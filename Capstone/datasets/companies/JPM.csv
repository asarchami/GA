0,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON  BOSTON Jan 2 Cybersecurity company FireEye Inc , one of last year's hottest IPOs, has acquired Mandiant Corp, the computer forensics specialist best known for unveiling a secretive Chinese military unit believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on U.S. companies.The $1.05 billion cash-and-stock deal, which FireEye said closed on Monday, unites two companies with relatively new technologies for thwarting cyber attacks, and brings together two of the most-respected executives in the security industry: FireEye CEO Dave DeWalt and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia.While sales of older anti-virus products have been on the decline, security experts expect strong growth in both FireEye's cloud-based systems for detecting malicious software and Mandiant's software that analyzes cyber attacks.About a year ago the two companies entered into a technology development agreement that made it easier to deploy their products together. With the merger, FireEye will gain Mandiant's team of forensics investigators.""They have these very strong Navy 'cyber' Seals who respond to breaches and are very good at what they do,"" DeWalt said about Mandiant. He had previously served as chairman of Mandiant's board.""My aim is to create the strongest security company in the world,"" DeWalt said in an interview.FireEye, which has yet to post a profit, said the acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings and expects the combined company's revenue to grow about 50 percent this year. In comparison, Symantec Corp, the biggest maker of anti-virus software, has said it expects fiscal 2014 revenue to drop 3 percent to 4 percent.Mandiant is best known for its forensics services. The company rose to prominence in February 2013 when it published a report detailing alleged links between a Shanghai-based unit of the People's Liberation Army and a long list of attacks on U.S. companies.. Beijing denied all allegations in the report. STOCK AND CASH Mandiant, which has long been profitable, generates sales of more than $100 million a year, according to DeWalt.FireEye in November forecast its 2014 revenue to be between $240 million and $250 million, up from an estimated $156 million to $158 million for 2013. DeWalt has declined to say when he expects the company to be profitable.FireEye, which has a market capitalization of around $5 billion, will pay for Mandiant with a combination of stock and cash. It issued 21.5 million shares and options, which were worth $939 million on Monday, when the stock closed at $43.69. A company spokesman said it had about 140 million shares outstanding after the deal was completed.It will also pay $106.5 million in net cash to Mandiant's shareholders, who include Mandia as well as Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and One Equity Partners, the private investment arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.DeWalt said he owns some shares in Mandiant and will disclose the size of his stake within a few days through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.FireEye shares were down 5.7 percent to $41.11 in late afternoon Nasdaq trade. They nearly doubled in their Sept. 20 trading debut and have not moved significantly since.FireEye's rival include Palo Alto Networks Inc, which went public in 2012 in one of that year's most successful IPOs. Mandiant was founded in 2004 by Kevin Mandia, a former U.S. Air Force cyber-forensics investigator who co-authored an influential textbook on the subject. The company made its name by automating processes used to investigate computer breaches.The company was largely unknown outside the computer security world until February of last year, when it fingered the People's Liberation Army's Shanghai-based Unit 61398 as the most likely driving force behind a Chinese hacking group known as APT1.Other security companies had published reports on cyberattacks, but had shied away from so clearly identifying their perpetrators.DeWalt said FireEye would consider releasing similar reports now that it owns Mandiant.""You will probably see us continue to do it when it is appropriate,"" he said. ""There is some incredibly egregious behavior.""DeWalt is the former chief executive of anti-virus software maker McAfee who sold McAfee to Intel Corp.Mandia was named FireEye's chief operating officer. He said in an interview that he plans to move to Silicon Valley, where FireEye has its headquarters, from the Washington D.C. area.""I'm in this for the long-term,"" he said. ""This is as exciting as heck for me.""",2014-01-02,JPM,"Thu Jan 2, 2014 | 4:00pm EST",FireEye buys cyber forensics firm Mandiant for about $1 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/mandiant-fireeye-idUSL2N0KC0VP20140102?type=companyNews

3,"   By David Henry and Emily Flitter | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co agreed to pay $2.6 billion to the U.S. government and Bernard Madoff victims to settle allegations that the bank failed to tell authorities about its suspicions of fraud at Madoff's fund.Even as the bank cut its exposure to Madoff's fund to minimize its losses it what ended up being a $17.3 billion Ponzi scheme, JPMorgan never shared its doubts with U.S. authorities, government prosecutors said.""The bank connected the dots when it mattered to its own profit but was not so diligent when it came to its legal obligations,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a press conference.""In part because of that failure, for decades, Bernie Madoff was able to launder billions of dollars in Ponzi proceeds essentially through a single set of accounts at JPMorgan,"" Bharara added. The bank's $1.7 billion settlement with the Department of Justice, part of the larger deal announced Tuesday, is the largest forfeiture a bank has ever had to pay to resolve anti-money laundering violations. The deal does not include charges against individuals.The settlement is only the latest of JPMorgan's legal difficulties. In November, the bank agreed to a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the bank's mortgage bonds. JPMorgan still faces at least eight other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate.These are big payouts, even to a bank whose profit has topped $20 billion a year. The Madoff settlement underscores how being the largest U.S. bank can be a hindrance as well as a benefit to JPMorgan. Like its Wall Street rivals, JPMorgan a colossus in which internal communication is often imperfect.""We recognize we could have done a better job pulling together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff from different parts of the bank over time,"" JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti said in an email. The bank filed a notice of suspicious activity with regulators in London in October 2008, but not in the United States, he acknowledged.He added: ""We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee knowingly assisted Madoff's Ponzi scheme.""The Department of Justice agreed to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the bank as part of its settlement. Tuesday's deal also settles probes by multiple bank regulators into failures in JPMorgan's anti-money laundering policies. The bank agreed to improve its controls.Experts viewed the $1.7 billion forfeiture as a tough penalty for JPMorgan, but several questioned why no individuals faced charges over the bank's failure to alert authorities for more than a decade to concerns about Madoff.""Despite those egregious facts, it appears that no person, no bank official, no bank employee, not a single one, is going to be held personally accountable for the scandal,"" said former Treasury Department official Jimmy Gurule, now a professor at Notre Dame University's law school. JPMorgan said Tuesday afternoon that the tab for the settlements will reduce fourth-quarter results by about $850 million, after the bank had already set aside money to cover most of the expenses. In the third quarter, the bank set aside another $7.2 billion to cover expected legal losses, bringing the total funds it had stockpiled for settlements to $23 billion. The settlement payments announced on Tuesday are not tax-deductible, the company said.The company had been expected to make about $5.13 billion in the quarter, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Shares of JPMorgan fell 1.3 percent to $58.26 on Tuesday.The settlement also includes a $350 million penalty from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In private litigation, the bank will pay $218 million to settle the class action suit and $325 million to settle a U.S. bankruptcy trustee's suit. The Department of Justice portion of the payout will go to Madoff's victims.""The bank was clearly willfully blind, I think, to detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department,"" Gurule said.Even if the transactions had been reported, it is not clear if Madoff would have been shut down. Analyst Harry Markopolos told the Securities and Exchange Commission multiple times about his suspicions about Madoff's consistently good returns, and was ignored by the agency. 'JUST ONE BIG LIE' Madoff was a quiet force for years on Wall Street, serving at one time as the chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Through his Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC hedge fund, he operated the largest Ponzi scheme that has ever been uncovered. It collapsed in December 2008 after he told senior employees at his firm ""it's all just one big lie"" and turned himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 of defrauding thousands of investors and is serving a 150-year prison sentence. Investors lost $17.3 billion in principal, the bankruptcy court trustee has said.From 1986 until his arrest in 2008, Madoff kept an account at JPMorgan Chase, or banks it had bought, according to the statement of facts the bank agreed to disclose as part of its settlement with the Justice Department.The account at the bank received deposits and transfers of about $150 billion, almost exclusively from investors in Madoff Securities, yet the money was not used to buy securities as Madoff had promised, according to the statement.According to the statement, in the 1990's Madoff routinely transferred money between two accounts, one held at an undisclosed bank and one at JPMorgan held by Norman Levy, one of its most important private banking clients. Levy is described only as a ""private bank client"" in the government's statement of facts, but he is named in the lawsuit filed against JPMorgan by the Madoff bankruptcy trustee Irving Picard, according to a source familiar with an unredacted copy of the lawsuit. Levy died in 2005 at the age of 93.According to the statement of facts, Levy and Madoff wrote checks back and forth to each other each day to take advantage of normal delays in the check-clearing process and make it seem as though the accounts had more money than they did.JPMorgan paid interest on the inflated amount in Levy's account and continued dealing with Madoff even after the other bank notified it of the scheme, according to the statement.An employee of JPMorgan's private bank said in a 1994 memo that ""the daily cost associated"" with Madoff's withdrawals was ""outrageous."" But when the employee tried to tell Levy about the scheme, Levy responded: ""If Bernie is using the float, it is fine with me; he makes a lot of money for my account.""While people in some parts of JPMorgan failed to take their suspicions about Madoff's results to people in other parts of the giant company and the U.S. government, they moved quickly enough to withdraw money from Madoff-related entities and save the company some $200 million right before Madoff was arrested, according to the statement of facts.In the first two weeks of October 2008, JPMorgan's ""Equity Exotics Desk"" sought to reduce its exposure to hedge funds following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan's earlier takeover of Bear Stearns. On October 16, 2008, an analyst in Equity Exotics assigned to scrutinize investments wrote a long email compiling suspicions about Madoff, including his ""lack of transparency,"" use of small and unknown accounting firms and resistance ""to provide meaningful disclosure"" on his exceptionally good returns, according to the statement of facts.A JPMorgan official in London reviewed the analyst's memo and filed a suspicious activity report with the U.K. Serious Organised Crime Agency saying Madoff's consistently superior performance seemed ""to appear too good to be true -- meaning that it probably is.""The report said JPMorgan was redeeming 300 million euros from two Madoff feeder funds out of a total of 350 million euros. JPMorgan took additional steps involving structured products linked to Madoff funds to limit possible losses. Without these steps, JPMorgan would have lost $250 million instead of the $40 million loss it booked, according to the statement of facts.If JPMorgan's deferred prosecution agreement with prosecutors runs a normal course, Bharara will seek to dismiss the criminal charges against the bank at the end of the two-year period. The settlement does not include detailed descriptions of how JPMorgan is expected to improve its anti-money laundering efforts.(Reporting by Emily Flitter and David Henry, additional reporting by Aruna Viswanatha, Karen Freifeld Jonathan Stempel and Joseph Ax,; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Bernadette Baum and Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-01-07,JPM,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 6:19pm EST",Decades-long ties to Madoff cost JPMorgan $2.6 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-madoff-deal-idUSBREA060JL20140107?type=companyNews

9,"  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to settle two private lawsuits stemming from its relationship with convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, according to a court filing on Tuesday.The bank will pay $218 million to resolve a class-action suit and $325 million to resolve claims by Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, the filing in Manhattan federal court shows.The settlements, which must be approved by a judge, were announced just after the bank struck a deal with U.S. prosecutors and bank regulators to pay more than $2 billion to resolve charges that it failed to follow up on suspicious activity by Madoff, who was a client of the bank for more than two decades.

11,"   By Steve Slater | LONDON  LONDON Investment bankers working in London for many top U.S. and European groups face a major overhaul of their pay structure, as their recent bonuses have far exceeded new EU rules which will curb payouts to be made this time next year.JPMorgan (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Bank of America (BAC.N), Barclays (BARC.L) and Credit Suisse CSGN.VX paid bonuses to leading staff which ranged from 3.3 to 5.4 times their fixed pay for 2012, according to data disclosed by the banks and Reuters calculations.Big changes will therefore have to be made to meet the European Union rules which cap bonuses at the same level as fixed pay, or double if the bank's shareholders approve.Bankers' bonuses remain a hot topic among politicians and the public. Many blame their high levels for encouraging reckless risk-taking that led to the 2008/09 financial crisis and a series of mis-selling and misconduct scandals.Banks usually pay staff bonuses in January or February based on their performance the previous year. So while the EU curbs came into force this month, they will be applied first to bonuses for 2014 to be handed out early next year.Major banks continued to reward their top risk-taking staff heavily on performance in bonuses for 2012, their regulatory disclosures have showed in the last few weeks.Goldman Sachs paid its top 115 UK staff an average of $4.67 million each for 2012, an increase of three-quarters from the average for 2011 and the highest of the major banks. The bank's earnings and revenues jumped in 2012 from 2011.About $350 million of Goldman's total salary bill for these bankers was paid in bonuses, or 5.2 times what it gave in fixed pay - jumping from a ratio of 2.2 times in 2011 - according to Reuters calculations.Banks are expected to increase fixed pay and reduce bonuses to meet the new rules, although Barclays (BARC.L), HSBC (HSBA.L) and others are coming up with innovative ways to cope.Barclays plans to give its senior bankers additional monthly payments. The new ""role-based pay"" element - on top of base salary and variable bonuses - will be for employees occupying specific risk-taking roles. Most of this will be in cash, although top-up payments to members of its executive committee may be in shares, following discussions with shareholders, a person familiar with the matter said.HSBC plans to hand new share awards to about 1,000 of its top staff, an industry source said, adding that the plan would have characteristics of variable pay but qualify as fixed pay.""A LOT OF CREATIVITY"" JPMorgan and others are considering similar shifts to Barclays and HSBC to keep some flexibility on pay and meet the bonus rules, industry sources have said.""It appears there's a lot of creativity going on,"" said Peter Hahn from London's Cass Business School. About 10,000 staff are expected to be covered by the rules. Bankers earning more than 500,000 euros a year will be affected, although the EU banking watchdog watered down requirements last month and said some staff earning that amount could be excluded.A number of other banks also bust the new rules for 2012, according to data released for their UK ""code staff"", which covers all people in significant risk-taking positions.JPMorgan paid 126 code staff an average of 2.09 million pounds ($3.4 million), and variable pay was 5.4 times fixed pay. Bank of America paid its code staff an average of 1.5 million pounds, with variable pay 5.4 times fixed pay. Its senior managers received 12 times more in variable pay than salary.The British government is fighting the rule in Europe's highest court and many banks in London have opposed the cap, saying it will force up fixed salaries, provide less scope to claw back pay and encourage staff to move to banks in the United States or Asia which are not constrained.Among other leading banks, top UK staff at Credit Suisse earned an average of $2.28 million in 2012, up 8 percent from 2011, and bonuses were 3.3 times fixed pay, according to data released just before Christmas. The figure for British-based Nomura (9716.T) bankers was an average of $2.37 million each in the year to March 2013, and bonuses amounted to 3.1 times fixed pay.Barclays had previously disclosed it paid its 393 code staff an average of 1.37 million pounds each in 2012, and variable pay was 4.3 times fixed pay, while HSBC paid its code staff an average of $1.68 million each in 2012, and variable pay was 2.7 times fixed pay.Hahn at Cass said it was ""disappointing"" that overall pay levels were not coming down, as returns for shareholders at many banks are still lagging the cost of equity.""This is an industry that still needs to deal with cost cutting...it's still an industry that appears to be paying as if it's a high return business, and it isn't,"" Hahn said.Banks either declined to comment, could not immediately be reached, or said they were considering their options in regard to future pay structures.The new rules cover pay for 2014, but will not affect bonuses for 2013 that will be handed out in the next two months.

15,"  By Jill PriluckJan 8 Just a few weeks before federal prosecutors announced a nearly $2 billion settlement with JPMorgan Chase over Bernie Madoff's fraudulent accounts, chairman and chief executive officer Jamie Dimon sat alongside former Congressman and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel at an Aspen Institute forum in the biology lab of Malcolm X College to tout the embattled bank's five-year, $250 million, multi-city investment in job training. The bank would commit $15 million for ""workplace readiness and demand-driven training"" in Chicago.JPMorgan is not alone in its quest to change how it is seen. Goldman Sachs recently extended its 10,000 Small Businesses plan to Detroit, the latest of a number of cities to receive cash from the investment bank. There's a reason beyond the corporate charity push for all the giving. The financial industry is facing a sea change in electoral politics. It is increasingly operating in a polarized political system that has placed a premium on accountability. Populist and ideologically extreme constituencies are needed for primaries and general elections in which fewer middle-of-the-road voters participate. Loyalties change quickly if pols don't sway the way their bases want. Elected and would-be elected officials can rely on campaign cash from super PACs and independent expenditures involving wealthy contributors like Sheldon Adelson, George Soros and David Koch. Campaigners don't have to rely as much on Wall Street as a unit.Politicians, especially Democrats, benefit from denouncing financiers. As Ben White and Maggie Haberman reported in Politico, ""at both ends of the political spectrum, the titans of American finance today find themselves alienated from politics to a surprising degree."" White and Haberman document an environment in which President Obama labels them ""fat cats,"" the left demonizes and the Tea Party Republicans just shun. So when someone like White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett mentioned Goldman Sachs' 10,000 Small Businesses in an interview with White, it shows the benefits an outfit like JPMorgan get from courting charitable initiatives, even if they delve into murky policy terrain. It's no accident that Dimon appeared with Emanuel, who is perceived as a hands-on, connected public servant. More than just a good will gloss, the bank's job training effort is a move to make nice with a political and regulatory establishment that denounces plutocrats. So what better way for JPMorgan Chase to ingratiate itself with the public servant class than to play policymaker in Chicago by throwing tax-deductible money to a job-skills training effort run by a proven pragmatist with deep Washington ties?JPMorgan Chase won't say much about how the ""New Skills at Work"" initiative was conceived or what it will entail. A continuation of the bank's corporate responsibility arm that funds non-profits and others, the push is clearly an effort to change the bank's deteriorating public image following the $13 billion Department of Justice settlement, the Madoff case that included a blocked probe, an ""Ask JPMorgan"" social media campaign that yielded questions such as whether it is ""ok to outright lie cheat and steal"" and a host of other embarrassments. The New Skills at Work initiative is much more complicated. Goldman Sachs' simple effort to award grants to upstarts presented a pretty cheery proposition for both the little guy and the bank. But the jobs conundrum is wonkier than funding startups. It is politically sticky. It requires JPMorgan Chase to collaborate with policymakers in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago. It involves consulting with academics and non-profit leaders to figure out what kind of manufacturing or retail jobs are vacant, what the lacking skills are and how to target populations that need the most training. JPMorgan is wading into an unemployed workforce that may be overlooked not because of a lack of skills, ultimately, but because of deeper problems such as a cultural and socioeconomic dissonance with employers, an inability to square work responsibilities with family or healthcare pressures, and most importantly an economy in transition.This is not a problem that can be solved simply by throwing cash in its direction. While there are exceptions, job training programs have been some of the biggest public policy failures of the last generation. New Deal initiatives were policy coups that helped the Depression-worn find jobs, but modern counterparts have lacked resonance. In 1984, the libertarian Cato Institute criticized federal efforts during the height of the Reagan era and it's been downhill ever since. As recently as June, the General Accounting Office reported that Obama's green jobs initiative has been slow to reap rewards. It remains to be seen whether the grants to states announced by Obama in September will be any more of an improvement. Obviously, a $250 million expenditure over five years that also happens to be a charitable tax deduction is not a hit to the bottom line. But the willingness of JPMorgan Chase to expend so much energy and reputational capital on what has been a losing proposition for the last 30 or so years speaks to the bank's dire circumstances in the age of Dodd-Frank, Basel III and a renewed resilience in regulatory and enforcement circles from the SEC to the Justice Department.It probably won't hurt to school community college kids in workplace culture, norms and tasks. Maybe a data-driven approach will solve the problem of unemployment in Chicago, where 100,000 jobs are vacant. Or maybe it won't. But JPMorgan might have done better if it expended its resources on a winning bet rather than a problem that is far beyond the Band-Aid that a few hours of training in front of a computer screen and a seminar on the meaning of business casual can remedy.In other words, the bank might have done better to fund small businesses or create small upstarts in these cities and hire the people they're training. That kind of innovation has made policymakers and legislators and the public stand up and take note.",2014-01-08,JPM,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 5:48pm EST",COLUMN-What's behind JPMorgan's push for worker training?,http://www.reuters.com//article/priluck-jpmorgan-idUSL2N0KI2HN20140108?type=companyNews

In 2012, it sold its metals concentrates business due to U.S. regulatory restrictions.On Tuesday JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion to the U.S. government and Bernard Madoff victims to settle allegations that the bank failed to tell authorities about its suspicions of fraud at Madoff's fund.The settlement is only the latest of JPMorgan's legal difficulties. In November, the bank agreed to a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the bank's mortgage bonds.The bank still faces at least eight other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate.""After LIBOR they are worried about reputational risk in anything to do with pricing,"" a third source said.About 30 lawsuits allege that the LME and other defendants - including investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan and merchants Glencore Xstrata and Trafigura AG - manipulated the warehousing of aluminum in order to lift the price of the metal. The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the matter(Additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Singapore; editing by Keiron Henderson)",2014-01-08,JPM,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 1:14pm EST",UPDATE 1-JPMorgan metal futures unit included in commodities sale -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/jpmorgan-metals-idUSL6N0KI33S20140108?type=companyNews
20,"  * Top banks paid up to 5.4 times fixed salary in bonuses* EU to cap bonus at maximum two times fixed salary* Top Goldman staff paid $4.67 million each for 2012* Some banks seek ""creative solutions""By Steve SlaterLONDON, Jan 7 Investment bankers working in London for many top U.S. and European groups face a major overhaul of their pay structure, as their recent bonuses have far exceeded new EU rules which will curb payouts to be made this time next year.JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America , Barclays and Credit Suisse paid bonuses to leading UK staff which ranged from 3.3 to 5.4 times their fixed pay for 2012, according to data disclosed by the banks and Reuters calculations.Big changes will therefore have to be made to meet the European Union rules which cap bonuses at the same level as fixed pay, or double if the bank's shareholders approve.Bankers' bonuses remain a hot topic among politicians and the public. Many blame their high levels for encouraging reckless risk-taking that led to the 2008/09 financial crisis and a series of mis-selling and misconduct scandals.Banks usually pay staff bonuses in January or February based on their performance the previous year. So while the EU curbs came into force this month, they will be applied first to bonuses for 2014 to be handed out early next year.Major banks continued to reward their top risk-taking staff heavily on performance in bonuses for 2012, their regulatory disclosures have showed in the last few weeks.Goldman Sachs paid its top 115 UK staff an average of $4.67 million each for 2012, an increase of three-quarters from the average for 2011 and the highest of the major banks. The bank's earnings and revenues jumped in 2012 from 2011.About $350 million of Goldman's total bill for these bankers was paid in bonuses, or 5.2 times what it gave in fixed pay - jumping from a ratio of 2.2 times in 2011 - according to Reuters calculations. Banks are expected to increase fixed pay and reduce bonuses to meet the new rules, although Barclays, HSBC  and others are coming up with innovative ways to cope.Barclays plans to give its senior bankers additional monthly payments. The new ""role-based pay"" element - on top of base salary and variable bonuses - will be for employees occupying specific risk-taking roles.Most of this will be in cash, although top-up payments to members of its executive committee may be in shares, following discussions with shareholders, a person familiar with the matter said.HSBC plans to hand new share awards to about 1,000 of its top staff, an industry source said, adding that the plan would have characteristics of variable pay but qualify as fixed pay.""A LOT OF CREATIVITY"" JPMorgan and others are considering similar shifts to Barclays and HSBC to keep some flexibility on pay and meet the bonus rules, industry sources have said. ""It appears there's a lot of creativity going on,"" said Peter Hahn from London's Cass Business School.About 10,000 staff are expected to be covered by the rules. Bankers earning more than 500,000 euros a year will be affected, although the EU banking watchdog watered down requirements last month and said some staff earning that amount could be excluded.A number of other banks also bust the new rules for 2012, according to data released for their UK ""code staff"", which covers all people in significant risk-taking positions.JPMorgan paid 126 code staff an average of 2.09 million pounds ($3.4 million), and variable pay was 5.4 times fixed pay. Bank of America paid its code staff an average of 1.5 million pounds, with variable pay 5.4 times fixed pay. Its senior managers received 12 times more in variable pay than salary.The British government is fighting the rule in Europe's highest court and many banks in London have opposed the cap, saying it will force up fixed salaries, provide less scope to claw back pay and encourage staff to move to banks in the United States or Asia which are not constrained.Among other leading banks, top UK staff at Credit Suisse earned an average of $2.28 million in 2012, up 8 percent from 2011, and bonuses were 3.3 times fixed pay, according to data released just before Christmas. The figure for British-based Nomura bankers was an average of $2.37 million each in the year to March 2013, and bonuses amounted to 3.1 times fixed pay.Barclays had previously disclosed it paid its 393 code staff an average of 1.37 million pounds each in 2012, and variable pay was 4.3 times fixed pay, while HSBC paid its code staff an average of $1.68 million each in 2012, and variable pay was 2.7 times fixed pay.Hahn at Cass said it was ""disappointing"" that overall pay levels were not coming down, as returns for shareholders at many banks are still lagging the cost of equity.""This is an industry that still needs to deal with cost cutting...it's still an industry that appears to be paying as if it's a high return business, and it isn't,"" Hahn said.Banks either declined to comment, could not immediately be reached, or said they were considering their options in regard to future pay structures.The new rules cover pay for 2014, but will not affect bonuses for 2013 that will be handed out in the next two months. Bonus details will start coming out from U.S. banks reporting results from next week, and are expected to be flat to slightly higher across the industry.Just over 3,500 bankers in Europe earned 1 million euros or more last year, and more than three-quarters of those were based in Britain, partly reflecting London's dominance as a financial hub and the European hub for global banks.PAY FOR UK BANK STAFF BANK              NO.

()* The Federal Trade Commission charged Sensa Products, L'Occitane, HCG Diet Direct and LeanSpa with deceptively marketing weight-loss products, asserting they made ""unfounded promises"" that consumers could shed pounds by using their food additives, skin creams and other dietary supplements. * An indictment by the Manhattan district attorney's office charged 106 people in the largest fraud ever perpetrated against the Social Security disability system. The scheme, stretching back to 1988 and involving as many as 1,000 people, many of whom are officers and firefighters already collecting pensions from the city, is suspected to have cheated the federal government out of about $400 million. ()* The Senate voted to advance legislation extending expired unemployment benefits. The three-month extension of benefits passed on a vote of 60 to 37, and some of the six Republicans who voted yes said they wanted the $6.4 billion cost paid for through cuts elsewhere in the budget. () * While the federal government is spending more than $22 billion to encourage hospitals and doctors to adopt electronic health records, it has failed to put safeguards in place to prevent the technology from being used for inflating costs and overbilling, according to a new report by a federal oversight agency. () * A legal struggle over Utah's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage has catapulted the socially conservative state to the center of the national debate over who should be allowed to wed, and whether states have the right to limit marriages to one man and one woman. ()* A U.S. military helicopter crashed on the coast of eastern England on Tuesday, and all four people aboard were believed to have been killed, authorities said. The cause of the crash was unclear. The helicopter was a United States Air Force HH-60 Pave Hawk that was based at the Royal Air Force base in Lakenheath in Suffolk, also in eastern England.

29,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday asked the administration of President Barack Obama to weigh in on whether the trustee seeking money for the victims of convicted Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff can recover damages from banks he accused of aiding in the fraud.The court invited Solicitor General Donald Verrilli to file a brief offering his views on whether a lower-court ruling that prevented trustee Irving Picard from recovering nearly $30 billion from various banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co and HSBC Holdings Plc, should remain intact.Picard last week announced a $325 million settlement with JPMorgan, meaning the bank will be dropped from the case.That settlement, which must be approved by a judge, was announced just after JPMorgan struck a deal with U.S. prosecutors and bank regulators to pay more than $2 billion to resolve charges that it failed to follow up on suspicious activity by Madoff, who was a client of the bank for more than two decades. The other banks involved in the case are Italy's UniCredit SpA and Switzerland's UBS AG.There are separate claims against the banks in a class action case that is not related to the issue before the Supreme Court.

30,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 13 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday asked the administration of President Barack Obama to weigh in on whether the trustee seeking money for the victims of convicted Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff can recover damages from banks he accused of aiding in the fraud.The court invited Solicitor General Donald Verrilli to file a brief offering his views on whether a lower-court ruling that prevented trustee Irving Picard from recovering nearly $30 billion from various banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co  and HSBC Holdings Plc, should remain intact.Picard last week announced a $325 million settlement with JPMorgan, meaning the bank will be dropped from the case.That settlement, which must be approved by a judge, was announced just after JPMorgan struck a deal with U.S. prosecutors and bank regulators to pay more than $2 billion to resolve charges that it failed to follow up on suspicious activity by Madoff, who was a client of the bank for more than two decades. The other banks involved in the case are Italy's UniCredit SpA and Switzerland's UBS AG.There are separate claims against the banks in a class action case that is not related to the issue before the Supreme Court.

The $3.2 billion deal will give Google a promising line of products and a prized design team.Core U.S. retail sales increased 0.7 percent in December from the prior month, flying past the 0.3 percent gain economists had expected. Fourth-quarter economic growth prospects were further boosted by a report showing retail inventories, excluding autos, increased 0.6 percent in November.The data followed Friday's payroll report, which showed job growth for December that was sharply below expectations.""Retail sales numbers for December sort of calmed everyone down,"" said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. ""Numbers indicate the economy is most likely moving forward at a nice pace despite an errant jobs number last Friday.""The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 115.92 points or 0.71 percent, to 16,373.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 19.68 points or 1.08 percent, to 1,838.88, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 69.712 points, or 1.69 percent, to 4,183.016.Tuesday's gains came a day after the S&P 500 posted its largest drop in two months, and market participants say they are gearing up for a more volatile 2014 after a year that saw U.S. stocks constantly go higher.""We're seeing a good preview of what the year will bring, which is a little bit more volatility,"" said Andres Garcia-Amaya, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. The CBOE volatility index .VIX dropped 7.5 percent to 12.28 after gaining 9.4 percent on Monday.""We got accustomed to very low volatility and (a VIX reading of) 14-16 is not out of the question,"" Garcia-Amaya said.Shares of General Motors (GM.N) jumped 3 percent to $41.20 in extended trading after the company said it will pay the first quarterly dividend on its common stock in almost six years.Intel Corp (INTC.O) shares jumped 4 percent to close at $26.51 in regular trade after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to ""overweight"" from ""neutral."" Electric car maker Tesla (TSLA.O) said deliveries of its Model S sedan in the fourth quarter blew past its forecast, sending shares up 15.7 percent to $161.27.Both JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) posted earnings that beat expectations, though upside was limited with Wells Fargo shares already near all-time highs and JPMorgan shares at their highest since 2000. Shares of both banks rose less than 0.1 percent on the day.With just 5 percent of the S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly results, 53.8 percent have beaten earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, below the 63 percent historical average. About 62 percent have beaten on revenue, above the long-term 55 percent average.Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) will post results later in the week. General Electric Co (GE.N) and Intel are also on tap. Both GameStop Corp (GME.N) and Stratasys Ltd (SSYS.O) slumped after giving outlooks that were weaker than expected. GameStop lost 19.9 percent to $36.31, while 3D printer maker Stratasys slid 8.2 percent to $119.37.In contrast, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG.O) advanced 6.8 percent to $419.88 after the surgical equipment maker gave a strong fourth-quarter outlook.Charter Communications (CHTR.O) is trying to strike a deal to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N and sway its shareholders after three of its offers have been rebuffed. On Monday, Charter took its approach public and proposed paying $132.50 per TWC share.TWC shares gained 2.7 percent to $136 and Charter added 2.3 percent to $137.34.Volume was roughly in line with the year-to-date average of about 6.5 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

34,"   By David Henry and Tanya Agrawal  JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a 7.3 percent decline in quarterly profit on Tuesday, as legal woes and weak demand for investment banking services capped off a tough year for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.The largest U.S. bank had $1.1 billion of legal expenses in the fourth quarter, about $850 million of which was linked to a recent settlement for failing to report its suspicions of fraud at its client Bernard Madoff's fund.The bank agreed to some $20 billion of legal settlements in 2013 - almost equal to a typical year's profit - which covered everything from mortgages it packaged into bonds before the financial crisis, to bad derivatives trades it made in 2012.Dimon said some investigations into JPMorgan are just beginning, implying that legal issues are likely to dog the bank for some time, even if on a smaller scale.Legal headaches aside, the bank faces headwinds in businesses ranging from debt underwriting to advising companies on mergers. Rising bond yields are cutting into demand for issuing debt, and new rules designed to make the financial system safer are also cutting into trading volumes.Investment banking fee revenue dropped 3 percent to $1.67 billion, and stock and bond trading revenue combined was unchanged before accounting adjustments.Shares of JPMorgan were up 0.3 percent at $57.86 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.SLUGFEST The results from JPMorgan, the first of the major investment banks to report for the quarter, show the difficulties that rivals like Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley are facing.""It's going to be a slugfest in 2014 to grow earnings,"" said Chris Mutascio, a bank analyst at KBW.

The special items included a benefit of 21 cents per share from the sale of Visa shares and 8 cents from the sale of its building at One Chase Manhattan Plaza.

37,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 14 (Fitch) JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) net income of $5.3  billion for the fourth quarter of 2013 (4Q'13), reflected a continuation of  strong credit trends and asset management performance, stable investment banking  and commercial banking results, weak mortgage production, and a variety of  significant items (including a new funding valuation adjustment  ), which  netted to approximately $407 million of after-tax losses. Returns on tangible  common equity were 14% for the quarter compared to 15% a year earlier.      As previously announced, quarterly results included additional litigation  expenses, due largely to announced Madoff settlements. These charges, in  addition to negative DVA and FVA adjustments, were largely offset with gains on  the sale of Visa shares, a real estate gain, and reserve releases in real estate  and card services. Legal costs are likely to remain elevated in coming quarters,  but Fitch expects the incremental impact to earnings will be manageable. Still,  the emergence of material and unexpected litigation losses could alter the  agency's view, particularly given where the firm's current capitalization ratios  compare to the broader peer group.  Results for the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) were relatively flat year  over year after adjusting for a $1.5 billion loss from implementing a FVA  framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes. DVA losses of $536 million  in the quarter were similar to a $567 million adjustment in 4Q'12. Investment  banking fees experienced a mix shift, with declines in debt underwriting being  offset by strength in equities. The CIB average VaR remained relatively low, at  $42 million for the quarter.  Net income in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment, was up from  4Q'12, as declines in provision expenses and non-interest costs offset a drop in  revenue, due largely to declines in mortgage. Origination volume was down 54.5%  year over year and 42.5% from the prior quarter, which appears to be in-line  with other large market participants. Production income would have been  marginally positive without $404 million of non-MBS related legal expenses in  the quarter, but income is expected to be negative in 1Q'14 given the  challenging market conditions. The servicing business turned a modest profit and  expenses were close to the $600 million target, adjusting for an addition to  compensatory fee expense reserves. Credit trends in the real estate portfolio  remained on a positive trajectory, leading to $950 million of reserve  reductions, including a $750 million reduction related to purchased  credit-impaired loans. Fitch expects additional reserve releases in real estate  in 2014.      The credit card business remains strong, with record sales volume and what  appears to be a bottoming of loan balances. Net charge-off and delinquency rates  improved modestly and supported a $300 million reserve release. Fitch believes  credit metrics are nearing a trough and expects minimal reserve releases, if  any, in 2014.  Commercial Banking (CB) remains a very steady performer within JPM, and had net  income of $693 million in the quarter. Loan growth was solid in the segment with  end of period balance up 7% year-on-year and corporate deposits were up about  3%. Credit quality remained very strong, with net charge-offs of 0.07%. Asset  Management (AM) generated strong results with net income of $568 million. This  reflects solid net inflows of $23 billion. Assets under management (AUM) reached  $1.6 trillion during the quarter.   The bank's core net interest margin, which excludes the impact of CIB's  market-based activities, was up 4 basis points sequentially, to 2.64% due to  higher investment securities yields. JPM is forecasting relatively stable NIM  over the near term as stronger security yields are offset by continued loan  spread compression. The bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $522 billion of high quality  liquid assets. Additional clarity regarding the direction of the net stable  funding ratio (NSFR) has been released in a consultative document, and JPM  believes the firm is currently compliant with requirements.      JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio reached 9.5% at year-end; in-line with the  bank's target. Management expects this ratio to reach 10% by year-end 2014, with  a longer-term target in a 10%-10.5% range. The supplementary leverage ratio  (SLR) was 4.7% at year-end for the firm and the bank. JPM expects this ratio to  reach 5% at the firm level by year-end 2014, with a 5.5% target longer-term.  Fitch regards JPM's capital levels to be consistent with its current ratings and  would expect the bank to achieve full compliance with all regulatory  requirements, well ahead of required implementation.

38,"   By Christopher  Whittall  LONDON, Jan 14 (IFR) - JP Morgan has recorded a US$1.5bn loss as a result of implementing a framework for funding valuation adjustments (FVA) in its derivatives and structured notes portfolios, in a further sign of the growing prominence of the controversial measure among the dealer community.Banks have been working behind the scenes for several years on developing their own frameworks for calculating FVA - a measure used to account for the cost of bank funding in uncollateralised derivatives positions - in order to accurately price and value transactions.Marianne Lake, JP Morgan's CFO, noted on a call with analysts today that there has been no broad consensus so far on whether funding should be incorporated into valuation estimates for derivatives. However, she said the firm believes market practices have noticeably evolved over the course of 2013.""We've now accumulated compelling evidence both from transactions as well as industry pricing services that dealers are pricing funding into uncollateralised derivatives with a degree of consistency. This supports incorporating an FVA framework this quarter,"" said Lake. The bank indicated the sizeable quarterly loss would be a one-off event as it incorporated the FVA framework into the valuation of its portfolios. From now on, FVA will be factored into derivatives valuations at the inception of a trade. This should significantly reduce JP Morgan's sensitivity to funding spreads going forward, Lake said.PRESENT VALUING JP Morgan described FVA as a spread over Libor, which had the effect of ""present valuing"" - in other words, marking to market - a contract's funding costs rather than accruing these costs over the lifetime of the derivative. FVA is only applied to uncollateralised transactions; collateralised derivatives effectively fund themselves using the collateral backing the trade. The FVA will vary depending on the size and tenor of the transaction, as well as the bank's own cost of funding. By way of example, Lake said if a bank held derivatives receivables net of cash and securities collateral of approximately US$50 billion, applying an average duration of approximately five years and a spread of approximately 50 basis points, that would account for about a billion dollars plus or minus the adjustment.As a result of adopting the new framework, JP Morgan expects the volatility of profits and losses associated with FVA and debit valuation adjustments (DVA) - another measurement that overlaps with FVA - to be lower going forward. FVA has sparked a lively debate in the derivatives world. Noted academic John Hull has argued that FVA should not be included in valuing derivatives as it moves away from risk-neutral pricing, while banks counter that it represents a real cost of doing business, and a substantial one at that. RBS, one of a handful of firms that has started making public disclosures, mentioned an FVA of £475m in its 2012 annual report.Other industry professionals have criticised the lack of transparency around factoring FVA into derivatives valuations, and have called for the creation of a simplified market standard.(For more from IFR Magazine, go to www.ifre.com)   (christopher.whittall@thomsonreuters.com)",2014-01-14,JPM,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 12:15pm EST",DERIVATIVES: JP Morgan books US$1.5bn FVA loss,http://www.reuters.com//article/banks-jpmorgan-fva-ifr-idUSL6N0KO3BZ20140114?type=companyNews

""From an economic perspective, the real economy continues to gain traction, but from a market perspective, the stronger the economy looks, the more we need to look and see whether, in fact, the Fed might be pulling back sooner than people think.""The first of the large banks reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' estimates, with a mixed outcome on their share prices; JPMorgan Chase & Co gained 1 percent to $58.25, while Wells Fargo lost 0.9 percent to $45.15.The S&P financial index advanced 0.3 percent. As the Federal Reserve begins winding down its stimulus, which helped boost the S&P 500 by 30 percent last year, investors may need to be more selective about stock valuations. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the index is the highest in nearly seven years.The benchmark S&P index fell 1.3 percent on Monday, its worst decline since Nov. 7, as investors exercised caution amid a ream of negative corporate earnings outlooks.Later in the week, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are among the financial companies scheduled to post results.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.01 points or 0.13 percent, to 16,278.95, the S&P 500 gained 3.28 points or 0.18 percent, to 1,822.48 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 15.265 points or 0.37 percent, to 4,128.569. Stratasys Ltd dropped 6.5 percent to $121.55 after the 3D printer maker estimated full-year adjusted profit well below Wall Street estimates, as it warned expenses would rise significantly in 2014.GameStop Corp plunged 18.4 percent to $37.01 as the worst performer on the S&P 500 after the video game retailer forecast fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates.In contrast, Intuitive Surgical advanced 9.7 percent to $431.50 as the best performer on the benchmark S&P index and the Nasdaq 100 after the surgical equipment maker gave its fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 outlook.The market was underpinned by brisk merger activity.Google Inc gained 0.7 percent to $1,131.12.

44,"   By David Henry and Tanya Agrawal  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) posted a 7.3 percent decline in quarterly profit on Tuesday, as legal woes and weak demand for investment banking services capped off a tough year for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.The largest U.S. bank had $1.1 billion of legal expenses in the fourth quarter, about $850 million of which was linked to a recent settlement for failing to report its suspicions of fraud at its client Bernard Madoff's fund.The bank agreed to some $20 billion of legal settlements in 2013 - almost equal to a typical year's profit - which covered everything from mortgages it packaged into bonds before the financial crisis, to bad derivatives trades it made in 2012.Dimon said some investigations into JPMorgan are just beginning, implying that legal issues are likely to dog the bank for some time, even if on a smaller scale.Legal headaches aside, the bank faces headwinds in businesses ranging from debt underwriting to advising companies on mergers. Rising bond yields are cutting into demand for issuing debt, and new rules designed to make the financial system safer are also cutting into trading volumes.Investment banking fee revenue dropped 3 percent to $1.67 billion, and stock and bond trading revenue combined was unchanged before accounting adjustments.Shares of JPMorgan were up 0.3 percent at $57.86 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.SLUGFEST The results from JPMorgan, the first of the major investment banks to report for the quarter, show the difficulties that rivals like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are facing.""It's going to be a slugfest in 2014 to grow earnings,"" said Chris Mutascio, a bank analyst at KBW. Still, JPMorgan is hopeful about the future.In 2013, the bank added staff in investment banking and it won market share in most major businesses, including advising companies on mergers and underwriting stock offerings.But overall revenue in most Wall Street businesses is falling or barely growing. Merger volume, for example, fell 6 percent last year to the lowest level since 2009, Thomson Reuters data shows. Bond underwriting activity fell 2 percent to its lowest since 2011.JPMorgan posted net income of $5.28 billion, or $1.30 per share, for the quarter, compared with $5.69 billion, or $1.39 a share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, the company earned $1.40 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.35, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The special items included a benefit of 21 cents per share from the sale of Visa shares and 8 cents from the sale of its building at One Chase Manhattan Plaza. It posted an expense of 27 cents from legal bills, including the Madoff settlements.Three months ago, JPMorgan posted its first quarterly loss under Dimon after recording after-tax expenses of $7.2 billion to settle government and private investigations. <ID:L1N0I10HI>Investors have been looking for reassurance from the company that the worst of its legal expenses is over.BRIGHT SPOTS There were bright spots in the quarter; for example, equity underwriting revenue soared 65 percent to $436 million. But investment banking fees were pulled down by lower debt underwriting, where revenue declined 19 percent, and merger advisory fees, which fell 7 percent. Altogether, investment banking fees declined 3 percent to $1.67 billion.The bank's market share in equity underwriting rose to 8.3 percent in 2013, moving it to second place in the industry from fourth. Goldman Sachs led with 11.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.Rising mortgage rates hurt the bank's mortgage lending results, as fewer borrowers refinanced.JPMorgan acknowledged that it was too slow to cut expenses in this business, and it lost $274 million, before taxes, from mortgage lending, compared with a year-earlier profit of $789 million.Wells Fargo & Co, (WFC.N) the fourth-largest U.S. bank, on Tuesday posted its lowest quarterly mortgage lending volume since the fourth quarter of 2008. But the bank posted an overall profit jump because it cut costs and dipped into money it had set aside to cover loan losses.At JPMorgan, expenses excluding interest costs fell 3 percent to $15.55 billion during the quarter, while provisions for bad loans fell 84 percent to $104 million.JPMorgan said its assets shrank to $2.42 trillion at the end of December from $2.46 trillion in the preceding quarter. It had $2.36 trillion a year earlier.Loans, excluding money set aside for bad loans, grew about 1.6 percent from the third quarter and 1.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012.(In this story a typo has been fixed in the third paragraph)(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Luke Swiderski in New York; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Lisa Von Ahn and Bernadette Baum)",2014-01-15,JPM,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 9:50pm EST","JPMorgan profit hit by Madoff, weaker investment banking",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-results-idUSBREA0D0O220140115?type=companyNews
45,"   By David Henry  In 2010, senior executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) came to realize that interest rates, already at zero for more than a year, ultimately had only way to go: up.They started retooling the bank's assets and operations to get ready for the day when rates started rising, people close to the bank said on Tuesday. Executives looked at the bank from top to bottom, and took steps ranging from adjusting its investment portfolio to finding ways to hang on to deposits when higher rates give customers an incentive to move money elsewhere.Regulators encouraged them, but it was a massive undertaking entailing huge - and sometimes costly - shifts around the bank.Then JPMorgan waited. And waited, and waited.""It costs us a significant amount of current income to be positioned this way,"" JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon wrote in a letter to shareholders in April. ""But we believe it is better to be safe than to be sorry.""On Tuesday, in a little-noticed slide in a presentation to investors, JPMorgan said its efforts to position its investment portfolio for higher rates could begin to pay off as soon as the middle of this year, potentially adding hundreds of millions to its interest income in 2014.The timing could not be better for JPMorgan. As the largest U.S. bank's legal problems start to recede after a year with $20 billion of settlements, investors are increasingly turning their focus to the performance of its main banking business, looking for how it would do in a rising rate environment and tepid U.S. economic recovery.Yields on longer-term bonds started rising last year, as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it was starting to cut back on its massive monetary stimulus program, called quantitative easing. But economic growth has not been strong enough to translate into stronger loan demand and higher revenue for banks. JPMorgan saw fourth-quarter profits fall 7.3 percent, in part due to its legal woes and weak demand for investment banking services.JPMorgan is hardly the only bank to be getting ready for rising rates. In 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and other regulators warned banks to prepare for the risk of rising interest rates, which can immediately hurt the value of bonds that suddenly pay below-market yields. Higher rates can also increase banks' funding costs, a key expense for lenders and traders.Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays, said all 25 banks he covers have said that they would benefit from rising rates, up from an average of 66 percent of those banks over the last 38 quarters.On a conference call on Tuesday, Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said the bank was ready for rising rates, adding that the most likely scenario is longer-term bond yields rising in the near future, and shorter-term rates rising in the next year or two.PREPPING THE PORTFOLIO In 2010, JPMorgan started focusing its investment portfolio, where the bank invests funds that it could not otherwise economically lend out, on shorter-term securities instead of longer-term bonds. Shorter-term notes offer less income, but they also mature sooner, allowing the bank to re-invest money at higher rates once bond yields start rising. Yields did not start to rise until the summer of 2013, costing the bank hundreds of millions of dollars of income that it could have earned from higher-yielding securities.With recent increases in longer-term yields, JPMorgan said by the middle of this year it will have invested enough at the new higher yields to be making money from interest.When shorter-term rates also rise, the benefits to JPMorgan could ultimately prove to be substantial. In the third quarter, JPMorgan said that a 2 percentage point increase in short- and long-term rates would ultimately lift its pretax income by $4.09 billion a year. (The bank posted $25.9 billion in pre-tax profit in 2013.)Much of those gains would come from rising short-term rates, a change that is not expected until 2015. With rising short-term rates, banks can take deposits and invest them for a month or so with little risk, and earn more income. JPMorgan has estimated that higher short-term rates would deliver about two-thirds of the additional interest income it would expect from a 3 percentage point rise in both short and long rates.MAKING DEPOSITS STICK People close to the bank say JPMorgan has also been preparing for a rise in rates across its myriad businesses, and not just its investment portfolio.In its retail banking unit, for example, deposits in the fourth-quarter were 10 percent higher than a year earlier, and amounted to about a fifth of total liabilities.The sources said JPMorgan views deposits with caution, and recognizes that once rates rise even loyal customers will be quicker to shift any extra cash from checking accounts to higher yielding instruments such as money-market accounts.The bank is hoping it can stem some of the expected deposit erosion by having superior customer service, so that some customers never consider taking money out of their accounts, or consider keeping more at JPMorgan than they would otherwise, the sources said.It is focusing on customers who value the convenience of its mobile account access and branches that will likely help the bank retain balances, says Stephen Beck, founder and managing director of consulting firm cg42, which tracks customer loyalty.Beck said he found that JPMorgan's customers were significantly less likely last year to become frustrated and close their Chase accounts than they were two years earlier.(Reporting by David Henry in New York Editing by Dan Wilchins and Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-01-15,JPM,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 9:49pm EST",Analysis: JPMorgan set to reap rewards of playing it safe on rates,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-results-analysis-idUSBREA0E03V20140115?type=companyNews

Following the 2008 financial crisis many investors who lost tens of millions of dollars through such investments have questioned what banks knew when they modelled such products and a number have brought legal action against the banks.Industry experts have also argued that some organisations may have lacked the sophistication to understand CDOs.The case comes after JPMorgan paid nearly $20 billion in 2013 to settle assorted legal claims, including the ""London Whale"" derivatives trading scandal.",2014-01-20,JPM,"Mon Jan 20, 2014 | 1:03pm EST",JPMorgan sues Berlin transport provider over derivatives contract,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-jpmorganbvg-idUSL5N0KU2T220140120?type=companyNews
49,"   By Fiona Lau  HONG KONG, Jan 20 (IFR) - JP Morgan has ceased working on the proposed US$1bn IPO of Jinzhou-based Tianhe Chemicals amid an ongoing investigation into its hiring practices.The bank walked away after managers raised concerns over the employment of Joyce Wei, the daughter of Tianhe chairman Qi Wei, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.Wei worked in the bank's corporate finance group and has recently left for a European investment bank, the sources said.JP Morgan had been discussing an overseas listing with privately-owned Tianhe since at least 2011, when IFR first reported that the chemical company planned to list in London. It is not clear whether Tianhe signed any formal letter of engagement before or after Wei joined the bank.JP Morgan declined to comment. Joyce Wei, Qi Wei and Tianhe Chemicals could not immediately be reached.While news of the exit does not suggest any wrongdoing, the decision to pass over a major overseas listing of a privately owned Chinese company underlines the bank's determination to avoid attracting further suspicion at a time when its hiring policies are under regulatory scrutiny. It comes only months after JP Morgan walked away from the Hong Kong IPO of China Everbright Bank, a mid-sized Chinese lender, following reports that US authorities had opened a bribery investigation related to its hiring of the children of powerful Chinese officials, often referred to as ""princelings"".The New York Times in August reported that JP Morgan had won several mandates from China Everbright Group after it hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, Everbright Group chairman.CEB went on to raise HK$24.9bn (US$3.2bn) from its Hong Kong share sale, the largest float in the city in 2013. CHINA FRANCHISE Despite losing out on the CEB deal, JP Morgan still ranked fourth in China's equity and equity-linked league table in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data.However, rivals are questioning the impact of the bank's cautious policy on its China franchise. ""We heard the bank has been avoiding deals related to the China railway sector, and hence it's not actively pitching for the China CNR and China Railway Materials transactions,"" said a banker at a rival bank.The SEC was also probing JP Morgan's hiring of Zhang Xixi, the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese of the Ministry of Railways, the New York Times reported in its August article.Shanghai-listed China CNR Corp, one of China's biggest train-makers, plans to raise about US$1.5bn in a Hong Kong float this year. China Railway Materials, meanwhile, is looking at a US$1bn deal.Tianhe had picked Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley to arrange its London IPO, IFR reported in July 2011. After wavering between a London and Hong Kong float, the company is now focusing on Hong Kong and is reshuffling its syndicate, according to two other sources.Tianhe, which supplies grease to refiners including China Petroleum and PetroChina, plans to raise about US$1bn in the second quarter of the year at the earliest.Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS are at a good position to win a leading role in the transaction, according to a source. Morgan Stanley, through its private equity arm, made a US$300m investment in Tianhe in March 2012.

52,"  * Deutsche ranked 2nd on debt market fees in MEast during 2013* Bank sees companies tapping liquidity in local markets* Says expects tangible measures on stock mkt openingBy Dinesh Nair and Angus McDowallRIYADH, Jan 20 Companies in Saudi Arabia will favour local debt markets over international bond issues to meet their financing requirements in 2014 as high liquidity keeps funding costs down, a top executive at Deutsche Bank  said.Saudi firms have increasingly looked to the local debt market in recent years to help diversify their funding sources away from bank loans, with ample liquidity in the domestic market often suppressing borrowing costs to levels well below rates for equivalent dollar-denominated bond sales.With interest rates on international markets expected to rise from historic lows as the U.S. Federal Reserve begins to wind down its quantitative easing programme in 2014, the insulated Saudi market and its low borrowing costs are expected to remain attractive to the kingdom's issuers.""There is a lot of liquidity looking for a good home in Saudi Arabia. And importantly the Saudi market has developed comfort with long-term debt issues in Saudi riyals,"" Jamal al-Kishi, chief executive officer of Deutsche Securities Saudi Arabia, said. ""We expect local debt market activity this year to surpass international bond sales by Saudi issuers,"" he said.The German lender is one of the more active international banks in the Gulf's largest economy, which is expected to open up its markets to foreign investors.Deutsche competes with HSBC and J.P. Morgan Chase Inc in arranging and advising companies and state-owned entities on their capital market needs in the kingdom.The bank earned $14.4 million in fees from arranging debt issues in the Middle East during 2013, second behind HSBC, which earned $15.4 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Construction firm Saudi Binladin Group and dairy producer Almarai were among the issuers of local currency Islamic bonds last year, while Deutsche Bank helped Sadara Chemical Co, a venture between Saudi Aramco and Dow Chemical, raise 7.5 billion riyals to fund construction of its facilities last March.A number of banks, including Saudi Hollandi Bank  and Saudi British Bank, have also sold sukuk in the local market to improve their reserves after a period of loan growth.""For entities who do not have a lot of outstanding debt, issuing in the local debt market may prove less costly and more straightforward,"" Kishi said. MARKET OPENING Kishi expects measures will be taken in 2014 to open up Saudi Arabia's stock market to foreign investors.Saudi Arabia is the Arab world's biggest stock market and, by some measures, the world's last sizeable market that has not opened to international capital flows. Hopes of the market opening to direct foreign investment has prompted international banks to beef up their presence in the kingdom.""Saudi needs responsible long-term oriented capital that will bring technology and best practice to our industrial and service sectors,"" he said.While the Saudi government has been making technical preparations, it has never set a date for opening the market. The capital markets regulator in the kingdom has said that any market opening would take place only in a gradual manner.""Saudi Arabia does not need foreign capital per se but what we need is a responsible, enlightened capital that will come in and add qualitatively to the way our market opens,"" Kishi said.",2014-01-20,JPM,"Mon Jan 20, 2014 | 7:45am EST",Deutsche sees Saudi local debt sales surpassing int'l issues in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/saudi-debt-deutsche-idUSL5N0KT0K020140120?type=companyNews

54,"  By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK Jan 21 Comcast Corp has added Barclays Plc as an adviser as it evaluates a potential deal for Time Warner Cable Inc, according to people familiar with the matter.Comcast, the top U.S. cable company, hired Barclays late last year to review its deal options, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co, which it had earlier tapped for advice, the people said.The people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives from Comcast and Barclays declined to comment.Reuters reported on Dec. 6 that Comcast brought in JPMorgan as speculation about cable industry consolidation increased in the prior several months.After six months of an unsuccessful pursuit, Charter Communications Inc made a formal offer to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 per share, or $37.3 billion, based on shares outstanding. Charter approached Comcast last week to discuss carving up Time Warner Cable's systems and subscribers, after the second-largest U.S. cable company rejected its offer, Reuters reported.. Comcast also has been weighing a bid of its own.A deal for Time Warner Cable, if consummated, would generate handsome payouts for the banks involved, as well as much-sought-after bragging rights that come with a marquee transaction.In a successful deal, banks advising Charter would split roughly $74 million to $92 million in advisory fees while Time Warner Cable's advisers could reap $81 million to $101 million, according to preliminary estimates by consulting firm Freeman & Co LLC. Charter's financing banks - led by Goldman Sachs Group , Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group and Deutsche Bank - would also share $325 million to $445 million in financing fees, Freeman & Co estimates.Charter has said it is lining up $20.5 billion in new debt and also arranging $3.5 billion in bridge financing.Estimating potential fees for Comcast's advisers is difficult since its deal plans are not yet public. Time Warner Cable is working with Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company and Citigroup. Charter has turned to Goldman Sachs and LionTree as lead financial advisers, and is working with other advisers that include Guggenheim Securities, Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.Charter, the No. 4 U.S. cable provider, and Comcast are in preliminary discussions about how to structure a potential alliance, Reuters reported last week. One possibility is that Charter buys all of Time Warner Cable and sells off some of its markets and subscribers to Comcast.It was not immediately clear which geographic markets are under discussion, but analysts have said that Comcast would be interested in Time Warner Cable's largest markets, such as New York and Los Angeles.Time Warner Cable, which has said it was open to a deal at the right price - or $160 per share - considers Comcast to be the best merger partner because the larger rival can afford to make an all-cash offer and provides a better geographic fit, separate people familiar with the matter have said.Time Warner Cable was trading at $134.50 late on Tuesday.",2014-01-21,JPM,"Tue Jan 21, 2014 | 3:53pm EST",UPDATE 2-Comcast adds Barclays as adviser on Time Warner Cable deal-sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/comcast-barclays-idUSL2N0KV1GL20140121?type=companyNews

The notice, posted on a website run by the trustees, said none of the trustees had made a determination ""regarding the reasonableness of, or the advisability of, entering into the proposed settlement agreement.""The agreement with 21 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts gave the trustees 60 days to accept the deal, with a right to extend it for another 60 days.JPMorgan Chase made the offer in November as it sought to get past problems related to mortgage-backed securities issued before the 2008 financial crisis by the bank and Bear Stearns, which it bought during the crisis.

64,"  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is telling employees this week about their 2013 bonuses, and most workers are not getting pay increases for the year thanks to the bank's massive legal bills, a person familiar with the matter said.Overall compensation per employee was roughly flat with 2012, just as managers had warned employees in November, said the person who was not authorized to speak publicly. While some individuals are getting more money, their payouts have come at the expense of others.Pay increases have been muted across much of the banking sector in the aftermath of the financial crisis, but 2013 was especially tough at JPMorgan as profits declined because of the cost to settle government and private claims against the bank. The bank announced about $20 billion of settlements in 2013 and recorded firm wide legal expenses of $11.1 billion, up from $5 billion in 2012. The additional legal expenses were responsible for all of the company's 9 percent increase in non-interest expenses. Net income in 2013 was $17.9 billion, down 16 percent from 2012.Company-wide compensation expense was $30.8 billion for the year, up a fraction of one percent from 2012. At the same time, JPMorgan reduced headcount by more than 7,500 people to 251,196, with the result that compensation expense per employee rose nearly 4 percent to $122,653, according to data disclosed by the company last week. Most of JPMorgan' job cuts were from positions handling mortgage loans. Some tellers in bank branches were also replaced with financial advisors selling investment products. In the company's Corporate & Investment Bank, where its deal-makers and traders work, total compensation expense declined 4 percent and employment remained flat.

While some individuals are getting more money, their payouts have come at the expense of others.Pay increases have been muted across much of the banking sector in the aftermath of the financial crisis, but 2013 was especially tough at JPMorgan as profits declined because of the cost to settle government and private claims against the bank. The bank announced about $20 billion of settlements in 2013 and recorded firm wide legal expenses of $11.1 billion, up from $5 billion in 2012. The additional legal expenses were responsible for all of the company's 9 percent increase in non-interest expenses. Net income in 2013 was $17.9 billion, down 16 percent from 2012. Company-wide compensation expense was $30.8 billion for the year, up a fraction of one percent from 2012. At the same time, JPMorgan reduced headcount by more than 7,500 people to 251,196, with the result that compensation expense per employee rose nearly 4 percent to $122,653, according to data disclosed by the company last week. Most of JPMorgan' job cuts were from positions handling mortgage loans. Some tellers in bank branches were also replaced with financial advisors selling investment products.In the company's Corporate & Investment Bank, where its deal-makers and traders work, total compensation expense declined 4 percent and employment remained flat.

70,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Irvin Goldman, who briefly oversaw risk at JPMorgan Chase & Co during the ""London Whale"" derivatives debacle, is being sued for non-payment of a $2 million loan he received while working for Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.Goldman joined Cantor Fitzgerald in 2003, according to a lawsuit filed by CF Notes that was transferred to a New York state court in Manhattan this week.CF Notes, a Cantor affiliate, issued the loan to Goldman in 2006 on the condition that he pay it back upon leaving the firm.In 2007, Goldman resigned from Cantor, and he has not made any principal or interest payments, the lawsuit said. In 2010, Cantor Fitzgerald paid a $250,000 fine to settle a disciplinary proceeding for failing to supervise an executive who, in 2006, was trading the same stocks in his personal account and a firm proprietary account. The firm neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. The settlement identified Goldman by title but did not name him.Joanna Hendon, a lawyer for Goldman, did not immediately return a call for comment. In court papers, Goldman said CF Notes tried to recover too late, and that the statute of limitations is six years from the date of the note. Goldman, who joined JPMorgan Chase after leaving Cantor, resigned from the bank in July 2012. He had been named chief risk officer of the Chief Investment Office that lost billions in the ""London Whale"" derivatives trades in early 2012, around the time problems began to mount. The trades, which ultimately lost $6.25 billion, took on the ""London Whale"" nickname that hedge funds gave to the London-based trader who put on the exceptionally large positions.Robert Hubbell, a spokesman for Cantor Fitzgerald, declined to comment.

LEGAL SETTLEMENTS Over the course of the year, the bank agreed to a series of high-cost legal settlements, including $13 billion to resolve claims that it overstated the quality of the mortgages it was selling to investors before the financial crisis.

Dimon was paid $11.5 million for 2012, half of his $23 million compensation in each of the prior two years, according to company filings.

78,"  NEW YORK Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), got a 74 percent pay increase for 2013, when $20 billion of legal settlements weighed on the bank's income.The CEO received $20 million, including $18.5 million of restricted stock recently awarded, the company said in a public filing on Friday. Dimon's base salary is $1.5 million.Dimon was paid $11.5 million for 2012, half the $23 million compensation in each of the prior two years, according to company filings, after the company lost $6.25 billion on bets known as the ""London Whale"" derivatives trades. When those trades first came to light in April 2012, Dimon dismissed them as a ""tempest in a teapot"".Most employees at JPMorgan did not get pay increases for 2013 because profits declined as a result of high legal bills to settle government and private claims against the bank.JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, employed 251,196 people at year-end.The bank suffered a number of black eyes in 2013. In January of last year, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed sanctions on the bank for weak risk and financial controls, as well as deficient safeguards against money laundering and violations of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, over the 2012 derivatives loss. LEGAL SETTLEMENTS Over the course of the year, the bank agreed to a series of high-cost legal settlements, including $13 billion to resolve claims that it overstated the quality of the mortgages it was selling to investors before the financial crisis. Those settlements cut into the bank's earnings for the year -- JPMorgan's income fell 16 percent for 2013 to $17.92 billion.In the new pay package, half of Dimon's restricted stock units will vest after two years and half after three years, which JPMorgan's statement said ties his compensation to the company's future performance, including progress meeting requirements from regulators to improve its risk controls.U.S. median household income was $51,017 in 2012, adjusted for inflation, according to the Census Bureau. Directors cited the 2012 pay cut as evidence that the board is independent from Dimon, who is its chairman. The board's independence became an issue at the company's annual meeting when some shareholders tried, but failed, to pass a referendum to separate the roles of board chairman and CEO.Shareholders voted against that proposal after board members said that Dimon might leave if he did not retain his chairman title.The New York Times reported Friday that directors had decided to pay Dimon more for 2013 after a series of meetings that turned heated at times. JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti said the Times' characterization of the director meetings was wrong.(Reporting by David Henry; Editing by Andrew Hay and Stephen Powell)",2014-01-25,JPM,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 8:06pm EST",JPMorgan directors raise Dimon's pay after prior cut,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-dimon-pay-idUSBREA0N19T20140125?type=companyNews

The index had previously fallen to a session low of 1,281.16 before bouncing back as far as 1,298.46 following the release of U.S. gross domestic product data.Figures showed the U.S. economy was on a solid ground in the fourth quarter as a result of robust household spending and strong exports, with the economy growing at an annual rate of  3.2 percent.""Short-term 'oversold' levels, in combination with reasonably good growth numbers from the United States, have attracted some buyers back into the market,"" said Christian Stocker, equity strategist at UniCredit in Munich. ""But investors are very sceptical. They want to be optimistic, but the current developments in emerging markets have been stressful for them.""Charts showed that the 9-day relative strength index (RSI) for the FTSEurofirst 300 was at 34 after slipping earlier this week below 30, a technically ""oversold"" market condition that often results in a bounce back.A rebound in equity prices was supported by a rally in drugmakers, with the STOXX Europe 600 healthcare index  rising 1.7 percent to the top of the sectoral gainers' list.Danish healthcare products maker Coloplast  climbed 7.4 percent after major investment banks such as JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley raised their price targets for the stock, a day after the company raised its full-year revenue guidance. But gains were eclipsed by a 1.1 percent decline in food and beverages shares, led lower by a 4.7 percent fall in Diageo after the world's biggest spirits company reported a worse-than-expected slowdown in sales growth in the last six months.Analysts said the stock market was likely to remain volatile because of slowing Chinese growth, the withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus and a selloff in emerging currencies.""A correction following the crisis in emerging market currencies has given an opportunity for investors to rebalance their positions,"" said Lorne Baring, managing director, B Capital Wealth Management.""But the market is still vulnerable to sentiment in emerging markets."" The Russian rouble hit record lows against the euro on Thursday and currencies in South Africa and Hungary hit multi-year troughs in the latest wave of an emerging market asset sell-off threatening global economic stability.Alongside the emerging market worries, investor concern has focused on the current earnings season, and whether it will result in profits strong enough to justify lofty valuations after a bumper 2013.The STOXX Europe 600 is trading on a 12-month forward price/earnings ratio of 14 times against its 10-year average of 11.9 times, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows.""I just don't know how you can justify further multiple expansion at the moment.

85,"   By Teresa Carson | TIGARD, Oregon  TIGARD, Oregon TPG Capital LP, a private equity firm that is behind some of the world's largest leveraged buyouts, said on Wednesday it was asking some of its key investors for up to $2 billion to spend on deals until it raises a new $10 billion flagship fund.Founded in 1992, TPG has been one of the private equity industry's most successful firms, turning its founders, David Bonderman and James Coulter, into billionaires. But some of its bets went sour in the last six years, weighing on the performance of its funds.TPG told a public meeting of one of its investors, the Oregon Investment Council, that it was seeking between $1.6 billion and $2 billion for an interim fund that was intended to serve as ""bridge investment capital"" until it starts raising its first major global fund since the financial crisis. It raised a $19 billion fund, called TPG Partners VI, in 2008.Last summer, TPG received permission from its investors to extend the investment period of TPG Partners VI by one year to February 2015.TPG Partners VI was valued at 1.25 times its investors' money as of the end of September 2013, according to the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund. The previous flagship fund, the $15.3 billion TPG Partners V fund that was raised in 2006, was valued at just 1.06 times its investors' money.""You will, from time to time, make mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them,"" Coulter told the meeting of the Oregon Investment Council on Wednesday. TPG asked the Oregon Investment Council for a $700 million commitment to the bridge fund, which was approved. Dubbed the TPG Strategic Partnership Interim Fund, the bridge fund will be rolled into the next flagship fund that TPG is planning to raise, TPG Partners VII.""Fund VII is 'make or break' for these guys,"" Oregon State Treasurer Ted Wheeler told the meeting.Coulter said he expected that TPG would raise around $10 billion for TPG Partners VII. The bridge fund would let the firmdelay fundraising for TPG Partners VII for six months and keep its focus, he added. The bridge fund is the clearest sign yet that TPG's fund performance has affected its fundraising plans.""We think that it is right and proper that we go to our best partners and look for their support,"" Coulter said, adding that TPG had turned to a couple of key investors besides Oregon's public pension fund manager for the bridge fund.TPG said the bridge fund will target its ""sweet spot"" - buyout transactions requiring $250 million to $600 million of equity capital, mostly in North America. Some deals in Europe and Asia are also within the bridge fund's scope. TPG, which has $55.7 billion of capital under management according to its website, made huge bets that went sour on companies such as Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings Corp, casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp (CZR.O) and floundering bank Washington Mutual Inc. During the financial crisis in September 2008, federal regulators seized Washington Mutual and reached a deal to sell most of its operations to JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N).TPG is hoping that some recent lucrative exits from its investments, such as the $6 billion sale of department store owner Neiman Marcus Inc in October and the $2.9 billion sale of pharmaceutical company Aptalis Holdings Inc, announced earlier this month, will increase its appeal to skeptical investors.""We had an extraordinary exit year, and we expect another one,"" Coulter said, pointing to some initial public offerings of companies that TPG was planning.The Oregon Investment Council also approved a $250 million investment in a TPG credit investment fund. Like Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) and other peers, TPG has diversified beyond private equity, prompting speculation that TPG may one day seek to go public.""We have no short-term desire to go public, but we will see what happens.

89,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday approved JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) $543 million deal to end two private lawsuits stemming from its relationship with convicted Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernard Madoff.A spokeswoman for the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC confirmed that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein approved the agreement, which was made public on January 7, the same day federal authorities announced the bank had agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle criminal charges related to the Madoff fraud.JPMorgan will pay $218 million to resolve class-action litigation and $325 million to resolve claims brought by the trustee, Irving Picard. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.Madoff was a longtime client of the bank, which was accused of turning a blind eye to suspicious activity within his accounts that suggested fraud. Picard has estimated that the Ponzi scheme, the largest in history, cost investors more than $17 billion of principal.

97,"   By Katharina Bart and Steve Slater | ZURICH/LONDON  ZURICH/LONDON A jump in bonus payments at Swiss bank UBS AG UBSN.VX stoked criticism on Tuesday that a previous cut was short-lived and banks have not learned lessons from the financial crisis.Banker bonuses drew intense criticism after the crisis which peaked in 2008 and 2009 for creating lucrative short-term incentives, tied to often ill-conceived products, whose failure cost banks and governments billions while leaving the bankers themselves unscathed.Yet as conditions in the banking sector improve, UBS and other banks argue they need to keep rewarding top performing staff in areas such as merger and acquisition advisory, bond trading or advising rich clients, or risk losing them to rivals.UBS said it had increased its bonus pool for 2013 by 28 percent to 3.2 billion Swiss francs ($3.5 billion), after a cut in 2012 when it was fined for rigging Libor interest rates.It said it needed to reduce a pay gap between with other banks and said the increase was justified after a ""transformational"" year in which it swung to higher than expected net profit and surpassed most of its turnaround targets.Critics said it showed little had changed after the financial crisis and argued banks were still paying staff too much, often at the expense of shareholders.""It is offensive when bonuses outpace profits. It isn't really comprehensible,"" said Roby Tschopp, head of activist shareholder group Actares.Actares voted against UBS's pay plan last year and Tschopp said he didn't know how he will vote this year.Thomas Zimmermann, spokesman for Schweizerischer Gewerkschaftsbund, an umbrella organization for Swiss labor unions, said: ""UBS is carrying on as if nothing happened. ""They have learned nothing from the public debate about the Minder initiative or the 1:12 initiative,"" Zimmermann said, referring to controls on executive pay introduced in Switzerland last year.The Minder initiative gives shareholders a binding vote on compensation, though voters rejected a proposal to limit executive pay to 12 times that of junior staff.UBS's decision comes with the bonus season in full swing in Europe and follows payouts already announced at major U.S. banks. Bonuses in investment banking are expected to be mostly flat to slightly lower, though some firms are raising pay.BONUS HIKE Bank of America (BAC.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) increased average pay last year by around 7 percent, while pay in the investment bank arms of JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) fell. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) cut average pay by 4 percent last year, although average compensation still topped $380,000 for its 32,900 staff.Top staff continue to receive multi-million-dollar awards, but more cuts could be on the cards for weak and average performers, especially in fixed income after a relatively bad year in that sector, bank and recruitment industry sources said.UBS's bonus hike would lift average personnel costs to 249,581 Swiss francs ($276,500) across the bank's 60,200 staff, up 3 percent from the year before. Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said the bank had cut its absolute and relative pay substantially in recent years and the rise for 2013 had ""reduced gaps to market pay"".""We feel comfortable that we now have a normalized compensation framework for the entire bank that allows us to be competitive and attract and retain the best talents,"" Ermotti told reporters on a conference call. UBS is considering introducing an ""allowance"" system to help comply with European Union rules that will cap 2014 bonuses at 100 percent of fixed pay, or double with shareholder approval, for his 5,600 staff in London and others in the EU.""There are various options and it goes without saying one of those is to use allowances that are supplementary, and can be included in the fixed compensation framework,"" Ermotti said.He said UBS would decide in the next couple of months the best way to comply with the EU directive.Rivals including Barclays (BARC.L), Goldman Sachs, HSBC (HSBA.L), Bank of America and JPMorgan are also expected to introduce monthly or quarterly role-based allowances that count as fixed pay but have more flexibility than salaries and are not pensionable.UBS changed its compensation framework in 2012, which it said was to increase focus on long-term performance and was aligned with creating attractive returns to shareholders.It said the cost of performance awards in 2013 would be flat for shareholders at 3 billion francs on an accounting basis after amortizations and deferrals.Yet critics of rich banker awards seem unlikely to be appeased by such reassurances.

99,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov | LONDON  LONDON Fast-growing trading house Mercuria, led by two former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) executives, has become the front-runner to buy the physical commodities unit of JPMorgan (JPM.N), one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street, two sources told Reuters.JPMorgan decided to sell its multi-billion dollar physical commodities division last year under rising regulatory and political pressure to retreat to the bank's core business of lending instead of speculating in raw materials.""This week, JPM entered into exclusive talks with Mercuria,"" one of the sources familiar with the process told Reuters.The final deal could take a few months to conclude, one of the sources said. If agreed, it would catapult Mercuria into the top tier of trading houses with Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L), Vitol and Trafigura TRAFGF.UL.In recent weeks, Mercuria was competing with Australian bank Macquarie Group (MQG.AX) and private equity manager Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to buy JPMorgan's unit, sources had said.Private and lightly regulated trading houses have benefited most from a major retreat by banks from commodities trading over the past two years.Companies like Glencore and Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) hired whole teams of traders from banks such as Morgan Stanley. (MS.N) But Mercuria could become the first trading house to absorb an entire physical division from a bank.JPMorgan and Mercuria both declined to comment. A spokesman for Blackstone in London declined to comment. A spokesman for Macquarie in London did not immediately respond.Mercuria was founded by Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, who both worked as executives at Goldman Sachs and then trading house Sempra, which was later bought by JPMorgan from the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L). In less than a decade, Dunand and Jaeggi have built Mercuria into one of the world's largest oil traders, with annual turnover of around $100 billion and 700 traders spread across the globe. But it is still much smaller than the world's largest trader, Vitol, which has turnover of $300 billion.The deal value has yet to be agreed and will depend to a large extent on the valuation of large stockpiles of oil and metals the bank holds, one source said.In documents circulated to potential buyers, JPMorgan valued its physical commodity business at $3.3 billion, with an annual income of $750 million. JPMorgan paid nearly $2 billion to buy the largest part of the business from RBS in 2010.The sale will allow JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon to close the book on a public set-back in a business once hailed as an engine for growth following a dire mix of waning margins, allegations of market manipulation and unprecedented political pressure over its role in the supply chain.The sale will also raise questions about the future for JPMorgan's commodities chief Blythe Masters, who over the past five years spent billions of dollars building the biggest physical commodity trading operation on Wall Street, surpassing in size long-time giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. NO STRANGERS JPMorgan has access to a vast global metals trading and warehousing network, a big U.S. power and gas desk and Canadian oil storage leases.The deal is expected to come with a contract supplying crude oil to the biggest U.S. East Coast refinery, the Henry Bath & Sons Ltd metals warehousing business with about 80 storage sheds stretching from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to Johor in Malaysia, and a sizeable U.S. natural gas and power trading book.Mercuria has said it is looking to expand in the United States like many other traders as a shale oil boom is opening up new ways to make profits.""Mercuria have expanded aggressively into new areas of commodity trading in the last two years, and part of that strategy has been hiring some of the best traders from the banking world,"" said Jake White, head of front-office commodities recruitment at Selby Jennings in London. ""But taking on a business of the size and prestige of JPMorgan's physical business is definitely their biggest move yet, and will undoubtedly propel Mercuria into the top tier of commodity trading houses.""Rising global capital requirements for banks under the Basel III regulatory framework and new restrictions on proprietary trading introduced to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis have made commodity markets less attractive for many banks.Commodity income at the world's top 10 investment banks has fallen from a peak of more than $14 billion in 2008 to just $5.5 billion in 2012, according to London-based consultants Coalition.For many U.S. banks, it was their prime regulator - the Federal Reserve - that delivered the heaviest blow, making clear in recent years that it was increasingly uneasy with Wall Street's expansion into physical trading of raw materials.Amid negotiations to resolve a host of other regulatory investigations, including the ""London Whale"" credit losses from derivatives trading in 2012, JPMorgan's Dimon was also stung by a probe into allegations of U.S. power market manipulation ending in a record $410 million settlement.JPMorgan is expected to retain its basic commodity derivatives trading desk that hedges prices for customers.While some of the industry's oldest hands such as Goldman Sachs aim to retain much of their commodities businesses, others are getting out or adopting different strategies.Deutsche Bank announced late last year that it was largely exiting commodities trading, while Morgan Stanley is selling the majority of its global physical oil trading operation to Russia's Rosneft.(Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, Additional reporting by David Sheppard, Oleg Vukmanovic, Henning Gloystein and Veronica Brown; Editing by Peter Graff)",2014-02-05,JPM,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 1:31pm EST",Exclusive: JPMorgan in talks with Mercuria on commodities unit sale,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-commodities-mercuria-idUSBREA140PT20140205?type=companyNews
100,"  Swiss trader Mercuria has become the front-runner to buy the physical commodities unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), one of the most powerful oil and metals desks on Wall Street, two sources told Reuters.The terms are yet to be agreed and the details of what assets would be included are not known, but a deal would catapult Mercuria into the top tier of trading houses with Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L), Vitol and Trafigura TRAFGF.UL.JPMorgan's multi-billion dollar push to become Wall Street's biggest commodities trader began in 2008 with the purchase of Bear Stearns and peaked with the $1.6 billion deal to buy RBS Sempra's global oil and metals business in 2010.The following are a selection of JPMorgan's physical trading assets and operations:ASSET: POWER PLANTS, ELECTRICITY TOLLING AND MARKETING AGREEMENTS DATE OF PURCHASE: March 2008 (JPMorgan buys Bear Stearns, including power subsidiary Bear Energy)DESCRIPTION: The bank's commodity division, known as JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation, has electricity trading deals with U.S. power plants and wind farms totaling almost 3,000 megawatts of capacity - enough to light up each one of Indiana's 2.8 million homes.In May 2013 the bank largely exited the Californian power market, where it has been embroiled in a market manipulation scandal, selling power interests totaling over 3,000 MW of capacity to Edison International.The bank's commodity division also has an equity interest in three entities that own power plants in the United States, including the 545 MW Kinder Jackson facility in Michigan, the 230 MW Brandywine plant in Maryland, and a 75 MW biomass plant in Florida.JPMorgan also owns interests in power plants and wind farms through its private equity arm, JPMorgan Capital Partners, and JPMorgan Infrastructure Investments Group, its asset management division.In late 2007, Bear Stearns' commodity arm, Houston-based Bear Energy, acquired the rights to more than 9,000 MW of electric power output after purchasing Williams Power Co.ASSET: Henry Bath, metals warehousing business DATE OF PURCHASE: July 2010SELLER: RBS SempraPRICE: Part of $1.6 billion RBS Sempra deal.DESCRIPTION: When RBS Sempra was bought by JPMorgan for $1.6 billion in 2010, it was the second-largest warehousing company in the LME's vast network with almost 100 warehouses. Since then it has been eclipsed by Goldman Sachs's warehouse business Metro International and Glencore Xstrata's Pacorini, and with around 80 facilities in nine countries, it is now the fourth-largest based on the number of sheds.The company was a founder member of the LME in 1877 and issued the first LME warrant on December 20 1883.The company motto is ""habere et dispertire"" - to have and to share. Tracing its roots back to 18th century England, the Liverpool, UK-based company was eventually bought by Metallgesellschaft in 1986. Until then, the company had largely been a trading house and ship operator. Hollywood actress Catherine Zeta Jones is reportedly named after the Henry Bath ship ""Zeta"" that was captained by her great grandfather.STATUS: In mid-January, an official from the U.S. Federal Reserve said the regulator had given JPMorgan an ""ultimate time limit"" for selling its Henry Bath warehousing unit.The Fed had been pressing JPMorgan to distance itself from its metals warehousing business for over a year. Since June 2012, the bank had tried unsuccessfully to turn the trading asset into an arm's length ""merchant banking"" investment in order to hold onto it, documents seen by Reuters showed.RBS Sempra was earlier told by the Fed it had to divest Henry Bath within two years of the launch of its 2008 joint venture.ASSET: (UBS) Commodities CanadaDATE OF PURCHASE: Feb 2009 DESCRIPTION: Bought from UBS in 2009, the Calgary-based trading division helped JPMorgan gain a foothold in the heart of the Canadian oil sands industry. It trades, transports and stores natural gas, crude and power.""We provide extensive physical capabilities, specifically transport and warehousing, and specialize in trading and structuring across energy products, including oil, natural gas and power,"" the company says on its website detailing its Canadian operations.The bank said in 2010 that it was growing its Natural Resources Group, hiring senior oil and gas traders in Calgary.STATUS: The bank's long-term leases on over 6 million barrels of oil storage capacity in Hardisty, Alberta have been mentioned as one of its most valuable but lesser-known assets.The tanks are owned by Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), and most of the leases are re-let to other companies operating in Alberta's oil patch, according to market sources.LONG-TERM TRADING DEALS: * NORTHERN TIER REFINERY: In December 2010, JPMorgan agreed to provide crude oil to Northern Tier Energy's 82,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in St. Paul, Minnesota.It now supplies more than 90 percent of the refinery's crude, according to Northern Tier's SEC filings, including about 10,000 bpd imported from Canada in 2012, EIA data show.* PHILADELPHIA ENERGY SOLUTIONS REFINERY: In the summer of 2012, JPMorgan agreed to provide financing and crude supply to the 335,000 bpd refinery in Philadelphia as part of a buy-out by the Carlyle Group (CG.O).Since September 2012 it had been importing some 250,000 bpd of crude from Nigeria, Chad and Azerbaijan.The deal helped the bank treble its crude imports in 2012 to nearly 130,000 bpd, the data show, overtaking Morgan Stanley's crude and fuel imports for the first time ever.(Reporting by Anna Louie Sussman, Jonathan Leff and Josephine Mason; Editing by Rosalind Russell)",2014-02-05,JPM,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 1:18pm EST",Factbox: JPMorgan's physical commodity trading,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-commodities-factbox-idUSBREA141PE20140205?type=companyNews
101,"  Feb 5 The physical commodity trading business that JPMorgan Chase & Co is in exclusive talks to sell to Swiss-based trader Mercuria is a vast global enterprise, parts of which have been bought and sold many times over several decades.While parts of the business have passed through the hands of some of the most famous and infamous names in the raw materials markets, its core is comprised of two enterprises considered among the most successful of their time: Sempra Commodities and Bear Stearns' power and gas desk.But major parts of the JPMorgan business were extracted from the ashes of failure, including a base metals operation that endured through the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the Enron meltdown, and a trading platform that dates back to the days of failed investment bank Drexel Burnham.More recently, much of the business had already been bought and sold twice in the past five years, once when Royal Bank of Scotland bought a 51 percent stake in Sempra Commodities and then again when RBS was forced to sell it to JPMorgan.A partial history of the business is below:THE EARLY YEARS 1980s - Drexel Burnham Lambert expands into physical energy trading, hiring a team that includes future Sempra chiefs David Messer and Frank Gallipoli.1986 - UK-based warehousing group Henry Bath & Sons is taken over by Metallgesellschaft (MG), a huge German conglomerate and one of the world's largest physical and futures metal traders, according to a history on its website.Early 1990 - AIG acquires the commodity trading business of Drexel Burnham, which had filed for bankruptcy.1997 - Pacific Enterprises and Enova Corp acquire the energy unit of AIG Trading for $225 million. (The utilities merge one year later to form Sempra Energy )2000 - Enron buys UK-listed MG Plc, including Henry Bath warehouses, for $448 million.ENRON OUT, OTHERS JUMP IN  2002 - Sempra Energy Trading buys Enron Metals Ltd, the former-MG metals division of the failed U.S. Enron for $145 mln.2002 - UBS buys Enron's energy trading business in exchange for royalties to Enron creditors. The deal includes leases to several million barrels of oil storage in Canada.2004 - Sempra Energy Trading is renamed Sempra Commodities. By 2005, the unit contributes more than half of parent company Sempra's net income; makes over half a billion dollars in 2007.Sept. 2005 - Bear Stearns moves into energy trading through joint-venture with Calpine. Deal ends six months later, but Bear Stearns continues to expand in the power and gas markets.Nov. 2006 - Bear Stearns buys Delta Power Co., a private power-plant developer with 1,380 megawatts of capacity. May 2007 - Bear Stearns' commodity arm buys the electricity trading book and gas and power contracts of Williams Cos for $512 million, giving it about 7,700 MW of gas-fired tolling capacity and 1,800 MW of full-requirements power supply.JPMORGAN'S ACQUISITION SPREE March 2008 - JPMorgan buys Bear Stearns, including its now-large energy trading business.Early 2008 - JPMorgan buys carbon offsetting company ClimateCare. (The firm's management takes it private in 2011) April 2008 - Royal Bank of Scotland acquires controlling stake in Sempra Commodities for $1.7 billion to form RBS Sempra Commodities.Feb. 2009 - JPMorgan buys UBS's global agricultural business and Canadian energy unit in 2009, including two million barrels of long-term oil storage leases.Sept. 2009 - JPMorgan buys UK-based EcoSecurities, which developed clean energy programs and carbon offsets as part of the Kyoto protocol, for $200 million.Nov. 2009 - RBS says it will sell its 51 percent interest in RBS Sempra Commodities in exchange for government aid.July 2010 - JPMorgan closes deal to buy RBS Sempra's global oil and metals business, plus its European gas and power desk, for $1.6 billion.Oct. 2010 - JPMorgan buys the North American wholesale gas and power trading book of RBS Sempra for $220 million. The value of the gross assets was put at $6 billion as of June, and the business had recorded pre-tax profits of $22 mln in the first six months of the year.June 2012 - Freepoint Commodities acquires metals concentrates business from JPMorgan.July 2013 - JPMorgan announces plan to explore ""strategic alternatives"" for its physical commodity trading division amid slimming margins and regulatory pressure to quit risky businesses.Feb. 2014 - Mercuria enters exclusive negotiations to buy JPMorgan's physical commodities business, sources say.",2014-02-05,JPM,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 11:31am EST","TIMELINE-Drexel to Enron, MG to RBS: A genealogy of JPMorgan's commodity arm",http://www.reuters.com//article/jpmorgan-commodities-mercuria-idUSL2N0KW1W720140205?type=companyNews

Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) have also reached settlements, while the Justice Department is seeking $2.1 billion in penalties from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) after a jury found the bank liable for fraud over mortgages sold by its Countrywide unit.Last year, JPMorgan agreed to about $20 billion in settlements in its drive to clear up legal claims.

The latest settlement was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and was approved by Judge J.

The settlement with the Justice Department began with a whistleblower, Keith Edwards, who sued JPMorgan in January 2013 under an anti-fraud law known as the False Claims Act. The law allows individuals to sue government contractors and suppliers for defrauding taxpayers. Whisteblowers can keep a slice of the penalty if successful.It has not been determined what Edwards' share will be, according to court papers. The existence of his suit was sealed until Tuesday.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC confirmed that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein approved the agreement, which was made public on January 7, the same day federal authorities announced the bank had agreed to pay more than $2 billion to settle criminal charges related to the Madoff fraud.JPMorgan will pay $218 million to resolve class-action litigation and $325 million to resolve claims brought by the trustee, Irving Picard. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.Madoff was a longtime client of the bank, which was accused of turning a blind eye to suspicious activity within his accounts that suggested fraud. Picard has estimated that the Ponzi scheme, the largest in history, cost investors more than $17 billion of principal. To date, he has recovered more than $10 billion for victims, including the JPMorgan settlement.Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence. Five of his former aides are currently on trial in New York federal court on charges that they helped Madoff perpetuate his scheme. In all, JPMorgan recorded approximately $20 billion of legal settlements in 2013, including $13 billion to resolve claims related to mortgages it packaged leading up to the financial crisis.The bankruptcy case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.

112,"   By Sarah N. Lynch and Aruna Viswanatha | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 10 The non-profit group Better Markets filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department on Monday to block what it called an ""unlawful"" $13 billion settlement with JP Morgan over bad mortgage loans sold to investors before the financial crisis.The record settlement with the bank, which was reached in November, does not release JP Morgan from potential criminal liability over the mortgages it packaged into bonds.But Better Markets said it was still appalled that the settlement gave the bank ""blanket civil immunity"" for its conduct without sufficient judicial review.""The Wall Street bailouts were bad enough, but now taxpayers are being forced to accept a secretive backroom deal that may well have been another sweetheart deal,"" said Dennis Kelleher, the chief executive of Better Markets. ""The Justice Department cannot act as prosecutor, jury and judge and extract $13 billion in exchange for blanket civil immunity to the largest, richest, most politically connected bank on Wall Street.""The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington. The Justice Department in November negotiated a wide-ranging deal with the largest U.S. bank that included a $2 billion civil penalty to resolve Department of Justice claims.It also included a $4 billion consumer relief package, and a separately negotiated $4 billion settlement with the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Another $1.4 billion of the $13 billion package also resolved a lawsuit from the National Credit Union Administration.The DOJ settlement was released to the public but not filed in federal court.The agency also did not release a complaint that it had prepared to file against JPMorgan before it negotiated the deal.",2014-02-10,JPM,"Mon Feb 10, 2014 | 12:05pm EST",Better Markets sues Justice Department over JP Morgan settlement,http://www.reuters.com//article/lawsuit-justice-jpmorgan-idUSL2N0LF0UV20140210?type=companyNews

115,"   By Abhinav Ramnarayan  LONDON, Feb 10 (IFR) - JP Morgan has cut its correspondent banking relationship with Emirates NBD, Dubai's largest bank, as part of a global review of its business, sources familiar with the matter said.In a memo to staff last year, the U.S. bank said it would scale back its relationships with foreign banks in order to comply with regulatory pressure to tighten risk controls.As part of this process, the bank has severed relationships in its cash management business in the Middle East, and has not spared Dubai's largest bank by market capitalisation.""JP Morgan is undertaking a global review of its banking relationships both on profitability and on compliance. In the Middle East they have cut many relationships, including with Emirates NBD,"" a person with knowledge of the matter said.Another Dubai-based banker said he had received similar information. ""It is not very surprising given the pressure they've been under from regulators. They are cutting any relationship that holds even a slight bit of risk,"" he said. JP Morgan does not comment on individual relationships, but a source said: ""It is well known we are tightening our controls, especially in the corresponding banking business...and we mentioned it in our Q3 earnings.""An Emirates NBD spokesman said the lender did not comment on the relationship between the bank and clearing banks.Correspondent banking, which involves activities such as processing transactions and clearing U.S. dollar payments for foreign banks, has historically been a core part of JP Morgan's business. It emerged in August last year that this business would be scaled back at JP Morgan and the bank would not take on any new clients, particularly in the light of increased regulatory scrutiny in the aftermath of the ""London Whale"" derivatives trade losses.Following media reports, JP Morgan said in a statement that it was ""important for us to pause and assess our business, particularly in select markets, to ensure we are well-positioned to meet our responsibilities for the long term"". Bankers working for international banks in the Middle East said they would be surprised if JP Morgan was the only international firm to cut relationships in the region.""I think it is a little unfair to single out JP Morgan on this issue - many of us will need to look at our relationships again and there could be more developments of this nature,"" said one.One problem facing international banks in the region is some Gulf lenders' relationships with clients in Iran, though there are no suggestions that the relationship with Emirates NBD was terminated for this reason.In February 2012, Dubai-based Noor Islamic Bank (now called Noor Bank) stopped channelling billions of dollars from Iranian oil sales through its accounts after pressure from the United States, Reuters reported.In May last year, the United States blacklisted two Dubai-based trading companies - Al Hilal Exchange and Al Fida International General Trading - accusing them of helping Iran evade financial sanctions.",2014-02-10,JPM,"Mon Feb 10, 2014 | 4:01am EST",IFR-JP Morgan cuts banking ties with Dubai's Emirates NBD -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/emirates-idUSL5N0LF11R20140210?type=companyNews
116,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wall Street power brokers are betting that Greg Fleming will be chief executive of a major U.S. company one day, but no one is quite sure of which one or when.Fleming, the head of Morgan Stanley's wealth and investment management businesses, is on the bank board's list of candidates who could potentially succeed Chief Executive James Gorman, according to sources with direct knowledge of the situation.But colleagues and recruiters say he is also a flight risk for Morgan Stanley.He is an external candidate for top jobs at companies including BlackRock Inc and American Express Co as part of their boards' regular succession planning.Fleming also has a friendly rapport with Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of arch rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc, although that bank has never gone outside its own ranks to pick a chief executive officer. Some people close to Fleming say he could even run a company outside of financial services.It is unclear if a suitable CEO job will be available any time soon. Sources familiar with the thinking of Morgan Stanley's board said directors believe there is time to work on a succession plan. Gorman, 55, has been in the job for only four years, and directors have no desire to replace him at this time.A Morgan Stanley spokesman said Fleming has no plans to leave the Wall Street bank. Fleming feels that his work at Morgan Stanley is not finished, and he is in no hurry to become a chief executive, the spokesman said.The other institutions to which he has been linked did not offer any comment. Blankfein could not be reached for comment.Still, Wall Street circles are abuzz with talk that the 50-year-old executive, known for an ambitious streak, may be itching for a bigger challenge soon, according to interviews with dozens of Morgan Stanley insiders and other industry executives who know Fleming.""Every couple of years, he finishes what he set out to do, and people want to give him more,"" Navtej S. Nandra, a trusted Fleming ally who is now president of online broker E*TRADE Financial Corp. ""Of course, that starts a whole slew of questions about what he's going to do next, and where.""It could create a knotty predicament for Morgan Stanley's board and Gorman. Directors like what Fleming is doing with his businesses and want to keep him at the firm, but they do not have an obvious spot to promote him within the bank.People who know Fleming say he is at a crossroads as he enters his fifth year at the bank. He has steered Morgan Stanley Wealth Management through a complicated merger with Citigroup Inc's Smith Barney brokerage, lifting the division's profit margins to a targeted level after a bumpy start.The business now generates more than half of Morgan Stanley's revenue. It is the centerpiece of Morgan Stanley and helped its shares rise nearly 65 percent last year.As he has set the wealth business on course, Fleming has also come to wield greater influence at Morgan Stanley. For example, he argued for the bank to scale down its bond-trading risk more aggressively. Colm Kelleher, who heads institutional securities, decided that was the right approach.""I have very high regard for his leadership and his achievement,"" said Masaaki Tanaka, one of two directors who represent Morgan Stanley's biggest shareholder Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc on the board.Tanaka said Fleming had done very well in turning around the wealth business but declined to comment specifically on succession planning.People who have worked with Fleming say he sets the bar high and can be demanding. Subordinates recalled him honing in on the one detail that was missing from a 30-page presentation and emailing round the clock to get updates on projects.Yet they also say he rarely loses his temper. Colleagues who worked with Fleming during the mortgage crisis said they never heard him raise his voice, even during tense negotiations.Friends and adversaries alike describe Fleming using terms like ""Boy Scout"" and ""goodie two-shoes."" One former colleague said Fleming tries to head home by 9:30 p.m., even on nights he is entertaining clients or hosting events. His only brush with the law appears to be a June 2009 speeding ticket.CEO QUALITIES Morgan Stanley's board may eventually promote Fleming to president of the whole bank, effectively anointing him Gorman's successor, some sources said. But Gorman, who is also chairman, has no plans to recommend such a move in the near term. Promoting Fleming could discourage other senior managers, the sources said.Neither the board nor Fleming want to upset his relationship with Kelleher or Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat. Both are also on the board's succession list and work well with Fleming in the current power structure, the sources added.Fleming's next move may come down to who offers him a job he wants first.One close friend and former colleague said Fleming always had his eyes on being a chief executive officer.""And, by the way, I'm not saying that negatively,"" said the person. ""His ambition in life was not to be a star dealmaker or banker. His ambition in life was to become CEO of a large organization.""RISING STAR Still, after a quick ascent up Wall Street's corporate ladder, it has been a relatively long wait for Fleming to get to the corner suite.Fleming joined Merrill Lynch in 1992 from the consulting firm Booz Allen, where he covered financial clients. By 1999, when he was only 35, he had become the head of the investment bank's U.S. financial institutions group.He aggressively courted CEOs at acquisitive banks, like First Union and Bank of America Corp, that embarked on dozens of mergers in a consolidation streak from the mid-'90s into the 2000s.In 2001, he appeared on the Crain's New York Business list of high achievers under 40. ""I have a lot of confidence,"" he told the magazine. ""It's not arrogance; it's confidence."" Two years later, Fleming had received two more big promotions at Merrill, first to head up investment banking globally and then to be co-president of the entire capital markets unit.He increased the investment bank's revenue by 2-1/2 times while running it and personally advised on several landmark deals of the era, including Blackrock's 1999 initial public offering and First Union's $15 billion sale to Wachovia in 2001.""One of the things which clearly stands out about Greg is that he's able to master virtually all the different aspects of a modern financial institution,"" said Sullivan & Cromwell's H. Rodgin Cohen, the preeminent bank lawyer who worked with Fleming on several deals.INTERIM CEO Fleming got his first shot at the top job at a major company soon after Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Stan O'Neal promoted him to co-president of the firm in May 2007.As the financial crisis took hold in the ensuing months, Merrill began disclosing escalating losses from subprime mortgage derivatives that grew to a crushing $45 billion. O'Neal and other executives responsible for the losses were fired.The board effectively made Fleming interim chief executive, but his role was short-lived. It hired John Thain, a former Goldman Sachs executive, to fill the job permanently.Directors decided against Fleming because they felt investors wanted someone who was not associated with the business that generated the losses, a source said.Though Fleming was in charge of the entire unit, the board did not see him as directly responsible for the trading losses. Fleming was routinely shut out of management decisions regarding trading, and his unsolicited advice was ignored by superiors.""While Greg would say he was without fault, the board didn't think the outside world would view it that way,"" the person said. ""The world would've said, 'You're going to put the guy in the job that was responsible for this?'""After helping to negotiate the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America at the height of the crisis, Fleming left Wall Street. He went to teach at Yale Law School, his alma mater, where he has given ethics lessons about cases such as Goldman Sachs' controversial ""Abacus"" derivatives deal and JPMorgan Chase & Co's ""London Whale"" fiasco.FRESH START A person involved with Fleming's hiring at Morgan Stanley said it was not easy to persuade him to return to Wall Street so soon after the crisis. However, unlike many bankers, he was not greedy about pay, this person added.Fleming made as much as $34 million in his best year at Merrill Lynch but earned less than that in his first three years at Morgan Stanley combined.When Fleming arrived in 2010, Morgan Stanley was shifting from being one of Wall Street's premiere investment banks with a retail brokerage unit tacked on, to having wealth management at the center of its profit universe. It was buying Smith Barney in phases and merging it with its own brokerage.The plan to integrate the two businesses was engineered before Fleming arrived, and by most accounts it was going terribly. Clients' historical account information was not being transferred properly, and staff complained about all sorts of technology problems.When Fleming embarked on a cross-country tour of brokerage offices in early 2012, he got an earful from angry employees.""Greg was basically going on a listening tour and got hit in the face with it,"" says Mary Deatherage, a broker based in New Jersey.STRONGEST HORSE He was resilient. Brokers recall him personally fielding complaints ranging from slow email and lack of client birthday reminders to bigger issues like a glitch with portfolio management systems that required a ""SWAT team"" to resolve.""He did that for two or three years with that kind of a focus until an awful lot of the issues were subsiding,"" said Jim Hansberger, a veteran adviser in Atlanta.In early 2013, Fleming announced a plan to invest $500 million in upgrading the unit's technology and hired former Merrill colleague Chris Randazzo to oversee technology.""Greg immediately understood what I was talking about and wanted to get into very detailed discussions around where we are today and where do we need to be in 12 months and 24 months and 36 months and 48 months,"" Randazzo said. ""You don't see that very much from very, very senior executives.""The wealth unit reached its 20 percent pre-tax profit margin goal last year. Management has since raised the goal to a range of 22 to 25 percent by next year if interest rates stay low and markets remain static. If rates rise and markets improve, the margin could be higher, executives say.Fleming is trying to boost revenue further by lending more, an area where Morgan Stanley lags rivals like Merrill Lynch that are part of big commercial banks.At a conference on Wednesday, Fleming also laid out targets to grow the investment management unit's assets by nearly 50 percent and boost its return-on-equity to 20 percent by 2016.Some of Fleming's associates said that gives him enough to do at Morgan Stanley to bridle his ambition for some time.Meanwhile, he is enjoying spending more time with his wife, Melissa, and their three children. He still teaches a class at Yale, and even found time last year to train for the New York City marathon, completing it in under 3.5 hours.""There's an expression that the strongest horse gets the cart. That's Greg, right?"" said E*TRADE's Nandra, whom Fleming had hired at both Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. ""I can't wait to see him as CEO some place one day, because I know that's who he is.""(Editing by Dan Wilchins, Paritosh Bansal and Cynthia Osterman)",2014-02-12,JPM,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 4:02pm EST",Insight: Wall Street's most eligible banker Fleming waits for suitor,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-morganstanley-fleming-insight-idUSBREA1B0AZ20140212?type=companyNews

118,"  By Lauren Tara LaCapraNEW YORK Feb 12 Wall Street power brokers are betting that Greg Fleming will be chief executive of a major U.S. company one day, but no one is quite sure of which one or when.Fleming, the head of Morgan Stanley's wealth and asset management businesses, is on the bank board's list of candidates who could potentially succeed Chief Executive James Gorman, according to sources with direct knowledge of the situation.But colleagues and recruiters say he is also a flight risk for Morgan Stanley.He is an external candidate for top jobs at companies including BlackRock Inc and American Express Co  as part of their boards' regular succession planning.Fleming also has a friendly rapport with Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of archrival Goldman Sachs Group Inc, although that bank has never gone outside its own ranks to pick a chief executive officeer. Some people close to Fleming say the he could even run a company outside of financial services.It is unclear if a suitable CEO job will be available any time soon. Sources familiar with the thinking of Morgan Stanley's board said directors believe there is time to work on a succession plan. Gorman, 55, has been in the job for only four years, and directors have no desire to replace him at this time.A Morgan Stanley spokesman said Fleming has no plans to leave the Wall Street bank. Fleming feels that his work at Morgan Stanley is not finished, and he is in no hurry to become a chief executive, the spokesman said.The other institutions with which he has been linked did not offer any comment. Blankfein could not be reached for comment.Still, Wall Street circles are abuzz with talk that the 50-year-old executive, known for an ambitious streak, may be itching for a bigger challenge soon, according to interviews with dozens of Morgan Stanley insiders and other industry executives who know Fleming.""Every couple of years, he finishes what he set out to do, and people want to give him more,"" Navtej S. Nandra, a trusted Fleming ally who is now president of online broker E*TRADE Financial Corp. ""Of course, that starts a whole slew of questions about what he's going to do next, and where.""It could create a knotty predicament for Morgan Stanley's board and Gorman. Directors like what Fleming is doing with the business and want to keep him at the firm, but they do not have an obvious spot to promote him within the bank.People who know Fleming say he is at a crossroads as he enters his fifth year at the bank. He has steered Morgan Stanley Wealth Management through a complicated merger with Citigroup Inc's Smith Barney brokerage, lifting the division's profit margins into a targeted range after a bumpy start.The business now generates more than half of Morgan Stanley's revenue. It is the centerpiece of Morgan Stanley and helped its shares rise nearly 65 percent last year.As he has set the wealth business on course, Fleming has also come to wield greater influence at Morgan Stanley. For example, he argued for the bank to scale down its bond-trading risk more aggressively. Colm Kelleher, who heads institutional securities, decided that was the right approach.""I have very high regard for his leadership and his achievement,"" said Masaaki Tanaka, one of two directors who represent Morgan Stanley's biggest shareholder Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc on the board.Tanaka said Fleming had done very well in turning around the wealth business but declined to comment specifically on succession planning.People who have worked with Fleming say he sets the bar high and can be demanding. Subordinates recalled him honing in on the one detail that was missing from a 30-page presentation and emailing round the clock to get updates on projects.Yet they also say he rarely loses his temper. Colleagues who worked with Fleming during the mortgage crisis said they never heard him raise his voice, even during tense negotiations.Friends and adversaries alike describe Fleming using terms like ""Boy Scout"" and ""goodie two-shoes."" One former colleague said Fleming tries to head home by 9:30 p.m., even on nights he is entertaining clients or hosting events. His only brush with the law appears to be a June 2009 speeding ticket. CEO QUALITIES Morgan Stanley's board may eventually promote Fleming to president of the whole bank, effectively anointing him Gorman's successor, some sources said.But Gorman, who is also chairman, has no plans to recommend such a move in the near term. Promoting Fleming could discourage other senior managers, the sources said.Neither the board nor Fleming want to upset his relationship with Kelleher or Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat. Both are also on the board's succession list and work well with Fleming in the current power structure, the sources added.Fleming's next move may come down to who offers him a job he wants first.One close friend and former colleague said Fleming always had his eyes on being a chief executive officer.""And, by the way, I'm not saying that negatively,"" said the person. ""His ambition in life was not to be a star dealmaker or banker. His ambition in life was to become CEO of a large organization.""RISING STAR Still, after a quick ascent up Wall Street's corporate ladder, it has been a relatively long wait for Fleming to get to the corner suite.Fleming joined Merrill Lynch in 1992 from the consulting firm Booz Allen, where he covered financial clients. By 1999, when he was only 35, he had become the head of the investment bank's U.S. financial institutions group.He aggressively courted CEOs at acquisitive banks like First Union and Bank of America Corp who embarked on dozens of mergers in a consolidation streak from the mid-'90s into the 2000s. In 2001, he appeared on the Crain's New York Business list of high achievers under 40. ""I have a lot of confidence,"" he told the magazine. ""It's not arrogance; it's confidence.""Two years later, Fleming had received two more big promotions at Merrill, first to head up investment banking globally and then to be co-president of the entire capital markets unit.He incraesed the investment bank's revenue by 2-1/2 times while running it and personally advised on several landmark deals of the era, including Blackrock's 1999 initial public offering and First Union's $15 billion sale to Wachovia in 2001.""One of the things which clearly stands out about Greg is that he's able to master virtually all the different aspects of a modern financial institution,"" said Sullivan & Cromwell's H. Rodgin Cohen, the preeminent bank lawyer who worked with Fleming on several deals.INTERIM CEO Fleming got his first shot at the top job at a major company soon after Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Stan O'Neal promoted him to co-president of the firm in May 2007.As the financial crisis took hold in the ensuing months, Merrill began disclosing escalating losses from subprime mortgage derivatives that grew to a crushing $45 billion. O'Neal and other executives responsible for the losses were fired.The board effectively made Fleming interim chief executive, but his role was short-lived. It hired John Thain, a former Goldman Sachs executive, to fill the job permanently.Directors decided against Fleming because they felt investors wanted someone who was not associated with the business that generated the losses, a source said. Though Fleming was in charge of the entire unit, the board did not see him as directly responsible for the trading losses. Fleming was routinely shut out of management decisions regarding trading, and his unsolicited advice was ignored by superiors.""While Greg would say he was without fault, the board didn't think the outside world would view it that way,"" the person said. ""The world would've said, 'You're going to put the guy in the job that was responsible for this?'""After helping to negotiate the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America at the height of the crisis, Fleming left Wall Street.He went to teach at Yale Law School, his alma mater, where he has given ethics lessons about cases such as Goldman Sachs' controversial ""Abacus"" derivatives deal and JPMorgan Chase & Co's ""London Whale"" fiasco.FRESH START A person involved with Fleming's hiring at Morgan Stanley said it was not easy to persuade him to return to Wall Street so soon after the crisis. However, unlike many bankers, he was not greedy about pay, this person added.Fleming made as much as $34 million in his best year at Merrill Lynch but earned less than that in his first three years at Morgan Stanley combined.When Fleming arrived in 2010, Morgan Stanley was shifting from being one of Wall Street's premiere investment banks with a retail brokerage unit tacked on, to having wealth management at the center of its profit universe. It was buying Smith Barney in phases and merging it with its own brokerage.The plan to integrate the two businesses was engineered before Fleming arrived, and by most accounts it was going terribly. Clients' historical account information was not being transferred properly, and staff complained about all sorts of technology problems.When Fleming embarked on a cross-country tour of brokerage offices in early 2012, he got an earful from angry employees.""Greg was basically going on a listening tour and got hit in the face with it,"" says Mary Deatherage, a broker based in New Jersey.STRONGEST HORSE He was resilient. Brokers recall him personally fielding complaints ranging from slow email and lack of client birthday reminders to bigger issues like a glitch with portfolio management systems that required a ""SWAT team"" to resolve.""He did that for two or three years with that kind of a focus until an awful lot of the issues were subsiding,"" said Jim Hansberger, a veteran adviser in Atlanta.In early 2013, Fleming announced a plan to invest $500 million in upgrading the unit's technology and hired former Merrill colleague Chris Randazzo to oversee technology.""Greg immediately understood what I was talking about and wanted to get into very detailed discussions around where we are today and where do we need to be in 12 months and 24 months and 36 months and 48 months,"" Randazzo said. ""You don't see that very much from very, very senior executives.""The wealth unit reached its 20 percent pre-tax profit margin goal last year. Management has since raised the goal to a range of 22 to 25 percent by next year if interest rates stay low and markets remain static. If rates rise and markets improve, the margin could be higher, executives say.Fleming is trying to boost revenue further by expanding the asset management business and by lending more, an area where Morgan Stanley lags rivals like Merrill Lynch that are part of big commercial banks.Some of Fleming's associates said that gives him enough to do at Morgan Stanley to bridle his ambition for some time.Meanwhile, he is enjoying spending more time with his wife, Melissa, and their three children. He still teaches a class at Yale, and even found time last year to train for the New York City marathon, completing it in under 3.5 hours.""There's an expression that the strongest horse gets the cart. That's Greg, right?"" said E*TRADE's Nandra, whom Fleming had hired at both Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. ""I can't wait to see him as CEO some place one day, because I know that's who he is.""",2014-02-12,JPM,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 7:00am EST",RPT-INSIGHT-Wall Street's most eligible banker Fleming waits for suitor,http://www.reuters.com//article/morganstanley-fleming-idUSL2N0LG16J20140212?type=companyNews

The company has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $75 million, they added.The sources asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. Oak Hill Capital declined to comment while Jacobson and JPMorgan representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Jacobson is the fourth largest provider of warehousing and third-party logistics services in the United States, according to its website.

Oak Hill Capital then merged Jacobson with another of its portfolio companies called Arnold Logistics LLC. Jacobson said last year it had divested its international logistics business through two separate management buyout transactions.Other private equity deals in the logistics sector in the last two years include Platinum Equity LLC's $750 million takeover of Caterpillar Inc's (CAT.N) logistics services unit in 2012 and Centerbridge Partners LP's minority equity investment in Syncreon Holdings Ltd last year.(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-02-13,JPM,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 4:34pm EST",Oak Hill Capital taps JPMorgan for Jacobson sale: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jacobsoncompanies-sale-idUSBREA1C1XS20140213?type=companyNews

126,"  By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Jennifer AblanFeb 14 Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby's to big retailers Target Corp and Walgreen CoGeneral Motors also became the flavor of the quarter with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly 14 percent, making for a rough start for new Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra.But on Friday, the automaker's stock rose 75 cents, or 2.13 percent, to $35.95.Soros Fund Management LLC, founded by billionaire investor George Soros, purchased new stakes in banking giants J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup in the fourth quarter. Soros also boosted holdings in GM.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings don't disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there's also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.  Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth quarter.JP MORGAN CHASE, CITIGROUP Soros's fund owned about 2.8 million shares of JP Morgan as of December 31, and 2.3 million shares of Citi. Soros held no shares in either bank at the end of the third quarter.SOTHEBY'S Activist investor Marcato Capital Management, run by Mick McGuire, boosted the firm's holdings of Sotheby's by 35 percent, having bought an additional 1,200,000 shares in the auction house to now own 4,562,991.Eric Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management also is a huge fan of Sotheby's, buying an additional 265,000 shares, bringing the firm's stake to 2.2 million shares.FACEBOOK Tiger Consumer Management got back into Facebook after exiting it in the third quarter. The filing shows the fund owned 1,384,507 shares of the social media powerhouse at the end of the fourth quarter. Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors bought an additional 13.9 million class A shares, bringing its stake to 18.3 million class A shares.Scout Capital Management closed out of its position, selling 3 million shares. Scout Capital may be going on a junk food diet, as it liquidated its entire position in Whole Foods  and Starbucks but added 3.9 million shares in Yum! Brands Inc.The fund's owners said last month that they are splitting up and shutting down the $6.7 billion fund after 13 years. Returns were strong at 21 percent last year.GENERAL MOTORS Kyle Bass's Hayman Capital announced in early December that he established a position and that the 4,606,005 million shares he owned made up nearly one quarter of his portfolio.Bridger Capital trimmed its holdings in General Motors Co by selling 155,000 shares, but the fund still owns 1,695,000 shares, which ranks the stock as the fund's fourth largest position.Bronson Point Management, founded by former managers at SAC and Pequot, added to its holding of GM by buying another 400,000 shares, increasing its stake by 34 percent. And Cooperman's Omega added a new position, buying 1.04 million shares of the automaker.Leon Cooperman's Omega added a new position, buying 1.04 million shares, and Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management opened a new stake of 2.74 mln shares.Soros Fund Management held more than 4.9 million shares of GM and more than 1.4 million call options, the filing showed, up from around 1.28 million shares and more than 350,000 call options on September 30. NETFLIX INC Blue Ridge sold all of its Netflix stake, liquidating 349,000 shares of the American provider of on-demand Internet streaming media, while billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn cut his stake by 2.9 million shares, bringing his exposure to 2.7 million shares.Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan's Tiger Global Management bought an additional 223,000 shares, bringing their stake to 663,000 shares.TARGET CORP Carlson Capital took a new position in Target, buying 1.4 million shares only weeks before the retailer made headlines after becoming the victim of computer hackers who stole millions of credit card records.WALGREEN CO Viking Global Investors opened a new stake of 11.6 million shares.

131,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Two senior officials at JPMorgan Chase & Co and predecessor companies repeatedly confronted Bernard Madoff over irregularities in his business, a new lawsuit said, suggesting that bank leaders had ""direct knowledge"" of his Ponzi scheme.The lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday on behalf of shareholders against Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and 12 other current and former executives and directors was based in part by statements made by Madoff himself during a series of interviews.""JPMorgan was uniquely positioned for 20 years to see Madoff's crimes and put a stop to them,"" the lawsuit said.""But faced with the prospect of shutting down Madoff's account and losing lucrative profits,"" it added, ""JPMorgan - at its highest level - chose to turn a blind eye.""JPMorgan spokeswoman Tasha Pelio declined to comment on the lawsuit, one of several seeking to hold bank officials responsible for failing to uncover the fraud before it surfaced publicly in December 2008. Madoff, 75, is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty to fraud in March 2009.TRUSTING MADOFF The revelations came 1-1/2 months after JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion to settle lawsuits over its Madoff dealings.Those lawsuits were brought by the U.S. government; Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC; and other shareholders. Picard has estimated that Madoff customers lost $17.3 billion. The accords included a ""deferred prosecution agreement,"" or DPA, to resolve criminal charges, under which JPMorgan acknowledged its responsibility for failing to stop Madoff, who was an important client of the bank for two decades.Upper management was not implicated in that agreement.But David Rosenfeld, a lawyer who filed the new lawsuit, said ""many hours"" of interviews with Madoff, including in person on October 28 at the federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, suggested that top officials knew of the fraud.""The DPA did not disclose how senior executives at JPMorgan knew that he was engaged in some kind of fraud, and that he should have been shut down years earlier,"" Rosenfeld, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, said in a phone interview. Asked if Madoff could be trusted, Rosenfeld said: ""I think he can. He certainly sounded credible to us, and there is no reason for him to lie at this point. He is remorseful, and he does feel compelled now to do what he can to help his victims. The things he said are also easily verifiable.""Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard, declined to comment. James Margolin, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, declined to comment.DINING WITH MADOFF The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Steamfitters Local 449 Pension Fund in Pittsburgh and Central Laborers' Pension Fund in Jacksonville, Illinois, both shareholders of JPMorgan. According to the complaint, senior bank officials who dealt with Madoff included Walter Shipley, a former chief executive of Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank; and Robert Lipp, a former JPMorgan senior adviser and director.Shipley and Lipp, the complaint said, repeatedly confronted Madoff with ""significant concerns about irregularities"" in his regulatory filings.The lawsuit said JPMorgan examined reports that Madoff was required to produce on the late Norman Levy, a former client of JPMorgan and Madoff, and that the reports gave the impression that Madoff was not investing Levy's money or lending him money on margin.Shipley and Lipp would meet Madoff for lunch from the 1990s through the 2000s, frequently along with Levy, and raise their concerns, the complaint said.But in the end, the bank was ""petrified"" of losing business from Levy, ""an extremely important, preferred top-tier client"" of its private banking unit, the complaint added.Shipley and Lipp did not immediately return calls seeking comment.

133,"  LONDON Feb 20 JPMorgan Chase & Co's  commodity revenues fell 12 percent last year, the bank said in a filing on Thursday, shedding new light on the unit as the bank prepares to sell its physical trading arm to Swiss-based trader Mercuria.The drop in commodity revenues at JPMorgan is the second in two years, and follows tighter restrictions across Wall Street on banks trading with their own money and growing scrutiny of their role in the natural resources supply chain.It said principal transaction revenues in commodities were $2.073 billion in 2013, down from $2.363 billion the previous year and $2.823 billion in 2011, the bank said in its annual 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A bank spokesman declined to comment on the figures.While the data offer a rare glimpse into the bank's large oil, gas, power and metals trading business, they are not considered a definitive indicator.The revenues don't include the cost of operating its commodities trading operation, which has numbered as many as 600 staff in 10 offices globally. The figures also do not distinguish between the physical trading team that JPMorgan is selling and the derivatives activities that it will keep. Banks also say accounting differences mean the outright numbers are not a complete reflection of how they operate their commodity businesses. No Wall Street firm declares the exact profit or loss of individual trading operations.But in commodities, the trajectory has been clear. Total commodity trading revenues on Wall Street have fallen by about two-thirds in the last five years, with the top 10 banks notching just $4.5 billion last year, according to London-based analytics firm Coalition. JPMorgan announced last summer it was selling its vast physical commodities operations, shortly after reaching a $410 settlement with energy regulators in the United States over allegations the bank had manipulated electricity markets.Mercuria, a private commodities dealer run by two former Goldman Sachs oil traders, entered exclusive talks with the bank to buy its physical business two weeks ago. JPMorgan has valued the business at $3.3 billion in documents circulated to potential buyers. The deal value has yet to be agreed and will depend to a large extent on the valuation of large stockpiles of oil and metals the bank holds, one source said.At the end of last year, the bank held $10.2 billion in physical commodities, according to the SEC filing, down from $16 billion at the end of 2012. That includes precious metals like gold and platinum that will not be included in any sale.While the bank is halting its trading of physical oil cargoes and industrial metals, it will continue to trade financial commodity contracts and precious metals for clients.",2014-02-20,JPM,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 2:31pm EST",JPMorgan posts 12 pct decline in '13 commodities revenues-filing,http://www.reuters.com//article/jpmorgan-commodities-idUSL2N0LP22B20140220?type=companyNews
134,"  MADRID Feb 21 Spain's largest cable operator Ono has hired Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan  to coordinate its plans for a stock market flotation, a source with knowledge of the situation said on Friday.Ono, which sells fixed and mobile phone, TV and internet services, has been preparing a 7 billion euro ($9.6 billion)listing to capitalise on strong investor interest in European cable firms.""A number of names have been rumoured, but these two banks have the mandate,"" the source said. Ono declined to comment. The telecoms group will hold a shareholders' meeting on March 13 to formally approve the initial public offering (IPO).Private equity funds Providence Equity Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors and Quadrangle Capital own 54 percent of Ono. Spanish bank Santander holds 4.4 percent. Ono believes it has an enterprise value of around 7 billion euros, including debt worth 3.4 billion euros. Based on this, around 25 percent of the company would float on the stock exchange after the listing, a separate source, who had been briefed on the board's talks, said. Ono's private equity owners had also been approached by Britain's Vodafone with a takeover offer, sources have previously told Reuters.But the company's board decided earlier this month to press on with the IPO plans and did not discuss takeover proposals, putting pressure on potential bidders to up their offers.",2014-02-21,JPM,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 8:24am EST","Spain's Ono hires Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan for IPO - source",http://www.reuters.com//article/spain-ono-idUSL6N0LQ29720140221?type=companyNews
135,"   By David Henry and Peter Rudegeair  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, announced thousands of job cuts on Tuesday as the mortgage lending business slows, and said it was lowering its profitability target.The company said it expected total headcount to fall by 5,000 to 260,000 in 2014. Around 6,000 full-time and contractor jobs in JPMorgan's home loans unit and 2,000 jobs in its branch and credit-card network will be cut. At the same time, the bank expects to add 3,000 new jobs in its control function, including areas like compliance.Speaking at the bank's annual conference with investors, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said the bank could post higher profit, possibly up to $27 billion a year, once short-term interest rates rise. The bank reported $18 billion net income in 2013, but Lake said excluding significant and one-time items its core performance was $23 billion.But because the bank cannot fund as many of its assets with debt, a measure of the profit it generates from equity will likely be lower. In particular, return on tangible common equity will likely be somewhere between 15 percent and 16 percent, down from the bank's prior estimate of 16 percent, Lake said.Even with this lower rate of profitability, Lake said the company believes its shares are now trading at a 20 percent discount to their ""theoretical value."" She also said the company believes it will generate enough excess capital to operate without an additional buffer capital over regulatory requirements.Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told reporters before the conference that the job cuts are part of the adjustments the company has to make continually as its business changes. ""You're always trimming the sails. That's business,"" Dimon said. ""Obviously headcount is coming down in some of the businesses. That is life.""Shares of JPMorgan closed down 1.7 percent at $57.03 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.MORE WEAKNESS IN MORTGAGE, SALES AND TRADING The newly announced job cuts in mortgage banking raise the total number of mortgage cuts the company originally called for by year-end 2014 to 17,000. Many big banks, including Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), have been laying off mortgage workers as higher interest rates in the second half of 2013 made refinancing less attractive to homeowners. Mortgage lending at JPMorgan fell 8 percent in 2013 to $166 billion, but refinancing fell three times as much.Weakness in that business would persist into this year. Mortgage banking Chief Executive Kevin Watters said at the conference the pretax income of JPMorgan's mortgage production business would be negative in 2014.Sales and trading was another business where JPMorgan executives expected weakness in the near-term. Daniel Pinto, co-chief executive of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, said that markets revenues since the start of the year were down 15 percent compared with the same period of 2013.The first quarter is generally the strongest for banks' sales and trading units, and executives did not attribute the lower levels to any specific development.""We don't know exactly why,"" Dimon said, adding that the drop-off in activity did not worry him.The job cuts in the branches and in the credit card network were also up from the 4,000 announced in 2013.Gordon Smith, the head of JPMorgan's consumer bank, said at the conference he expected the number of employees who work in the bank's branches will have declined 20 percent in 2015 from 2011.(Reporting by David Henry and Peter Rudegeair in New York; editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Sofina Mirza-Reid, Chris Reese and Matthew Lewis)",2014-02-25,JPM,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 6:12pm EST","JPMorgan to cut 8,000 jobs, lowers 2014 profit target",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-investorday-idUSBREA1O0X120140225?type=companyNews

144,"   By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Biomet Inc, the U.S. medical device maker that was taken private by a private equity consortium for $11.4 billion in 2007, has hired underwriters for an initial public offering later this year, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The offering could come in the first half of 2014 and raise more than $1 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public.Biomet's owners -- Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity arm, KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) and TPG Capital LP -- have selected Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to lead the IPO, the people said. Blackstone and Biomet did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for TPG, KKR and the banks declined to comment.Founded in 1977, and based in Warsaw, Indiana, Biomet designs, manufacturers and markets products that include dental implants and artificial hips joints. Biomet competes with Smith & Nephew PLC and Stryker Corp (SYK.N). Biomet's buyout was done at the top of the market. But since then the medical device industry was hit during the financial crisis as patients delayed surgery and joint replacements. Pricing pressure for hip and knee replacements has also impacted the sector.Biomet is one of the few remaining large companies taken over by private equity firms during the buyout boom that has not yet gone public. Other large private equity-owned companies that have gone public in the past 12 months include hotel chain Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N), oil and gas company Antero Resources Corp (AR.N) and industrials supply company HD Supply Holdings Inc (HDS.O).Biomet's sales topped $3 billion in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013, up 8 percent from the previous year. Adjusted net income was $368 million, up 46 percent over the same period.(Reporting by Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim in New York; Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in Berlin; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-02-26,JPM,"Wed Feb 26, 2014 | 3:45pm EST","Exclusive: Biomet picks BAML, Goldman, JPMorgan to lead IPO - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-biomet-ipo-idUSBREA1P1Y020140226?type=companyNews

147,"  (Corrects quote to $$$$$$$ instead of ??????? in 12th paragraph.)By Richard WeizelNEW HAVEN, Conn. Feb 25 Jesse Litvak, a former trader at Jefferies Group Inc, made extra commissions and profits by defrauding big Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co and AllianceBernstein Holding LP on bond trades, a U.S. Treasury Department agent testified at Litvak's fraud trial.The testimony came as Litvak's lawyers filed a request to dismiss the case, saying the government had failed to prove any crimes were committed.Chief Judge Janet Hall of the U.S. District Court in New Haven, Connecticut, said outside the jury's presence that she would not rule immediately.Prosecutors are expected to finish presenting their case on Wednesday after U.S. Special Agent James O'Connor, a senior white collar crime investigator and former FBI agent who testified on Tuesday, leaves the witness stand.Litvak's lawyer, Patrick Smith, said he may need three days to offer a defense, meaning that closing arguments could be made next week.Litvak, 39, went on trial last week, accused of defrauding investors in a more than $2 million scheme by lying and misrepresenting the prices of trades on mortgage-backed securities.The case is crucial to the government, the first brought under a 2009 law banning major fraud against the United States through the $700 billion federal bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.In seeking to dismiss the case, lawyers for Litvak said the government failed to prove that their client intended to defraud anyone, made any alleged material misstatements, committed a major fraud against the United States, or made false statements that could support a guilty verdict. O'Connor told jurors on Tuesday that at the prosecutors' request he reviewed emails to and from Litvak over bond trades.    One such exchange occurred on May 5, 2010 between Litvak and a JPMorgan representative, he said.""It just sucks. I can't even win when I win,"" Litvak wrote, according to O'Connor. ""Don't have to tell you how hard it is the buy bonds right.""""Sorry buddy, but just think how much $$$$$$$ you are making,"" the JPMorgan representative replied.""But I want more $$$$$$$"" Litvak responded. ""This is torture.""Prosecutors then presented charts on various deals in 2009 and 2010 that they said show how Litvak routinely told clients he was buying bonds at one price, only to then sell them for significantly higher prices, and collect the profits. The government said the charts showed that Litvak made nearly $400,000 in extra profit in one deal alone, more than $71,000 in another trade, and $44,500 in a third.O'Connor told Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis that the charts reflected the ""actual profit difference"" that Litvak was realizing on his trades.UNFAMILIAR WITH TERMINOLOGY Under cross-examination by Smith, O'Connor conceded he had been unfamiliar with some terminology used in bond trading before getting involved in the case. Hall abruptly dismissed jurors for the day as Smith questioned O'Connor about his familiarity with trading jargon. ""It's wrong to question this agent about what these words mean; he's not an expert witness in that area,"" she said.Smith has repeatedly said that while his client lied and misled investors on bond trades, the government cannot prove a crime was committed.Some witnesses have previously testified that some of Litvak's activities were considered common practices in the industry, as the defense has suggested.Among the defense witnesses expected to be called is Johan Eveland, a Jefferies managing director.Litvak worked for Jefferies in its Stamford, Connecticut, office from 2008 until he was fired in December 2011.He was arrested in January 2013, and now faces criminal charges on 10 counts of securities fraud, four counts of making false statements and one count of fraud connected to TARP.Litvak has pleaded not guilty, and faces up to 20 years in prison on each securities fraud count if convicted. He also faces a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit.Jefferies is now part of Leucadia National Corp. Neither firm was charged.The cases are U.S. v. Litvak, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 13-cr-00019; and SEC v. Litvak in the same court, No. 13-00132.

151,"   By Natalie Harrison and Lynn Adler  NEW YORK, Feb 28 (IFR/RLPC) - JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon delivered a confident message at the bank's global high-yield conference this week, telling attendees it would be no more cautious than any other Wall Street bank when it comes to lending, according to investors present at the event.But the bank's decision not to extend a revolving credit facility for Freescale Semiconductor earlier this month, a move confirmed by two market sources, appeared to send a very different message to the market.It was deemed an unusual decision mainly because revolvers are usually private deals with relationship banks. By not extending the maturity of the revolver, JP Morgan  passed up fees, which some bankers said did not make sense as it still had to honor the existing facility.JP Morgan declined to comment.The revolver got done - and at a larger size. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Morgan Stanley all committed to the deal, which was increased by up to USD50m to a total of up to USD450m.The decision demonstrates how carefully banks are scrutinizing which loans, and how many, they will commit to - and there is clearly a ripple effect from the leveraged lending guidance issued about a year ago by regulators.Some reckon JP Morgan made the correct bet on Freescale, which was taken private by sponsors Blackstone, Carlyle, TPG and Permira in 2006 in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts of all time.Although the company listed five years later, its leverage remains high.""You could say JP Morgan has been smart,"" said one senior banker at a rival bank. ""Maybe it made a judgment and thought the company was not a big client, and therefore, not worth doing. The bank's the largest underwriter of leveraged loans in the market, so this is only natural.""Freescale and its private equity owners were either not immediately available or declined to comment. SUBSTANDARD REPORT CARD The rationale behind JP Morgan's decision, the sources said, was that the loan could have been considered ""substandard"" - one of the definitions that regulators have applied to ""criticized"" or ""non-pass"" loans under their guidelines.Another category - ""special mention"" - is more common. Considered less risky, those loans are also less likely to rile regulators, bankers said.""It's a bit like a report card. If you're going to have bad marks, you'd rather have more Bs than Cs,"" said the banker. ""The Freescale revolver, a C grade, was substandard already."" A loan may be criticized if companies are not able to amortize or repay all of their senior debt from free cashflow or half of their total debt in five to seven years. Leverage levels exceeding six times debt to Ebitda after asset sales are also viewed as problematic.According to Moody's latest report on Freescale, even after it pays down debt with proceeds of a recent share offering, adjusted debt to Ebitda will still remain in the low seven times range.The guidelines aim to prevent a return to reckless underwriting practices, but until recently the market believed regulators would be more focused on new leveraged buyouts. In fact, the implications of the greater scrutiny are far wider than that.""The guidance does capture refinancing, though not necessarily an amendment,"" said Tess Virmani, assistant general counsel at the Loan Syndications and Trading Association.The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller were either not immediately available or declined to comment. FRUSTRATION BUILDS Even so, some argued JP Morgan was being too conservative, and said its decision was more about the bank wanting to be seen to be toeing the line, and a desire to keep out of the headlines after paying a USD13bn fine last year to settle multiple government claims over dealings in mortgage securities.""When he was asked at the conference whether JP Morgan would react differently because of its recent issues, Dimon said he expected all banks to behave the same,"" said one investor who attended the leveraged finance gathering in Miami.There is, nonetheless, growing annoyance among bankers who are convinced that regulators have not thought through the whole process.""They have said that they don't want us to stop lending to companies that are in trouble and need financing. But there are lots of grey areas, and it's very frustrating,"" said the banker.How this will all play out remains to be seen. The regulators publish report cards on banks' loans in what is known as a Shared National Credits Program to help communicate what are, and what are not, quality loans.The SNC last year showed criticized and classified assets remained at elevated levels at 10% and 6.2% respectively in 2013. The volume of criticized assets increased 2.4% to USD302bn, but as a percentage of total commitments, the criticized asset rate fell from the year before.One banker said it would be interesting to see the reaction to fines doled out if banks are too reckless. Others said that fines were unlikely.""I don't think the punishment will be fines. There are lots of ways for regulators to turn up the heat. Just coming into the bank to meet the risk people, and telling them they are unhappy would be enough to get banks to stop,"" said a banker.",2014-02-28,JPM,"Fri Feb 28, 2014 | 1:47pm EST",JP Morgan call on Freescale adds confusion,http://www.reuters.com//article/leveragedlending-freescale-idUSL6N0LX2TB20140228?type=companyNews

157,"   By Jonathan Stempel | March 7  March 7 A whistleblower will be paid $63.9 million for providing tips that led to JPMorgan Chase & Co's  agreement to pay $614 million and tighten oversight to resolve charges that it defrauded the government into insuring flawed home loans.The payment to the whistleblower, Keith Edwards, was disclosed in a filing on Friday with the U.S. district court in Manhattan that formally ended the case.In the Feb. 4 settlement, JPMorgan admitted that for more than a decade it submitted thousands of mortgages for insurance by the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs that did not qualify for government guarantees.JPMorgan also admitted that it had failed to tell the agencies that its own internal reviews had turned up problems.The government said it ultimately had to cover millions of dollars of losses after some of the bank's loans went sour, resulting in evictions and foreclosures nationwide. David Wasinger, a lawyer for Edwards, did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.About $56.5 million of Edwards' award concerns the FHA portion of the case, and $7.4 million concerns the VA portion. It is unclear how much of the award will go to his lawyer. Edwards, a Louisiana resident, had worked for JPMorgan or its predecessors from 2003 to 2008, and had been an assistant vice president supervising a government insuring unit.He originally sued in January 2013 under the federal False Claims Act, which lets individuals sue government contractors and suppliers for allegedly defrauding taxpayers.

158,"   By Manuela D'Alessandro | MILAN  MILAN A Milan appeals court has acquitted four international banks, including JPMorgan and UBS, found guilty in an earlier trial of mis-selling derivatives to the city of Milan.Depfa Bank, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and UBS had appealed against a landmark verdict from December 2012 ordering the seizure of 89 million euros ($123 million) and fines of 1 million euros for each of the banks.The original trial was the first of its kind in Italy, where hundreds of local governments entered opaque and risky derivatives deals that turned sour. Many of them have since taken lenders to court to solve their disputes.The appeals court said on Friday that the four banks had no case to answer. It cancelled the fines and seizure of funds, and also acquitted nine bank employees who had been handed suspended jail sentences of up to eight months.

More banks will be signed up as bookrunners, the people added.BC Partners and Com Hem declined to comment, as did JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Rothschild.The people said Com Hem could be worth up to around 22 billion Swedish crowns including debt.

In Denmark, outsourcing firm ISS closed up 14 percent on its first day of trading on Thursday compared to the price set in the IPO.Com Hem made EBITDA earnings of 2.2 billion crowns in 2013 on revenues of 4.4 billion and employs around 950 people.Almost 40 percent of Swedish households are connected to Com Hem's network, and it has more than 600,000 digital TV customers according to its website.BC Partners bought Com Hem in 2011 from private equity groups Carlyle and Providence for around $2.6 billion.

166,"   By Nelson Bocanegra | BOGOTA, March 19  BOGOTA, March 19 Colombia's peso staged its strongest rally in six months after investment bank J.P. Morgan announced on Wednesday it will boost the weighting of the country's peso-denominated debt in two closely followed emerging market bond indexes.In a note circulated to investors, J.P. Morgan said it will introduce five new Colombian Treasury bonds, known as TES, in its GBI-EM Global Diversified and GBI-EM Global indexes.The new instruments -  maturing in 2016, 2018, 2022, 2024 and 2028 - will be included in a phased approach over five month-end periods, starting on May 30 and ending on Sept. 30, it said.Generally, an increased weighting of a country in major indexes leads to more investment in that nation's securities since investment fund managers are often judged against the benchmarks.""COP (the Colombian peso) and TES bonds staged a huge rally after (the J.P. Morgan) announcement,"" Citibank said in a note. ""The weight increase should generate very significant inflows into TES bonds. "" Colombia's peso strengthened 1.17 percent on Wednesday to 2007 to the dollar while public debt appreciated across the entire maturity curve. It was the peso's strongest appreciation since Sept. 19 last year.In announcing the move to boost Colombia's weighting in the indexes, J.P. Morgan cited ""improved transparency and accessibility for international investors in the local TES market."" As a result, the bank said Colombia's participation in J.P. Morgan's GBI-EM Global Diversified index will rise to 8 percent up from 3.2 percent previously and in the GBI-EM Global, it will increase to 5.6 percent from 1.8 percentOn March 3, the director of public credit, Michel Janna, told Reuters in an interview that the country was preparing reforms to boost sales of its debt to foreign investors.Janna was referring to the need to make an even deeper cut to the tax foreigners pay on earnings from debt investments even after it was slashed to 14 percent from the start of 2013, down from 33 percent previously. That cut raised the proportion of Colombia's debt in foreign hands to around 7 percent up from 2 percent in 2012, still a comparatively low figure for the region, Janna said. He added foreign ownership of Mexican and Peruvian debt is between 40 and 50 percent.Janna considers 15 to 20 percent a desirable level of foreign ownership of the country's public debt.Colombia's increased weighting may come at the expense of the that of Turkey, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hungary, the announcement from the bank warned.The TES bonds that will be introduced in the bank's indexes expire on June 2016, November 2018, May 2022, July 2024 and April 2028.

168,"  U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. has sold its physical commodities arm to Mercuria for $3.5 billion in cash, catapulting the Swiss trade house into the top tier of commodities traders.While parts of JPMorgan's commodities business have passed through the hands of some of the most well-known names in the raw materials markets, its core is comprised of two enterprises considered among the most successful of their time: Sempra Commodities and Bear Stearns' power and gas desk.But major parts of the JPMorgan business were extracted from the ashes of failure, including a base metals operation that endured through the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the Enron meltdown, and a trading platform that dates back to the days of failed investment bank Drexel Burnham.More recently, much of the business had already been bought and sold twice in the past five years, once when Royal Bank of Scotland bought a 51 percent stake in Sempra Commodities and then again when RBS was forced to sell it to JPMorgan.A partial history of the business is below:THE EARLY YEARS 1980s - Drexel Burnham Lambert expands into physical energy trading, hiring a team that includes future Sempra chiefs David Messer and Frank Gallipoli.1986 - UK-based warehousing group Henry Bath & Sons is taken over by Metallgesellschaft (MG), a huge German conglomerate and one of the world's largest physical and futures metal traders, according to a history on its website. r.reuters.com/myk56vEarly 1990 - AIG acquires the commodity trading business of Drexel Burnham, which had filed for bankruptcy.1997 - Pacific Enterprises and Enova Corp acquire the energy unit of AIG Trading for $225 million. (The utilities merge one year later to form Sempra Energy)2000 - Enron buys UK-listed MG Plc, including Henry Bath warehouses, for $448 million. ENRON OUT, OTHERS JUMP IN 2002 - Sempra Energy Trading buys Enron Metals Ltd, the former-MG metals division of the failed U.S. Enron for $145 million. r.reuters.com/kyk56v2002 - UBS buys Enron's energy trading business in exchange for royalties to Enron creditors. The deal includes leases to several million barrels of oil storage in Canada.2004 - Sempra Energy Trading is renamed Sempra Commodities. By 2005, the unit contributes more than half of parent company Sempra's net income; makes over half a billion dollars in 2007.September 2005 - Bear Stearns moves into energy trading through a joint-venture with Calpine.

169,"  (Updates Feb. 5 timeline with sale of commodities business to Mercuria)March 19 U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. has sold its physical commodities arm to Mercuria for $3.5 billion in cash, catapulting the Swiss trade house into the top tier of commodities traders.While parts of JPMorgan's commodities business have passed through the hands of some of the most well-known names in the raw materials markets, its core is comprised of two enterprises considered among the most successful of their time: Sempra Commodities and Bear Stearns' power and gas desk.But major parts of the JPMorgan business were extracted from the ashes of failure, including a base metals operation that endured through the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the Enron meltdown, and a trading platform that dates back to the days of failed investment bank Drexel Burnham.More recently, much of the business had already been bought and sold twice in the past five years, once when Royal Bank of Scotland bought a 51 percent stake in Sempra Commodities and then again when RBS was forced to sell it to JPMorgan.A partial history of the business is below:THE EARLY YEARS 1980s - Drexel Burnham Lambert expands into physical energy trading, hiring a team that includes future Sempra chiefs David Messer and Frank Gallipoli.1986 - UK-based warehousing group Henry Bath & Sons is taken over by Metallgesellschaft (MG), a huge German conglomerate and one of the world's largest physical and futures metal traders, according to a history on its website. r.reuters.com/myk56vEarly 1990 - AIG acquires the commodity trading business of Drexel Burnham, which had filed for bankruptcy.1997 - Pacific Enterprises and Enova Corp acquire the energy unit of AIG Trading for $225 million. (The utilities merge one year later to form Sempra Energy )2000 - Enron buys UK-listed MG Plc, including Henry Bath warehouses, for $448 million.ENRON OUT, OTHERS JUMP IN  2002 - Sempra Energy Trading buys Enron Metals Ltd, the former-MG metals division of the failed U.S. Enron for $145 mln. r.reuters.com/kyk56v2002 - UBS buys Enron's energy trading business in exchange for royalties to Enron creditors. The deal includes leases to several million barrels of oil storage in Canada.2004 - Sempra Energy Trading is renamed Sempra Commodities. By 2005, the unit contributes more than half of parent company Sempra's net income; makes over half a billion dollars in 2007.September 2005 - Bear Stearns moves into energy trading through a joint-venture with Calpine. Deal ends six months later, but Bear Stearns continues to expand in the power and gas markets.November 2006 - Bear Stearns buys Delta Power Co., a private power-plant developer with 1,380 megawatts of capacity.

In another positive report, jobless claims rose less than expected in the latest week.The data ""shows that fundamentals are getting stronger every day, and that strength is getting firmer,"" said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York.

She estimated the ""considerable period"" between the end of the Fed's stimulus and its first rate increase at possibly six months. Analysts widely expected a hike in the second half of 2015.""We're trying to decipher her timeframe and get ahead of it,"" Davis said. ""While we didn't make any drastic changes to our positions as a result of what she said, we have a tight watch on her to figure out how she'll play her hand.""

President Barack Obama announced sanctions on Thursday against prominent Russians, including close allies of President Vladimir Putin, as Moscow raced to complete its annexation of Crimea and built up its forces in the region.

177,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON, March 21  WASHINGTON, March 21 The U.S. derivatives regulator on Friday gave European trading platforms more time to register and meet strict new rules to make the market more transparent, in anticipation of comparable rules abroad.The delay was issued by the agency in a so-called no-action letter after an agreement the Commodity Futures Trading Commission struck with the European Union in February, which will in practice affect firms in London only.The CFTC at the time said it expected the UK's Financial Conduct Authority to have rules comparable to its own in place by March 24, and that foreign companies would be granted relief from its rules, if they so requested. The platforms to trade swaps now have until May 14 to register, or so much earlier as the agency finds they have signed up with a European regulator with comparable rules.The CFTC also said it would adjust the conditions companies would have to meet, and that it would elaborate on that in another statement expected next week. The CFTC last year publicly argued with the European Union as it sought broad sway over foreign companies doing business with U.S. clients or trading out of U.S. offices. It has also been sued by U.S. banks over so-called cross-border rules. The banks argue that the United States has no jurisdiction over what they do abroad.The February decision had been anticipated by London firms, which do the bulk of the business with U.S. banks. Only swaps broker ICAP had sent in registration paperwork for its London unit to avoid any risk of noncompliance.The $630 trillion global swaps market, which was at the center of the 2007-09 financial crisis, is dominated by large investment banks such as Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase & Co and Citigroup.

186,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP poached one of Jamie Dimon's closest aides, Michael Cavanagh, from JPMorgan Chase & Co on Tuesday, in a surprise hire that reflects both the increasing prominence of so-called shadow banking and the regulatory challenges faced by banks.Cavanagh, 48, who was co-head of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, will become the co-president and co-chief operating officer of Carlyle, as the alternative asset manager puts its own succession plan in place. He will also join Carlyle's executive board.He will share both new titles with Carlyle veteran Glenn Youngkin, 47, who has until now been sole chief operating officer.Cavanagh's departure is a blow to Dimon, and sources familiar with the situation said the move came as a surprise to senior bank executives. Dimon hired Cavanagh more than two decades ago and has worked with him ever since. In recent years, Cavanagh, who was also a member of the bank's operating committee, had come to be seen as one of the potential successors to the JPMorgan chairman and CEO. Daniel Pinto, who had the same role as Cavanagh, was named sole CEO of JPMorgan's corporate and investment banking division.Cavanagh's move underscores the challenges banks face in retaining talent amid an onslaught of regulations in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which have complicated bank managers' jobs and reduced their pay.Several other long-time bankers, such as former JPMorgan executives Jes Staley and Steven Black, have moved in recent years to private equity, hedge funds and other more lightly regulated corners of high finance, broadly referred to as shadow banking. The sector offers executives more business opportunities as banks pull back, as well as higher pay.Carlyle's founders - David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello - each received $92.9 million in dividends and salaries in 2013. They also received $108.1 million, $252.8 million and $109.5 million, respectively, from Carlyle's funds in 2013 as a result of investing alongside the firm's clients. By comparison, Dimon was paid $20 million for 2013, with $18.5 million of that coming in restricted stock.Cavanagh told Dimon over the weekend that he was considering the job after having been approached by Carlyle earlier this year, one of the sources said. The increased demands from changing regulations and JPMorgan's myriad problems in recent years with regulators were factors that played into Cavanagh's decision, the source added.Over the past two years, new people have moved into seven of nine key positions at JPMorgan, according to a count by analyst Mike Mayo of CLSA. Cavanagh, Mayo said, ""was a familiar face in a shuffled deck.""Cavanagh, the source added, was not tired of waiting in the wings to become chief executive, as Dimon, one of the longest-serving U.S. bank CEOs, shows no signs of stepping down. Cavanagh will be on ""gardening leave"" at JPMorgan until he joins Carlyle in the summer. Gardening leave is the typical cooling-off period that senior executives go through when they switch jobs, allowing them to receive their salary while not actively carrying out their duties.JPMORGAN SUCCESSION The decision marks a major career move for Cavanagh, who went to work for Dimon at age 26 at Smith Barney. The brokerage was one of the companies that Dimon's mentor, Sandy Weill, would roll up into Citigroup Inc. Dimon personally interviewed Cavanagh for the job, according to the source.After Weill fired Dimon, Cavanagh followed him to Chicago-based Bank One Corp and then on to JPMorgan.Cavanagh was tasked in 2012 with overseeing the bank's internal investigation of the derivatives loss that became known as the ""London Whale"" trades. Before taking his current role at JPMorgan's investment banking arm, Cavanagh headed the unit that manages JPMorgan's cash for corporations and keeps securities in custody for large money managers. Earlier, he served as chief financial officer.""While we would prefer he stay at the firm, we are glad he is going to a valued client in Carlyle,"" Dimon said.With Cavanagh's departure, the most obvious successors to 58-year-old Dimon from within JPMorgan include Pinto and Chief Operating Officer Matthew Zames, 43, according to sources inside the bank.Zames got his current job after Dimon dispatched the former bond trading executive to salvage the London Whale derivatives portfolio and to overhaul the bank's Chief Investment Office where the bad trades were made.Other possible in-house successors include Gordon Smith, 55, the CEO for the consumer bank, which accounts for about half of the company, and Mary Erdoes, chief executive of asset management.

190,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s  (JPM) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and short-term IDR at 'F1'.  Fitch has also affirmed JPM's viability rating (VR) at 'a+', its support rating  at '1', and its support rating floor (SRF) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with a review of support for  banks globally and also as part of a periodic review of the Global Trading and  Universal Banks, which comprise 12 large and globally active banking groups.  Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable on balance. Earnings pressure in  securities businesses and continued conduct and regulatory risks present in the  GTUBs are offset by stronger balance sheets as capitalisation and liquidity  remain sound. Fitch forecasts stronger GDP growth in most economies, which  should contribute to a more balanced operating environment, but the operating  environment is likely to remain challenging in 2014. Today's rating actions assume that JPM will perform adequately under the CCAR  stress test, though Fitch has no visibility into any potential qualitative  rejections for JPM, or any of the other 29 banks subject to regulatory stress  testing. Although a qualitative rejection of a capital plan request under CCAR  would be viewed negatively, it is not expected to have any rating implications  for JPM. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying earnings capacity of  the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing international  franchise, and progress made toward achieving compliance with heightened capital  and liquidity requirements. The affirmation also reflects the firm's strong  funding flexibility, given its deposit raising capabilities and uninterrupted  access to the global capital markets through an economic cycle.  JPM's Basel III tier 1 common equity ratio improved from an estimated 8.7% at  year-end 2012 to 9.5% at year-end 2013, which is in-line with management's  target but lower than the peer average. Capital improvements have been supported  by growth in retained earnings and modest reductions in risk-weighted assets,  due largely to non-core portfolio run-off. Management is targeting a ratio of  10% by the end of 2014 and 10%-10.5% longer-term, which Fitch believes is  prudent, given the 9.5% minimum requirement. Fitch believes JPM is well  positioned to maintain compliance with Basel III capital requirements, even with  its higher G-SIFI loss absorbing buffer, given the superior earnings capacity of  the bank. Fitch believes progress on compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio  (SLR) will extend into 2015, as certain structural adjustments are required for  the bank to reach a ratio of 6%. JPM converted some intercompany debt into  equity during the fourth quarter, which contributed to a 40 basis point increase  in the bank's SLR, to 4.7% at year-end. However, the conversion yielded an  increase in the firm's double leverage to approximately 1.17 times (x), which  Fitch believes is high, relative to historical standards. Further increases in  double leverage would be viewed negatively. Fitch expects JPM to achieve full  compliance with all regulatory requirements, well ahead of required  implementation, which for SLR is 2018.  The bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $522 billion of high quality  liquid assets at Dec. 31, 2013, up from $341 billion a year earlier. Fitch  believes the growth was largely driven by JPM's efforts to accelerate compliance  with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which has been achieved. Additionally,  clarity regarding the direction of the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) was  released in a consultative document in January, and JPM believes it is currently  compliant with the requirements, which Fitch views favorably.    Earnings performance has been highly resilient, particularly on a relative  basis, as the company remained profitable throughout the financial crisis and  continued to post relatively solid returns despite the recognition of over $11.1  billion of legal expenses in 2013. This is a testament to the company's broad  and diverse franchise. The firm had another strong year on a core basis in 2013.  Fitch estimates that pre-tax earnings were essentially flat, on an adjusted  basis, as weaker mortgage performance was offset by reduced provision expenses  and stronger asset management revenue. Core operating expenses remained  relatively flat, with efficiency measures funding higher costs associated with  the control agenda.  JPM made significant progress settling a variety of outstanding litigation  during 2013 and early 2014, which Fitch views as a positive step in moving  beyond the headline issues stemming from the financial crisis. Legal costs are  likely to remain elevated in coming quarters, but Fitch expects the incremental  impact to earnings will be manageable. Still, the emergence of material and  unexpected litigation losses could alter the agency's view, particularly given  where the firm's current capitalization ratios compare to the broader peer  group.  The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating consistency,  although Fitch believes credit costs will become a growing headwind, as asset  quality metrics rise from historical lows, and earnings are likely to continue  to be challenged by relatively low interest rates. A continued focus on  operational improvements is expected to offset the impact to some extent.  Investment banking results will remain dependent upon market conditions, but  JPM's strong market position and diverse product offering should yield  peer-superior performance.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to deliver earnings  growth, particularly in light of the current regulatory environment. Higher  capital charges and what remains difficult market conditions present a challenge  for all GTUBs, which may be encouraged to seek more aggressive ways to generate  profits that take advantage of regulatory changes. However, Fitch expects that  JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity risk management, and product diversity  mitigate some of these concerns. Negative rating actions could result from reputational damage that impacts the  firms market position and/or material asset quality weakening which pressures  JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital, deterioration in liquidity  levels, material and unexpected litigation losses, and/or failure to  sufficiently address weaknesses noted in regulatory consent orders and internal  reviews following material losses in the chief investment office. Further,  significant risk management or operational failures that result in material  losses to the firm could also result in a negative rating action. Fitch considers JPM's ratings to be particularly sensitive to the degree and  scope of litigation risk going forward. Fitch recognizes that the large  litigation charge taken during the third quarter of 2013 reflects JPM's desire  to address outstanding legal issues, related largely to mortgage. To the extent  JPM enters into any new and material litigation settlements, Fitch will consider  whether these effectively diminish ongoing legal risks. Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the foreseeable  future given that its current rating level is among the highest of its peer  group and of the global bank universe.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF JPM's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's  expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of support from the  U.S. government ('AAA'/Outlook Stable) if required. This expectation reflects  the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its  strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain.  Specific to JPM, Fitch's view of support likelihood is based mostly on its  systemic importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness given its size  and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share and  its position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy. JPM's  IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support because JPM's VR is  above its SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments.  KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise JPM's  Support Rating to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' within the next one to two  years, likely to be some point in late 2014 or 1H15.  A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would mean no change to JPM's Long-term IDR  and debt ratings because JPM's viability rating is above the SRF.  KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk profiles. Their ratings are  primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of JPM or its bank subsidiaries.  KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS JPM's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by JPM and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in JPM's IDR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY  JPM's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries.  Common equity double leverage rose in late 2013 as the firm converted certain  intercompany debt into equity during the fourth quarter to boost the bank's SLR  ratio. Double leverage is at the high-end of the peer group, at 1.17x at Dec.  31, 2013. Fitch would view further increases in double leverage negatively.  KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs and VRs are equalized  across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) is a wholly owned subsidiary  that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and is considered core to JPM's business.  As a result its IDR is equalized with that of its parent JPM. Bear Stearns  Companies, LLC and JPMorgan Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent guarantee and  therefore their IDRs are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized Commercial Paper  Co., LLC's short-term IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the amounts payable  by the repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its short-term IDR is equalized with  that of JPMS. Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's short-term IDR is  based on the repo seller, JPMS's ST IDR.  JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.4 trillion in total  assets and $17.9 billion of net income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013.

197,"  HONG KONG, March 31 Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency searched an office belonging to a top JPMorgan Chase & Co  banker in the city who recently resigned, amid a U.S. investigation into the bank's hiring practices, according to media reports.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on March 26 searched the office of Fang Fang, JPMorgan's outgoing chief executive officer for China investment banking, seizing computer records and documents, according to the reports.On March 24, an internal memo said Fang would leave the firm but gave no reason for his resignation. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported Fang's departure, said he had emerged as a key figure for U.S. authorities as they investigate whether the investment bank violated bribery laws by improperly hiring the relatives of well-connected Chinese officials.

JPMorgan has withdrawn from underwriting a $3 billion Hong Kong listing by China Everbright Bank Co Ltd - one of two China initial public offerings it has stopped working on while the investigation is being carried out.Other firms that have come under scrutiny for their hiring practices in Asia include Citigroup, Goldman Sachs  and Morgan Stanley.

198,"   By Josephine Mason and Jonathan Leff | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In teaming up with Cargill to create the world's largest sugar trader last week, Brazil's Copersucar has joined a small but growing club of national resource champions steadily transforming the commodities landscape.In the boldest international move in its 50-plus-year history, the world's top sugar producer will form a 50-50 joint venture with global trading powerhouse Cargill, plugging its 47 sugar mills into one of the world's biggest logistical operations, with customers stretching from Chicago to China.It was a blockbuster deal for the global sugar market, but perhaps even more importantly it opened up a new path for other state-owned or nationally powerful commodity producers, those with domestic strongholds and international ambitions.From Russia to China, Brazil to Saudi Arabia, national giants are going global at an accelerating pace, eager to squeeze more profit from the lucrative global commodities supply chain - a trend that, until now, threatened to crowd out the global merchants who have long dominated international trade.Some are simply buying what they want, such as Russian oil firm Rosneft's purchase of Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) physical oil business; others like PetroChina (601857.SS), which has been looking to hire traders in Houston, are building it organically.They are racing in amid once-a-generation reshuffling of commodity industry investors, with many global banks bailing out of the market due to regulatory pressure. The grab for market share could last for years, experts say.""It's a game of musical chairs and the seats are getting much more valuable,"" said Chip Register, a long-time commodity executive, currently at Sapient Global Markets.""For anyone who's got the capital and the interest, it's a land grab.""SAME AIM, DIFFERENT ROUTES  While the aim is the same, the routes to success vary and in just the past three months, companies have several different approaches: buy a business wholesale, secure strategic assets piecemeal, and go it alone with their own shop.Copersucar, a collective of 47 privately held mills steeped in Brazil's agricultural roots, has entered uncharted territory by agreeing to a 50-50 joint venture that excludes any physical assets - keeping control over the most strategic parts of its business while leveraging Cargill's global network.While similar arrangements are not unusual in other niches of the soft commodity markets, none come close in terms of scale, scope and the half-and-half corporate structure.The deal arrived just two years after Copersucar launched a global expansion, opening its first offices in Hong Kong and the United States, the world's two largest consuming markets. The deal is a lower-risky, lower-cost way to catapult the Brazilian enterprise into the top league of the fiercely competitive sugar trade, avoiding the expense and execution risk of buying a company or hiring expertise, experts said.But it still presents challenges.

Martin-Artajo who lives in Spain, has been fighting extradition. Both men deny wrongdoing. Last year, JPMorgan agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle U.S. and British regulatory probes into the London Whale losses and admitted wrongdoing.Grout, who ceased working for JPMorgan in London in December 2012, has been out of work since then, his lawyers said in court papers. He moved into his parents' country home in France in July 2013, the lawyers wrote.He and Martin-Artajo were indicted in September on charges including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.

He and Martin-Artajo were indicted in September on charges including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.Edward Little, another lawyer for Grout, said after Wednesday's hearing that the U.S. government was not open to allowing his client to return to France during trial.Little also said he might follow a suggestion Daniels made at the hearing to ask the judge overseeing the criminal case, U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield, to weigh in on the bail dispute.A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara declined comment.The cases in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v.

210,"   By David Henry and Anna Louie Sussman | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Blythe Masters, one of Wall Street's most powerful women, is leaving JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM.N) after a 27-year career that began as an intern in London and concludes with the sale of the multibillion-dollar commodities business she built.Masters, who turned 45 in late March, will leave the bank in a few months after assisting with the sale of its physical energy and metals business to Swiss merchant Mercuria. Many observers had not expected her to remain with the business after its sale, although her future with JPMorgan was less clear.She will take ""time off"" and ""consider future opportunities,"" according to a memo bank executives sent to employees on Wednesday.Once a rising star within JPMorgan and credited with having helped create credit derivatives in the early 1990s, Masters' career took a much rockier turn in recent years as she got caught up in a regulatory inquiry and struggled to extract profits from the commodities operation.She began her career at JPMorgan as an intern in London before entering Cambridge University, where she studied economics. She joined the commodities desk in 1991 after graduating, and later moved to the bank's derivatives desk, where she was considered a derivatives wunderkind.She is known for having been part of the team that pioneered structured finance instruments which others on Wall Street took to excesses that fueled the U.S. housing bubble and set up the financial crisis of 2008. After serving for several years as chief financial officer of the investment bank, Masters took the reins of the commodities desk in 2006 as interim head.While the bank had been a sizeable player in commodities in the 1990s, with a global oil trading division led at the time by Masters' ex-husband, Danny Masters, it hadn't delved as deeply into the sector as investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and had scaled back after facing regulatory scrutiny in metals markets toward the turn of the century.That changed with the acquisition of Bear Stearns in March 2008, which gave the bank a large physical power and gas business for the first time. With Masters at the helm, JPMorgan would go on to buy parts of UBS's UBSN.VX commodity business after the Swiss bank decided to get out of the sector at the height of the financial crisis. That was followed by the jewel in the JPMorgan commodities crown, the purchase of physically-focused RBS Sempra in 2010.By August 2010, Masters was telling employees that Goldman and Morgan Stanley should be ""scared"" of JPMorgan's newly-expanded commodity operation, Bloomberg reported at the time.SECTOR TURNS  But more recently regulatory problems began to pile up. In 2013, the bank paid $410 million to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to settle allegations of power market manipulation in California.While Masters was not cited for any wrongdoing, her name is referenced in the regulator's order a number of times. The bank neither admitted nor denied any violations in the case.Meanwhile regulators were turning a sharper eye on all of Wall Street's involvement in the raw materials supply chain, with the Federal Reserve questioning whether commercial banks like JPMorgan should be allowed to trade physical commodities.Commodities trading, once considered a blockbuster billion-dollar business, was shrinking. Total commodity trading revenues on Wall Street have fallen by about two-thirds in the last five years, with the top 10 banks notching just $4.5 billion last year, according to a report by Coalition, a UK financial analytics firm.That is down from more than $14 billion at its peak in 2008, when the bumper returns earned by sector stalwarts Goldman and Morgan Stanley encouraged many other banks to expand into energy and metals trading.(Additional reporting by David Sheppard in London; Editing by James Dalgleish)",2014-04-02,JPM,"Wed Apr 2, 2014 | 2:05pm EDT",JPMorgan global commodities unit head Masters to leave: memo,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-chase-masters-idUSBREA311QH20140402?type=companyNews
211,"  * Company owns 44,000 apartments in coal-mining Czech region* Company partly owned by financier Zdenek Bakala   (Adds comment from filing, BXR, details throughout about company)By Freya Berry and Jan LopatkaLONDON, April 2 Netherlands-based property company Domus plans a stock market listing in Amsterdam that a source familiar with the matter said could value the firm at 490 million euros ($676 million).Domus is owned by Dutch private equity firm BXR, which will remain a minority shareholder, the source said.BXR is half-owned by Czech investor Zdenek Bakala. It  controls RPG Byty, a property company in the Czech Republic, which will be folded into Domus. RPG Byty holds around 44,000 residential properties and other assets in the Ostrava coal mining region in eastern Czech Republic. Bakala is, through BXR, also a shareholder in New World Resources  which owns coals mines in the region.The source said Domus was seeking to sell 250 million euros of new and pre-existing shares in an initial public offering (IPO) in Amsterdam and the sale would be run by U.S. investment bank JP Morgan.Domus said on Wednesday it would seek to list in the second quarter of 2014, subject to market conditions. It gave no further details. A prospectus for the sale should be released in several weeks, a BXR spokeswoman said. ""The free float will be a majority of the shares,"" she said.RPG Byty said in a statement the sale would consist of both new and existing shares.JP Morgan declined to comment. RPG Byty's residential properties have been at the centre of a row in the Czech Republic over whether the tenants should have the opportunity to buy their homes.Czech politicians, including the ruling centre-left Social Democrats, have in the past called on RPG to sell the flats to the tenants. President Milos Zeman said in September last year after a trip to the region where the properties are located that he would prefer the company to transfer the apartments to public authorities or the tenants and proceeds should be used to subsidise loss-making mines in the region.RPG Byty's bond, maturing in 2020, jumped in price on Wednesday following news of the IPO plan.  RPG Byty had a gross asset value of 894 million euros and core earnings or EBITDA of 57 million at the end of 2013.A spokesman for Bakala was not immediately available for comment.($1 = 0.7249 Euros)   (Aditonal reporting by Robert Muller, Editing by Jane Merriman)",2014-04-02,JPM,"Wed Apr 2, 2014 | 12:57pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Czech property firm plans listing via Dutch-based Domus,http://www.reuters.com//article/domus-ipo-idUSL5N0MU1RQ20140402?type=companyNews

213,"   By Megan Davies | MOSCOW  MOSCOW JP Morgan Chase & Co is processing a payment from Russia's embassy in Kazakhstan to insurance agency Sogaz, easing tension after Moscow accused the U.S. bank of illegally blocking the transaction under the pretext of sanctions.Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday the ""unacceptable, illegal and absurd"" act of blocking the payment would have consequences for the U.S. Embassy in Russia.The confrontation threatened to further strain ties between Washington and Moscow, locked in the worst standoff since the Cold War over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.""Following consultation with our regulators, we are processing this transaction,"" JPMorgan said in a statement.Last month, Washington imposed sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against several Russians close to President Vladimir Putin and against Rossiya Bank, which it said was the ""personal bank"" for the leader's inner circle.The destination for the embassy payment was insurance agency Sogaz, which is 48.5 percent owned by Abros, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank Rossiya.Industry consultants in Moscow say financial institutions are unclear about how to apply the new rules in some situations, such as when dealing with subsidiaries of companies which have either been sanctioned or which have shareholders that have been punished. Several Western investors and their banks are facing quandaries over individual situations.Guidelines on the U.S. Treasury department's website from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control says that property which is more than 50 percent owned by a person on the sanctions blacklist is affected and advises acting ""with caution"" when ownership interests are less than 50 percent.""It is up to private companies and lawyers to figure out who is subject to sanctions,"" said one Moscow-based lawyer. ""Of course (a U.S. bank) is more scared of the American (authorities than the Russian ones)."" COSTLY Falling foul of U.S. authorities can be extremely costly.BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, in February set aside $1.1 billion for a possible fine for breaching U.S. sanctions on countries including Iran.Sogaz said in a statement last month that Abros had decreased its shareholding to 48.5 percent, but did not specify the shareholding level prior to the decrease. ""Sogaz doesn't have any shareholders holding more than 50 percent of the company shares directly or indirectly, so we see no reason for Sogaz to be included in the U.S. sanctions,"" a Sogaz representative said in emailed comment late on Wednesday.The confusion around sanctions caused Visa and Mastercard to briefly cut off services for clients at Russia's SMP bank, whose main shareholders were affected by U.S. sanctions, before resuming them shortly after.Russia's accusation could damage relations the bank has with the Russian authorities. JPMorgan generated $55.6 million in investment banking fees in Russia last year, with a 7 percent market share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Worldwide, JPMorgan recorded $6.4 billion in investment banking fees last year, according to the company's annual report.JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and for its size it does relatively little lending in Russia. At year-end, its loans and trading positions at risk to Russia totaled $5.4 billion compared with the company's total assets of $2.4 trillion.JPMorgan is one of a number of Western banks operating in Russia.

214,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON, April 3  BOSTON, April 3 Robert Reynolds, a former Fidelity Investments executive, wants to become a formidable rival to the largest U.S. 401(k) recordkeeper.Reynolds, who runs Great-West Lifeco U.S. Inc, said on Thursday he struck a deal to buy the large 401(k) recordkeeping unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc. The deal, in which terms were not disclosed, creates the second-largest U.S. recordkeeper of 401(k)-style retirement plans with 6.8 million participants and $387 billion in assets.""I approach this as we want to be the best,"" Reynolds said. ""I helped build Fidelity's business and the focus always was being the best at what we do."" However, Fidelity still dominates that retirement plan recordkeeping market by a wide margin. Its full defined contribution recordkeeping assets under administration totaled $1.36 trillion at the end of 2013, a Fidelity spokesman said. That's up from $678 billion in 2008. Those assets include 401(k) plans and the defined contribution plan assets of nonprofits and universities, for example.Reynolds is well known inside Boston-based Fidelity. He was a senior executive there and his office was right next to Fidelity Chairman Edward C. Johnson's. Reynolds left Fidelity in 2007 after a 24-year career. Last month, Reynolds was named chief executive of Great-West Lifeco U.S., which also owns Boston-based Putnam Investments and Great-West Financial in Denver. Reynolds had been serving as CEO of Putnam, where he landed in 2008 after leaving Fidelity. Reynolds said JPMorgan's book of business includes plenty of mega 401(k) plan clients who are Fortune 500 companies. The Great-West recordkeeping business covers smaller 401(k) clients and the nonprofit sector, he said.Reynolds did not rule out more acquisitions. But he said the JPMorgan deal puts Great-West in a position to also grow organically.""We feel very confident that with what we have today we can grow dramatically organically,"" Reynolds said. ""But I'd never sit here and say I'd never do another acquisition either.""

215,"  * Investors confused about how to interpret sanctions* Some companies are shelving or cancelling projects in Russia* Polish firm's Russian partner is Crimean politician on sanctions list* Banks withdraw pre-payment terms for Russian steel, grain trade   (Adds JP Morgan move to resume payments, changes date)By Jakub Iglewski and Megan DaviesWARSAW/MOSCOW, April 3 Elektrobudowa, a Polish firm that builds power plants, is interested in buying its partner out of a Russian company they jointly own, but there is a problem: the partner firm is owned by a pro-Moscow Crimean politician on the EU's sanctions list.To buy out the partner would mean Elektrobudowa transferring cash or assets to the owners, and that, say lawyers who specialise in sanctions law, could be interpreted as a violation of the EU measures.Many Western investors and their banks are facing similar quandaries after the imposition of targeted sanctions by the EU, the United States and a handful of other jurisdictions.Those measures are supposed to punish Russia's elite for annexing Crimea, but according to people advising companies in this field they have also spread confusion and created awkward predicaments for some foreign investors.Finnish retailer Stockmann said this week it was freezing plans to open more department stores in Russian cities because of uncertainty and a falling rouble, and other investors may follow suit, either halting or cancelling projects.A surge in net capital flight - mostly Russians sending their own funds abroad to avoid uncertainty at home - is one of the main factors prompting Russia's central bank to warn that economic growth would likely fall below 1 percent this year.Western banks involved in global commodity trade flows are also tightening payment procedures for deals with Russia, having already taken similar steps with Ukraine. Some banks now require, for example, that payment for exports of steel or grain be made only once there is proof cargoes have been loaded onto a vessel, as opposed to allowing the transfer of funds for material still in Russia or Ukraine.""I have experienced huge concern in all the European companies I have been in contact with - both economic concern and about what happens next, regarding sanctions and retaliation,"" said Lars Christensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank. ""The customers are very, very scared. In fact, in 15 years I have never seen the customers this scared about political matters.""Banks, stung in the past for failing to implement sanctions correctly, are particularly wary of falling foul of the rules and are being ultra-cautious about applying them.U.S. bank JP Morgan agreed to process a payment from Russia's embassy in Kazakhstan to an insurance agency after initially refusing on the grounds that the agency was partly owned by a unit of Bank Rossiya, blacklisted by the White House. JP Morgan's initial ban caused uproar in Moscow. After consulting with U.S. regulators, the bank relented.Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard have resumed payment services for clients of another Russian bank, SMP, which they halted last month because its main shareholders were on the U.S. blacklist, although unlike Rossiya the bank itself was not. Visa said it was told by Washington to lift the restrictions.DISQUIET IN KATOWICE The biggest ownership change to come as a direct result of the sanctions so far was that of Gunvor, one of the world's largest commodity traders. Hours after U.S. sanctions were imposed on one of its billionaire co-founders, Gennady Timchenko, the firm announced its other co-founder, Torbjorn Tornqvist, had just bought Timchenko's stake the previous day.Gunvor said the move was made as part of its contingency planning because it thought sanctions might come, and that its business has not been affected. U.S. officials also made clear they did not want sanctions on Timchenko to affect the firm.Unlike Gunvor, it is too late for Elektrobudowa to announce that it has already bought out its sanctioned partner. Since 2008 the Polish company has owned a 49 percent stake in Vector, a Russian company that makes electricity transformers at a factory in the Ural mountains region of Udmurtia. The other 51 percent in Vector is owned by Tavrida Electric, which has its headquarters in Moscow. Tavrida is, in turn, majority owned by a Alexei Chaliy, a businessman who holds a 60 percent stake and has emerged in recent weeks as one of the leading pro-Russian politicians in Crimea.Chaliy declared himself ""people's mayor"" of the Crimean port of Sevastopol in February and was installed on April 1 as the acting governor of Sevastopol, now annexed and given the status of a separate region of Russia alongside the rest of Crimea.Last month, he sat alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin as he signed an agreement on Crimea's annexation at a ceremony in the Kremlin. Dressed casually in a dark sweater while surrounded by officials in suits, he punched the air with his fist when the deal was signed.He is one of 51 people subject to visa bans and asset freezes under EU sanctions.Their partner's political activities have caused disquiet at Elektrobudowa's headquarters in the southern Polish city of Katowice. Poland, itself occupied by Russia in the past, strongly backs the authorities in Kiev and opposes Moscow and its associates in Crimea.Elektrobudowa executives say they are prepared to buy him out of their joint venture, especially as he may no longer want to be seen doing business with NATO member Poland.""If he decides to sell his stake, we will be thinking about buying it,"" Elektrobudowa chief executive Jacek Faltynowicz told Reuters in an interview. ""We are in regular contact with our Russian partners, and we are planning to visit Russia ... It is hard to tell how much it would cost. We have not worked out any valuations yet."" Reuters sent questions to Tavrida Electric asking if it planned to sell or reduce its stake in Vector, and whether the sanctions on Chaliy had affected its operations. The company said it received the questions, but did not reply.Chaliy did not respond to requests for comment. His spokesman said he had passed the questions to him.POLITICAL PRESSURE According to Brian Zimbler, managing partner at law firm Morgan Lewis in Moscow, the sanctions could prevent an EU-based company from transferring money or assets to the benefit of anyone on the list.""If you are doing business with, or doing anything that benefits anyone on the list, (there is a risk) of violating the sanctions - EU and U.S.,"" he said.Payment can be placed in an escrow account, or the assets of the person subject to the sanctions can be placed in a trust and then sold, lawyers say. But how safe these arrangements are would depend on how strictly the regulating authority - in this case the Polish government - interprets the sanctions.Another potential problem is that, depending on how the rules are interpreted, any dividend received from a firm controlled or majority owned by someone on the list could be seen as a payment from that person, which would be a violation of the sanctions.Company reports show Elektrobudowa took a dividend worth 1.377 million zlotys ($455,700) from Vector's 2012 profits. The Polish firm's chief financial officer, Adam Swigulski, told Reuters it also expected a dividend from Vector's 2013 profits.Asked about the impact of the sanctions on any transactions involving Elektrobudowa and Vector, Faltynowicz, the Elektrobudowa CEO, said: ""It is far too early for such consultations or analysis of the problem.""Financial sources based in Moscow said that in the days after the sanctions were announced there was a flurry of activity as companies, especially foreign banks, scrambled to work out if they were exposed.Some smaller investors pulled their money out, even if they were not directly affected, said the sources, but since then things have calmed down. ""The bigger guys are OK,"" said a second financial source. ""Funds see this as a buying opportunity.""Andrei Kostin, the chief executive of VTB, Russia's second-largest state bank, said in the previous week he had visits from representatives of five leading U.S. and European banks.""They said 'we will keep working with you, we will keep giving you money but will be doing it quietly because political pressure is being put on us',"" Kostin told a news conference on Wednesday. ""Probably it will be a little more expensive - the risks have increased.""

The two will manage corporate banking, treasury services and investment banking worldwide.Jeff Bosland, 47, who had been a sales and marketing chief and former public finance head, will become head of treasury services and will report to Hernandez and Urwin. John Horner, 44, will succeed Hernandez as head of investor services. Horner has been over the financing business within the markets and investor Services unit.The moves follow a March 25 announcement that Mike Cavanagh, who was co-CEO with Pinto of corporate and investment banking, was leaving the company to join private equity firm Carlyle Group LP. Also, late last year Don McCree, who headed treasury services and corporate banking, decided to leave JPMorgan after 30 years at the bank. McCree, 52, will shift his duties to Hernandez and Urwin over the next few months, the memo said.

223,"  LONDON, April 7 (IFR) - JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are to join Morgan Stanley  on the syndicate for Emaar Properties' upcoming IPO of its retail and malls business, bankers said.Last month, Dubai's biggest property firm hired Morgan Stanley to manage an 8-9 billion dirham (US$2.18-2.45 billion) listing of its shopping mall and retail unit, a deal that promises to be the largest ECM transaction in the region since 2008.Emaar has now appointed JP Morgan to the topline along with Morgan Stanley, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch will be one step below as joint bookrunner. The listing, which was first contemplated before Dubai's real estate and stock market collapsed in 2009, underscores the extent of the emirate's recovery over the past few years. Residential property prices increased by more than 20 percent last year and Dubai's main equity index - the best performing bourse in the world in 2013 - is up 18.8 percent so far this year. Emaar is 31 percent-owned by the Dubai government, which is set to earn a dividend of about US$750 million from the listing.

226,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers on Monday launched a bill to rewrite the rules of  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), giving more leeway to smaller players in the derivative markets it oversees.The agency became one of the most prolific reformers of Wall Street after the financial crisis under its previous chairman, Gary Gensler, who was frequently criticized by some in the financial industry for his hard-nosed style and sometimes-hasty adoption of new rules.In a so-called reauthorization bill to fine-tune the CFTC's mandate, the chairman and the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee drew up a list of changes to many of the tough rules the agency has written.""The CFTC's rulemaking process has been less than ideal. The rulemaking process has proven confusing,"" the four lawmakers launching the bill said in a statement.The bill also directed the CFTC to finish a study into high-frequency trading if it were adopted.The CFTC was a little-watched overseer of agriculture and other futures before the crisis, but the 2010 Dodd-Frank law put it in charge of the $690 trillion swaps market, dominated by large investment banks such as JP Morgan Chase & Co, Citibank and Bank of America.That has earned the agency a strong reputation among critics of big banks, but has drawn the ire of financial industry associations as well as from users of derivatives who fear the new rules may ramp up their costs.Frank Lucas, the Republican from Oklahoma who chairs the Committee, and Collin Peterson, the ranking Democrat from Minnesota, urged the other members of the committee to adopt the bill at a hearing on Wednesday.Separately, the Senate Agriculture Committee on Tuesday will vote on the candidacy on a new CFTC chairman, and two new commissioners. The CFTC needs to be reauthorized every five years, though it has in the past gone for several years without that stamp of approval. The launch of the bill is the first step of what will likely be a drawn-out process to get it through Congress.President Barack Obama's administration is opposed to making any changes to Dodd-Frank before it is fully implemented, and previous attempts to tweak it have stalled.THREE TITLES IN BILL The bill has three titles: one to better protect customers in futures markets, a second to reform the CFTC, and the third to fine-tune changes in the swaps market for those clients who use it to hedge risk, and not to speculate. Client protection issues were at the heart of two major collapses of futures brokers overseen by the CFTC, MF Global and Peregrine Financial, and the agency has since tightened its rules for the long-regulated industry.But the lawmakers said the agency's new rules made the market too expensive for farmers, who use futures to protect revenue from their crops against wild swings in market prices, and proposed making regulations easier on them.The second title to reform the CFTC's procedure may well be among be the bill's most explosive, and could draw criticism from the left that the lawmakers are tethering the agency.If enacted, it would make the agency's staff responsible to the full five-strong Commission - which ordinarily is majority-led Democrats or Republicans, depending on the reigning administration - and not just its chairman.It would also subject all the agency's decisions to a so-called cost-benefit analysis, a frequently used tool with which opponents of regulation have knocked out rules in court. The agency is facing a court battle over how it applies its rules to foreign companies and U.S. companies doing business abroad, with the argument focusing on whether it followed proper procedure.The so-called cross-border guidance wasn't vetted by the Commission, but issued by staff. The bill would limit that practice, which puts decisions outside the reach of its politically controlled top level, to a minimum.The bill also touched on a row between the agency and the world's largest future exchange, the CME Group Inc., which last year accused it of sharing sensitive market data with outside researchers, leading the agency to temporarily shut down its research program for visiting academics.The lawmakers in the bill proposed setting up a new office of the chief economist, also answerable to the full commission, and with tighter procedures and internal controls.The third title would exempt so-called end-users in swaps markets - who use swaps to hedge risk, and not to speculate - from costly rules that require them to set aside money for each trade they enter into, so-called margin.It would also exempt them from certain record-keeping requirements the CFTC has introduced to combat fraud.Lastly, the bill would require a vote before the agency lowers the threshold above which a company needs to register with the agency as a so-called swap dealer, and comply with its harshest rules, from $8 billion where it is now.(Editing by Ken Wills, Eric Meijer and Ed Davies)",2014-04-08,JPM,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 2:16pm EDT",U.S. House panel to vote on swaps regulator mandate,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-cftc-reauthorization-idUSBREA3703I20140408?type=companyNews

""There is much to say and a lot to be learned in analyzing what happened, but I am not going to do so in this letter — more distance and perspective are required.""Dimon also provided more details on the $2 billion of additional annual spending by the company to comply with new rules and regulations. JPMorgan will have added 13,000 employees through the end of 2014 since the beginning to 2012 for regulatory compliance and risk control, Dimon said. The company employed about 251,000 people at the end of December.Some 8,000 employees are now dedicated solely to combating money laundering, Dimon said. The company was sanctioned last year by regulators for its weak system to thwart money laundering. Dimon acknowledged in the letter that JPMorgan executives previously had been too self-assured when they had seen competitors get in trouble with regulators over their systems. ""Our response generally was, 'We know what we're doing.' Well, we should have done more self-examination. We need to be better listeners and do a better job at examining critiques of others so we can learn from other people's mistakes, too,"" he wrote.JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has spent more than $600 million on technology for the compliance and control push. It has built what Dimon called a ""state-of-the-art control room in our corporate headquarters to provide streamlined data analysis and reporting capabilities.""Beyond JPMorgan's regulatory troubles, Dimon took up a wide range of topics, including interest rate risk, cyber attacks and stock performance. He also warned of three looming threats to the company beyond its usual competitors: large, global Chinese banks, technological obsolescence and non-bank financial companies that operate largely outside of current bank regulators. Four Chinese banks are following rapidly growing Chinese companies overseas, he said. As examples of non-bank competitors, he cited the PayPal business of eBay Inc, money market funds, real estate investment trusts and middle-market loan funds.Dimon said he looks forward to interest rates rising from their currently low levels, which he expects will boost JPMorgan profits. But he cautioned, ""When rates do normalize, we know one thing for certain - it will happen differently from what people expect. And my guess is that when it happens, it will be faster than people expect.""The bank is increasingly worried about cyber attacks, which he said are becoming more complex and dangerous. By the end of this year, JPMorgan's annual spending on cyber security will increase to more than $250 million, from $200 million in 2012, and staffing will rise to 1,000 people from 600 people.

232,"  * American Express, Citigroup, Discover prevail* Cardholders alleged collusion to require arbitration   (Adds comments from Citigroup, Discover lawyer)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, April 10 Consumers suffered a setback on Thursday as three big credit card issuers won the dismissal of U.S. lawsuits accusing them of colluding to require that disputes be settled in arbitration rather than class action lawsuits.U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan said cardholders failed to show that American Express Co, Citigroup Inc and Discover Financial Services  conspired to violate the Sherman antitrust law.The plaintiffs had argued that the conspiracy ran from May 1999 to October 2003, when 10 card-issuing banks and their lawyers held 28 meetings to discuss how to impose mandatory arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements.Pauley said his decision in the decade-old case was a close call, given the ""conscious parallel action"" among the biggest card issuers to include the clauses.""It was only by a slender reed that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the lawyers who organized these meetings had spawned a Sherman Act conspiracy among their clients,"" Pauley wrote in a 92-page decision, following a 2013 non-jury trial.Class action litigation can allow consumers to pool resources and obtain greater recoveries at lower cost than individual arbitrations. ""This is a big dent for consumer rights,"" said Curtis Arnold, a consumer advocate and founder of CardRatings.com in Little Rock, Arkansas. ""Class action lawsuits have over the years kept this industry in check. Individuals don't have much recourse taking on card giants by themselves.""Cardholders had sought to force American Express, Citigroup and Discover to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for eight years.Merrill Davidoff, a partner at Berger & Montague representing the plaintiffs, said his clients were ""obviously disappointed"" and strongly disagreed with Pauley's decision. He said it is premature to address whether there will be an appeal.Robert Sperling, a partner at Winston & Strawn representing Discover, said the cardholders ""never came close to proving collusion."" Citigroup spokeswoman Emily Collins said that the bank is pleased with the decision. Spokeswomen for American Express did not respond to requests for comment. American Express, Citigroup and Discover collectively held about 31.1 percent of U.S. outstanding credit card balances in 2013, according to the Nilson Report.AVOIDING A BACKLASH In April 2010, Bank of America Corp, Capital One Financial Corp, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co settled with the plaintiff cardholders by agreeing to remove their arbitration clauses for 3-1/2 years. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated in December that just over 50 percent of outstanding credit card loans remain subject to the clauses. It said the percentage would have been 94 percent absent the earlier settlements.Other industries also use arbitration clauses. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 upheld contracts used by AT&T Inc  requiring consumers to arbitrate disputes individually.In his decision, Pauley noted that of the 10 banks that had been part of the litigation, just two had mandatory arbitration clauses at the start of the alleged collusion.He found ""compelling evidence"" that cardholders would have little economic incentive to fight alleged abuses absent class actions, and said that the banks' ""need to parry consumer backlash and temper any 'rogue' players"" established a motive to conspire.""A motive to conspire, however, does not mean that a conspiracy existed,"" he said. ""This court is convinced that the evidence is just as consistent with legitimate activity in furtherance of the issuing banks' independent self interests.""Pauley said the case also offered a ""cautionary lesson"" to lawyers, given that the banks' cost to defend against the lawsuits offset potential savings from the arbitration clauses.""In retrospect, the issuing banks' short-term goal of lowering litigation costs eluded them,"" he wrote.The cases are in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. They are Ross et al v. American Express Co et al, No. 04-05723; and Ross et al v. Bank of America NA et al, No. 05-07116.

233,"   By David Henry  JPMorgan Chase & Co executives had a clear message for shareholders after reporting declining first-quarter earnings: don't worry, be happy that the bank isn't chasing short-term gains by making irrational lending decisions.The first quarter was a tough one for JPMorgan. Profit fell 19 percent, revenue fell 8 percent, and the bank set aside 38 percent more money to cover loan losses.But the important thing is that the bank is not lowering its lending standards, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told reporters.""We feel really good about the risks we're taking ... for the future of the company,"" Dimon said on a conference call.The bank will not be too aggressive in areas where it says it believes other lenders have taken leave of their senses, such as business lending, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told analysts on a separate call.""We'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do but we aren't going to chase growth at the expense of discipline,"" Lake said.Some investors say they appreciate the bank's strategy. Analyst Mike Scanlon at John Hancock Asset Management said Dimon seems to be making the kind of cautious lending decisions that long-term investors should want.""They gave up revenue instead of chasing every dollar of business,"" Scanlon said.Before the financial crisis, Charles ""Chuck"" Prince, then chief executive of Citigroup, infamously said that his bank had no choice but to make aggressive loans to private equity funds because its rivals were. ""As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance,"" he told the Financial Times.A senior executive at JPMorgan, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said on Friday, ""Jamie is not going to dance.""By backing away when others lend more aggressively, JPMorgan is acting like it did before the credit crisis, Scanlon added. John Hancock Asset Management owns about 1 million shares of JPMorgan. Dimon's recent tangles with regulators over a range of issues, including the loss of more than $6 billion in the London Whale derivatives scandal, may be making the bank more inclined to play it safe when it comes to all kinds of risk, said analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.""All of this is coming together to make a conservative bank that in the long-run is going to work very well for shareholders, but over the near-term is going to come up short at times, like they did this quarter,"" said Cassidy.JPMorgan has one of the highest valuations among the major commercial and investment banks, as measured by share price to tangible common book value, which is due in part to its tendency to know when to scale down credit risk, Cassidy added.Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, agrees that competition is heating up now.""You tend to see competitors be a little more aggressive, price things more aggressively to generate revenue,"" said Tim Sloan, chief financial officer at Wells Fargo.Wells Fargo said on Friday that it managed to boost its lending book in the first quarter, but much of its 14 percent net profit increase in the period came from one-time gains. LAGGING RIVALS For JPMorgan, remaining disciplined is painful.The bank's mortgage lending and bond trading businesses logged steep profit declines, and the bank's profits also fell in many other key businesses, including corporate lending and debt underwriting.""It was not an exciting set of numbers,"" said Andrew Kohl, an associate portfolio manager at Alpine Financial Services Fund, which owns JPMorgan shares.The results and company commentary prompted analyst Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer to cut his JPMorgan earnings estimates. He reduced his 2014 estimate to $5.64 a share from $6.13, and his 2015 estimate to $6.00 a share from $6.45.Total loans on JPMorgan's books grew less than 1 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-earlier period, and the average rates it earned on its $730 billion of loans fell to 4.49 percent, from 4.78 percent. One headwind for loan growth at JPMorgan is the impact of old Washington Mutual assets that the bank is not replacing when they mature. JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual at the height of the financial crisis after it failed.But the bank is consciously trying to limit its new business in areas where profitability is shrinking. For example, JPMorgan made just $17 billion mortgages in the first quarter, down from $52.7 billion in the same quarter last year. That nearly 70 percent drop is steeper than the 57 percent decline that the Mortgage Bankers Association expects for the industry in the first quarter, mainly as a result of the reduced appeal of refinancing because of higher interest rates.Speaking to investors in February, JPMorgan's Consumer and Community Banking CEO Gordon Smith said that there is a lot of competition in mortgage lending now as volume shrinks, and the bank is trying to determine how much business it wants there.JPMorgan's total loan growth lags the overall market, Federal Reserve data show. Loans across the U.S. banking system rose about 3.5 percent from the final week of March 2013 to the last week of March 2014.Overall volume of loans to companies has been growing fast, Fed data show: commercial and industrial loans on banks' books were 7.8 percent higher at the end of March from a year earlier.In the riskiest part of that market, namely junk-rated loans to companies, quality has weakened, and deals are put together in a way that reduces protection to investors.In loans to companies, JPMorgan is increasingly seeing competition from private equity firms and other lenders outside of the banking sector.About $1 billion of loans that JPMorgan made to companies with weak credit quality have been refinanced by non-banks, Doug Petno, chief of the bank's commercial banking, said in February.Wells Fargo's Sloan said he has seen increasing competition from non-banks as well, but added that Wells Fargo's ability to sell a wide range of products to customers has prevented it from losing too many clients.In the first quarter, companies took out $8.6 billion of second-lien loans, which are riskier as they provide lower recoveries to lenders in a default.

235,"   By Angela Moon | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks slid in a volatile session on Friday, with the Nasdaq closing below the 4,000 mark for the first time since early February.Selling accelerated late in the afternoon, with the biotech and other momentum stocks again leading the Nasdaq sharply lower. JPMorgan's disappointing earnings also gave investors a reason to sell some bank stocks.For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq lost 3.1 percent, the biggest weekly decline for both indexes since June 2012.""Today's decline is what we've been seeing all week. The weakness in the biotech and momentum names is getting investors worried about where the market is headed in the near-term, eventually triggering a selloff in everything,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners in New York.""Our long-term outlook on the market hasn't changed because if you understand why the market is selling off, you know it's not rational, that it doesn't make sense,"" he added.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 143.47 points or 0.89 percent, to end at 16,026.75. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 17.39 points or 0.95 percent, to finish at 1,815.69. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 54.372 points or 1.34 percent, to close at 3,999.734. The Nasdaq Composite fell through 4,000 for the first time since early February and many one-time market darlings are now down substantially from records reached only six or seven weeks ago.JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) shares fell 3.7 percent to close at $55.30. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 after the bank reported a far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as revenue from securities trading fell.The S&P financial index .SPSY dropped 1.2 percent. It was the S&P 500's worst-performing sector. The Nasdaq biotech index .NBI fell 2.8 percent after rising as much as 1 percent earlier.

The stock tumbled 14 percent to close at $51.48. Even with the recent declines, investors appear committed to equities. Investors in U.S.-based funds poured $8.9 billion into stock funds in the week ended April 9, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.The latest economic data showed that consumers felt more optimistic as April got under way.

236,"   By David Henry and Tanya Agrawal  JPMorgan Chase & Co posted far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as uncertainty about the U.S. economy weighed on investor trading volumes and consumer borrowing.Results from the first of the major Wall Street banks to post earnings underscore how difficult the first quarter was for the financial sector. JPMorgan's bond trading revenue plunged 21 percent, and mortgage lending revenue fell 84 percent from the same quarter last year.Most of the bank's big businesses, including commercial lending and credit cards, delivered lower profits. But the bank is not responding by dialing up its risk-taking in commercial lending, and it views falling revenue in its bond trading business as part of a business cycle instead of a symptom of a broad-based and lasting decline in fixed-income trading.""It's not like selling cereal - it's not like your volumes go up 2 percent every day,"" Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said to reporters on a conference call. The business will grow over the next decade or two, he added.Dimon, who earned plaudits for keeping his bank consistently profitable during the financial crisis, is struggling to figure out how to navigate the current environment.In his annual letter to shareholders earlier this week, Dimon noted that JPMorgan will have spent more than $2 billion more than usual from 2012 through the end of this year on complying with new rules, and devoted more than 1 million work hours to meeting new mortgage rules. The bank's net income dropped 16 percent last year due to massive legal settlements and rising compliance costs.Friday's results showed how the bank's troubles appear to be extending beyond outsized legal settlements and meeting new rules, and into areas more fundamental to the business, such as loan demand and trading volume.Overall, net income fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, from $6.53 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the same quarter of 2013, the biggest U.S. bank said on Friday.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.40 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total net revenue fell 8.5 percent to $22.99 billion, falling well short of the average estimate of $24.53 billion. JPMorgan shares, which recently topped $61 to trade at their highest level in 13 years, fell 3.1 percent to $55.63 in afternoon trading.MORTGAGE LENDING FALLS One area where the bank is meeting with some success is keeping costs under control, a crucial effort when future revenues may be weak. JPMorgan said non-interest expenses fell 5 percent in the latest quarter to $14.6 billion.Dimon is aiming to hold down overhead - which he defines as non-interest expenses aside from litigation - to below an average of $14.75 billion per quarter, or $59 billion for the year.Mortgage banking net income fell to $114 million in the quarter, a drop of $559 million from the year-earlier period. Production revenue, a measure of lending revenue, fell 84 percent to $161 million, and the bank made $17 billion of home loans, a 68 percent decline from a year earlier.U.S. mortgage lending has cooled after rising rates in the second half of last year have given fewer homeowners reason to refinance their loans. Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. home lender, also reported results Friday and said its income from mortgage banking fell 46 percent from a year earlier. Gains on one-time items, however, contributed to a higher-than expected 14 percent rise in quarterly profit for the company.For JPMorgan, rising bond yields in the middle of last year, which resulted from the Federal Reserve's decision to slow down its bond buying program, also weighed on fixed income, currency, and commodity trading revenue, which fell to $3.76 billion from $4.75 billion in the same quarter last year.Commercial banking income fell 3 percent to $578 million, hurt by declining revenue from making loans. Consumer credit and debit card income fell 1 percent to $1.35 billion.JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said total assets at the end of March stood at $2.48 trillion, up from $2.42 trillion at the end of December.The firm's supplementary leverage ratio, a measure of a bank's capital compared with its assets, stood at 5.1 percent at the end of the quarter. Leverage ratios took on added importance on Tuesday when the Federal Reserve approved new rules setting minimum levels that could force the eight biggest U.S. banks to boost their capital by a total of $68 billion.The rule sets a higher minimum of 6 percent for the company's insured bank subsidiary.Before the rule was approved in its latest form, JPMorgan had said it was on track to raise its ratio from 4.6 percent at the end of December to the 5 percent minimum for its holding company by the end of this year.LITIGATION EXPENSES ""IMMATERIAL"" JPMorgan said its litigation expenses were immaterial in the latest quarter, under its ""other corporate"" accounting line.Litigation expenses totaled $347 million in the year-earlier quarter and $847 million in the fourth-quarter.In the first quarter two years ago, litigation costs totaled $2.5 billion as the bank built up reserves in anticipation of big legal settlements that it ultimately reached in 2013. JPMorgan paid more than $20 billion last year to resolve legal claims stemming from a wide range of problems, including its London Whale derivatives loss and its marketing of bad mortgage securities before the financial crisis.JPMorgan's shares - which have nearly doubled in price since the bank was rocked in 2012 by its London Whale derivatives trading scandal and $6.2 billion loss - were trading at a multiple of 9.56 times estimated forward earnings on Thursday.That compares with 9.93 times for Goldman Sachs Group Inc and 11.38 times for Morgan Stanley, both of which report next week.(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr, Dan Wilchins, Sofina Mirza-Reid and Richard Chang)",2014-04-11,JPM,"Fri Apr 11, 2014 | 4:10pm EDT",JPMorgan profit weaker than expected as trading revenue falls,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-results-idUSBREA3A0RB20140411?type=companyNews
237,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 11 (Fitch) As expected by Fitch Ratings, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s  (JPM) 1Q'14 net earnings of $5.3 billion were hurt by weakness in fixed income  and a continued decline in mortgage production. Bright spots included business  banking loan growth, market-leading credit card purchase volume growth, strong  investment banking fees in commercial banking, positive client flows in asset  management, and a continuation of solid asset quality trends in consumer and  commercial loan categories. Returns on tangible common equity were 13% for the  quarter compared to 17% a year earlier. There were no significant items of note  in the quarter.      Results for the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) were down 24% from 1Q'13, or  22% adjusting for DVA. The decline was driven by a 22% decline in debt  underwriting and a 21% decline in fixed income markets, which was largely  expected given market volumes. Markets revenue was down overall, but investment  banking fees were up modestly, as growth in advisory and equity underwriting  offset weaker debt issuance. The CIB average VaR remained relatively low, at $42  million for the quarter, which was flat with 4Q'13, but down from $62 million in  1Q'13. DVA/FVA was a loss of $53 million in the quarter and is expected to  remain modest going forward, given the implementation of FVA in 4Q'13.  Net income in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment was down from  1Q'13 and 4Q'13, given declines in mortgage revenue and higher provision  expense, offset to some extent by lower operating expenses. Mortgage origination  volume was down nearly 68% year over year and 27% from the prior quarter, which  appears to be in-line with other large market participants. Production pre-tax  income was a negative $186 million in the quarter and is expected to be negative  for the year, although it could improve modestly in 2Q'14 according to  management.  Pre-tax earnings in the servicing business improved given declines in the cost  basis. Total servicing expenses were $582 million in the quarter, which compares  to a target of approximately $500 million per quarter by year-end, which Fitch  believes is achievable. MSR risk management losses were relatively large, but  reflected a higher allocation of capital to the business. Credit metrics in the  real estate portfolio continued to decline, which supported $200 million of  reserve releases in the quarter. Fitch expects additional reserve releases over  the balance of the year, although at lower levels than seen in 2013.    Card segment performance was relatively solid, but Fitch expects provision  expenses and continued margin compression to be headwinds over the remainder of  2014. Reserve releases, which were $250 million in the quarter ($50 million of  which were related to student loans) are largely complete. Still, nothing is  signaling an imminent decline in credit performance. The 1Q growth in net  charge-offs were seasonally driven and early-stage delinquencies continued to  decline. Potential offsets to earnings headwinds could be a continuation of  strong sales growth, which was up 10% from 1Q'13, and loan portfolio growth,  which appears to have bottomed.    Commercial Banking (CB) remains a very steady performer within JPM, with  earnings relatively flat year-over-year. Loan growth was up about 7% from 1Q'13,  with noted strength in commercial real estate. Credit quality remained very  strong, with net recoveries in the quarter. Asset Management (AM) earnings were  down due to an increase in expenses related to higher headcount and costs  associated with the control agenda. Assets under management (AUM) were above  $1.6 trillion at quarter-end.   The bank's core net interest margin, which excludes the impact of CIB's  market-based activities, was up 2 basis points sequentially, to 2.66% due to  higher investment securities yields, offset to some extent by loan spread  compression. JPM is expecting Treasury to report breakeven net interest income  (NII) by year-end, but reported negative NII of $87 million in 1Q'14.  JPM made no progress toward its year-end Basel III Tier 1 Common equity (CET1)  target in the quarter, as benefits from portfolio run-off and capital generation  were offset by the impact of models not approved for Basel III. The CET1 ratio  remained flat sequentially at 9.5% compared to a year-end 2014 target of 10%.  Still, progress was made on the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which  improved 50 basis points sequentially at the firm level in 1Q'14, reaching 5.1%.  The improvement was driven by net retained earnings and preferred issuance of  close to $4 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the impact of the U.S. final  leverage ratio NPR, which was released earlier this week, benefited the ratio by  about 15-20 basis points. JPM expects to target firm SLR of 5.5% longer-term.  Fitch regards JPM's capital levels to be consistent with its current ratings and  would expect the bank to achieve full compliance with all regulatory  requirements, well ahead of required implementation.  As recently disclosed, the Federal Reserve did not object to JPM's capital plan  as part of the annual CCAR process. As a result, JPM announced a $0.02 per share  increase in its quarterly dividend, to $0.40 per share, and authorization to  repurchase up to $6.5 billion of common equity through 1Q'15.

Biotech and momentum stocks extended losses from the previous session's sharp selloff that pushed the Nasdaq  to its worst decline since Nov. 9, 2011. The Nasdaq Composite fell through 4,000 for the first time since early February and many of these popular shares are now down substantially from records reached only six or seven weeks ago.Equities have been volatile this week, with Thursday's slide a sharp reversal from Wednesday's gains after minutes from the latest Federal Reserve policymakers' meeting suggested members were more likely to keep rates low than previously expected.Since reaching a record intraday high on April 4, the S&P 500 has fallen 4.2 percent, while the Nasdaq has dropped 8.5 percent from its March 6 intraday high. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 121.38 points or 0.75 percent, to 16,048.84. The S&P 500 lost 14.78 points or 0.81 percent, to 1,818.30. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 50.894 points or 1.26 percent, to 4,003.212.JPMorgan Chase & Co shares fell 3.3 percent to $55.49 as the biggest drag on the S&P 500 after it reported a far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as revenue from securities trading fell. The S&P financial index lost 0.9 percent and was the S&P 500's worst-performing sector.The Nasdaq biotech index fell 2.5 percent after rising as much as 1 percent earlier. The Global X social media index, which includes Facebook and LinkedIn , slid 2.4 percent.In contrast to the day's sharp downturn, shares of Wells Fargo & Co rose 1.8 percent to $48.59 after the biggest mortgage lender in the United States reported a 14 percent increase in first-quarter net profit.Even with the recent declines, investors appear committed to equities.

239,"  (Adds Analysis and Breakingviews links, updates stock price)By David Henry and Tanya AgrawalApril 11 JPMorgan Chase & Co posted far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as uncertainty about the U.S economy weighed on investor trading volumes and consumer borrowing.Results from the first of the major Wall Street banks to post earnings underscore how difficult the first quarter was for the financial sector. JPMorgan's bond trading revenue plunged 21 percent, and mortgage lending revenue fell 84 percent from the same quarter last year.Most of the bank's big businesses, including commercial lending and credit cards, delivered lower profits. But the bank is not responding by dialing up its risk-taking in commercial lending, and it views falling revenue in its bond trading business as part of a business cycle instead of a symptom of a broad-based and lasting decline in fixed-income trading.""It's not like selling cereal - it's not like your volumes go up 2 percent every day,"" Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said to reporters on a conference call. The business will grow over the next decade or two, he added.Dimon, who earned plaudits for keeping his bank consistently profitable during the financial crisis, is struggling to figure out how to navigate the current environment.In his annual letter to shareholders earlier this week, Dimon noted that JPMorgan will have spent more than $2 billion more than usual from 2012 through the end of this year on complying with new rules, and devoted more than 1 million work hours to meeting new mortgage rules. The bank's net income dropped 16 percent last year due to massive legal settlements and rising compliance costs.Friday's results showed how the bank's troubles appear to be extending beyond outsized legal settlements and meeting new rules, and into areas more fundamental to the business, such as loan demand and trading volume.Overall, net income fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, from $6.53 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the same quarter of 2013, the biggest U.S. bank said on Friday.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.40 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total net revenue fell 8.5 percent to $22.99 billion, falling well short of the average estimate of $24.53 billion.JPMorgan shares, which recently topped $61 to trade at their highest level in 13 years, fell 3.1 percent to $55.63 in afternoon trading.MORTGAGE LENDING FALLS One area where the bank is meeting with some success is keeping costs under control, a crucial effort when future revenues may be weak. JPMorgan said non-interest expenses fell 5 percent in the latest quarter to $14.6 billion.Dimon is aiming to hold down overhead - which he defines as non-interest expenses aside from litigation - to below an average of $14.75 billion per quarter, or $59 billion for the year. Mortgage banking net income fell to $114 million in the quarter, a drop of $559 million from the year-earlier period. Production revenue, a measure of lending revenue, fell 84 percent to $161 million, and the bank made $17 billion of home loans, a 68 percent decline from a year earlier.U.S. mortgage lending has cooled after rising rates in the second half of last year have given fewer homeowners reason to refinance their loans.Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. home lender, also reported results Friday and said its income from mortgage banking fell 46 percent from a year earlier.  Gains on one-time items, however, contributed to a higher-than expected 14 percent rise in quarterly profit for the company.For JPMorgan, rising bond yields in the middle of last year, which resulted from the Federal Reserve's decision to slow down its bond buying program, also weighed on fixed income, currency, and commodity trading revenue, which fell to $3.76 billion from $4.75 billion in the same quarter last year.Commercial banking income fell 3 percent to $578 million, hurt by declining revenue from making loans. Consumer credit and debit card income fell 1 percent to $1.35 billion. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said total assets at the end of March stood at $2.48 trillion, up from $2.42 trillion at the end of December.The firm's supplementary leverage ratio, a measure of a bank's capital compared with its assets, stood at 5.1 percent at the end of the quarter.Leverage ratios took on added importance on Tuesday when the Federal Reserve approved new rules setting minimum levels that could force the eight biggest U.S. banks to boost their capital by a total of $68 billion.The rule sets a higher minimum of 6 percent for the company's insured bank subsidiary.Before the rule was approved in its latest form, JPMorgan had said it was on track to raise its ratio from 4.6 percent at the end of December to the 5 percent minimum for its holding company by the end of this year.LITIGATION EXPENSES ""IMMATERIAL"" JPMorgan said its litigation expenses were immaterial in the latest quarter, under its ""other corporate"" accounting line.Litigation expenses totaled $347 million in the year-earlier quarter and $847 million in the fourth-quarter.In the first quarter two years ago, litigation costs totaled $2.5 billion as the bank built up reserves in anticipation of big legal settlements that it ultimately reached in 2013.    JPMorgan paid more than $20 billion last year to resolve legal claims stemming from a wide range of problems, including its London Whale derivatives loss and its marketing of bad mortgage securities before the financial crisis.JPMorgan's shares - which have nearly doubled in price since the bank was rocked in 2012 by its London Whale derivatives trading scandal and $6.2 billion loss - were trading at a multiple of 9.56 times estimated forward earnings on Thursday.    That compares with 9.93 times for Goldman Sachs Group Inc  and 11.38 times for Morgan Stanley, both of which report next week.

The S&P financial index lost 0.7 percent as the worst performing S&P sector. ""That's not helping matters,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York. ""At the moment that is going to prevent us from really rallying, if anything it is going to cause more pressure as we go into the end of the day.""In contrast, Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a 14 percent rise in first-quarter net profit as costs fell. Its shares gained 1.6 percent to $48.45.S&P 500 companies' first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 0.9 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. That's down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. Investors will be looking at the impact of harsh winter weather on first-quarter earnings, and signs of optimism for the second quarter.Another sharp selloff in biotech and momentum names on Thursday sent the Nasdaq to its worst decline since Nov. 9, 2011 and the benchmark S&P index to its biggest fall since Feb 3. After showing initial weakness Friday, biotechs rebounded, with the Nasdaq biotech index up 1.1 percent after it entered bear market territory earlier in the session, falling more than 20 percent from its high on Feb 25. Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc rose 3.8 percent to $68.02.""The pendulum always swings too far to the left, so like everything you might get a little more pressure, I don't think you will see a 50 percent or 40 percent correction in some of these names, 20 percent or 25 percent might be what you get,"" said Polcari.Equities have been volatile this week, with Thursday's move a sharp reversal from gains Wednesday after minutes from the latest Federal Reserve policymakers' meeting suggested members were more likely to keep rates low than previously expected.The CBOE Volatility index is up nearly 17 percent for the week. Even with the recent declines, investors appear committed to equities.

244,"   By David Henry  JPMorgan Chase & Co executives had a clear message for shareholders after reporting declining first-quarter earnings: don't worry, be happy that the bank isn't chasing short-term gains by making irrational lending decisions.The first quarter was a tough one for JPMorgan. Profit fell 19 percent, revenue fell 8 percent, and the bank set aside 38 percent more money to cover loan losses.But the important thing is that the bank is not lowering its lending standards, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told reporters.""We feel really good about the risks we're taking ... for the future of the company,"" Dimon said on a conference call.The bank will not be too aggressive in areas where it says it believes other lenders have taken leave of their senses, such as business lending, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told analysts on a separate call.""We'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do but we aren't going to chase growth at the expense of discipline,"" Lake said.Some investors say they appreciate the bank's strategy. Analyst Mike Scanlon at John Hancock Asset Management said Dimon seems to be making the kind of cautious lending decisions that long-term investors should want.""They gave up revenue instead of chasing every dollar of business,"" Scanlon said.Before the financial crisis, Charles ""Chuck"" Prince, then chief executive of Citigroup, infamously said that his bank had no choice but to make aggressive loans to private equity funds because its rivals were. ""As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance,"" he told the Financial Times.A senior executive at JPMorgan, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said on Friday, ""Jamie is not going to dance.""By backing away when others lend more aggressively, JPMorgan is acting like it did before the credit crisis, Scanlon added. John Hancock Asset Management owns about 1 million shares of JPMorgan. Dimon's recent tangles with regulators over a range of issues, including the loss of more than $6 billion in the London Whale derivatives scandal, may be making the bank more inclined to play it safe when it comes to all kinds of risk, said analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.""All of this is coming together to make a conservative bank that in the long-run is going to work very well for shareholders, but over the near-term is going to come up short at times, like they did this quarter,"" said Cassidy.JPMorgan has one of the highest valuations among the major commercial and investment banks, as measured by share price to tangible common book value, which is due in part to its tendency to know when to scale down credit risk, Cassidy added.Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, agrees that competition is heating up now.""You tend to see competitors be a little more aggressive, price things more aggressively to generate revenue,"" said Tim Sloan, chief financial officer at Wells Fargo.Wells Fargo said on Friday that it managed to boost its lending book in the first quarter, but much of its 14 percent net profit increase in the period came from one-time gains. LAGGING RIVALS For JPMorgan, remaining disciplined is painful.The bank's mortgage lending and bond trading businesses logged steep profit declines, and the bank's profits also fell in many other key businesses, including corporate lending and debt underwriting.""It was not an exciting set of numbers,"" said Andrew Kohl, an associate portfolio manager at Alpine Financial Services Fund, which owns JPMorgan shares.The results and company commentary prompted analyst Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer to cut his JPMorgan earnings estimates. He reduced his 2014 estimate to $5.64 a share from $6.13, and his 2015 estimate to $6.00 a share from $6.45.Total loans on JPMorgan's books grew less than 1 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-earlier period, and the average rates it earned on its $730 billion of loans fell to 4.49 percent, from 4.78 percent. One headwind for loan growth at JPMorgan is the impact of old Washington Mutual assets that the bank is not replacing when they mature. JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual at the height of the financial crisis after it failed.But the bank is consciously trying to limit its new business in areas where profitability is shrinking. For example, JPMorgan made just $17 billion mortgages in the first quarter, down from $52.7 billion in the same quarter last year. That nearly 70 percent drop is steeper than the 57 percent decline that the Mortgage Bankers Association expects for the industry in the first quarter, mainly as a result of the reduced appeal of refinancing because of higher interest rates.Speaking to investors in February, JPMorgan's Consumer and Community Banking CEO Gordon Smith said that there is a lot of competition in mortgage lending now as volume shrinks, and the bank is trying to determine how much business it wants there.JPMorgan's total loan growth lags the overall market, Federal Reserve data show. Loans across the U.S. banking system rose about 3.5 percent from the final week of March 2013 to the last week of March 2014.Overall volume of loans to companies has been growing fast, Fed data show: commercial and industrial loans on banks' books were 7.8 percent higher at the end of March from a year earlier.In the riskiest part of that market, namely junk-rated loans to companies, quality has weakened, and deals are put together in a way that reduces protection to investors.In loans to companies, JPMorgan is increasingly seeing competition from private equity firms and other lenders outside of the banking sector.About $1 billion of loans that JPMorgan made to companies with weak credit quality have been refinanced by non-banks, Doug Petno, chief of the bank's commercial banking, said in February.Wells Fargo's Sloan said he has seen increasing competition from non-banks as well, but added that Wells Fargo's ability to sell a wide range of products to customers has prevented it from losing too many clients.In the first quarter, companies took out $8.6 billion of second-lien loans, which are riskier as they provide lower recoveries to lenders in a default. That is the fifth-highest level on record and a 25 percent increase over each of the past two quarters, Thomson Reuters LPC data show.(Reporting by David Henry in New York, Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra, Peter Rudegeair and Michelle Sierra in New York; Writing by Dan Wilchins; Edited by Martin Howell)",2014-04-14,JPM,"Mon Apr 14, 2014 | 1:35am EDT",JPMorgan on profit drop: Be relieved we aren't taking big risks,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-chase-results-risks-idUSBREA3A1ND20140414?type=companyNews
245,"  * Momentum builds for relaunch of securitisation in Europe* Ex-IMF chief de Larosiere shows how it could work* Bank lobbyists behind the push shoot at open goal* Sceptics sound alarm at dangersBy John O'DonnellBRUSSELS, April 21 Jacques de Larosiere says he is an isolated and modest man. Yet the 84-year-old former head of the International Monetary Fund is one of the most influential voices in European and global finance.An eminence grise as respected among France's political elite as in the heart of the law-drafting European Commission, de Larosiere finds himself at the nexus of finance and rulemaking, treading a fine line between lobbying and advice.Following the financial crash, his blueprint - produced by a group of experts he led at the request of the European Commission in 2009 - shaped the most ambitious round of banking reform in Europe's history.Now he is pushing to help banks with a scheme that some experts warn could repeat mistakes that led to the collapse.His work provides a rare glimpse of the ease with which European lawmakers interact with industry and how banks, despite the crash, still shape the 'rules of the game'.He runs a Paris-based think-tank called Eurofi where investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan  pay for membership in part to interact with the officials and parliamentarians who decide the fate of their industry.Although he is no longer on its payroll, he provides advice to BNP Paribas and has an office at the bank.In biannual meetings of the Group of 30, an elite body of financiers and academics who meet around the globe, de Larosiere rubs shoulders with Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.Now he is proposing a scheme to securitise - repackage and sell to insurers, pension funds and possibly even the ECB - loans made in the go-go years that have turned into a dead weight on banks' finances. The declared aim is to make it easier for the banks, once unburdened, to lend to credit-starved small and medium-sized companies.The plan, outlined last month at a Eurofi event on the sidelines of a meeting of European finance ministers and central bankers in Athens, could play a pivotal role if the ECB embarks on quantitative easing or money printing to buy such assets.""It would provide some breathing space to the financial sector that is being stifled,"" de Larosiere told Reuters.CHANGE OF HEART There is support for such a move. Last month, the European Commission said it would loosen the rules to make it easier for insurers and pension funds to invest in securitised debt. And the ECB is warming up to its use, accepting more such debt as security in return for credit. Michel Barnier, the French commissioner in charge of regulating finance, announced that he would cut the amount of capital investors must carry to cover potential losses on such investments, paving the way for them to snap up such debt from banks, who are eager to sell.Insurers, said Barnier, have 84 trillion euros of assets, while pension funds have 37 trillion euros - money that could help unlock lending and tackle the concerns of voters over the economic malaise ahead of European elections.He was among the speakers at Eurofi in Athens, where he outlined plans to ""revive sustainable securitisation markets"", drawing a distinction between what he called ""good and bad securitisation"".It marks a change of tack when dealing with the financial industry. Having temporarily banned officials from meeting lobbyists ahead of a contested proposal to shake up the structure of big lenders, Barnier's latest rule change is more bank friendly.For Graham Bishop, an economist and advisor to the European Commission, the reason for this change of heart is clear. European businesses need their banks.While companies in the United States are ever more enthusiastic about selling bonds and raise almost as much finance this way as by borrowing from banks, euro zone firms rarely turn to financial markets.""If you are going to go banker bashing, then you bash the economy as well,"" said Bishop.

""The way to do that is to focus on 'very good, well rated, simple to understand'. Those words are important."" SUBPRIME DISASTER The market is potentially large. Banks have lent almost 4 trillion euros in loans of under 1 million euros, according to ECB data.Many in Brussels are persuaded that it makes sense to shift these loans away from banks and towards pension funds and others in the hope that banks will then be prepared to lend again.But securitisation evokes memories of the dodgy mortgages and car loans packaged by U.S. banks that triggered a credit crunch in 2007, leading to the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank, which sent shockwaves around the world and caused the 'Great Recession'.""We are not going to invite a new subprime disaster,"" said Barnier last month.Pervenche Beres, a French lawmaker in the European Parliament, is not convinced.She recalls a similar debate when she reluctantly accepted an invitation to lunch with top Goldman Sachs executives in June 2010 at their New York headquarters.""They were crystal clear that they did it all correctly ... that they were helping the economy,"" Beres told Reuters, recounting how Goldman Sachs executives argued the case for securitisation then.""I'm very sceptical,"" she said.

247,"  (Repeats story first published April 21, text unchanged)* Momentum builds for relaunch of securitisation in Europe* Ex-IMF chief de Larosiere shows how it could work* Bank lobbyists behind the push shoot at open goal* Sceptics sound alarm at dangersBy John O'DonnellBRUSSELS, April 21 Jacques de Larosiere says he is an isolated and modest man. Yet the 84-year-old former head of the International Monetary Fund is one of the most influential voices in European and global finance.An eminence grise as respected among France's political elite as in the heart of the law-drafting European Commission, de Larosiere finds himself at the nexus of finance and rulemaking, treading a fine line between lobbying and advice.Following the financial crash, his blueprint - produced by a group of experts he led at the request of the European Commission in 2009 - shaped the most ambitious round of banking reform in Europe's history.Now he is pushing to help banks with a scheme that some experts warn could repeat mistakes that led to the collapse.His work provides a rare glimpse of the ease with which European lawmakers interact with industry and how banks, despite the crash, still shape the 'rules of the game'.He runs a Paris-based think-tank called Eurofi where investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan  pay for membership in part to interact with the officials and parliamentarians who decide the fate of their industry.Although he is no longer on its payroll, he provides advice to BNP Paribas and has an office at the bank.In biannual meetings of the Group of 30, an elite body of financiers and academics who meet around the globe, de Larosiere rubs shoulders with Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.Now he is proposing a scheme to securitise - repackage and sell to insurers, pension funds and possibly even the ECB - loans made in the go-go years that have turned into a dead weight on banks' finances. The declared aim is to make it easier for the banks, once unburdened, to lend to credit-starved small and medium-sized companies.The plan, outlined last month at a Eurofi event on the sidelines of a meeting of European finance ministers and central bankers in Athens, could play a pivotal role if the ECB embarks on quantitative easing or money printing to buy such assets.""It would provide some breathing space to the financial sector that is being stifled,"" de Larosiere told Reuters.CHANGE OF HEART There is support for such a move. Last month, the European Commission said it would loosen the rules to make it easier for insurers and pension funds to invest in securitised debt. And the ECB is warming up to its use, accepting more such debt as security in return for credit. Michel Barnier, the French commissioner in charge of regulating finance, announced that he would cut the amount of capital investors must carry to cover potential losses on such investments, paving the way for them to snap up such debt from banks, who are eager to sell.Insurers, said Barnier, have 84 trillion euros of assets, while pension funds have 37 trillion euros - money that could help unlock lending and tackle the concerns of voters over the economic malaise ahead of European elections.He was among the speakers at Eurofi in Athens, where he outlined plans to ""revive sustainable securitisation markets"", drawing a distinction between what he called ""good and bad securitisation"".It marks a change of tack when dealing with the financial industry.

251,"   By Peter Murphy and Nelson Bocanegra | BOGOTA, April 25  BOGOTA, April 25 Colombia's central bank on Friday is expected to hold the benchmark lending rate unchanged for the 13th straight month as economic growth continues to gather pace, inflation remains controlled and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy persists.The bank's seven-member board, headed by Jose Dario Uribe, is likely to hold borrowing costs at 3.25 percent, according to 26 of 28 analysts surveyed by Reuters earlier in the week. Two analysts forecast a quarter-point rate increase.But the growth-promoting rate is expected to come to an end some time after May with a quarter point increase to prevent inflation moving beyond the bank's 3 percent target level.""The strong numbers in retail sales and industrial confidence as well as the evidence on a stronger recovery in the U.S., will bring to the meeting the discussion of the start of the hiking cycle in the coming months,"" Deutsche Bank said in a bulletin. ""We expect the central bank to keep the interest rate unchanged in the April meeting."" The bank also may be loathe to raise borrowing costs just yet to avoid exacerbating a surge in the peso that occurred in  March because of an influx of foreign investment into financial markets.U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan last month raised its weighting for Colombian sovereign debt in two of its indexes, prompting new investment flows.  An interest rate increase would raise returns on bonds and cause the currency to strengthen further as demand for it increased. Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said this week the central bank was momentarily speeding up dollar purchases because of the stronger peso. That will reduce the cost of building up reserves. The total $1 billion it plans to buy from April to end-June has not been altered, he said.""Up until April, there's still a shortage of information that is leaving (the board) unsettled, believing that external conditions continue to generate much uncertainty,"" said Francisco Chaves, chief economist at Corredores Asociados brokerage. The central bank shaved 200 basis points off the interest rate from July 2012 until March 2013 to boost economic growth, and has held it steady ever since, with inflation at the lower end of the bank's 2 percent to 4 percent target range.Inflation last year was the lowest since 1955 at 1.94 percent but is slowly picking up as growth accelerates and the population spends more on consumer goods.The government expects the Andean nation, with large coffee and coal sectors, and about 1 million barrels of daily oil production, to grow 4.7 percent this year, faster than 2013's expansion of 4.3 percent.

Dudley has said he is still concerned about the risk of fire sales, where one market participant may come under pressure and dump assets, leading to a contagion of falling asset prices and further selloffs.He warned in February that industry inaction on this problem might prompt regulators to introduce rules meant to contain the risk.(Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-04-28,JPM,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 9:26am EDT",JPMorgan reduces repo credit extension that concerns regulators,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jpmorgan-chase-markets-repo-idUSBREA3R0TF20140428?type=companyNews

Dudley has said he is still concerned about the risk of fire sales, where one market participant may come under pressure and dump assets, leading to a contagion of falling asset prices and further selloffs.He warned in February that industry inaction on this problem might prompt regulators to introduce rules meant to contain the risk.(Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-04-28,JPM,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 9:24am EDT",JPMorgan reduces repo credit extension that concerns regulators,http://www.reuters.com//article/jpmorgan-chase-markets-repo-idUSL2N0NK0GG20140428?type=companyNews
258,"  * Record net operating income from fixed income, currencies and commodities unit* Strong commodity earnings place bank among top peers in the sector* Analysts caution similar growth may be hard to replicate   (Rewrites throughout to add details and quotes)By Cezary PodkulNEW YORK/SYDNEY, May 2 Macquarie Group  earned A$1.1 billion ($1 billion) in net income from commodities trading in its financial year to March, propelling the Australian bank into the big leagues of much-larger American rivals who have long dominated the sector.In its first results since losing the battle to buy JPMorgan Chase & Co's physical commodities business, the biggest on Wall Street, Macquarie said its net trading income from commodities surged nearly 60 percent as the coldest winter in three decades in the United States boosted power and gas prices.Client hedging and trading in its metals and energy capital division were also up, Macquarie said.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and oil majors including BP Plc have also reported stronger trading results as the Polar Vortex slammed the United States.The one-off weather impact may make it tough to repeat the growth in the cyclical commodities business, but the gains underscore Macquarie's ambitions in commodities as Wall Street and European rivals retreat due to regulatory scrutiny and weak margins. A commodities business of that size would rank among the world's top five banks dealing in everything from oil, copper and wheat, said George Kuznetsov, head of research and analytics at Coalition, a UK consulting firm that tracks banks' trading income.The top 10 banks tracked by Coalition together made $4.5 billion trading commodities in 2013, the firm said in a report earlier this year.For Macquarie, commodities' share of the A$1.7 billion in net income from fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) - the bank's trading arm - is now 67 percent, chief executive Nicholas Moore said during an analyst presentation.That is up from about 55 percent last year. It is also well above any bank tracked by Coalition, Kuznetsov said. The strong gains in U.S. energy markets helped lift Macquarie's overall net profit over the A$1 billion ($928 million) mark for the first time in four years.Macquarie's commodities risk exposure, known as Value-at-Risk (VaR) averaged A$13 million ($12 million) in its full year, up from A$10 million a year earlier, still much smaller than its Wall Street rivals. Goldman Sachs reported an average commodity VaR of $19 million in 2013 and Morgan Stanley $21 million.""There are a lot of competitors in the commodities businesses... Some are leaving, but I can assure you there's more than enough remaining in that space,"" Macquarie chief executive Moore told analysts.Macquarie's U.S. physical natural gas marketing business is the fourth largest in North America and the firm is the biggest non-producer in the space. Just months after losing out to Swiss trader Mercuria for JPMorgan's physical operations, Macquarie said it stands by plans to grow through self-funded growth initiatives and acquisitions. The past decade has seen it make a handful of bite-sized U.S. acquisitions.It bought a natural gas trading desk, Cook Inlet Energy Supply, in 2005, and followed that with a larger deal for Constellation Energy Partners' downstream natural gas trading operations in 2009. It began trading physical power in 2007 and, eventually, physical oil in 2010.Macquarie expects the segment to benefit from better market conditions in the medium term, but analysts say weather-related trading gains in natural gas markets may not be easily replicated in coming years.""I'm sure they got some lift from this but the thing is, does it mean that it's a permanent change? I very much doubt that,"" said Al Troner, president of Asia Pacific Energy Consulting in Houston, Texas.Macquarie's FICC division, which provides trading, research, sales and financial services across the globe, posted net profit of A$726 million for the year-ended March 2014 compared with    A$563 million a year ago.The combined annual net profit for the company rose nearly 50 percent from a year ago to A$1.27 billion ($1.17 billion).($1 = 1.07715 Australian Dollars)   (Additional reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen in Singapore and Swati Pandey and Melanie Burton in Sydney; Editing by Grant McCool)",2014-05-02,JPM,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 6:54pm EDT","UPDATE 1-Macquarie tops $1 bln in commodities, joining banks' big league",http://www.reuters.com//article/australia-macquarie-group-commodities-idUSL3N0NO3W820140502?type=companyNews

The settlement, which is subject to final court approval, would resolve a class action lawsuit filed in 2008.The accord marks the third-largest settlement in a U.S. class action against banks that packaged and sold mortgage securities at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.The class action was led by the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi, which had sued over what it said were untrue statements and omissions in connection with $36.8 billion in mortgage securities issued in 2006 and 2007. The lawsuit accused JPMorgan of ignoring its standards and guidelines when evaluating and buying loans included in 33 offerings of mortgage securities.After a series of rulings, MissPERS ultimately moved forward on a narrower case that would cover investor claims stemming from 26 offerings of mortgage-backed securities. The settlement resolves claims held by investors in those offerings.A hearing on final settlement approval is scheduled for July 24. David Stickney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, declined comment. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment.The JPMorgan settlement, which was filed with the court in March, follows a deal announced in February in which Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L) agreed to pay $275 million to resolve similar mortgage-backed securities claims.

Although the mining sector has been dogged by concerns about an economic slowdown in China - which is the world's biggest metals consumer - JP Morgan pointed to signs of a rebound in Chinese economic activity.Earlier this month, data showed China's exports and imports returned to slight growth in April as orders to the United States and European Union surged. That was a positive signal for the world's second-largest economy after a weaker-than-expected start to 2014. ""Clearly such a bullish upgrade on the mining sector from JP Morgan is always going to have a knock on effect on the FTSE,"" said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.""The rally in the miners has also been helped by a strengthening in copper, as well as an uplift on gold that has again bounced upwards from support.""Macquarie strategist Daniel McCormack said concerns over Ukraine, where Kiev authorities have clashed with pro-Moscow supporters, could curb the FTSE's progress in the near-term. Mayne also saw more value in the actual commodities themselves, such as gold and silver, than in equity indexes or individual mining shares.Mayne added he was tempted to ""short"" the FTSE - to bet on it retreating in the near-term - while taking up positions to bet on more gains in metal prices.But McCormack was more bullish on the FTSE over the longer term, with many investors expecting the FTSE to hit a record high of 7,000 points later this year. The index is up by around 1.4 percent since the start of 2014.""Longer term, there is still quite a bit of upside to come because I do think that earnings will improve,"" he said.

280,"  * Deutsche aims to remain a global investment bank player* Chairman to make case for capital hike* Deutsche culture shift to take time to completeBy Thomas  AtkinsFRANKFURT, May 19 Paul Achleitner, the chairman of Deutsche Bank, believes Europe needs a global investment bank to support the region's companies that can measure up to rivals in the United States.For that reason, Deutsche on Monday asked shareholders for 8 billion euros ($10.98 billion) to help the bank keep its place in the shrinking ""bulge bracket"" of big investment banks that includes JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi and Morgan Stanley.While other European banks such as UBS are scaling back in investment banking, Deutsche remains the only European investment bank to have avoided wholesale job cuts and the only one aiming to represent European companies in the capital markets worldwide.""Our continent is at a turning point where it needs to decide whether it wants to belong to the champion's league of financial markets participants,"" Achleitner said earlier this year.Achleitner wants big, and so does corporate Germany, which regards Deutsche Bank as a national institution that can support the world's biggest exporter after China.When Achleitner was at Goldman Sachs, he advised Deutsche on its 1999 purchase of Bankers Trust, a deal that catapulted it into the big league. But in 2000, as CFO at Allianz, he tried to stitch the insurer into a merged Dresdner and Deutsche Bank, a mega-deal that fell apart soon after it was announced.""Germany and the euro zone need a big investment bank and you have only one left and that is Deutsche Bank,"" Joachim Faber, chairman of the supervisory board of Deutsche Boerse, said. ""The business community is very aware the Deutsche Bank is very important to Germany.""So when 57-year-old Achleitner stands before the bank's annual shareholder meeting on May 22, he must make the case for the capital hike and the bank's turnaround plan, which also aims to overhaul the bank's culture after a string of scandals. Achleitner, who joined Deutsche as head of the supervisory board in 2012, is pressuring management to settle what the bank calls ""legacy issues"" before the end of the year.But the list of remaining cases - which includes everything from interest rate-rigging to mortgage mis-selling - is long and the bank's hope of clearing the decks quickly is fading.That has cast a pall over co-chief executives Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen and fuelled speculation in the German media that one or both will not serve out their contracts to 2017.Achleitner, who has to have alternate CEO candidates at-the-ready, rejects the notion that he himself would grab the wheel.""I am quite hands-on as far as supervisory board matters are concerned (but) I do not, nor do I wish to, serve in an executive function. This is ridiculous,"" he told Reuters last week. CULTURE CHANGE Shortly after Fitschen, Jain and Achleitner took up their jobs in mid-2012, Deutsche Bank began its big overhaul which has included technology, structure, compensation and compliance. But Achleitner's hardest battle is to change the bank's culture.""The public doesn't understand anything about cultural change,"" Juergen Hambrecht, former CEO of chemical company BASF and architect of the bank's reformed compensation system, said.""People think it's like switching on a light. But that doesn't work. It is a fundamental change in the way the bank and all employees see themselves.""Hambrecht, a sometimes provocative advocate of corporate Germany and its needs, said the problem with ""pre-reform"" Deutsche Bank was that it was more concerned about making money than serving customers. ""The client was nowhere. The client wasn't important,"" Hambrecht said. ""It was the individual banker himself who mattered and the main question was, how could the bank advance its interests, regardless of the client.""Cultural transformation at Deutsche, Hambrecht said, will take another five to ten years to complete. ""Deutsche Bank is in fact on the right path but the past is a burden that cannot be gotten rid of so quickly.""Two years into the revamp, the bank on Monday diluted and delayed its original goals by one year, which means, in effect, it will take until 2016 to get to where it wants to be.Achleitner, also a part-time professor who often dresses more like an academic than sharp-suited banker, has asked for patience as the reforms take effect. ""The success of a strategy cannot be measured by quarterly results,"" he said.Germany's financial watchdog Bafin recently appeared dissatisfied with progress. It criticised the bank in a confidential report leaked to local media. In it, the watchdog said Deutsche failed to practice what it preached, namely, promoting cultural change but not firing senior staff who oversaw divisions implicated in an interest-rate scandal.Dieter Hein, an independent equity analyst at Fairesearch, said both Jain and Achleitner need to be replaced to clearly show that Deutsche Bank has transformed itself.""This cultural transformation is not credible and indeed won't be credible in the future unless Deutsche Bank replaces Anshu Jain and Paul Achleitner,"" Hein said. Both, Hein said, were integral parts of the system that created the crisis.But leaving aside Deutsche's cultural problems, there is little doubt that corporate Germany and Berlin want Europe to have a strong investment bank to protect its interests on the world stage.Deutsche Boerse's Faber, for example, said Bafin's harsh tone toward Germany's financial flagship should not be mistaken for lack of support for having a big, German bank.""There is no risk of failure. It would be suicidal for corporate Germany,"" he said.($1 = 0.7289 Euros)   (Reporting by Thomas Atkins, editing by Jane Merriman)",2014-05-19,JPM,"Mon May 19, 2014 | 3:57pm EDT",Deutsche Bank chairman leads battle for the bulge bracket,http://www.reuters.com//article/deutsche-bank-chairman-idUSL6N0O53RN20140519?type=companyNews

The executive pay was approved by 78 percent.Unlike last year, when some shareholders unsuccessfully pushed to have Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon stripped of one of the two titles, there were no major controversies at Tuesday's meeting.The company won agreements earlier this year with activist shareholders to not take another vote on whether to split the roles of chairman and CEO, both of which Dimon currently holds. In exchange, the bank agreed to develop some type of public event on criteria that boards should use in setting up the two roles, activists said in February. In addition, JPMorgan will provide more details of its risk mitigation efforts, both sides said, leading to the withdrawal of a related proposal.Last year, a proposal to separate the chairmanship and CEO jobs brought out campaigns from both sides. Dimon's allies suggested at the time he might leave the company if he lost one of the titles. The proposal won support from just 32 percent of votes that were cast. At last year's meeting three of 11 directors received less than 60 percent of the vote, and two left the board shortly after.

A source familiar with the situation said Pfizer is unlikely to pay any fees if the deal is not consummated. Pfizer has not yet discussed the matter with its banks and is expected to follow its policy of not paying any consolation fees, the source said.As a lead adviser to the U.S. company, JP Morgan would have earned the biggest share of the fees.AstraZeneca's advisers, however, are expected to receive 5-10 percent of their $130 million fee pool, according to estimates by U.S.-based Freeman Consulting Services (FCS).The British company's advisers Robey Warshaw, Evercore , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs would have earned up to $130 million and are set to miss out on about $32.5 million each, FCS estimates. With its low-cost structure, the newly formed Robey Warshaw advisory boutique is likely to benefit most from the deal, even if it fails. As a lead adviser to AstraZeneca, the firm led by former Morgan Stanley banker Simon Robey and ex-UBS dealmaker Simon Warshaw is set to receive up to $10 million - a huge amount for a team of less than 10 people.AstraZeneca, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Robey Warshaw and Evercore all declined to comment, while Pfizer, Morgan Stanley, Guggenheim Securities were not immedialtey available for comment.Buyside advisers tend to earn more money than those acting on a deal defence because the preparation for a takeover bid requires more work. However, AstraZeneca's advisers would have received an extra payout if Pfizer's bid had gone hostile. M&A MONEYSPINNERS Severn Trent paid its advisers 19 million pounds ($32 million) for helping them to see off a bid consortium led by Candian infrastrucure investor Borealis. Some industry players and media observers questioned whether bankers deserved such a high sum for a four-week tussle in a regulated sector with no formal bid on the table.Marks & Spencer shelled out nearly 39 million pounds in 2004 to rebuff a takeover bid led by former executive Philip Green and develop a new standalone strategy.Under siege from fellow miner BHP Billiton , Rio Tinto  ran up miscellaneous costs of $325 million in 2008.Thomson Reuters data shows that M&A fees for completed transactions are up 1 percent since January at $7.4 billion, reflecting the increase in activity this year. M&A volumes rose by 54 percent in the first quarter, driven by a string of large deals.Goldman Sachs currently tops the rankings for global M&A advisory by deal volume and fees, Thomson Reuters data shows. JP Morgan ranks second by fees and fourth by announced transactions, while Robey Warshaw is 13th for global advisory.

He was pronounced dead at the scene. (ID:nL5N0L22CK) His body was visible for hours to workers overlooking the JP Morgan tower in Canary Wharf.""I am wholly satisfied that Gabriel jumped off the 32nd floor with the intention of killing himself,"" senior coroner Mary Hassell said in her conclusion.She also said it was clear that work performance issues he had previously faced were consequences of personal troubles. The inquest got written evidence from a senior toxicologist that Magee, an American, had an alcohol level nearly three times the legal driving limit. An empty bottle of tequila was found among his possessions.COMPUTER NOTES JP Morgan's head of investigations, Jonathan Shatford, told Poplar Coroner's court that a note was found on Magee's computer to ""jump"" from January 27. Another note two weeks earlier read ""try to jump off building."" He also said evidence from Magee's swipe card showed he tried to reach the roof and upper floors twice before his death, starting from November 2013. A padlock had been cut and Magee had climbed a step ladder to get to the roof, he said.Mark Gibbons, a friend and colleague, said that although Magee had seemed happy, there had been a previous incident in New York when Magee had sent an email along the lines that he ""couldn't handle this"" before disappearing for a short while. His former line manager, Andrew Harding told, the court that Magee asked for and received a reduced working week and that after a holiday in September, he seemed in a better frame of mind and his work improved.The inquest also heard from several witnesses that Magee had been upset in early 2013, a year before his death, when he split up with his girlfriend. But Maya Cooray, a therapist who saw Magee for several months from March 2013, said she saw no signs of paranoia or depression during the 10-odd occasions they met.Magee's was the second confirmed suicide by a London-based bank worker in 2014.

Mark Gibbons, a friend and colleague, said that although Magee had seemed happy, there had been a previous incident in New York when Magee had sent an email along the lines that he ""couldn't handle this"" before disappearing for a short while.His former line manager, Andrew Harding told, the court that Magee asked for and received a reduced working week and that after a holiday in September, he seemed in a better frame of mind and his work improved.The inquest also heard from several witnesses that Magee had been upset in early 2013, a year before his death, when he split up with his girlfriend. But Maya Cooray, a therapist who saw Magee for several months from March 2013, said she saw no signs of paranoia or depression during the 10-odd occasions they met.Magee's was the second confirmed suicide by a London-based bank worker in 2014. He died just two days after the wife of a former senior manager at Deutsche Bank found him hanging at their home.An inquest in March heard that William Broeksmit, 58, left several suicide notes and had been ""very anxious"" about the authorities investigating areas of banking where he had worked.",2014-05-20,JPM,"Tue May 20, 2014 | 10:54am EDT","UPDATE 2-JP Morgan exec killed himself leaping from UK building, inquest rules",http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-jpmorgan-chase-inquest-idUSL6N0O62XM20140520?type=companyNews

288,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS European Union antitrust regulators charged Europe's biggest bank HSBC, U.S. peer JPMorgan and France's Credit Agricole on Tuesday with rigging financial benchmarks linked to the euro, exposing them to potential fines.The European Commission also said it would charge broker ICAP soon for suspected manipulation of the yen Libor financial benchmark.U.S. and European regulators have so far handed down some $6 billion in fines to 10 banks and brokerages for rigging the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its euro cousin Euribor while prosecutors have also charged 16 men with fraud-related offences.""The Commission has concerns that the three banks may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro interest rate derivatives,"" the EU competition authority said.The three banks and ICAP, which refused to settle the case in December, could face penalties of up to 10 percent of their global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules. JPMorgan said the EU charges were without merit and that it would defend itself while Credit Agricole said it would examine the charge sheet. HSBC said it would defend itself vigorously.In December a record 1.7-billion-euro ($2.3 billion) fine was levied on six banks including Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Citigroup for similar offences. The lenders settled their charges and received a 10-percent cut in their fines.Asked about the ongoing Libor probe against ICAP, European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a news conference: ""In the coming days or weeks, we will probably issue a new statement of objections against the broker."" ICAP, the world's largest interdealer broker, declined to comment. It was one of 10 institutions fined by U.S. and European authorities last September for rigging yen Libor benchmarks.Almunia also said regulators have yet to decide on the next step of an ongoing investigation into suspected rigging and collusion in the trillion-dollar foreign exchange market, the world's biggest marketplace.""We received lots of information and we are looking into this information...We are not yet at this moment when I can announce steps of this case,"" he said. Almunia can choose to open a formal investigation into the case or keep things under wraps if enough banks decide to settle any charges and only announce a decision at the end.More than 30 foreign exchange traders at many of the world's biggest banks have been put on leave, suspended or fired as the forex probes in the various countries expand.The probe focuses on activity related to the key foreign exchange benchmark, known as the WM/Reuters fix, which is tied to several exchange rates including the euro, sterling, Swiss franc and yen set daily in London.These are compiled using data from Thomson Reuters and other providers, and are calculated by WM Company, a unit of State Street Corp, and are important because they are used as reference rates for trillions of dollars worth of investments, trade and corporate deals around the world.(Additional reporting by Steve Slater and Clare Hutchison in London and Maya Nikolaeva in Paris; Editing by Louise Heavens)",2014-05-20,JPM,"Tue May 20, 2014 | 9:28am EDT","EU Commission charges HSBC, JPMorgan, Credit Agricole with rigging",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-eu-banks-eurorigging-idUSBREA4J08W20140520?type=companyNews

290,"  JPMorgan Chase & Co announced a $100 million, five-year commitment on Wednesday to help spur bankrupt Detroit's economic recovery.The plan, which the bank developed over several months with community and government leaders, includes $50 million to finance capital projects in struggling Detroit neighborhoods and for small businesses, $25 million to address residential property blight and $12.5 million for job training.""With this investment, we are putting our resources and expertise to work to help Detroit chart a course back to economic prosperity,"" JPMorgan Chase Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. ""We have been in Detroit for a very long time, and we're here for the long term."" Detroit, which filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history last July, has also gathered $466 million in pledges from philanthropic foundations and the Detroit Institute of Arts museum for a key element in its plan to adjust $18 billion of city debt. The institute, in turn, has approached Detroit's three automakers for help in raising its $100 million share. The so-called grand bargain, which also requires a $195 million lump sum payment from the state of Michigan, would be used to ease pension cuts for Detroit retirees and protect the museum's art work from being sold to raise money to pay city creditors. A U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing on the debt plan is scheduled to begin July 24. JPMorgan Chase's commitment also allocates $7 million to provide support for Detroit's small business clusters and a $5.5 million investment in strategic initiatives, such as a light rail system, that are considered essential for the city's economic growth. The bank said it will deploy volunteers from its work force to lend their expertise to nonprofit groups in the city.(Reporting by Karen Pierog; Editing by Peter Galloway)",2014-05-21,JPM,"Wed May 21, 2014 | 10:56am EDT",JPMorgan Chase pledges $100 million to aid Detroit recovery,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-detroit-chase-idUSBREA4K0NF20140521?type=companyNews

294,"  (Adds details)By Andrew Longstreth and Josephine MasonNEW YORK May 23 Wall Street banks, big metal merchants and the London Metal Exchange face a lawsuit alleging they have artificially inflated  zinc prices, expanding a high-profile legal case that has until now centered on the larger aluminum market.In a filing on Friday, Duncan Galvanizing, one of the oldest galvanizers in the United States, accused Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, the LME and metal warehouse operators of conspiring since 2010 to manipulate the U.S. zinc price.The suit, registered in the Southern District of New York, is the first to include allegations over the impact of warehousing on the smaller, niche zinc market. Zinc is used to coat steel to protect against corrosion.The lawsuit names as defendants the mining and commodities trading group Glencore Xstrata and its Pacorini Metals USA LLC unit. Metro International Trade Services, the metal warehousing of Goldman Sachs, is also named a defendant.The lawsuit, which seeks class action status, echoes the allegations made in 26 suits that have been consolidated into a class-action suits over alleged price fixing of the aluminum market in the United States.JPMorgan and Glencore declined to comment on the lawsuit. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said it intended to ""vigorously contest the suit."" LME did not respond to a request for comment.Frustration over long waiting times and inflated prices at metals warehouses across the world has led to growing criticism of banks that own commodity assets and trade raw materials and has captured regulatory and public attention in the United States.Complaints about escalating costs of aluminum by major users like Coca Cola and MillersCoors which use the metal to make beverage cans have caught public and political attention, but long queues and inflated prices have been a big problem across other base metals, market participants say.The lawsuit claims the defendants used a variety of means to restrain trade in zinc, including by manipulating LME rules to ensure long queues for metals and shuttling zinc between warehouses for no reason other than to ""cause and exacerbate anticompetitive effects."" Like aluminum, physical prices of zinc have soared in recent years due to the queues, costing endusers billions of extra dollars each year.Premiums, paid on top of the benchmark LME zinc price for physical delivery, have soared since 2010, Richard Brooks, who owns Duncan Galvanizing, a small family-owned coating company based in Massachusetts, said on Friday.He pays between 8 and 10 cents per lb for zinc premiums, up from 2-4 cents four years ago before the long wait times appeared. ""If we can stabilize the pricing, it can make the market competitive for us again,"" said Brooks, whose company coats everything from microchips with gold to bridges with zinc, by phone on Friday.""I'm a small player and I enjoy being in business. It's not for the reward. It's for what's right.""Most of the ire over zinc queues is centered on LME warehouses in New Orleans, where 80 percent of the zinc in the exchange-registered stockpile is stored. Pacorini operates most of the sheds in that port city.The lawsuit will likely stir the debate over how to solve the years-long problem over long queues that have plagued the LME for years.The exchange, the world's biggest and oldest metal exchange, has announced plans for a sweeping overhaul of its storage policy aimed at easing logjams.Facing political and regulatory pressure for its involvement in physical commodity markets, Goldman Sachs this week put Metro up for sale. JPMorgan is selling its physical commodities business, including its warehousing unit Henry Bath.The case is Duncan Galvanizing Corp v.

302,"   By Steve Slater | LONDON  LONDON Investors owning almost 6 billion shares rejected the pay plans of 10 of the world's biggest banks in recent weeks as anger over excessive bonuses reached record levels in Britain and jumped sharply from a year ago in the United States.Hefty bankers' bonuses have been blamed for contributing to the 2008/09 financial crisis and banks have since changed pay structures, but many politicians, shareholders and members of the general public say the industry has not gone far enough.""While some changes in behavior are taking place, these are not deep or broad enough. The industry still prizes short-term profit over long-term prudence, today’s bonus over tomorrow’s relationship,"" Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said this week.Shareholder opposition to executive pay at five European and five U.S. banks averaged 17.5 percent at their annual meetings in April and May, according to Reuters' analysis of votes.That was up from an average of 9.5 percent across the same 10 banks last year, but was slightly down from the record rebellion of 19.2 percent of votes in 2012.Opposition at British banks this year hit record levels, led by 41 percent of shareholders at Standard Chartered voting against its executive pay plan. At Barclays more than one-third of voters failed to back its plan, including abstentions.Eugenia Jackson, head of governance at F&C Investments, which has 82 billion pounds in assets under management and voted against remuneration reports at Barclays, HSBC, UBS and others, said lower revenues and profits in investment banking and tougher capital requirements had put even more scrutiny on how banks plan to adapt pay levels.""It's an even bigger concern than it was before because we are now coming to the realization that the old business models have to change, and as a result they have to rethink the compensation,"" Jackson said. ""Say on pay"" votes on bank executives' compensation are not binding, although there is growing pressure to change that.Some banks held binding votes on some aspects of pay policy this year and investors at UK banks had to vote on a separate pay policy that set out three-year pay plans. It passed at all banks, but was rejected by 21 percent of HSBC shareholders who voted.Opposition above 5 percent on proposals recommended by a company are typically regarded as a protest vote, with anything over 10 percent seen as significant. During Britain's ""shareholder spring"" in 2012, when investors became more vocal with criticism, opposition to remuneration reports averaged 7 percent across the top 350 UK companies.Investors are typically most concerned about the pay in investment banking businesses, where bonuses are highest and form a big share of overall expenses. At the five U.S. firms with major investment banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, opposition to compensation reports averaged 13.3 percent, up from 9.1 percent last year but below 2011 and 2012 levels.There were significant protest votes at Switzerland's UBS and Credit Suisse, although the scale of opposition did not reach the levels seen in 2012 and 2010.Investors raised concerns about various issues around pay, including awards to chief executives, the structure of new ""allowances"" for thousands of staff and whether targets were challenging enough, but the main issue remained that high pay is unjustified while returns are sluggish, and a bigger share of revenues should go to shareholders via dividends.""We don't think there's a good case for paying high bonuses when banks are still reporting a return on equity below their cost of capital. We are happy for management and employees to be paid well, as long as shareholders get the return on their investment,"" Jackson said. Banks were not alone in seeing shareholders flex their muscles this year and pharmaceuticals, mining and other firms also came under fire.Politicians are encouraging investors to hold companies more to account, although major investors often prefer to work behind the scenes with firms and avoid public disagreements.Standard Life Investments joined F&C in publicly opposing Barclays' remuneration report, and it also opposed HSBC's proposal on pay policy.Often it is small shareholders who make the loudest noise, accusing boards of failing to look after their interests.""It's jam tomorrow for the shareholders, but champagne today for the investment bankers,"" Anthony Lee, a small shareholder in Barclays, said to applause at the bank's fiery London meeting.

304,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The City of Los Angeles has sued JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), accusing the largest U.S. bank of engaging in discriminatory mortgage lending practices that drove up foreclosures among minority borrowers.The lawsuit on Friday is part of the second most populous U.S. city's effort to hold mortgage lenders liable for lost property tax revenue caused by falling home values, and the cost to maintain vacant foreclosed properties.""LA continues to suffer from the foreclosure crisis - from blight in our neighborhoods to diminished revenue for basic city services,"" City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. ""We're fighting to hold those we allege are responsible to account.""The complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court accused JPMorgan of engaging in a ""continuous pattern and practice of mortgage discrimination"" in the city since 2004.It said the New York-based bank's practices included redlining, where minority borrowers are denied credit on the same terms as other borrowers, and reverse redlining, where borrowers in minority neighborhoods are flooded with subprime loans they cannot afford despite qualifying for better terms.""We are disappointed the L.A. City Attorney is pursuing an adversarial approach to address city finances impacted by the recent economic downturn,"" JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said in a statement. ""The downturn was beyond our control."" The bank said it would defend itself against the lawsuit.

Baltimore, Cleveland and Memphis, Tennessee are among other cities to bring similar cases against banks. Atlanta-area counties have also sued HSBC.  Los Angeles said JPMorgan loans made from 2004 to 2011 in predominantly black or Latino neighborhoods were 2.19 times more likely to go into foreclosure than loans in mainly white areas. It said loans to minority borrowers went into foreclosure faster.Part of the case was based on confidential statements from former JPMorgan employees.One, a former mortgage loan officer, accused the bank of refusing to help struggling borrowers, and instead often ""just waiting for the sheriff to come around"" and foreclose. There were about 200,000 foreclosures in Los Angeles from 2008 to 2012, causing the loss of $78.8 billion in home values, the complaint said.

308,"   By Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK, June 3  NEW YORK, June 3 In a big gain for a regional Texas firm, 3-year-old U.S. Capital Advisors hired five brokers over the last two weeks from UBS AG's Wealth Management Americas and JPMorgan Chase & Co, who together managed a combined $500 million in client assets.The four-person team from UBS, led by Todd Lavergne, officially started Tuesday, May 27, while Amanda Ton, previously of J.P. Morgan Securities, began May 19.U.S. Capital Advisors' founder and CEO Patrick Mendenhall called the hiring of Lavergne and his team, which includes Ryan Ringuet, Aaron Geller, Nick Erwin and $3.2 million in annual production, a ""reunion,"" because they worked together at UBS.Lavergne took over as the managing director of Mendenhall's complex at UBS when Mendenhall left in 2009 to create U.S. Capital Advisors. Lavergne led the complex for roughly a year and a half before stepping down to go into full time production at UBS, where he assembled his team. ""We have always been friends (although) we competed when I started this business and he was at UBS,"" Mendenhall said.U.S. Capital Advisors is an independent firm with just under 100 employees focused on wealth management, capital markets, energy consulting and public finance in Texas. It has two additional offices in Dallas and Austin. Ton was hired as a managing director and will also advise clients in a move to expand U.S. Capital's client base of medical professionals.Ton spent 17 years at J.P. Morgan's branch at the Texas Medical Center and will bring with her $300 million in assets and a client base of top doctors and surgeons, Mendenhall said. She left JP Morgan in March amid allegations that she asked her assistant to take part in certain company training programs unrelated to securities, according to records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.Ton could not be reached for comment. US Capital Advisors' general counsel Therese Surprenant said she carefully scrutinized the allegations against Ton and found no reason to be concerned about her hiring.A spokeswoman from J.P.

310,"  * JPMorgan previously withdrew from deal amid China hiring probe* BofA, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS named global coordinators* Company scrapped London listing plan in favour of Hong Kong   (Adds banks working on the deal; background of JPMorgan withdrawal)HONG KONG, June 3 China's Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd is seeking to raise between $636 million and $818 million in an Hong Kong initial public offering, according to a term sheet of the deal seen by Reuters on Tuesday.The listing drew attention in January this year when JPMorgan stepped aside from the deal, amid an investigation by U.S. authorities into its hiring practices in China. JPMorgan's exit was driven by concerns raised about the bank's employment of Joyce Wei, the daughter of Tianhe Chemicals Chairman Qi Wei, IFR reported at the time, citing sources.Hong Kong securities licence filings show that a Jiao Wei worked at JPMorgan from January 2012 to August 2013, and is now on the staff at UBS, joining the Swiss bank in October. Jiao is Joyce Wei's Chinese name, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. JPMorgan and UBS declined to comment on the reports at the time.UBS is one of four joint global coordinators on the Tianhe  Chemicals IPO, the term sheet showed, along with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs. Tianhe Chemicals is offering shares between HK$1.75 and HK$2.25 each, with 72.5 percent of the offer consisting of new shares and the rest being sold by existing shareholders.The company, which makes lubricating oil additives and special fluorides, had planned to list in London in 2011 but eventually decided that Hong Kong has a bigger pool of investors for Chinese companies, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.The deal size could increase up to $940 million if the so-called greenshoe option is exercised to meet additional demand for the stock, the term sheet showed.

311,"   By Megan Davies | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Russian investment banking activity has been hit this year by the faltering economy and the Ukraine crisis, putting pressure on Moscow bankers to get creative in offering local firms different ways to raise capital instead of the standard fare of international share and bond issues.Russian investment banking fee income has fallen by about a third to $166 million in the year to date compared with the same period last year, with a marked squeeze in the last few months, according to Thomson Reuters data.The imposition of U.S. and EU sanctions on some Russian individuals and firms caused a sell-off in the rouble and equity markets, forcing many companies to postpone plans to raise equity and debt capital and raising fears amongst local investment bankers about potential jobs cuts.Some banks have already reallocated staff, said one Moscow-based banker, who asked not to be named. ""Some people primarily or solely focused on Russia are now not on Russia any more. Some people have moved back to London and don't do Russia any more or do Russia as part of a broad scope,"" he said.Major U.S. and European investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank have built up prominent businesses in Moscow, where they work alongside or compete with state-controlled banks Sberbank and VTB for work on mergers and acquisitions (M&A), share issues and debt capital markets.""It became evident that growth slowed considerably,"" said a second banker who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""So I think there are quite a few firms that are probably making assessments on these events regarding staffing.""DEAL DROUGHT Russian economic growth is expected to grind to a near-halt this year while capital outflows during the first quarter totaled $63.7 billion - more than during the whole of 2013 - partly as companies and households switched into foreign currencies.

But the fears have not yet led to widespread job cuts because foreign banks are keenly aware that it is hard to rebuild a business in a country where having political goodwill is key. A source at one of the major global banks in Russia said that headcount was largely flat and there were no cuts happening at the moment.MIXED FORTUNES The situation in Russia is trickier for U.S. institutions, the heads of which were advised by Washington not to attend a high-profile investment forum last month in St Petersburg.

LOCAL FINANCING PRODUCTS   Transactions such as the share listing of German retailer Metro's Russian wholesale business and Russia's long-delayed privatization programme have been put on hold due to the Ukraine crisis. Meanwhile Moody's credit agency said on Tuesday it estimated that the volume of new corporate rouble bond issuances over the next year will fall to its lowest level since 2009. As standard types of transaction have been frozen, bankers have seen opportunities for alternative products as foreign companies make contingency plans for their Russian subsidiaries or local companies look for alternative ways to raise capital.Foreign companies, concerned about deploying more capital abroad to finance units in Russia, have been inquiring about local financing for their subsidiaries, said Dimitri Casvigny, head of Industrials at Sberbank CIB.

319,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK, June 9  NEW YORK, June 9 Large U.S. banks are finding the billions of dollars they paid in recent years to settle lawsuits and fix broken businesses are coming back to haunt them in another place: their capital requirements.Under the new global rules known as ""Basel III,"" banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc must hold more capital to account for potential losses from trading scandals, regulatory probes and related issues.Regulators are concerned that such potential problems, known as ""operational risk,"" can be severe enough to hobble banks. In recent tests, the Federal Reserve estimated that losses from operational risk and related problems reduced earnings during a period of market turmoil by about a third.""It speaks volumes that some of the most significant losses banks have sustained in the last several years were attributable not to the loans they made but rather to lapses in operational risk management and the ensuing legal judgments, regulatory fines and reputational damage,"" the U.S. comptroller of the currency, Thomas Curry, said in a speech last month.These losses have come at most big banks: JPMorgan Chase lost over $6 billion on bad derivatives trades in 2012; large mortgage lenders have struggled to foreclose on homes because they could not find critical paperwork; and Bank of America Corp  has agreed to pay over $50 billion in crisis-related legal settlements.Although Basel III rules were finalized for U.S. banks last year, they are still coming to grips with the level of capital they need to set aside after U.S. regulators in February said eight big U.S. banks can use their own models to determine the riskiness of their assets and operations.For individual banks, the extra capital can be enormous. Regulators told JPMorgan Chase it needed to hold over $30 billion in capital to offset operational risk exposures, almost four times the level it needed in 2010 and around twice the capital it holds for market risk, finance chief Marianne Lake said in February. That $30 billion is about 20 percent of the bank's current Basel III capital. Executives argue that regulators' demands are excessive. Bank of America finance chief Bruce Thompson told investors in April the bank received no capital relief from businesses it exited, like packaging and selling private-label mortgage bonds.People familiar with regulators' thinking said that even if banks have shed problematic businesses, they have often not addressed factors like poor oversight of employees or vendors that resulted in the losses.Higher capital requirements reduce profitability, encouraging banks to push their regulatory capital as low as possible. The U.S. government had to rescue banks during the financial crisis because many of them had insufficient capital.Fed officials fear that the banks' ability to use their own models allows them to understate risk, and instead they view the Fed's own test of how assets perform under stress as the main measure of safety. But the ""stress tests"" also account for operational risk. Even if the Fed shifts to another risk measure, banks will hold more capital to account for it.THE BIGGEST RISK  For years most U.S. banks paid scant attention to operational risk because earlier versions of Basel neglected it.

320,"   By Aruna Viswanatha and Karen Freifeld | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The U.S. Justice Department is spending some of the $13 billion JPMorgan Chase & Co agreed to pay to settle claims stemming from mortgage misdeeds to speed up similar punishments against other lenders, possibly including Bank of America Corp and Citigroup, according to people familiar with the matter.     U.S. Attorney's offices that have been among the most active in probing banks over the toxic loans they bundled into mortgage securities and sold to investors have received funds to hire new civil prosecutors, the people said.U.S. Attorneys in New Jersey, Colorado and the Eastern District of California, based in Sacramento, are among those most experienced in pursuing the probes, the people said.     The increased activity is a sign that President Barack Obama is trying to follow through on his 2012 pledge to hold more banks accountable for their role in the housing crisis, after prosecutors faced criticism for little high-profile action. Attorney General Eric Holder has also expressed a desire to wrap up more of mortgage securities-related cases this year.    ""There is a widespread recognition that the banks have not yet been held fully accountable for their origination practices and the harm that did to borrowers, investors and the American economy in general,"" said Don Hawthorne, a partner with Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider in New York who has represented clients in mortgage-backed securities litigation.       The Justice Department's portion of the JPMorgan settlement went to the U.S. Treasury, but the department can keep up to three percent of money it collects for other federal agencies to use for certain purposes. The DOJ settlement with JPMorgan also resolved lawsuits from other agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.    In addition to Bank of America and Citigroup, the government has been investigating other banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse AG, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, people familiar with the investigations said.    In the wake of the government's landmark settlement against JPMorgan last year to resolve probes into shoddy mortgage securities, authorities may reach settlements with both Bank of America and Citigroup this summer over similar charges, people familiar with the matter said. The JPMorgan settlement included about $4 billion to resolve claims from the Federal Housing Finance Agency.    Bank of America has discussed paying about $12 billion, with more than $5 billion of that going to help struggling borrowers, to resolve a range of federal and state probes, according to people familiar with the talks. That would be on top of the $6.3 billion the bank has already paid to resolve claims from the FHFA. The Justice Department suggested a $17 billion settlement in the latest round of negotiations and did not view Bank of America's most recent offer as a serious one, one of the people said.Reuters could not determine the range of penalties Citigroup is potentially facing, but one analyst estimated the bank could face a settlement of about $5 billion, including about $2 billion in consumer relief.    Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment on the investigations and negotiations. Representatives of Goldman, Citigroup, RBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.Representatives of the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney offices in New Jersey, Colorado and Sacramento declined comment. As part of the effort to accelerate the probes, the Justice Department is also spreading the work among offices with experience in similar cases, and in some situations reassigning cases. An investigation into Goldman Sachs, for example, was moved from the U.S. Attorney's office in Philadelphia to Sacramento, which had worked on the JPMorgan case, according to two people familiar with the matter. Representatives of both of those offices declined comment.          MERRILL PROBE     The negotiations between Bank of America and the Justice Department, fueled by a threatened lawsuit against Merrill Lynch from civil prosecutors in New Jersey, have yielded back-to-back meetings in the past two weeks, one source said, though no meetings have yet been scheduled after the bank's latest offer.The U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey is drafting its complaint against Merrill, though does not have specific plans to file it yet, the person said.  Bank of America agreed to acquire Merrill at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, along with some of its liabilities.     The probes date to 2012, when Obama directed the Justice Department to create a task force to investigate the packaging and sale of home loans. After earlier inquiries fizzled, the Justice Department took a more systematic approach, issuing more than a dozen subpoenas in early 2012 to financial institutions.        Civil fraud inquiries into banks including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were prioritized, sources said. Holder took an active interest in the investigations, receiving regular briefings on developments.       Three U.S. Attorney offices divided the investigations into Bank of America and its units, with Los Angeles examining Countrywide, Charlotte taking on Bank of America itself, and New Jersey leading the probe of Merrill Lynch, sources said.    A magistrate judge earlier this year recommended dismissing a lawsuit the U.S. Attorney's office in Charlotte brought against the bank over fraud in the sale of mortgage securities, and a federal district judge considered the recommendation at a Wednesday hearing, a ruling in which could give the bank leverage in negotiations.      The talks also include the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, which has been investigating whether the bank properly submitted mortgage loans for government insurance provided by the Federal Housing Administration, people familiar with the matter said.    That probe has focused on loans the bank made after May 2009, since Bank of America paid about $500 million in 2012 to resolve liability over loans it sold earlier than that. Mortgage originations plunged in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, however, and it's unclear how much liability the bank faces through that inquiry.     The Justice Department's negotiations are being led by its No. 3 official, Tony West, who oversees the agency's civil efforts. Bank of America's team includes Meyer Koplow of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and the bank's general counsel Gary Lynch, sources said.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office is also involved in negotiations, according to a person familiar with the talks. Schneiderman is one of four co-chairs of the working group that is coordinating the investigations.His office also advised the bank months ago that it planned to recommend an action against Merrill Lynch, according to a February filing from the bank. A spokesman for Schneiderman declined comment.      The negotiations do not include a separate civil mortgage fraud case brought by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which convinced a jury last October that the bank was liable for fraud through loans sold by its Countrywide unit. The government has asked for more than $2 billion in penalties but a judge has yet to rule on that request.           ADVERTISING FOR ATTORNEYS     Several U.S. Attorney offices including the Eastern District of California, which handled the JPMorgan investigation, recently advertised for new attorneys to work on its civil mortgage fraud enforcement cases and other types of fraud on the government.    A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento declined to comment on specific hires but said that the working group ""has been very supportive"" of the office. ""We are currently in the process of evaluating our needs and determining how additional resources could best be utilized,"" the spokeswoman said.    A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch's office in Brooklyn said it's also in the process of hiring new assistant U.S. attorneys but declined to discuss their roles. The new resources suggest the government may pursue cases tied to the financial crisis for several more years, and reflect the amount of work necessary to move the complicated cases across the finish line, sources said.But observers say the government must do more than force big penalties, and should enforce standards and adequate disclosures for borrowers and investors, which some argue does not seem to be a priority.     ""Even if we look at these settlements as punitive, we cannot look at them as corrective,"" said Joshua Rosner, managing director of Graham Fisher & Co., a New York based independent consultancy. ""If you don't fix the system going forward, you may have extracted monies, but you haven't done anything to ensure this doesn't happen again in the future.""     (additional reporting by Peter Rudegeair in New York.

When all goes well, that can lead to strong outperformance even after a small fund's higher-than-average fees; when it does not, those funds are likely to fall among the worst-performers. At the same time, stock pickers tend to reap the biggest rewards in the later stages of a bull market, when rallies are less broad. Each of the small funds leading their categories this year have 30 or fewer stocks in their portfolio. The $25 million Biondo Focus fund, for instance, has gained 9.8 percent for the year with its portfolio of 19 stocks, trailing only two other funds among the 1,743 in the Morningstar large-cap growth category.  Its top holdings include a 14 percent stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co, a 12 percent in Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc, and 10.3 percent in Gilead Sciences Inc. By comparison, Fidelity's $107.5 billion Contrafund, a mainstay of retirement accounts, holds no more than 4.5 percent in any one of its 298 holdings. The fund is up 3.4 percent for the year, putting it in the 57th percentile of the large growth category. Over the last three years, however, Contrafund has returned an average of 17.1 percent a year, while the Biondo fund has gained an average of 13.5 percent over the same time frame. ""When you are running a concentrated fund, you are taking greater risk opportunity for greater reward. If you pick the right stocks your winners are going to shine,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P CapitalIQ.Picking only a handful of stocks tends to work better in the United States than in the emerging markets or Europe, Rosenbluth added, where a fund manager has to be right on not only a company, but on the performance of its country as well.

323,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The city of Miami has sued JPMorgan Chase & Co, accusing the bank of predatory mortgage lending in minority neighborhoods that allegedly caused a wave of foreclosures during the last decade's housing crisis.The lawsuit, filed on Friday in federal court in Florida, said the country's largest bank engaged in a continuous practice of discriminatory mortgage lending since at least 2004, violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act.After issuing high-cost loans to minorities in the years before the housing crisis, JPMorgan later refused to refinance the loans on the same terms as it extended to whites, leading to defaults and foreclosures, the complaint said.The lawsuit came just weeks after the city of Los Angeles filed similar claims against JPMorgan, seeking to recoup damages for lost tax revenue and increased city services needed in blighted neighborhoods.""The Miami City Attorney's claims are baseless and stand contrary to our long record of providing affordable housing to low- to moderate-income families across the region,"" JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said.

Strong votes can secure bragging rights for winning firms and, for highly rated individuals, can result in lucrative job offers and pay rises.In a repeat of 2013's results, Bank of America Merrill Lynch scooped the prize for leading pan-European brokerage in equity and equity-linked research, ahead of 12-time winner UBS . Morgan Stanley remained in third place.JPMorgan Asset Management was joined in the top three in the best fund manager category by Wellington Management and Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which last year placed fifth and fourth respectively. Among individual prize winners was Andrew Wood of Sanford C. Bernstein, who for the eighth consecutive year took home the trophy for leading pan-European equity analyst.JPMorgan Asset Management's Peter Lawrence reclaimed the title of top fund management individual from Philip Guest of UBS Global Asset Management, who came second. HSBC's Niels Pecriaux climbed nine places to finish third in that category.GLG Partners was for the second straight year named top hedge fund, with Tudor Capital in second. Moore Capital Management jumped from sixth to third.The awards also cover companies' investor relations teams. Germany's Deutsche Telekom took the top spot, followed by Swiss drugmaker Roche and French media and telecoms group Vivendi.The Extel awards are based on a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters between the end of March and early May. This year attracted a record level of participation, with more than 16,000 individuals from around 6,300 brokerages, fund managers, research houses and major European companies taking part.WeConvene, a web-based platform that allows the investment community access to companies, said on Monday it had agreed to acquire Extel from Thomson Reuters in a deal expected to close by the end of June.

329,"  (Updates to add graphic)By Douwe MiedemaWASHINGTON, June 17 Wells Fargo, State Street and JPMorgan Chase & Co are below or almost at minimum capital thresholds expected to be included in a rule still being hammered out by U.S. regulators that's meant to mitigate taxpayer losses in another financial crisis, according to a Reuters analysis.U.S. banks are already required to hold equity equal to about 10 percent of their balance sheet to serve as a shock absorber to cover the risk of a sharp drop in the value of loans, investments and other assets on their books. Banks expect U.S. regulators to require them to hold another 10 percent in bonds with maturities of more than a year and other instruments, as part of the forthcoming rule.Wells Fargo's loss-absorbing capital stood at 17 percent at the end of last year, State Street's was 18.2 percent and JPMorgan stood at 19.1 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of eight banks, based on regulatory filings and methodology recently presented by Citigroup.""These are figures which have been circulating,"" said Bernard De Longevialle, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's. ""The market tends to view these three (banks) as those who would potentially be the most stretched.""Analysts and officials at banks are basing their estimates for the benchmarks partially on discussions with regulators and on wider market assumptions for what would be a reasonable level. The Federal Reserve has typically taken a tougher stance than its counterparts in the European Union.The Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), who are jointly working on the rule, declined to comment.Regulators want creditors - and not just shareholders - to take a hit if a bank lands in trouble, to prevent a repeat of the panic that spread when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008.The equity requirements that U.S. banks already conform to are in line with recommendations made in the global Basel III accord. The Fed has said it is planning similar requirements for long-term debt instruments that investors buy knowing they might lose all or part of their money. This would double the loss-absorbing capacity of a bank's capital to about 20 percent.Regulators from across the world are also working on such plans, but they still disagree about the details of a common approach they want to present when the G20 largest countries of the world meet at a summit in Brisbane, Australia, in November. DOUBLE THE BUFFERS The European Union wants banks' loss-absorbing capital to stand at about 18 percent of the balance sheet, and analysts believe that the Fed will come up with a similar number, somewhere between 18 percent and 25 percent.JPMorgan declined to comment. State Street said it had ""an ongoing dialogue with industry participants and regulators over a wide variety of issues"", and that it remained one of the most well-capitalized banks in the United States.Wells Fargo pointed to a May investor day, during which its Treasurer Paul Ackerman said he expected the bank's long-term debt ""to grow a little bit"" to fill any gap. Since the beginning of last year, Wells Fargo has issued more than $11 billion in debt with maturities greater than 10 years.Bank of New York Mellon stood at 23.4 percent, Citigroup at 22.8 percent and Bank of America at 23.2 percent. All numbers are based on regulatory filings as of Dec. 31, 2013. The rule is intended to make sure that governments can wind down a failing bank that is considered to pose too much risk to the financial system to go through ordinary bankruptcy, while not burdening the taxpayer.In the U.S., for example, the FDIC has explained how it would go about the exercise, but the plan won't work without the extra buffers.""Banks are more or less asked to keep a capital base ... of 9 to 10 percent of risk-weighted assets, and it's just a simple rule of thumb to say you would have ... debt that would allow to double this amount,"" De Longevialle said.FitchRatings in a recent presentation also assumed a total loss-absorbing capacity of 20 percent. MORE RULES Banks may not have too much trouble in raising more long-term debt depending on the exact details of the Fed's requirement, analysts said, particularly if there is a long transition period.Questions about the levels and about what instruments would count towards the total add to banks' anticipation about a long list of new rules that haven't been fully implemented, or that regulators are still writing.The Fed alone is working on four more rules: to raise more capital for systemically important banks, to require banks to invest in assets they can easily sell, to balance the maturities of assets and liabilities, and to make the short-term funding market less susceptible to panics.One of the reasons that Wells Fargo is behind some of the other banks is that it has traditionally relied on client deposits for funding, and simply did not need to borrow money from other banks or from investors.While clients can quickly withdraw deposits, they are still considered ""sticky"" - meaning banks don't anticipate that depositors will withdraw their funds all at once-- and the Fed may take that into account by granting banks such as Wells Fargo more leeway when setting its long-term debt requirement.""We would not be surprised if there are some differentiations between the banks based on their business models. But that's an assumption, that's not an information,"" De Longevialle said.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have far fewer deposits to fund their business, and they are also the two banks that far exceed the 25 percent thought to be the upper boundary for loss-absorbing capital level.A senior Fed staffer working on the rule said at a conference last week he would prefer consensus among the world's regulators grouped together in the G20's Financial Stability Board before the Fed put out its own rule.Banks in Europe often have a different legal structure than those in the United States, which group all their operating subsidiaries under one holding company, and this may make it hard to agree on a common approach soon.

332,"  (Corrects in paragraph eight to show Pecriaux works for GLG Partners, not HSBC)* BoA Merrill Lynch top pan-European equity brokerage* JPMorgan voted best fund management firm* GLG Partners wins leading hedge fund prizeBy Clare HutchisonLONDON, June 17 Bank of America Merrill Lynch  was named top pan-European equity brokerage for a second straight year at the annual Thomson Reuters Extel Awards on Tuesday, while JPMorgan Asset Management won best fund manager for the fifth year in a row. The awards, which were handed out in a ceremony at London's Guild Hall, are significant badges of honour in the industry as they are based on the votes of thousands of industry insiders.Strong votes can secure bragging rights for winning firms and, for highly rated individuals, can result in lucrative job offers and pay rises.In a repeat of 2013's results, Bank of America Merrill Lynch scooped the prize for leading pan-European brokerage in equity and equity-linked research, ahead of 12-time winner UBS . Morgan Stanley remained in third place. JPMorgan Asset Management was joined in the top three in the best fund manager category by Wellington Management and Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which last year placed fifth and fourth respectively.Among individual prize winners was Andrew Wood of Sanford C. Bernstein, who for the eighth consecutive year took home the trophy for leading pan-European equity analyst.JPMorgan Asset Management's Peter Lawrence reclaimed the title of top fund management individual from Philip Guest of UBS Global Asset Management, who came second. Niels Pecriaux, of GLG Partners, climbed nine places to finish third in that category.GLG Partners was for the second straight year named top hedge fund, with Tudor Capital in second. Moore Capital Management jumped from sixth to third.The awards also cover companies' investor relations teams. Germany's Deutsche Telekom took the top spot, followed by Swiss drugmaker Roche and French media and telecoms group Vivendi.The Extel awards are based on a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters between the end of March and early May. This year attracted a record level of participation, with more than 16,000 individuals from around 6,300 brokerages, fund managers, research houses and major European companies taking part.WeConvene, a web-based platform that allows the investment community access to companies, said on Monday it had agreed to acquire Extel from Thomson Reuters in a deal expected to close by the end of June. No financial details were disclosed.

Most investment banks have seen trading revenues slump over the past year amid a low interest rate environment and tougher regulations requiring them to hold more capital, which have driven down returns.

336,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Institutional investors including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Allianz SE's Pimco (ALVG.DE) on Wednesday sued six of the largest bond trustees, accusing them of failing to properly oversee more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities issued in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.The lawsuits, filed in New York state court, claim the trustees breached their duties to investors by failing to force lenders and sponsors of the securities to repurchase defective loans, the suits claim.The investors are seeking damages for losses that exceed $250 billion and relate to over 2,200 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued between 2004 and 2008, according to a person familiar with the cases.The trustees that were sued include units of U.S. Bank (USB.N), Citibank (C.N), Deutsche Bank [DBKGN.UL], Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N), HSBC [HSBCUK.UL], and Bank of New York Mellon. Representatives for the banks declined comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuits come after a New York appeals court ruling in December that determined the six-year statute of limitations to bring breach-of-contract cases against the issuers of mortgage securities began when the transactions were executed. The ruling means that for many cases it is too late to sue.  The lawsuits claim the trustees disregarded their duties to protect investors despite knowing that the trusts held a large number of loans that did not meet their contractual obligations.    The trustees were aware of an ""industrywide abandonment of underwriting guidelines"" for the loans and ""pervasive and systemic deficiencies infecting the trusts' collateral,"" as the complaint against Citibank says. Banks have paid billions of dollars in lawsuits and settlements since being accused of packaging shoddy mortgages into securities that helped lead to the financial crisis.The bonds at issue here have not been included in similar cases including an $8.5 billion accord between investors and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and a $4.5 billion deal between investors and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) over mortgage-backed securities, the person familiar with the lawsuits said.In addition to BlackRock and Pimco, the lawsuits were filed on behalf of Charles Schwab Co, DZ Bank AG and other institutional investors.

337,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK, June 18  NEW YORK, June 18 Institutional investors including BlackRock Inc and Allianz SE's Pimco  on Wednesday sued six of the largest bond trustees, accusing them of failing to properly oversee more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities issued in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.The lawsuits, filed in New York state court, claim the trustees breached their duties to investors by failing to force lenders and sponsors of the securities to repurchase defective loans, the suits claim.The investors are seeking damages for losses that exceed $250 billion and relate to over 2,200 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued between 2004 and 2008, according to a person familiar with the cases.The trustees that were sued include units of U.S. Bank , Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo & Co., HSBC, and Bank of New York Mellon. Representatives for the banks declined comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuits come after a New York appeals court ruling in December that determined the six-year statute of limitations to bring breach-of-contract cases against the issuers of mortgage securities began when the transactions were executed. The ruling means that for many cases it is too late to sue.The lawsuits claim the trustees disregarded their duties to protect investors despite knowing that the trusts held a large number of loans that did not meet their contractual obligations. The trustees were aware of an ""industrywide abandonment of underwriting guidelines"" for the loans and ""pervasive and systemic deficiencies infecting the trusts' collateral,"" as the complaint against Citibank says.Banks have paid billions of dollars in lawsuits and settlements since being accused of packaging shoddy mortgages into securities that helped lead to the financial crisis. The bonds at issue here have not been included in similar cases including an $8.5 billion accord between investors and Bank of America Corp and a $4.5 billion deal between investors and JPMorgan Chase & Co over mortgage-backed securities, the person familiar with the lawsuits said.In addition to BlackRock and Pimco, the lawsuits were filed on behalf of Charles Schwab Co, DZ Bank AG and other institutional investors.The cases were filed on behalf of the investors by Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann.The cases are BlackRock Allocation Target Shares, et al v Bank of New York Mellon, Blackrock Balanced Capital Portfolio, et al, v Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, BlackRock Allocation Target Shares v.

338,"  July 6 A former JPMorgan Chase & Co  trader has filed an appeal with a London tribunal court to challenge civil findings made by Britain's financial watchdog against the bank over the ""London Whale"" debacle of 2012, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing tribunal records.Julien Grout, a junior trader with JP Morgan who was indicted in the United States in September on five charges, will allege that he was ""readily identifiable"" in findings which were meant to be anonymous, the daily quoted people familiar with the matter as saying. (on.ft.com/1xCbLfZ)The French national was accused of participating in a conspiracy to hide losses within JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office in London by marking positions in a credit derivatives portfolio at inflated prices. Another former JP Morgan employee, Achilles Macris, won the right to challenge the Financial Conduct Authority in April, after a tribunal court ruled that by failing to give him the right of reply to its report into the affair the regulator had infringed his rights. Graham Huntley, a London-based solicitor for Grout, and the FCA could not immediately be reached for a comment outside of regular business hours in the UK. Last year, JP Morgan admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle U.S. and British regulatory probes into the $6.2 billion losses arising from risky derivatives bets made in 2012 that came to be known as the ""London Whale"" trades.Grout and another one-time trader at the bank, Javier Martin-Artajo, are considered fugitives by the U.S. government for not coming to the country to face trial over charges relating to the scandal. Both men have denied any wrongdoing.

339,"   By Clare Hutchison and Kirstin Ridley | LONDON  LONDON A former JPMorgan (JPM.N) trader charged in the United States over his alleged role in the $6.2 billion ""London Whale"" trading scandal has won the right to a legal challenge of the British regulator's decision to drop its investigation into him.Lawyers said the trader, Julien Grout, might want the investigation to continue in Britain as its findings could affect the case against him in the United States.A High Court judge ruled on Tuesday that Grout could bring a so-called judicial review of the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) decision to end its probe before he was able to respond to the allegations.Richard Lissack, a barrister for Grout, said the FCA dropped its investigation because of pending U.S. charges. The review would challenge the rationality of that decision, Lissack said. The London Whale was a nickname for Bruno Iksil, Grout's colleague in the London division of JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office. The division made some large bets on derivatives markets that went sour, stacking up losses of more than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan was fined more than $1 billion by U.S. and British regulators in relation to the loss. Grout, who is based in France, and his former supervisor Javier Martin-Artajo face charges in the United States, including wire fraud and conspiracy to falsify books and records. Both deny any wrongdoing.  Iksil avoided charges by striking an immunity deal with U.S. prosecutors in exchange for cooperation.Grout is also one of three men bringing cases against the FCA relating to a statement it published alongside the fine it imposed on JPMorgan over the London Whale scandal in September 2013. He alleges he can be identified in the statement. Former JPMorgan executive Achilles Macris has also challenged the FCA over the London Whale case, saying he should have been given the right to respond to allegations set out in the regulator's public statement on the fine.The FCA has said it did not give Macris these so-called ""third party rights"" because it did not think he could be identified in the statement.

Its Chapter 11 case has been marred by a long-running battle between Ergen, who became LightSquared's largest creditor during the bankruptcy, and Phil Falcone's Harbinger, which spent billions of dollars building the company's wireless network.Dish and Ergen engaged in ""an illegal scheme involving mail and wire fraud, bankruptcy fraud, tortious interference, and abuse of process,"" said the complaint.

345,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON U.S. drugmaker AbbVie has been forced to retract comments by its chief executive about shareholder support for its $51 billion bid for Shire after being caught out by British takeover rules. Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday he believed major Shire investors were  ""generally supportive of this transaction"" - a comment he repeated in conversations with other media.Under Takeover Panel rules, designed to ensure fair treatment for all investors, a company attempting to acquire a rival is not allowed to claim support for its bid unless it has this in writing from shareholders. ""AbbVie confirms that it has not received any written commitments of support and accordingly retracts the statements,"" it said on Wednesday. The error is a further example of the strict nature of British takeover rules, which also caused problems for Pfizer during its unsuccessful bid for AstraZeneca earlier this year. The retraction is embarrassing for AbbVie and its key advisers - investment bank J.P. Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick, both of which also advised Pfizer. Pfizer limited its options and caused some market confusion when it declared its $118 billion offer for AstraZeneca ""final"". AbbVie's climbdown is further evidence of how closely the Takeover Panel is monitoring bid situations. The watchdog also forced U.S. medical devices firm Stryker to announce in May it did not intend to make an offer for Smith & Nephew following a report it was considering a bid. WAITING FOR SHIRE AbbVie raised its offer for Shire to 30.1 billion pounds ($51.3 billion) on Tuesday, hoping to win over its reluctant target after three earlier offers were rejected. Shire has yet to respond to the latest cash-and-stock offer, which was worth 51.15 pounds a share at July 7 prices, or 11 percent more than AbbVie’s previous proposal. It said on Tuesday that its board was meeting to consider it.  Industry analysts said it was unlikely to be enough to get a deal done but it could bring Shire to the negotiating table. Several analysts have valued Shire in the mid-50s pounds per share or higher. However, with AbbVie's shares falling 3 percent on Tuesday, the actual value of the latest offer has fallen to 50.19 pounds per share, which Panmure Gordon analyst Savvas Neophytou said was inadequate and was likely to be rejected by the Shire board. Other analysts said Shire's board might try to seek alternative offers in order to push the price higher, although AbbVie's Gonzalez told Reuters he was not aware of any counterbidders interested in the company. Shire shares were down 1.3 percent at 44.70 pounds by 1120 GMT.  The silence from the Shire camp and the failure by AbbVie to land a decisive blow has prompted some hedge funds to take profits, according to people close to the situation. Worries that the two sides may not manage to reach a deal, as happened with Pfizer-AstraZeneca, has fuelled volatility in Shire shares, which fell back sharply on Tuesday after initially rising on news of the raised bid.AbbVie may have some room to offer more but is likely to be constrained by a desire to maintain its investment grade credit rating. The U.S. company is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio by adding Shire's specialised drugs for hyperactivity and rare diseases.Moody's Investors Service said the latest increased offer was credit negative as it would raise AbbVie's financial leverage, with its ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) expected to reach a range of 3.2 to 3.6 times, compared to 2.2 times at the end of March.

353,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, July 14 Credit the booming stock market as a partial catalyst for a surge in mergers and acquisitions, which are up almost 73 percent from the same period a year ago.In the first six months of this year alone, companies have announced deals worth nearly $2 trillion, a seven-year high. But if you want to get a piece of the action as an investor, you're best off betting on the banks that have a hand in arranging or advising the mergers - or an even larger pool of stocks. The mutual funds that specialize in this activity are poor performers.One of the oldest and largest funds in this niche is the Merger Fund, which manages nearly $6 billion. Over the past 12 months through July 11, the fund has returned 5.5 percent, which lags the broader S&P 500 index by more than 14 percentage points.While the margin of underperformance to the S&P Index is 16 points over the past half-decade, the Merger Fund shows a slight advantage over the index over the past 15 years, with an annualized return of 4.5 percent.The Merger Fund's largest holdings include some recent merger candidates such as Omnicon Group Inc, Time Warner Cable Inc and T-Mobile US Inc. Like most of the funds in this category, the Merger Fund is expensive to hold, costing 1.26 percent for annual expenses plus a 0.17 percent 12b-1 charge and transaction expenses. A similar vehicle is the Arbitrage Fund, up about 2 percent for the past 12 months and has roughly averaged 2 percent performance for the past five years. The Arbitrage Fund is even more expensive than the Merger Fund, charging 1.45 percent in management expenses and a 0.25 percent 12b-1 fee.Of the four largest funds in the merger category, none has come close to beating the S&P 500 Index in recent years, so you should consider a more passive, indirect strategy.The problem with owning a merger/arbitrage fund is that its managers only focus on a handful of companies. What if the companies picked by the managers don't merge? What if the market doesn't bid up the price of the targeted company?Many proposed deals fizzle when both sides can't make the deal work, and some take a long time to complete. Major deals still pending include AT&T Inc and DirectTV Group, and Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. Deals can blow up as well. The proposed $35 billion union of Publicis Groupe SA and Omnicom would have created one of the largest advertising firms in the world, but collapsed after several months of negotiations.When nothing happens, the fund managers can end up holding a stock that doesn't rise at all or drops in value. INDIRECT STRATEGY A more profitable strategy is a roundabout way of playing the merger-acquisition game. Instead of picking potential winners, just pick a handful of investment banks doing the most deals when the merger climate is hot. They profit handsomely from setting up these corporate marriages.To zero in on the biggest background players in mergers and acquisitions, target the top five elite investment banks doing the bulk of the deals. This group would include Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp (Merrill Lynch), Citigroup Inc and JP Morgan Chase & Co.Rather than concentrate your holdings in these stocks, you could find most of them in a financial services index exchange-traded fund like the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF . The fund is up 14 percent for the 12 months through July 11 and charges only 0.16 percent for annual expenses.Better yet, cast an even wider net that would capture nearly all of the public companies that might be merger or acquisition candidates. Consider a total market fund such as the Vanguard Total Stock market ETF, which holds nearly the entire U.S. stock market and charges you 0.05 percent annually.Virtually reflecting the performance of the U.S. stock market as a whole, the Vanguard fund is up nearly 20 percent for the 12 months through July 11. Although finding a fund manager who can score big on a merger or acquisition is always appealing, that manager is always looking for a relatively small fish in a huge pond. It's better to fish the entire pond.

354,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co, the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender, is backing away from making home loans to less creditworthy borrowers after losing faith in its ability to recover much money from foreclosing on homes, even with government guarantees.The shift reflects a change in the way JPMorgan runs its mortgage business: while it used to regard collateral and U.S. government lending programs as key backstops to most of its loans, it now pays closer attention to the credit quality of borrowers. The bank wants to reduce the chances of having to foreclose on a loan, because it's bad business.""The cost to take a customer through the foreclosure process is just astronomical now,"" Kevin Watters, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase's residential mortgage banking business in New York, told Reuters in an interview.In addition to federal standards, states, and in some cases local governments, have written their own rules making it more expensive for banks to recover loan losses, he said. According to foreclosure data firm RealtyTrac, it took an average of 120 days to foreclose on a home at the beginning of 2007, just as the housing bubble was starting to burst. In the first quarter of 2014, it took 572 days, or more than 1.5 years. Lenders have generally been paying more attention to borrowers' credit quality since the financial crisis, but JPMorgan is going a step further in its reluctance to rely on government loan guarantees and insurance.If other lenders choose the same path as JPMorgan, it could become more difficult for people to secure financing to buy homes, even though government programs are intended to help credit flow to these borrowers, said Christopher Mayer, a professor of real estate finance at Columbia University. ""This could reduce the number of first-time buyers and slow the speed with which people who lost their homes during the crisis can become homeowners again,"" said Mayer.For now, JPMorgan is taking a different path from smaller competitors, many of which have lowered their underwriting standards. Some lenders, particularly those that aren't banks, are increasingly willing to make subprime loans. Over the last 18 months lenders have been making loans to borrowers with lower and lower credit scores on average, according to mortgage data provider Ellie Mae, although the mean is still well within the ""prime"" category.As JPMorgan pulls back from mortgage lending, non-banks are ramping up. The third biggest mortgage lender in the United States in the first quarter was Detroit's Quicken Loans, according to industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance, after Wells Fargo & Co and JPMorgan. Quicken is a bigger mortgage lender now than Citigroup Inc or Bank of America Corp.  The mortgage market is shrinking as rising rates cut into refinancing demand and home sales growth is spotty. But JPMorgan is shrinking faster than many of its rivals:  its market share fell to 8.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014 from 11.1 percent in the same quarter a year earlier, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. On Tuesday, the bank posted a $74 million loss from making mortgages in the second quarter, compared with $566 million of income in the same quarter last year. The bank has said it expects to lose money making home loans for the full year.Wells Fargo does not break out its mortgage figures in exactly the same way, but its mortgage banking revenue fell 38.5 percent in the second quarter from the same quarter last year to $1.72 billion. BANK EXECS FEEL MUGGED JPMorgan may take until 2015 to fully formulate its new mortgage strategy, but one area it is pulling back from already is loans made under the Federal Housing Administration program, which allows first-time homeowners to borrow as much as 96.5 percent of the purchase price of their house.The government guarantees these loans against default, but the FHA has clashed with JPMorgan and other big banks over whether some of the loans they made qualified for the insurance. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on a conference call on Tuesday that he was frustrated when the bank settled with the FHA in February for $614 million for getting government insurance payments on loans that allegedly were not eligible for coverage. An FHA spokesman declined to comment on Dimon's remarks.Dimon added that the bank's experience with FHA loans was so bad that ""the real question to me is should we be in the FHA business at all and we are still struggling with that."" In November, the bank settled with the Department of Justice, the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and others for $13 billion for mortgage-related matters. In private, the JPMorgan CEO has complained to colleagues about the unfairness of the bank's mortgage settlements. Executives at many of the biggest banks have griped that the FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac have punished lenders for minor problems with documents to avoid having to pay guarantees and insurance they had agreed to provide. Banks continually gripe about legal settlements and new regulation, but JPMorgan's intent to change its business is clear from market share data. The bank's share of FHA loans in April was just 1.7 percent, compared with 3.1 percent for all of 2013, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.In May, FHA officials said they were taking new steps to make their rules clear so that lenders will finance borrowers without fear of unanticipated consequences. And, in June they proposed new rules to do just that.Dimon, in the conference call, held out hope that the FHA will make adjustments that will allow the bank to make credit more available to marginal borrowers without the risk of severe penalties.One area where the bank isn't shrinking is ""jumbo loans,"" mortgages that are so big that government agencies will not guarantee or insure them. These borrowers tend to be wealthier and have more assets to pay off their loans. JPMorgan has been under-cutting competitors on prices for the loans and winning a bigger share of that business, company executives say.

360,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 15 (Fitch) While core operating performance remained solid,  JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) 2Q'14 net earnings continued to be weighed down by  weaker performance in mortgage and markets, according to Fitch Ratings. Net  income of $6.0 billion was down 7.9% from the prior year, but return on tangible  equity remained strong, at 14%, which is expected to compare favorably to large  bank peers. Bright spots in the quarter were a continuation of prior quarter trends, and  included record business banking loan growth, market-leading credit card  purchase volume growth, record investment banking fees in commercial banking,  positive client flows in asset management, and a continuation of solid asset  quality trends in consumer and commercial loan categories. The only significant  item of note in the quarter was a $500 million firm-wide legal expense, which is  not too surprising given the current operating environment.     Results for the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) were down 31% from 2Q'13, or  28% adjusting for FVA and DVA. The decline was driven by a 15% drop in fixed  income markets, a 10% decline in equity markets, and a 6% reduction in debt  underwriting volume; all of which was anticipated, given market volumes. Markets  revenue was down 12% overall, but investment banking fees were up modestly, as  growth in advisory and equity underwriting offset weaker debt issuance. The  overhead expense ratio grew to 67%, due largely to continued investment in  controls. The CIB average VaR remained relatively low, at $43 million for the  quarter, which was effectively flat with 1Q'14 and 2Q'13. DVA/FVA was a gain of  $173 million in the quarter compared to a gain of $355 million a year ago.  Net income in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment, was down from  2Q'13, given declines in mortgage revenue and higher provision expense, offset  to some extent by lower operating expenses. Mortgage origination volume was down  66% year over year, but relatively flat with the prior quarter. JPM is likely  losing market share in the space, based on peer trends, as it holds firm on  terms and pricing, which Fitch believes is prudent. Production pre-tax income  was a negative $74 million in the quarter, which was above expectations, given  higher revenue margins, resulting from a positive mix shift, and progress on  expense cuts. Management expects production income to be relatively similar in  3Q'14.  Pre-tax earnings in the servicing business improved due to MSR risk management  gains and declines in costs. Total servicing expenses were $552 million in the  quarter, which compares to a target of approximately $500 million per quarter by  year-end, which Fitch believes, is achievable. MSR risk management gains were  $338 million, and included $220 million of gains related to model updates  associated with slower prepayment speeds. Credit metrics in the real estate  portfolio continued to decline, which supported $300 million of reserve releases  in the purchased-credit impaired portfolio. Fitch expects additional reserve  releases over the balance of the year, although at lower levels than seen in  2013.   Card segment fundamentals were solid, with market-leading purchase volumes,  lower net charge-off rates, and modest portfolio growth, but earnings declined  33% given lower reserve releases, spread compression, and higher expenses, due  to investment in controls, marketing, and legal expenses. Fitch expects  provision expenses and continued margin compression to be headwinds over the  remainder of 2014. Reserve releases, which were limited to $50 million in  student loans, appear largely complete. Positively, sales growth was up 12% from  the prior year and the loan portfolio has surpassed its inflection point, with  1% average growth in the quarter.  Commercial Banking (CB) remains a very steady contributor to JPM. Loan growth  was up about 7% from 2Q'13, with continued strength in commercial real estate.  Credit quality remained very strong, with net recoveries in the quarter. Asset  Management (AM) earnings were up due to net client inflows and higher market  levels, partially offset by higher costs associated with the control agenda.  Assets under management (AUM) were above $1.7 trillion at quarter-end.  The bank's core net interest margin, which excludes the impact of CIB's  market-based activities, was down 2 basis points sequentially, to 2.64% due to  lower loan yields. JPM is expecting Treasury to report breakeven net interest  income (NII) by year-end, but reported negative NII of $10 million in 2Q'14.  JPM made more meaningful progress toward its year-end Basel III Tier 1 Common  equity (CET1) target in the quarter, due largely to retained earnings. The CET1  ratio improved to 9.8% compared to a year-end 2014 target of 10%. Progress was  also made on the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which improved 30 basis  points sequentially at the firm and bank level in 2Q'14, reaching 5.4% and 5.6%,  respectively. JPM expects to target firm SLR of 5.5% and a bank SLR of 6%  longer-term. Fitch regards JPM's capital levels to be consistent with its  current ratings and would expect the bank to achieve full compliance with all  regulatory requirements, well ahead of required implementation.  JPM repurchased $1.5 billion of common equity during the quarter, which leaves  about $5 billion of authorization based on the annual CCAR process. Dividends  per share were $0.40, which equates to a payout ratio of approximately 27% on a  fully diluted basis.

361,"   By David Henry and Tanya Agrawal  JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said on Tuesday that second-quarter profit fell 8 percent after customer stock and bond trading volume dropped and mortgage lending fees plunged.The results were not as bad as investors had feared, and the bank's shares rose 3.8 percent to $58.44 shortly after midday.Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the bank had seen ""encouraging signs"" across its businesses toward the end of the quarter, including businesses drawing more from credit lines. But the bank's executives also sounded notes of caution, noting that it was ""too early to assume that this momentum will continue.""Speaking on a conference call with analysts, Dimon said that companies are still not stepping up capital spending. On a conference call with reporters, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said the pickup in bond trading revenue that the bank saw in June has not continued through July.The report is the bank's first since Dimon disclosed that he had throat cancer. Dimon told reporters on Tuesday, ""I feel great,"" and added that he would stay engaged with the business as he underwent treatment. He said for the first time that he was advised to take a few weeks of rest after his eight weeks of treatment. The bank's net income fell to $5.99 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $6.5 billion, or $1.60 per share, in the same quarter of 2013. Revenue fell 3 percent to $24.45 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.29 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue from fixed-income and equity markets fell 15 percent to $3.5 billion in the quarter ended June 30 compared with the same quarter last year, but the drop was less than the 20 percent decline that JPMorgan had forecast in May. Investors had broadly expected trading revenue drops in the 20-percent range for the big banks, but stronger activity in June helped dampen the declines that banks posted. Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N posted a 10 percent decline in stock and bond trading revenue for customers, excluding a business it sold last year.  Citigroup Inc C.N, which reported on Monday, said income from stock and bond trading fell 15 percent, excluding an accounting adjustment - well below the 20-25 percent fall it had braced the market for in May. JPMorgan executives have said that institutional investors seem to be shying away from bonds because of a lack of strong opinions about future moves in interest rates and currencies. MORTGAGE LENDING DROPS JPMorgan, the second largest U.S. mortgage lender after Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, said its profit from mortgage lending fell 38 percent to $709 million, while mortgage application volumes dropped 54 percent to $30.1 billion.Overall U.S. mortgage demand has fallen for more than a year as mortgage rates have risen. Demand for loans was also hit by a weaker spring selling season compared with last year.JPMorgan said total assets at end-June stood at $2.52 trillion, up from $2.48 trillion at the end of March.

367,"  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Thursday that its board of directors allowed $36 million of options previously awarded to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon to vest.The options were part of Dimon's 2008 compensation package that became exercisable in January 2013. The bank's board determined at that time that because of the bank's $6.2 billion ""London Whale"" trading loss, it would defer vesting until July 2014 at the latest.

369,"  * Q2 adj profit $0.60/shr vs est $0.55 - Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S* Wealth management pretax margin 21 pct vs 18.5 pct* FICC revenue falls 12.3 pct* Shares edge down   (Adds investor quote, details about results and company strategy)By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tanya AgrawalJuly 17 Morgan Stanley's second-quarter income more than doubled, helped by rising revenue in its retail brokerage business as it won more assets to manage from clients, the investment bank said on Thursday.A onetime tax break and the ending of a joint venture with Citigroup in wealth management gave the bank its biggest income gains for the quarter. But even excluding those items, the bank posted better results in businesses including merger advisory, stock and bond underwriting and investment management.The results beat forecasts, and Morgan Stanley's shares edged 0.24 percent higher to $32.58 as the broader market fell. ""The businesses that are going well are firing on all cylinders,"" said John Thompson, chief executive of Vilas Capital Management, whose second largest holding is Morgan Stanley shares.Morgan Stanley has been reshaping its business after coming close to failing during the financial crisis. The second-largest stand-alone investment bank, long a powerhouse in areas like bond trading and commodities trading, has been increasing its reliance on its retail brokerage and investment management businesses. Its current CEO, James Gorman, previously headed the wealth management businesses.These businesses tend to generate more stable earnings and are less likely to unravel during market calamities. Investment management and retail brokerage accounted for about 30 percent to 40 percent of the bank's quarterly revenue in 2007, but the share grew to more than half in the second quarter of 2014.Retail clients' assets rose by $59 billion to $2 trillion in the second quarter, due in part to clients bringing money to the bank. Morgan Stanley managed to win those assets without expanding its broker force: it ended June with 16,316 financial advisers compared with 16,321 a year ago. Revenue from wealth management rose 5 percent to $3.72 billion from the year-ago quarter, and the bank's pretax margin from the business widened to 21 percent from 18.5 percent, close to its target of 22-25 percent by the end of 2015.Overall, net income for shareholders rose to $1.86 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the second quarter from $803 million, or 41 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.According to adjusted figures calculated by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the company earned 60 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 55 cents.The quarter included a $609 million tax benefit. The bank also received 100 percent of the income from its wealth management business during the quarter, unlike the second quarter of 2013, when it shared that income with its joint venture partner, Citigroup. Morgan Stanley bought out Citigroup's remaining 35 percent stake in the wealth management business on June 28, 2013. Revenue from fixed-income, currency and commodity trading fell 12.3 percent to $1 billion as a lack of volatility discouraged trading during the quarter. Those results exclude accounting adjustments linked to the value of the company's debt.That decline is about in line with the drops posted by rivals including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc , and No. 1 standalone investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Investors' concerns about the future of the bank's bond trading business have weighed on its valuation. Morgan Stanley shares trade at about their book value, or the net accounting value of the company's assets. When the bank's earnings start rising in the coming years, as equity markets rise, said Vilas Capital's Thompson, the bank's shares could trade at 1.5 to 2 times book value.Morgan Stanley, ranked No. 2 globally in mergers-and-acquisitions, benefited from a strong equities market in the quarter. Advisory revenue rose 26 percent to $418 million.Separately, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview that management does not believe that U.S. sanctions announced on Wednesday against Russian oil company Rosneft  would affect a deal between the two companies.

370,"  LONDON, July 18 Any new debt issued by the Russian companies subject to latest U.S. sanctions will not be eligible for inclusion in JPMorgan's bond indexes, the most widely used emerging debt indexes, the bank said.""As a result of the latest U.S. Treasury sanctions, new debt issued by Gazprombank, Novatek, Rosneft  and VEB (Vneskekonombank) will not be eligible for inclusion into the JPMorgan suite of indices due to investors' inability to replicate the benchmark,"" JPM said in a note late on Thursday.Oil firm TNK-BP, not named officially in the sanctions but 90 percent owned by state oil major Rosneft, will also be subject to the restriction, JPM said. However, existing debt of these companies will not be affected, the bank said, adding that sanctions imposed to date had not affected its indexes.

371,"   By Aruna Viswanatha | WASHINGTON, July 22  WASHINGTON, July 22 JPMorgan Chase & Co  has begun to provide the debt forgiveness and other help to struggling homeowners under last year's $13 billion accord with federal and state authorities, though it has only turned over a handful of details, a monitor of the deal said in a report released on Tuesday.Joseph Smith, who was appointed by the bank and governments to monitor a settlement over mortgage securities, said he determined that the largest U.S. bank had so far earned $6.3 million in so-called ""credits"" from either cutting borrowers' principal or agreeing to defer some payments on 100 loans in a test pool.The bank receives extra credit for certain types of help and less for others, so the total is not a dollar-for-dollar accounting of the assistance provided.In an interview, Smith said he didn't yet have enough information to assess whether the bank is on track to fulfill its obligations, which it has until 2017 to accomplish, but he expected to put a more comprehensive report out later this year. JPMorgan agreed last November to pay $9 billion in cash and  $4 billion in the form of loan modifications and other help to consumers to resolve federal and state claims that it misrepresented risky mortgage securities that it sold in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis.While Smith said Chase had informed him it had provided more than the confirmed $6 million in help to struggling borrowers, he said the bank chose to first test whether it was accurately calculating its credit on the sample loan pool. Chase is JPMorgan's brand for consumer loans.""This really was a dry run,"" Smith said. Chase spokesman Jason Lobo said in a statement the bank had been ""working closely"" with Smith's team on the limited sample of loans in order to be prepared for a full reporting cycle that begins in August.The report comes one week after Citigroup entered into a similar $7 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and several states over shoddy mortgage securities the No. 3 U.S. bank sold before the crisis. Under that deal, Citigroup similarly agreed to provide around $2.5 billion in help to struggling homeowners and low-income tenants.Bank of America has also held talks to resolve federal and state probes into securities packaged by the bank and its units, though the Justice Department has threatened to sue as settlement talks have stalled.Any settlement with Bank of America is expected to include similar provisions for help to borrowers.

373,"   By Jonathan Stempel  JPMorgan Chase & Co has won the dismissal of a lawsuit by the City of Los Angeles accusing the largest U.S. bank of steering minority borrowers into mortgages they could not afford, even after similar cases against the next three largest banks were allowed to go forward.In a decision made public on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Otis Wright said the city could not hold JPMorgan responsible for questionable lending by the former Washington Mutual Inc, under a federal law governing the wind-down of failed banks.Wright said Los Angeles may file an amended complaint focused on JPMorgan's, but not WaMu's, lending practices.Once the largest U.S. thrift, WaMu failed in September 2008, when JPMorgan acquired most of it in a $1.9 billion sale supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.""We respectfully disagree with the court's ruling as to the loans made by Washington Mutual, and are exploring our options,"" said Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer, who filed the lawsuit on May 30. ""In the meantime, we are aggressively pursuing our case against JPMorgan Chase.""JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said: ""We are pleased with this decision, and we will continue to carry out our strong commitment to Los Angeles residents.""

The judge said that made the city's lawsuit against JPMorgan different from its similar lawsuits against Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. Those lawsuits have survived motions to dismiss.""FIRREA bars this court from hearing the city's claims as they relate to WaMu's discriminatory lending practices,"" Wright wrote, in a decision dated August 5.The judge said the rest of the lawsuit also had to be dismissed because Los Angeles ""lumps loans issued by both Chase and WaMu together."" But he gave Los Angeles permission to file an amended complaint that tries to ""excise"" allegations related to WaMu.Los Angeles accused New York-based JPMorgan of engaging since 2004 in a ""continuous pattern and practice"" of mortgage discrimination in the city.It faulted alleged practices by the bank such as putting minority borrowers into riskier loans than white borrowers, causing a disproportionate number of foreclosures in minority neighborhoods, and denying credit to minority borrowers on the same terms as white borrowers.The case is City of Los Angeles v.

The investments, which included private equity and hedge funds, were also ""clearly unsuitable"" and performed poorly, the church said. Other types of investments included structured notes, a risky complex security whose performance is linked to the performance of another underlying investment, such as a foreign currency.Many of the investments were sold at substantial losses, the church said.

381,"   By Emily Stephenson and Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. regulators on Wednesday issued rules for banks to hold enough easy-to-sell assets to keep them afloat during a crunch, after many were caught short of cash during the 2007-09 financial crisis.The rules, adopted by the three main bank regulators, are a new building block in a global effort to make big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) sturdier and head off a future meltdown of the financial system.""Liquidity squeezes were the agents of contagion in the financial crisis,"" Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said. ""The (new rule) makes such squeezes less likely by limiting large banks from taking on excessive liquidity risk.""The Federal Reserve said big U.S. banks would need to hold a total of about $2.5 trillion in highly liquid assets by 2017, and that they would have a shortfall of about $100 billion if that threshold applied today.The regulators also proposed rules determining how much money - or margin - swaps buyers and sellers must set aside when they do trades outside central clearing houses, which makes them more risky than cleared derivatives trades.The liquidity rules, which were first proposed in October 2013, will force banks to hold enough liquid assets such as cash, treasury bonds and other securities to fund themselves over a 30-day period during a crisis.In the wake of the last crisis, regulators have told banks to rely less on borrowed money, and to raise more shareholder equity. But they had yet to address problems with everyday cash needs that came to light during the crisis.The final rule provided some relief from the proposed version, allowing smaller banks to make their liquidity calculations on a monthly basis rather than every day. It also exempted companies regulated by the Fed that are deemed to be of systemic financial importance but that are not banks - such as insurer Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N). Banks with more than $250 billion in assets will still have to tabulate their daily liquidity needs.The Fed's estimate of the current shortfall is half of what it foresaw in its proposed rule. Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), PNC Financial Services (PNC.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) are examples of banks that currently do not meet the ratio, according to a note by KBW research analysts.""Banks have started to narrow the gap,"" said David Wright, a regulation expert at consultancy firm Deloitte. ""Some were waiting to find out exactly how the buffer would be defined ... but now ... banks will be able to go ahead and close the final $100 billion gap.""Fed staff said they want to work on a plan to eventually include the most liquid municipal bonds in the asset buffer, although for now they will not count, something that has frustrated local government officials, who have argued banks will buy fewer of their bonds, and taxpayers will shoulder more costs for projects such as new roads.U.S. cities and states criticized the regulators' tightening of the rules on Wednesday, saying it would raise their borrowing costs and hamper vital infrastructure projects.  MORE RULES Tarullo, the Fed's top official on financial regulation, said more rules were forthcoming. He said the Fed would write separate liquidity rules for foreign banks that are exempted from the rule that was finalized on Wednesday.Liquidity standards for the handful of non-banks overseen by the Fed would be issued by order, he said. Separately, the Fed is working on rules to rein in banks that heavily rely on short-term funding tools, and it will also need to implement forthcoming global requirements that would force banks to calculate their liquidity needs over a full year, the so-called net stable funding ratio.The Fed also reproposed margin requirements for swap trades conducted outside clearing houses, which function as middlemen by taking on the risk that trading partners cannot deliver on their promises to make them less risky.Swaps, a form of derivatives, mushroomed during the pre-crisis boom when they were only lightly regulated. Now, they must be routed through clearing houses, but some are so complex that they still won't be cleared, and the new rules set out how much money trading partners need to set aside.Trading counterparties must post enough buffers to give themselves 10 days to unwind any deal going awry, the rules say. For cleared swaps, that period is one to five days.That makes cleared swaps far cheaper to use, and market parties have said that the margin rules could have a direct impact on how popular these swaps are with clients.The reproposal largely followed a global agreement released in 2013, and superseded an initial Fed proposal from 2011. The new U.S. proposal was somewhat stricter in its definition of large financial end users, agency staff said.The three agencies adopting both sets of rules are the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

382,"   By Emily Stephenson and Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON, Sept 3  WASHINGTON, Sept 3 U.S. regulators met on Wednesday to adopt rules for banks to hold enough easy-to-sell assets to keep them afloat during a crunch, after many were caught short of cash during the 2007-09 financial crisis.The rules, a key plank of a global agreement to make big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup safer, are a new building block as regulators across the world work to make banks sturdier and head off a future meltdown.""Liquidity squeezes were the agents of contagion in the financial crisis,"" Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said. ""The (new rule) makes such squeezes less likely by limiting large banks from taking on excessive liquidity risk.""The regulators also unveiled rules determining how much money - or margin - swaps buyers and sellers must set aside when they do trades outside central clearing houses, which makes them more risky than cleared derivatives trades. The Fed board will vote on the rules in a public meeting on Wednesday and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also will take a vote. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it had already adopted both rules.U.S. regulators in October 2013 first proposed the liquidity rules, which were more stringent than the global agreement, with a shorter phase-in period for domestic banks.The Federal Reserve said big U.S. banks would need to hold a total of about $2.5 trillion in highly liquid assets by 2017. The institutions would have a shortfall of about $100 billion if that threshold applied today, the Fed said. Banks must maintain enough liquid assets on hand to survive a 30-day squeeze. Banks with more than $250 billion in assets will have to tabulate their liquidity needs every day, while smaller institutions will calculate theirs monthly.Fed staff said they want to work on a plan to eventually include the most liquid municipal bonds in the asset buffer, although for now they will not count, something that has frustrated state and local government officials. Global regulators also are working on an additional requirement that would force banks to calculate their liquidity needs over a full year, the so-called Net Stable Funding Ratio. On top of that, the Fed is working on rules to rein in banks that heavily rely on short-term funding tools.Staff also recommended that the Fed repropose margin requirements for swap trades conducted outside clearing houses, which function as middlemen by taking on the risk that trading partners cannot deliver on their promises.Swaps, which mushroomed during the pre-crisis boom, must now be routed through clearing houses but some are so complex that they are still not cleared, and the new rules set out how much money trading partners need to set aside to cover risk.The margin rules largely followed a global agreement released in 2013. The U.S. proposal was somewhat stricter in its definition of large financial end users, agency staff said.

The study did find problems, however. For example, nearly a third of advisers that contact clients via email do not send messages through a secure system that prevents them from being read by hackers and other third parties. Also, fewer than half of the firms surveyed, or 44 percent, had policies, procedures and training in place related to cyber security.State-registered investment advisers account for more than half of the registered investment advisers in the United States, NASAA said.

395,"  BOGOTA, Sept 11 Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said on Thursday he expects the peso to continue its recent weakening and settle in a ""reasonable"" range of between 2,000 and 2,100 pesos per dollar, a trend that would boost competitiveness of exports.""I think we are going toward that rate. I have always said that I would feel at ease with an exchange rate around 2,000 - between 2,000 and 2,100,"" Santos said in a speech to business leaders in Bogota.""That exchange rate is very reasonable,"" he said, without saying how quickly he expected the peso to weaken to that level. Colombia's central bank has been buying dollars regularly on the local foreign exchange market in an effort to weaken the peso, whose strength in the last few years has made it more difficult for exporters to compete internationally. This year the Finance Ministry also weighed in, buying dollars to tame a sharp strengthening in the peso after investment bank J.P. Morgan raised the weighting of Colombian debt in its indexes, boosting appetite for that asset. The currency has since reversed course with falling output of oil, its top export, and lower crude prices, cooling demand for the peso.

399,"  * To distribute income daily instead of monthly* Investors in ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund informed* Follows weak money market trading after ECB depo rate cut   (Add detail in paragraph 7)By Simon Jessop and Emelia Sithole-MatariseLONDON, Sept 12 Global fund manager BlackRock  said on Friday that it had told investors in one of its money market funds it would rebalance the fund daily in response to the threat of negative yields.Returns from money market funds in Europe have been hit by  weakening in trading conditions after the European Central Bank cut its deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent. Discouraging economic data and geopolitical risk made things worse.That has left many investors worrying over whether they will get a return or lose money on a range of money market instruments, and if so how much, as the ECB action is felt in prices across the market.""Negative is the new normal, and clients need to think about what that means for their cash management,"" said Bea Rodriguez, the head of cash portfolio management for Europe at BlackRock. ""Most people haven't had to think about cash,"" she said. ""It's often the last thing they think about in their portfolio. But right now there is a cost to holding cash.""Some funds have closed to new money since the ECB first moved to a zero deposit rate in July 2012.BlackRock is the latest firm to look to tweak its rulebook in order to keep a fund open. Others, with more focus on credit, have yet to feel the pinch.It will do this by distributing income from the ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund daily instead of monthly and, if the investments have returned a negative yield, cancel as many units in the fund as necessary to ensure the value of the remaining units remains steady. ""In the case of net negative portfolio yields, due to all securities that the fund can invest in trading negatively, maintaining a stable net asset value (NAV) would be impossible without having appropriate mechanisms in place or undergoing structural changes,"" BlackRock said in a statement.Investors would still lose money in that situation, but they should lose less than they would by parking their cash at the bank, using alternatives such as the commercial paper or repo market or by leaving it with a custodian. All of those incur costs.""Investors still value money market funds as a cash- management tool, and we want to make sure our clients can continue to access our funds during these challenging times,"" Rodriguez said. Investors in the ICS Euro Government Liquidity Fund voted in 2013 to put a so-called Reverse Distribution Mechanism in place to allow the fund to continue to operate in a negative interest rate environment.On Wednesday, BlackRock wrote to them to give 14 days notice of its intention to trigger the mechanism, although it stressed this did not imply the yield of the fund would turn negative as a result.BlackRock currently manages around $268 billion equivalent in money market funds and cash portfolios around the globe, of which it has 23 billion euros ($29.77 billion)in three euro-denominated funds and roughly 35 billion pounds ($56.81 billion) in two sterling-denominated funds.At the end of 2012, total assets under management held in money market funds in Europe was around 1 trillion euros, the Institutional Money Market Funds Association said on its website. The U.S. market was around $2.6 trillion.When the ECB cut its deposit rate to zero in 2012, BlackRock and other big money market fund providers like JPMorgan  and Goldman Sachs temporarily restricted access to some of their funds to protect shareholders from yield dilution.After the latest ECB measures, JPMorgan Asset Management said in a statement it did not expect its money market fund to turn negative in the near term.""All of our euro money funds remained ""open for business as normal.

400,"  BOSTON Hackers accessed dozens of servers at JPMorgan Chase & Co in a cyberattack launched in June, though no money was taken, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the investigation into the case. “We are confident we have closed any known access points and prevented any future access in the same way,"" the paper quoted JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau as saying. She added that the bank had “not seen any unusual fraud activity” since the intrusion was discovered and said there was no evidence that they have taken any proprietary software or had a blueprint of the bank’s network, according to the Times. JPMorgan disclosed late last month that it had been the victim of a cyberattack and was working with U.S. law enforcement authorities to determine its scope. The Times said the attack began in June, was detected in July and that the bank last week briefed financial regulators on the extent of the damage. The report said that hackers accessed information on about 1 million customer accounts. It cited one source as saying that hackers had not gained access to financial information or Social Security numbers, and may have only been able to review names, addresses and phone numbers.Bank spokeswoman Trish Wexler told Reuters she could not elaborate on Lemkau's statements to the paper or otherwise comment on the report.

401,"   By Astrid Zweynert  LONDON, Sept 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Governments can unleash billions of dollars to tackle social problems more effectively if they take bold steps to reduce barriers to investing for both profit and social good, a task force set up by the world's richest nations said on Monday.In its first report, the G8 Social Impact Investment Task Force calls on governments to make tax and regulatory reforms to catalyse the market in investments that generate social or environmental benefits alongside financial returns.""This is not about increasing or reducing public expenditure, but helping government to benefit from innovation and private sector capital in order to achieve more impact with the money it has,"" Ronald Cohen, the chair of the year-old task force, said in a statement.The report highlights the potential of so-called ""impact investing"" to help solve some of society's most pressing issues, such as caring for children and the elderly, community regeneration, financial inclusion, housing and prisoner reoffending.Already, some $46 billion in impact investments are under management globally, according to estimates. While this figure is growing, it is only a tiny fraction of the $210 trillion invested in financial markets around the world.U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan estimates that capital flows into impact investing could reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade.The report sets out eight recommendations to governments and financial service providers in the Group of Eight countries. They include allowing charitable foundations to consider social as well as financial returns on their investments and boosting the use of social businesses in public services.The task force also said pension funds and providers of tax-advantaged savings schemes and products should do more to include impact investments as part of their offering. MOMENTUM The concept of impact investing has gathered momentum as cash-strapped governments struggle to cope with poverty, broken health care systems, crime and poor education and increasingly look for money from the private sector.In Britain, for example, a youth offender costs the state £21,268 ($34,600) per year, while a successful programme to prevent reoffending could cost as little as £7,000 ($11,400), the report said.""Social impact investment harnesses the forces of entrepreneurship and capital and the power of markets to do good,"" Cohen said. Britain has been among the leaders in efforts to boost impact investing. In 2010 it pioneered a social impact bond, a £5 million ($8 million) investment by 17 foundations and charitable trusts to reduce reoffending by prisoners.Investors only receive a return if agreed targets are met, and early indications suggest they will get their money back with a positive return, the report said.Similar bonds have since been launched in Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany, India and the United States.Impact investment can also play a role in the delivery of the new sustainable development goals to succeed the U.N. Millennium Development goals after 2015 by increasing the flow of capital to tackle climate change, water scarcity, food shortages and lack of access to health care, the report said.Efforts are under way to fight malaria in Mozambique and sleeping sickness in Uganda, as well as improve education in Rwanda through development impact bonds, the report said.($1 = 0.6147 British Pounds)   (Editing by Ros Russell)",2014-09-14,JPM,"Sun Sep 14, 2014 | 7:01pm EDT",TRF-Governments hold key to unlocking billions for social good - G8 report,http://www.reuters.com//article/foundation-investment-idUSL5N0RD3A520140914?type=companyNews

405,"  (Adds detail on card security breaches, byline)By David HenryNEW YORK, Sept 17 JPMorgan Chase & Co is replacing some credit and debit cards following the security breach at Home Depot Inc, a company spokesman said.The company began sending notices on Tuesday to some card holders, advising them that they will soon receive new cards because the breach put them ""at risk.""One of the notices said the company would mail a new card on Sept. 30. The existing card can be used in the meantime, but the notice advised monitoring the account for unrecognized purchases.JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick could not immediately say how many cards are likely to be replaced. Home Depot disclosed on Sept. 8 that its payment security systems had been breached. The company is investigating how much account data might have been taken as customers paid for purchases in the United States and Canada from April through August.The spokesman could not immediately say why the bank moved now to replace the cards or discuss how it balanced the goals of thwarting fraud and minimizing inconvenience to customers.After card data was taken from Target Corp stores in December, JPMorgan quickly canceled some debit cards that were threatened and asked customers to go to branches for replacements. JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and one of the biggest card issuers. It issues cards under its Chase brand and under co-branding relationships with some airlines and hotel chains, such as United, Southwest and Marriott.The notice to card holders said customers will not be liable for unauthorized transactions that they report promptly to the company. The company said it would continue to monitor accounts to help identify unusual activity. After confirming the breach, Home Depot promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially affected customers.The retailer had said earlier it will roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores by the end of the year to prevent card fraud.Brian Krebs, who runs the security website KrebsOnSecurity and first reported the Home Depot breach, said earlier this month that it could be larger than the attack on Target in which hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data during that retailer's busiest season.Target has spent $146 million to resolve data breach-related issues since the fourth quarter of 2013. Most of the expenses were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims, mainly by payment card networks.The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc TJX.N, operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, which had more than 90 million credit cards stolen over about 18 months.

Private equity firms are among the prospective buyers, the people added. The people asked not to be identified because the sale process is not public. Pharos declined to comment while spokespeople for TPG, American Beacon and JPMorgan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Founded in 1986, Fort Worth, Texas-based American Beacon manages a series of mutual funds open to institutional investors, retirement accounts and individual investors. It had $60.1 billion in assets under management as of the end of June. In 2008, AMR Corp, the former parent of American Airlines Group Inc, sold American Beacon, which at the time operated as its asset-management subsidiary, to Pharos and TPG for $480 million. AMR kept a small stake in American Beacon as part of that deal.Private equity dealmaking in the U.S. asset management sector has largely been elusive. One prominent deal last year was Carlyle Group LP's acquisition of bond manager TCW Group Inc from France's Societe Generale.

412,"  RICHMOND Virginia said on Monday it had dropped lawsuits against two units of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N that accused them of defrauding the state's retirement fund in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.The banks, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and WaMu Capital Corp, were among 13 that Virginia Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring sued last week. He is seeking $1.15 billion in damages, charging the banks misled the Virginia Retirement System about the quality of loans in investments purchased between 2004 and 2010.Herring's office said in a statement it had identified a confidential settlement agreement for $3 million that barred further action against J.P. Morgan Securities and WaMu Capital.Herring's Republican predecessor, Ken Cuccinelli, and the previous governor, Robert McDonnell, had approved the terms, the statement said.

The case follows many other states' resolution of similar cases over losses that state funds suffered from pools of mortgages considered to be at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.

416,"   By Josephine Mason and Melanie Burton | NEW YORK/SYDNEY  NEW YORK/SYDNEY Swiss commodity trader Mercuria, known best for its energy  prowess, is mounting an audacious challenge to metal trading titans like Glencore Plc and Trafigura AG [TRAFGF.UL], but not in the way that industry sources had expected.    Rather than relying on its pending $3.5 billion purchase of JPMorgan Chase & Co's physical commodity business to build out its China-focused metals business into a global powerhouse, the upstart trader has hired a new global metals trading head and is quietly preparing a move into new markets, according to four sources familiar with its strategy.Earlier this month, Trafigura's former global refined metals chief Tristan Busch joined Mercuria as global head of metals, spearheading a foray into North and South America and Europe, the sources said. It is the firm's first major expansion since starting trading copper, aluminum and other base metals just over two years ago.Meanwhile, Mercuria will not retain JPMorgan's top metal traders, Sam Hainsworth and Ivan Petev, when the acquisition is completed in the next few weeks, the four sources said.Also, the size of the bank's trading book has shrunk in the past year, as long-term contracts have expired during the year-long sales process, they added.JPMorgan declined to comment.Mercuria spokesman Matthew Lauer played down the scale of the company's ambitions, which do not include the kind of vast mining projects that Glencore secured with last year's takeover of Xstrata.""It is absurd to reason that Mercuria is working to rival other businesses with billions of dollars in resources and more than 20 years of experience in the metals trading space,"" he said in an email.Still, Mercuria, founded a decade ago by two former Goldman Sachs oil traders, will undertake a significant strategic shift to broaden its business beyond the high-volume Chinese copper financing deals that helped make it the world's third-largest base metals trader, handling over one million tonnes per year.With China embroiled in a scandal over missing warehouse stockpiles, Mercuria is focusing on the fiercely competitive business of securing offtake agreements and building relationships with producers and end users, the sources said.Following the same strategy as its rivals, some traders have tagged Mercuria a ""Trafigura Mark Two"" in the making.But it is also a similar model to the one carved out in energy trading by Mercuria founders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, who have transformed a small trading house into a global competitor. Turnover topped $100 billion last year for the first time, with profit at $273 million.  CHINA FOCUS Mercuria's metals business mainly deals in base metals from its Chinese headquarters in Shanghai helmed by another Trafigura alumnus and copper trader, James Wu. It has about 50 personnel in China, including about 10 traders, two sources said.Busch, who led Trafigura's charge into aluminum almost a decade ago before being promoted to global head of refined metal in 2011, will oversee Wu and veteran trader Jose Leon who started Mercuria's concentrates trading operations late last year. While Leon and Busch are based in Geneva and the firm has several staff in the Lulumbashi, the Democratic Republic of Congo's copper belt, Mercuria's global presence is limited, sources say. Mercuria's Lauer denied the company has staff in the DRC.In at least one way that will change substantially when Mercuria closes its purchase of the JPMorgan business, including the centuries-old Henry Bath & Sons Ltd metals warehousing unit, a prize asset with sheds stretching from Singapore to Rotterdam and about 25 staff. That will help Mercuria push into consumer business as well as juggle inventory around the world. ""Our goal for Henry Bath is to operate it as an independent warehouse facility. It will be separate from our trading operation,"" Lauer said.JPMorgan's operations also have a long and distinguished pedigree as one of the world's largest and most successful metals businesses, with roots in legendary German trading house Metallgesellschaft and, more recently, Sempra Commodities.Despite its history, however, the portion of the business being sold is ""symbolic"" compared with its vast energy operations, according to a source close to JPMorgan.It is unclear how many traders the firm will hire as part of the push. JPMorgan metals staff will only account for a small share of the less than 200 people it will retain out of the 400-strong business, sources have said.Long-time aluminum trader Hainsworth, who joined the desk 14 years ago from Barclays, may leave the bank after the deal is signed, the four sources who know the traders said.The timing is unknown because it has not been officially announced yet. While Petev, who deals in copper from Singapore, will not join Mercuria, it is not clear if he will stay at JPMorgan after the signing.Both were formerly traders at Sempra Commodities, where Dunand and Jaeggi also worked in the early 2000. They moved from RBS Sempra to the Wall Street bank with the acquisition in 2010.BEYOND REPOS Mercuria has been one of the most successful new entrants on the metals market in recent years, even as competition from other energy trading house Gunvor [GGL.UL] and Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual [BTG.UL] has intensified.The mainstay of its meteoric growth has been through so-called repo deals in China, which give companies access to short-term credit in exchange for goods, three sources familiar with the company have said.""It's huge, it's China centric and all they do is trade repos. It's going in the right direction, but it needs more focus on stuff beyond repo,"" said one of the four sources familiar with the strategy.Suspected fraud at China's Qingdao port has left banks and trading firms exposed to billions of dollars of losses and curbed the market's appetite for repo deals though. Mercuria had alumina worth about $44 million stuck at the port, one of China's largest, and the company is facing legal action from Trafigura's warehouse business Impala.

419,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Rocket Internet, the global e-commerce investor, will take a more hands-on role in its stable of companies through a stock market listing which was fully subscribed within the first hour of taking orders, it said on Wednesday. The German company is riding the coattails of last week's successful listing by Chinese rival Alibaba and on Tuesday said it was doubling the amount of money it planned to raise in its share sale to 1.48 billion euros ($1.9 billion).Founded in 2007 by brothers Oliver, Alexander and Marc Samwer, Rocket Internet has set up e-commerce sites and online marketplaces for everything from taxis to meal deliveries in more than 100 countries. Its companies made about $1 billion in revenues last year.However, chief executive and co-founder Oliver Samwer on Wednesday said Rocket Internet aimed to reinvent itself through the initial public offering (IPO) financing, saying it will turn itself into an operating company from its prior role as an incubator for start-up firms. ""Rocket is not an investor. Rocket is an operating company,"" he told a news conference for the IPO which is set to begin trading in Frankfurt on Oct. 9. Instead of simply fattening up its stable of start-ups for eventual sale, Samwer said the company would now focus on building and operating the companies under the Rocket umbrella, and seek to retain majority control of the assets they create. ""We will finance our companies significantly longer,"" Samwer said. ""Previously, we could only support them in an early phase as we didn’t have enough money,"" forcing it to seek early exits.Rocket's flotation follows the surging demand for the listing of Alibaba shares, which shot up 38 percent in its debut last Friday, and next week's listing of Zalando, a European fashion site that Rocket helped to found.   The two flotations are set to be Germany's biggest technology listings since the bursting of the dot.com bubble a decade ago, and will make billionaires of the Samwer brothers, who own 52.3 percent of Rocket stock and a stake in Zalando.The pricing of the shares could value Rocket at up to 6.7 billion euros ($8.6 billion). The Rocket group's own revenues, which until now it made largely by charging consultancy fees to the companies it set up, rose 43 percent to 47 million euros in the first half of 2014, while it made a net loss of 13.3 million as expenses rose. THE LONG ROAD  At every opportunity, Samwer underscored his drive to replicate the success of Amazon.com Inc and Alibaba in markets that the U.S. and Chinese groups have yet to dominate such as Africa, Latin America, Russia and other parts of Asia.""Our target is to be the leading internet platform outside the U.S. and China one day. Rocket's best time is yet to come,"" said Samwer.Samwer's ambitious strategy is to dominate ecommerce business in many emerging markets by partnering with local telecom and logistics companies to be the first to create the necessary infrastructure to allow online shopping via phones. However, the company faces daunting logistical challenges and rising local competition.  He argues this hybrid ecommerce-emerging markets approach will provide his company with barriers to entry against Internet-only companies that try to follow Rocket's lead.""Ecommerce is 50 percent digital and 50 percent physical,"" Samwer said of his bid to reach shoppers in more than 100 countries with the basic elements to enable a functioning consumer market. One major German fund investor said he bought the idea. ""If you want to make money in ecommerce, you have to have a superior infrastructure,” said the investor, who declined to be named. ""The jury is out as to whether the strategy will be successful.""A second investor, Michael Muders, a portfolio manager with Union Investment, said investors in the company were not looking for conventional Deutshland AG stock. ""Rocket has a business model that hasn't existed anywhere else, up to now,"" he said.“You have to believe in the concept, and in the potential of emerging markets, and in the fact that online shopping grows further,” Muders said of the set of risks involved. Rocket, which previously had only released minimal financial details, said in its IPO filing that its top 11 ventures, such as Russian fashion site Lamoda and Indian online store Jabong, produced aggregate net losses of 442 million euros in 2013.Samwer was adamant that, as an operating company, Rocket could transform its financial prospects. ""Every one of our companies has a clear path to profitability,"" he told reporters.He said Rocket aimed to retain majority control in its businesses over the longer term, but did not rule out further IPOs of existing businesses in order to accrue further capital to fund its global plans. ""It may be that some of our larger companies might also list over time,"" he said. Possible IPO candidates include online home furnishing retailers Westwing and Home24.Rocket claims it can launch a company within 100 days by drawing on expertise at its Berlin head office in areas such as finance, communications, marketing and business intelligence, helping it start from three to six new business lines a year.While initially, the shareholder base will be drawn entirely from institutional investors and wealthy individuals, Samwer said he viewed Rocket Internet as appropriate for retail investors with patience.""Our markets are still developing,"" he said in response to a question by Reuters. ""They will have to wait for them to develop. So our share is suitable for every shareholder that has a long-term investment horizon.”    (1 US dollar = 0.7795 euro) (Reporting by Eric Auchard, Alexander Huebner and Jonathan Gould; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Robin Pomeroy)",2014-09-24,JPM,"Wed Sep 24, 2014 | 11:50am EDT",Rocket draws big investor crowd for emerging market Web plan,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-rocketinternet-ipo-demand-idUSKCN0HJ0IR20140924?type=companyNews

The three banks each brought in around $5.9 billion in revenue from that business in the six months to end-June. That compares with $7.6 billion made by JPMorgan last year, when it was also the top bank in FICC, and reflects the structural and cyclical pressures that have dogged FICC divisions in recent years.FICC trading has been steadily falling since the 2008 crisis, partly due to a collapse in interest rates across the developed world that has crushed volatility.

He said the plaintiffs could try again to certify a class on damages.Oetken ruled 10 months after JPMorgan reached a $13 billion settlement to resolve U.S. and state probes into the New York-based bank's sale of mortgage securities. The class consists of investors before March 23, 2009 in certificates issued from nine of 11 trusts created by JPMorgan for the April 2007 offering. The other two trusts attracted only a handful of investors, and are the subject of other lawsuits. Oetken named the Laborers Pension Trust Fund for Northern California and Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as lead plaintiffs, and their law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd as lead counsel.A JPMorgan spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plaintiffs' lawyer did not immediately respond to a similar request.The lawsuit said that JPMorgan misled prospective investors about the underwriting, appraisals and credit quality of the home loans underlying the certificates. It said that by the time the litigation began in March 2009, six months after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc failed, the certificates were worth at most 62 cents on the dollar.Oetken rejected JPMorgan's arguments that the case could not be a class action because it was based on the practices of many originators and more than 8,000 underwriting guidelines, some investors were more sophisticated than others, and the MBS had evolved too rapidly during the two-year class period. He also said he had no basis to accept JPMorgan's request that he disqualify Robbins Geller because one of what the judge called the firm's ""confidential sources"" for the lawsuit, a former employee at a loan originator, later withdrew his testimony - something the bank said had occurred in other cases handled by the firm.The case, whose caption names a different plaintiff, is Fort Worth Employees' Retirement Fund v.

431,"  (Recasts to add details on offering, context, background throughout)By Guillermo Parra-BernalSAO PAULO, Sept 30 Ouro Fino Saúde Animal Participações SA, Brazil's third-largest veterinary products maker, seeks to raise up to 363.5 million reais ($148 million) from investors in an initial public offering slated to price next month, which could be the first IPO in the country this year.The Cravinhos, Brazil-based company and some shareholders will offer 13.46 million shares priced between 26 reais and 27 reais each, a securities filing said on Tuesday. Ouro Fino estimates that almost 45 percent of its shares will be publicly traded should an extra 4.7 million shares be sold via additional and supplementary allotments.The IPO is set to price as early as Oct. 17, between the first and second rounds of Brazil's most unpredictable presidential election in 12 years. Regardless of how the race plays out, a banker involved in the deal told Reuters on Tuesday that ""there is no turning back."" Growing interest in the Ouro Fino deal comes as JBS SA , the world's largest meatpacker, put off an IPO of its pork, poultry and food-processing operations in Brazil earlier this month. JBS and banks were wary that volatility stemming from the election could lead to significant pricing discounts, two sources told Reuters.The Bovespa stock index, which jumped in August, has fallen 12 percent since the start of the month, as President Dilma Rousseff overtook opposition candidate Marina Silva, an environmentalist who has embraced pro-market policies, in recent polls. CVC IPO Ouro Fino has hired the investment banking units of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA and Banco do Brasil SA to manage the IPO. The last time a Brazilian company listed shares on the São Paulo Stock Exchange was in December, when travel agency CVC Brasil Operadora de Turismo SA raised 540 million reais. This year, IPOs in Brazil are likely to have their worst year in at least a decade.Under terms of the transaction, Ouro Fino plans to offer as many as 1.923 million common shares in a primary offering, while a number of shareholders including BNDES Participações SA  and controlling partners Norival Bonamichi and Jardel Massari will tender 11.54 million shares in a secondary offering.In a primary offering, a company raises money from an IPO for its own use. A secondary offering allows shareholders to cash out from their investment in the company being listed.($1 = 2.4510 Brazilian reais)   (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-09-30,JPM,"Tue Sep 30, 2014 | 1:08pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Ouro Fino aims to complete first Brazilian IPO this year,http://www.reuters.com//article/brazil-ipo-ouro-fino-idUSL2N0RV1HE20140930?type=companyNews

JPMorgan officials proposed changes to its hiring practices in Asia and the changes formed a part of a set of anticorruption measures approved by its board directors on the bank's audit committee in late 2011, according to the report. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon also knew of the anticorruption measures as they were unveiled, according to the report. U.S. authorities have not accused the bank of any wrongdoings yet.A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the story.

456,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A group of funds that threw a monkey wrench in Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities will object to JPMorgan Chase & Co's $4.5 billion offer to settle claims over similar investments, according to the lawyer that represents them.The funds, collateralized debt obligations known as the Triaxx entities, received court permission on Wednesday to intervene in a proceeding seeking judicial approval of the JPMorgan settlement, people close to the case said.JPMorgan last year reached the $4.5 billion agreement with some 20 institutional investors in 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by JPMorgan and Bear Stearns, which the bank took over during the financial crisis. The settlement would resolve claims over misrepresentations in the quality of mortgages packaged into securities before the collapse of the U.S. housing market.The Triaxx entities hold certificates with an original balance of some $1.5 billion in 13 of the covered trusts, according to court papers.Their claims are ""potentially worth far more than the small percentage of the $4.5 billion settlement than they would receive,"" John Moon, an attorney for Triaxx, argued in the papers, filed in New York state court in Manhattan, seeking permission to intervene.  Moon later told Reuters he planned to object to the deal. Triaxx is the second investor to raise questions about the accord. On Oct. 21, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, which has holdings in 37 of the trusts in the proposed settlement, asked for a three-month extension of the Nov. 3 deadline to object. On Wednesday, Justice Marcy Friedman of New York state Supreme Court also allowed the bank to intervene, but did not change the deadline, people close to the case said. Friedman's chambers declined to comment.In August, trustees overseeing the securities accepted the bank's offer for the vast majority of the trusts.  Some 20 investors agreed to the deal last year, including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Metlife Inc (MET.N), Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Company (ALVG.DE), and Bayerische Landesbank [BAYLN.UL].Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group, did not immediately return a call for comment.In June 2011, Bank of America reached a similar deal with an investor group in which the bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve claims involving securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America acquired in 2008.  A New York judge largely approved the Bank of America deal in January, although she refused to accept a portion objected to by Triaxx, involving loan modifications.Triaxx has since dropped its opposition, as did American International Group Inc, which led objectors to the settlement in a three-year legal battle. An appeals court is still weighing the settlement on behalf of other objectors. Oral arguments were held last week. The case is In re: the application of U.S. Bank National Association, et al, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan), No. 652382/2014.

459,"  Oct 31 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co learned about hackers who stole the bank's contact information for 76 million households and 7 million small businesses through a corporate event that it sponsors, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.According to the report, the bank discovered that the intruders had used some of the same offshore servers to hack both the bank and the website of the J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge.It was not clear when the bank might have discovered the problem had the hackers not used the same I.P. addresses to launch cyberattacks on both the bank and the Corporate Challenge race websites, WSJ reported, citing people briefed on the matter. The Corporate Challenge website, operated by Simmco Data Systems, was later taken offline after the hacking of the site was discovered, WSJ reported.According to the report, the website has been restored by the bank ahead of upcoming races in Shanghai and Singapore, but has moved the payments to a Chase website. (on.wsj.com/1qaZc6r) Officials at J.P. Morgan Chase were not available for comment. The hackers had originally gained access to the bank's network by compromising the computer an employee with special privileges used both at work and at home and then moved across the bank's network to access contact data, the paper reported.Earlier this month, Reuters had reported that two U.S. states were investigating the theft of customer records in a massive cyberattack uncovered over the summer.

460,"   By Lisa Lambert and Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Units of 13 major Wall Street firms, including JPMorgan and UBS, improperly sold bonds from Puerto Rico's landmark March junk deal to retail investors who may not have understood the debt's riskiness, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday.The firms will pay penalties ranging from $54,000 to $130,000, without admitting or denying the regulator's charges that they violated a new rule on minimum denominations for municipal bond sales. This is the first time the SEC has brought a case based on the rule, which prohibits dealers from selling bonds to individual buyers below a certain threshold amount.""These firms violated a straightforward investor protection rule that prohibits the sale of muni bonds in increments below a specified minimum,"" said LeeAnn Gaunt, chief of the SEC's municipal securities and public pensions unit, in a statement. ""We conduct frequent surveillance of trading in the municipal bond market and will penalize abuses that threaten retail investors.”    The $3.5 billion deal in March, the largest municipal junk bond sale in U.S. history, included limits meant to ensure  smaller investors were not caught holding the risky debt unawares.  Specifically, there was a high minimum denomination of $100,000 for a purchase, which carried over when the bonds were traded in the secondary market. The SEC said it found 66 occasions when dealers sold the bonds to investors below that threshold. There was high demand for the debt, which came with a rich 8 percent coupon, from hedge funds and other institutions. Still, less than two weeks after the issuance the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which also oversees the $3.7 trillion municipal market, began inquiring into possible trades involving retail buyers. FINRA would not comment on the SEC charges.Units of Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Investment Professionals, Lebenthal & Co, National Securities Corporation, Oppenheimer & Co, Riedl First Securities Co of Kansas, Stifel Nicolaus & Co, TD Ameritrade, and Wedbush Securities were also charged. A spokesperson for Charles Schwab said the firm ""was included in today’s settlement related to four unsolicited trades that were made under the $100,000 regulatory threshold. When we were alerted to those trades, they were canceled.""Representatives from J.P. Morgan, Lebenthal, Riedl, Stifel Nicolaus and Oppenheimer declined to comment, and a spokesperson from TD Ameritrade said it fully cooperated with the SEC. Others were not immediately available. Over the last year, the territory has come under increasing scrutiny from regulators and investors alike as it tries to address major economic and financial deterioration. It will soon embark on $2.9 billion in financing to help shore up its struggling highway authority while also overhauling its tax system. Separately, UBS has entered a $5.2 million settlement with Puerto Rico's financial regulator stemming from sales of Puerto Rico's closed-end bond funds with investors. A UBS client on Friday sued the regulator to make documents related to the case public.

465,"   By David Henry and Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK When JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) agreed to lead a $700 million bond offering for Russian gas producer Gazprom OAO, (GAZP.MM) it was doing business that some U.S. banks are afraid to do, several lawyers and a banker said. Gazprom faces U.S. sanctions after the U.S. government widened its restrictions against Russia in September. U.S. companies are prohibited from providing goods or technology to Gazprom and others, although they can provide financial services to the companies, meaning JPMorgan obeyed the law in underwriting bonds for the company. Gazprom announced pricing for the deal on Thursday. Peter Kucik, a former U.S. Treasury official who left the department in March, said generally short-term transactions, such as underwriting bonds, should not be a problem. But he said U.S. companies need to be careful in conducting long-term business with Russian firms or banks, since sanctions could always get tougher in the future.  Some U.S. bankers would hesitate to do the business, fearing that even if it is legal, it will look bad to regulators.  ""Our relationship with regulators is so important. We would not want to make them mad,"" said a capital markets banker at a rival firm. ""No one would touch it with a 10-foot pole here.""Some banks' hesitance to underwrite these sorts of bonds underscores the frostiness in relations between banks and their regulators since the financial crisis. Big banks globally face much tighter restrictions on their activity after the financial crisis of 2008 and have paid tens of billions of dollars in fines for violations over the past few years. One lawyer who works extensively with sanctions matters said his clients are ""skittish,"" and are reluctant to expend the effort to determine whether, for example, underwriting bonds for Gazprom's would be legal.   ""They just won't do business with the entities that are listed in those sanctions, even if it is legal,"" the lawyer said. It is not clear exactly what JPMorgan did in this case, but the bank often checks in with regulators in advance of potentially sensitive assignments, such as through a phone call seeking an unofficial consent, a person familiar with the matter said. Doing the deal could help JPMorgan cement its relationship with Gazprom, a company that the bank has worked with extensively in the past.     The U.S. sanctions against Russia are meant to be surgical, focusing on particular people, sectors, and businesses, lawyers who work with the sanctions said.

470,"   By Euan Rocha | TORONTO  TORONTO JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Monday it notified Sears Canada Inc that it plans to terminate their credit card agreement, in another setback for the retailer.The U.S. bank said it served the clothing and household goods retailer with a notice of non-renewal to prevent the agreement, which also expires Nov. 15, 2015, from auto-renewing.Sears Canada also said they plan to explore a sale of the credit card portfolio to another party. In the event of a sale, JPMorgan would pay Sears Canada up to C$174 million under certain circumstances.  Sears Canada and JPMorgan said the bank will service the  credit card business until at least Nov. 15, 2015, but has no obligation to do so after that date.  Sears Canada, hit by tough competition, has seen its market share erode for years. It reported an operating loss of C$187.8 million ($166.19 million) in 2013 and has sold locations at many of the country's top malls.  JPMorgan had purchased the credit card receivables business in 2005, enabling Sears Canada to pay out a special dividend to investors that year. As part of the agreement, JPMorgan agreed to pay annual marketing and other fees to Sears Canada.Desjardins analyst Keith Howlett said in a research note that the tie-up had boosted Sears Canada's annual earnings before interest and taxes by more than C$60 million annually in the early years of the 10-year contract.Sears Canada no longer breaks out the specific contribution from the JPMorgan agreement. Howlett said he believes the contribution is still crucial for Sears Canada, even though the earnings lift from it has likely slipped as the retailer's revenue has declined.""The relative importance of the profit contribution of credit has increased, given Sears Canada is currently losing money on sales of merchandise,"" said Howlett, deeming JPMorgan's decision a negative for Sears Canada. Even so, shares of thinly traded Sears Canada were up 1.29 percent at C$11 late on Monday.""We continue to be committed to working together with Sears on a solution,"" said JPMorgan.Sears Canada said it is confident it can work through the process to find an option for its credit card customers.

482,"   By Lisa Anderson  LONDON, Nov 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Closer collaboration between financial institutions and New York City prosecutors is improving the chances of uncovering and convicting sex traffickers, according to Manhattan's top prosecutor, and a similar programme will be launched in Europe.District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. said a partnership between institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Western Union and Bank of America and law enforcement to share data on client transactions was starting to pay dividends.""I think we have stepped up our game,"" Vance told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.A speaker at the opening of the foundation's third annual Trust Women conference on Tuesday, Vance said data, such as that produced by the initiative, has led to 22 ongoing sex trafficking investigations and contributed to several trials and convictions.The success of the project, a joint initiative of the Thomson Reuters Foundation and Vance's office, prompted the foundation to announce plans to launch a similar campaign in Europe next year.""We need good, innovative ideas. Can data come to the rescue? The answer is yes,"" said Thomson Reuters Foundation CEO Monique Villa. ""And data is used more and more to prosecute the slavers and make them pay for their crimes."" The expansion of the programme came as the latest global slavery index estimated 35.8 million people are living in slavery: born into servitude, trafficked for sex work, trapped in debt bondage, or exploited for forced labour.The global slavery business is estimated to be worth $150 billion a year. Vance's office first partnered with the Thomson Reuters Foundation in April 2013, assembling a working group of top financial institutions to explore how they could share technology and mine stores of client data to discern patterns indicative of human trafficking.""I think that bringing us all together was critically instrumental in helping us move forward,"" said Vance.The financial working group, which consulted with law enforcement and leading anti-trafficking NGOs, included JPMorgan Chase & Co., Western Union, Barclays, Bank of America, Citigroup, TD Bank and Wells Fargo. In January 2014, the working group released a white paper offering guidance to financial institutions in how to identify customer traits and transaction patterns that may signal a higher risk of human trafficking for labour or sex.These red flags include regular transfer of funds from employee accounts back to the employer's account, cross-border transfer of funds inconsistent with the stated business purpose of the client and recurrent business transactions taking place at odd hours and for suspiciously large amounts of money.For example, experts said, a nail salon putting through a charge for $300 at 2 a.m. is probably providing more than a manicure/pedicure.When financial institutions see such patterns they must file a report with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.Since the release of the white paper, Vance said, more banks are filing such reports and are working more proactively with the District Attorney's office.

484,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s  (JPM) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and short-term IDR at 'F1'.  Fitch has also affirmed JPM's viability rating (VR) at 'a+', its support rating  at '1', and its support rating floor (SRF) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. The rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic review of the Global  Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active  banking groups. On balance, Fitch's outlook for the sector is stable. The 12  banks have continued to strengthen their balance sheets in 9M14. Capitalisation  has improved materially over the past two years and liquidity remains sound.  This strengthening balances with continued pressure on earnings, particularly in  securities businesses, and remaining material but unpredictable exposure to  conduct and regulatory risks. Fitch forecasts weak growth in the eurozone during 2015 while growth in the US  and UK is expected to be somewhat stronger, which should help the GTUBs with a  significant presence in these regions. Spikes in market volatility, most  recently in October 2014, show that uncertainty remains over how expectations of  rising interest rates in the US will affect financial markets. Our expectation  is that rises in interest rates will be gradual and would follow improved  prospects for the economy, which should help business volumes. Sharp and  unexpected hikes in US interest rates would likely result in increased market  volatility and, consequently, additional pressure on banks' earnings, although  we believe that the GTUBs' risk appetite has declined.  Lower risk appetite should help the banks avoid material losses on trading  positions but an adverse operating environment could result in a change of our  outlook if earnings prospects suffer materially. For eurozone-focused banks, a  prolonged deflationary scenario would put pressure on earnings and could result  in a changed outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying earnings capacity of  the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing international  franchise, and significant progress made toward achieving compliance with  heightened capital and liquidity requirements. The affirmation also reflects the  firm's strong funding flexibility, given its deposit raising capabilities and  uninterrupted access to the global capital markets through an economic cycle.  JPM's Basel III tier 1 common equity ratio reached 10.1% at Sept. 30, 2014,  which was slightly above management's year-end target but lower than the peer  average. Capital improvements have been supported largely by growth in retained  earnings. Management is targeting a ratio of 10%-10.5% longer-term, which Fitch  believes is prudent, although the target could evolve as further clarity emerges  surrounding regulatory requirements. Still, Fitch believes JPM is well  positioned to maintain compliance with Basel III capital requirements, even with  its higher G-SIFI loss absorbing buffer, given the superior earnings capacity of  the bank. Fitch believes JPM has made meaningful progress on compliance with the  supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) in 2014 and further improvement is expected  in 2015. The firm gained compliance with the SLR in 3Q'14, reaching 5.5%, but  the bank remains 30 basis points shy of the 6% requirement. In 2013, progress on  the SLR came partially at the cost of an increase in the firm's double leverage,  as the firm converted intercompany debt into equity. Double leverage increased  to 1.17 times (x) at year-end 2013, which Fitch viewed as high, relative to  historical standards, but double leverage declined to 1.11x at June 30, 2014,  due to the net issuance of $7.3 billion in perpetual preferred stock in the  first half of the year. Fitch expects JPM to achieve full compliance with all  regulatory requirements, well ahead of required implementation, which for SLR is  2018.  The bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $572 billion of high quality  liquid assets at Sept. 30, 2014, up from $538 billion a year earlier. JPM is in  compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), although its buffer, of  about 20%, is more modest following publication of the U.S. final rules, due to  higher outflow assumptions across certain categories and a reference to peak  outflows rather than cumulative outflows. JPM also believes it is in compliance  with the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which Fitch views favorably.  Earnings performance remains highly resilient, particularly on a relative basis,  as the company remained profitable throughout the financial crisis and continues  to post relatively solid returns despite the recognition of periodic legal  expenses and continued investment in the control agenda. This is a testament to  the company's broad and diverse franchise. Fitch estimates that adjusted pre-tax  earnings were down about 4.3% through the first nine months of 2014,  year-over-year, given weaker mortgage performance, a challenged debt capital  markets environment, and an increase in loan loss provisions. That said, JPM  continues to exhibit strong core loan growth, prudent operating expense  controls, and solid contributions from card, commercial banking, and asset  management.  JPM made significant progress settling a variety of outstanding litigation  during 2013 and early 2014, but several investigations remain open, including  those related to foreign exchange, for which JPM set aside legal reserves in  3Q'14. Legal costs are likely to remain elevated in coming quarters, but Fitch  expects the incremental impact to earnings will be manageable. The emergence of  material and unexpected litigation losses could alter the agency's view,  particularly given where the firm's current capitalization ratios compare to the  broader peer group.  The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating consistency,  although Fitch believes credit costs will remain a headwind, as recent loan  vintages season and asset quality metrics rise from historical lows, and  earnings are likely to continue to be challenged by relatively low interest  rates. A continued focus on operational improvements is expected to offset the  impact to some extent, although JPM is expected to continue to incur costs  associated with its control agenda. Investment banking results will remain  dependent upon market conditions, but JPM's strong market position and diverse  product offering should yield peer-superior performance.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to deliver earnings  growth, particularly in light of the current regulatory environment. Higher  capital charges and what remains difficult market conditions present a challenge  for all GTUBs, which may be encouraged to seek more aggressive ways to generate  profits that take advantage of regulatory changes. However, Fitch expects that  JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity risk management, and product diversity  mitigate some of these concerns. Negative rating actions could result from reputational damage that impacts the  firms market position and/or material asset quality weakening which pressures  JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital, deterioration in liquidity  levels, material and unexpected litigation losses, and/or failure to  sufficiently address weaknesses noted in regulatory consent orders and internal  reviews following material losses in the chief investment office. Further,  significant risk management or operational failures that result in material  losses to the firm could also result in a negative rating action. Fitch considers JPM's ratings to be particularly sensitive to the degree and  scope of litigation risk going forward. Fitch recognizes that the large  litigation charge taken during the third quarter of 2013 reflects JPM's desire  to address outstanding legal issues. To the extent JPM enters into any new and  material litigation settlements, Fitch will consider whether these effectively  diminish ongoing legal risks. Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the foreseeable  future given that its current rating level is among the highest of its peer  group and of the global bank universe.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF JPM's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's  expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of support from the  U.S. government ('AAA'/Outlook Stable) if required. This expectation reflects  the U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its  strong financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain.  Specific to JPM, Fitch's view of support likelihood is based mostly on its  systemic importance in the U.S., its global interconnectedness given its size  and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share and  its position as a key provider of financial services to the U.S. economy. JPM's  IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support because JPM's VR is  above its SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments.  KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SRF The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). A key hurdle that remains is whether sufficient contingent capital  exists at the holding company to recapitalize without requiring government  assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise JPM's SR  to '5' and its SRF to 'No Floor' likely during the first half of 2015. KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from JPM's or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  nonperformance and relative Loss Severity risk profiles. Their ratings are  primarily sensitive to any change in the VRs of JPM or its bank subsidiaries.  KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS JPM's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The ratings of long and short-term deposits issued by JPM and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in JPM's IDR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY AND OPERATING SUBSIDIARY Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. This may result  in a possible downgrade of JPM's holding company rating, an upgrade of operating  company ratings, or no changes to ratings if Fitch's views the long-term debt  requirement assigned to JPM as providing an insufficient amount of bail-in  capital at the operating company level. KEY RATING DRIVERS & SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The IDRs and VRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA and therefore IDRs and VRs are equalized  across the group. JPMorgan Securities LLC (JPMS) is a wholly owned subsidiary  that is the firm's U.S. broker dealer and is considered core to JPM's business.  As a result its IDR is equalized with that of its parent JPM. Bear Stearns  Companies, LLC and JPMorgan Clearing Corp. benefit from a parent guarantee and  therefore their IDRs are equalized with JPM's. Collateralized Commercial Paper  Co., LLC's short-term IDR benefits from JPMS's guarantee of the amounts payable  by the repo seller, JPMCC, and as result its short-term IDR is equalized with  that of JPMS. Collateralized Commercial Paper II Co., LLC's short-term IDR is  based on the repo seller, JPMS's ST IDR.  JPM is a leading global trading and universal bank with $2.5 trillion in total  assets and $16.8 billion of net income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014.

487,"  (Refiles to fix formatting)By Lianting TuSINGAPORE, Nov 28 (IFR) - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is poised to launch its much-anticipated US$5.7bn debut Additional Tier 1 offering in three different currencies, in a bid to target the widest possible investor base and increase its pricing power.The Basel III-compliant contingent capital offering will be only the second offshore issue of its kind from mainland China, following Bank of China's US$6.5bn AT1 sold in mid-October. While that deal comprised a single tranche and was taken up mainly by investors in Greater China, however, ICBC is planning to issue in three currencies - US dollars, euros, and offshore renminbi.ICBC will meet global investors until Tuesday for the 144A/Reg S offering, suggesting that the deal could be launched to the market as early as next week. The tranches are likely to be sized US$2.5bn, 1bn euros and Rmb12bn, making the renminbi portion the largest Dim Sum bond from any issuer other than the Chinese sovereign, and by far the biggest single tranche in that market.S&P is expected to rate ICBC's prefs BB, one notch higher than the BB- it assigned to Bank of China's pref shares. Moody's would rate ICBC's proposed prefs at Ba2, the same rating it gave BOC's paper. The two deals share a similar structure.Investors generally see ICBC as a stronger credit than Bank of China. For one, ICBC is the largest bank in China by many categories including assets, loans, deposits, profits and its common equity base. It is among the Chinese banks that have the highest capital adequacy ratios with total capital adequacy ratio and Tier 1 capital ratios of 14.2% and 11.8%, respectively, as at September 30, compared to BOC's 13.07% and 9.37%.For those reasons, investors generally think the ICBC AT1 should price 20bp-30bp inside the BOC AT1, which had rallied to around 6.25% bid yield-to-call on Friday from a reoffer yield of 6.75%.""ICBC is arguably the strongest of China's Big Four banks and as such, leaving technicals aside, the proposed ICBC AT1's yield should reflect this versus the existing Bank of China AT1s,"" said Swee Ching Lim, Singapore-based analyst at Western Asset Management. Now that BOC has set a benchmark for Chinese AT1s, investors have become more comfortable with this new instrument, which has created a positive backdrop for ICBC, market participants said.In fact, indications of interest for its euro and offshore renminbi tranches have already covered the books for those tranches, according to a source familiar with the deal: ""Lots of IOIs came from Chinese conglomerates that have assets in euros or have offshore renminbi reserves.""Test for Dim SumThe planned Rmb12bn (US$2bn) tranche will be the first Basel III-eligible AT1 offering denominated in offshore renminbi. It is also double the biggest single tranche Dim Sum bond ever issued - a Rmb6bn three-year from China's Ministry of Finance in 2011.""The bank is keen to issue a sizable Dim Sum tranche, which seems to carry the political agenda of deepening the CNH market,"" said a Singapore-based portfolio manager who met the issuer a few weeks ago. Analysts generally believe there will be sufficient offshore renminbi liquidity to absorb such a chunky size. But given how the BOC deal was placed, they doubt pricing will be market-driven.""Based on the minimum interest from global investors and fund managers for BOC's AT1, we wonder whether pricing for ICBC's AT1 is going to be reflective of what institutional investors are willing to accept,"" said David Marshall, Singapore-based senior analyst at CreditSights.BOC's US$6.5bn AT1 relied heavily on Asian insurers and sovereign-linked investors, with 94% of the bonds staying in Asia and only 14% going to fund managers.For benchmarks, investors will have to look at offshore renminbi Tier 2 instruments from ICBC and China Construction Bank. CCB's latest Rmb2bn 10-year non-call five T2, sold in early November to yield 4.9%, was indicated last week at 4.7%. Given the spread between BOC's T2 and AT1 notes of about 140bp, fair value for ICBC's renminbi tranche seems to exceed 6%. Wider distribution?After a concentrated distribution for BOC's AT1, investors are closely watching whether the ICBC deal will have wider sponsorship from global institutional investors. The fact that US investors bought 27% of Bank of China's US$3bn 10-year bullet T2 in early November may be an encouraging sign, but investors still believe AT1 is a completely different animal.""It is difficult to predict US involvement in the proposed ICBC AT1s given, unlike the recently printed BOC T2s which also had a 144A component to it, the AT1s are likely not index-eligible, are governed by Chinese law and are in preference share format,"" Lim of Western Asset Management said.Some analysts, however, believe global investors are warming up to Chinese financials as issuance from the sector continues to grow.""At the end of the day, US investors can no longer ignore the Chinese bank sector,"" said Oscar Chow, Hong Kong-based head of Asia credit research at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. ""Chinese financials have issued about US$30bn of US dollar bonds this year (including senior paper), up over four times versus 2013, and the volume is only going to grow in the future.""CoCos of top-tier US banks such as Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, whose AT1s are rated investment grade, were indicated at low-to-mid 5%, while lower-rated Deutsche Bank, for example, sold its debut Yankee US$1.5bn AT1 (Ba3/BB/BB+) last week at a hefty yield of 7.5%.""When you look from a global perspective where some leading European bank AT1s are yielding more than 7%, I wonder if Chinese bank AT1s offer good value in the 6% range,"" CreditSights' Marshall said. He warned that investors needed to recognise the loss-absorption and coupon deferral risks, as well as the general slowing Chinese economy and worsening asset quality of banks there.ICBC International is sole global co-ordinator and joint bookrunner with Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS.

The timing was always wrong for that purported linkage to be anything other than conspiracy theory.The problem is that the potential conflict of interest was hard-wired into the proposition because of the overlapping interests of JPMorgan in being fund promoter, trading facilitator and storer of the metal, the latter in the form of its Henry Bath warehousing operations.There is an analogy with Goldman Sachs' ownership of LME warehouser Metro and its role in the aluminium market.""Chinese walls"" can be proven to be effective to financial regulators, but they'll never be effective in terms of outside perception.Which is why Goldman Sachs has been fending off regulatory scrutiny, lawsuits and media criticism for the last couple of years.GOOD-BYE TO ALL THAT? Things have changed a lot at JPMorgan since those heady copper market times of 2010.The company has this year disposed of its physical commodity assets, including the Henry Bath metals warehousing business, to Mercuria.It will revert to being a ""pure"" broker in terms of LME metals trading.But that doesn't mean that it couldn't amass client positions to the point of market dominance again. And if it does so in the copper market, it still won't have to include those holdings in meeting the limits imposed by the Fed and the OCC.Nor will any other U.S. bank as long as copper is deemed to be ""bullion"".And while it is, to quote the subcommittee's report, ""copper will continue to provide a loophole that can be used to circumvent otherwise applicable physical commodity safeguards important to protecting U.S. taxpayers from risks related to physical commodity activities"".

501,"   By Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said on Tuesday the bank has been questioned by the U.S. Department of Justice over auto lending practices that possibly resulted in discrimination.The largest U.S. bank said in an annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the Justice Department is looking at whether auto loans made by car dealerships to borrowers of different races and ethnicities may have been  marked up.JPMorgan is the fifth-largest U.S. auto lender behind Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) in-house lending arm and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), according to Experian Automotive.  Ally settled an investigation into similar discriminatory lending practices with the Justice Department and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in December 2013 for $98 million. Toyota Motor Credit Corp TOYOM.UL said in December that it faced an enforcement action from U.S. authorities over whether auto loans it offered through dealerships violated fair lending laws.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ""has focused significant resources on rooting out discrimination in indirect auto lending,"" Director Richard Cordray said on Monday, adding that lenders have reimbursed 425,000 consumers who faced discrimination in loans approximately $136 million. Lenders and car dealers have criticized the methodology the U.S. government has used previously to determine whether they exhibited bias against minority borrowers. In a November study, the American Financial Services Association, an industry group, found that the statistical methods that enforcement officials used to determine whether such borrowers were overcharged had high error rates.The government's calculations ""may create the appearance of differential pricing...when none exists,"" AFSA and four other industry groups wrote in a Feb 18 letter.  The examinations into auto loan bias were unrelated to the Justice Department's investigation into subprime auto lending, an area that federal prosecutors are focusing on more as their probes into mortgage bonds come to a close.

502,"   By David Henry and Peter Rudegeair | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said on Tuesday it aims to save about $1.4 billion in annual expenses, mainly in consumer and investment banking, as a proposed government requirement to hold more capital is expected to pinch profits. The largest U.S. bank by assets expects expenses in 2015 to fall to roughly $57 billion from $58.4 billion in 2014, JPMorgan said at its annual investor day. Shares rose 2.5 percent to $60.82, reaching their highest since the beginning of January.JPMorgan is looking to lower expenses by $2.8 billion in its investment bank, excluding legal costs, and by about $2 billion in its consumer bank. Some savings will be offset by investments elsewhere in the company. Just over half the investment banking expense reductions will come from simplifying businesses, but JPMorgan will also look to cut technology and operational costs in that division by $1 billion and front-office personnel costs by $300 million.Daniel Pinto, chief executive for JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, told Reuters that personnel cost cuts will come from job cuts and pay cuts. The bank has not yet determined how many jobs will be eliminated, he said.""We are working through the process,"" Pinto said on the sidelines of the conference at the company's headquarters on Park Avenue.It has become easier for JPMorgan to pay its market employees less and still compete with rivals because trading revenues have been shrinking across the industry, he added. The changes are necessary because of weak revenue and higher regulatory burdens on the investment bank. ""You have no choice,"" Pinto said.New information systems will help lower tech costs by reducing the time needed to process trades and other transactions, Pinto said.Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told analysts the latest cost cutting is in line with continuing efforts to keep a lid on expenses. But some analysts said they left the conference believing Dimon and his lieutenants are pushing harder than ever.""It feels as though they are turning up the intensity on efficiency"" after three years of no real progress reducing costs relative to revenue, CLSA analyst Mike Mayo said. The new $2.8 billion target for reducing costs in corporate & investment bank ""is a big number,"" said Mayo.

510,"   By Jamie McGeever | LONDON  LONDON Deposit outflows from Greece's banks rose last week to around 3 billion euros, according to JP Morgan estimates, ahead of Friday's last-minute aid extension agreement with the country's euro zone creditors.The 50 percent increase in the pace of outflows from the prior week's 2 billion euros meant Greek banks were on track to run out of collateral for new loans in eight weeks as opposed to 14 the week before, JP Morgan said.This is based on its calculation that of a maximum 108 billion euros of financing available from the European Central Bank and Greek central bank, Greek banks have already used up 85 billion euros, leaving them with 23 billion euros if needed. Hard data on Greek bank deposit flows come with a long time lag, meaning estimates are the most up-to-date guides. Outflows apparently accelerated during last week.They totaled more than 1 billion euros over Wednesday and Thursday, three senior banking sources told Reuters on Friday, and about 1 billion euros on Friday alone, another senior banker said. Greece is discussing a list of reforms including measures to tackle tax evasion and corruption with international partners to ensure it is accepted. Approval will secure the financial lifeline outlined on Friday. Total bank deposit outflows this year, which JP Morgan estimates by using a proxy of Greek demand for money market funds overseas, stand at around 25 billion euros - equivalent to more than 3 billion per week. Outflows rose in the run-up to the Jan 25 election that brought the current government into office, dipping thereafter before rising again as the deadline for a debt deal neared.

513,"  MEXICO CITY Feb 25 Latin American financial markets fell on Wednesday, dragged down by losses in Brazil as the country's currency tumbled and shares of state-run oil firm Petrobras sank after Moody's cut its investment grade to junk.Shares in Petrobras fell more than 6 percent after Moody's Investors Service stripped the company of its investment-grade rating late on Tuesday and said it could cut the country's state-run oil company again due to an ongoing corruption scandal and liquidity pressures.Reuters reported on Wednesday that Petrobras has hired JPMorgan Chase & Co to handle $3 billion in planned asset sales this year in a bid to cut its debt levels.The losses helped pull down Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index  by 0.68 percent. Brazil's real shed nearly 1.3 percent to bid at 2.8692 per dollar. The Petrobras downgrade further eroded the attractiveness of assets in Brazil, which is struggling with an economic slowdown, analysts said.""The downgrade should intensify the recent turmoil in the Brazilian financial markets,"" wrote analysts at BBVA. Brazil currently has no plans to capitalize Petrobras despite market fears the state-run oil company could need fresh capital, two government officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Mexico's benchmark IPC index fell 0.3 percent, slipping off its highest level in nearly three months while Mexico's peso  was little changed, down 0.1 percent to 14.9350 per dollar.Shares in Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa, the biggest Coke bottler in Latin America, fell 1.4 percent after it reported flat fourth-quarter earnings, hurt by currency weakness in Venezuela and Mexico.(Reporting by Michael O'Boyle in Mexico City and Bruno Federowski in Sao Paulo; Editing by Diane Craft)",2015-02-25,JPM,"Wed Feb 25, 2015 | 2:40pm EST","EMERGING MARKETS-Brazil stocks down, real tumbles after Petrobras cut to junk",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-emerging-idUSL1N0VZ2FW20150225?type=companyNews
514,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Mike Stone | SAO PAULO/NEW YORK  SAO PAULO/NEW YORK Petróleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) has hired JPMorgan Chase & Co to handle $3 billion in planned asset sales this year, as fallout from a corruption scandal has shut access to financing for Brazil's state-controlled oil producer, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said on Wednesday.JPMorgan (JPM.N) will be tasked with luring the largest number of bidders possible for the assets and then structuring their sale, said a first source, who asked for anonymity since the process is private. Properties and drilling licenses are among assets that could be put on the block, the source added.According to a second source, meetings are being scheduled in the coming weeks to further look at deal opportunities. Both Petrobras, as the company is commonly known, and JPMorgan declined to comment.Asset sales have become imperative for Petrobras now that Moody's Investors Service has stripped the company of its investment-grade rating and has warned that further cuts are possible. Worries over a looming cash crunch and the scandal were behind the downgrade, Moody's said late on Tuesday. In what is being called Brazil's worst corruption scandal in history, prosecutors have alleged that allies of President Dilma Rousseff used Petrobras to skim billions of reais through overpriced contracts in political campaign kickbacks for over a decade.The scandal has cut Petrobras' access to bond markets after independent auditors, concerned over the need for potential asset impairments, refused to sign off on the company's quarterly earnings reports.Chief Executive Officer Aldemir Bendine, who took office a month ago, has made investment cuts and asset divestitures the cornerstone of his plan to restore confidence in the scandal-battered company. A reduction in the company's five-year, $221 billion capital spending plan is also widely expected. Moody's was the first of the three major rating firms to put Petrobras ratings on so-called junk status. Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor's currently rate Petrobras at the lowest investment-grade ranking. Last week, JPMorgan Securities analysts predicted that Moody's would be first to announce a Petrobras downgrade. Moody's Petrobras ratings cut was the largest corporate downgrade in terms of the amount of debt impacted in 10 years. According to the first source, potential bidders could include Middle East investors, mainly sovereign wealth funds familiar with oil and gas projects. Petrobras sold $10.7 billion worth of assets between October 2012 and December 2013, as part of a plan to exit non-core assets to fund its investment program.

518,"   By Steve Slater and Lawrence White | LONDON/HONG KONG  LONDON/HONG KONG Standard Chartered (STAN.L) said former JPMorgan (JPM.N) investment bank boss Bill Winters will take over as chief executive in June, replacing Peter Sands in a major management overhaul following two years of problems. Investors had been pushing for a change at the helm of the  Asia-focused bank citing strategic, governance and operational mistakes, and saying Sands had been slow to address troubles including a U.S. fine for breaking sanctions to losses on commodities loans. Winters, 53, is currently CEO of the Renshaw Bay hedge fund he founded and is one of the most respected bankers in the industry. He has wide experience of investment banking and regulatory issues. The bank's two biggest shareholders, Singapore sovereign fund Temasek and Aberdeen Asset Management - who own more than 25 percent between them - welcomed the changes which will also see Chairman John Peace leave next year. ""From what we know at this point, this is an amazingly astute choice,"" said Jim Antos, a Hong-Kong based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.Antos said Winters could force ""real change"" at the bank and has strong credibility with U.S. and UK regulators, ""which is exactly what the bank needs.""Standard Chartered shares jumped 5 percent on the news of the appointment before trimming gains amid concerns the bank is now more likely to launch a rights issue to address concerns about its capital strength.By 1244 GMT (7:44 a.m. EST) Standard Chartered shares were up 3 percent at 956 pence. They have fallen 30 percent since the start of 2013.Analysts said there could be more changes in management, although Peace said Mike Rees, the deputy CEO and head of the wholesale bank, was staying in his role.

526,"  (Adds quote from Argentine embassy in U.S.)By Eliana Raszewski and Davide ScigliuzzoBUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK Feb 25 Argentina, a pariah of the global debt market for more than a decade, believes it has an opportunity to raise debt internationally and on Wednesday began marketing a new bond issue to non-U.S. investors.Central bank chief Alejandro Vanoli said the government saw an opportune moment to follow some provinces and state-run energy firm YPF which have raised debt abroad.The South American country has faced prohibitively high borrowing costs since its record 2002 default on $100 billion, in part due to a legal battle with creditors who refused to take part in its 2005 and 2010 restructurings that pushed it into a fresh default in July.""The global context presents an important window of opportunity,"" Vanoli told radio station Blue FM, referring to U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments on Tuesday that it would be several months before the Fed might raise interest rates. Another incentive could be the surge in prices of Argentine debt over the past few sessions partly on market optimism of a more investor-friendly government coming to power after October's presidential election.The government has begun marketing a new issue of Bonar 2024  notes via Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase & Co as it seeks to raise cash ahead of upcoming maturities and avoid legal risks in the United States, two people with knowledge of the offering told Thomson Reuters' IFR.One of the sources said lead managers have been talking about a sale of $2.7 billion, with proceeds going toward the repayment of its Boden 2015 notes this year. A new issuance would be its first foray into the dollar-bond market since the flop of a $3 billion offer in December, which attracted only $286 million in bids.""(Argentina) could consider additional long-term financing to continue expanding its infrastructure investment,"" Cecilia Nahon, Argentina's ambassador to the United States, said in a statement.Investors piled into a new $500 million bond from the city of Buenos Aires earlier this month, hoping to reap hefty gains if Argentina mends fences with creditors after October's vote. YPF also sold $500 million worth of bonds in its first international debt sale since Argentina's default.Argentina was barred by a U.S. judge from paying the coupon on its restructured bonds in July because it refused to also pay a group of so-called ""holdout"" creditors that rejected its 2005 and 2010 restructurings.The holdout hedge funds offered last month to restart talks aimed at clearing the country's non-paying sovereign bonds. Argentina said it was considering the offer but has so far made no public moves to return to talks.NML Capital Ltd, one of the lead holdout creditors, said it was ""dismayed that JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank are participating in the schemes of an international scofflaw, schemes which we believe are an attempt to evade the court-ordered enforcement of bondholders' rights.""JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

527,"  SAO PAULO Feb 27 Petróleo Brasileiro SA   denied on Friday that it has hired JPMorgan Chase & Co to handle the sale of oil exploration licenses in deep-sea areas off the coast this year.In a securities filing, the state-controlled oil producer known as Petrobras reiterated the need to reduce capital investments, dispose of assets and step up divestitures to preserve cash.Petrobras also said JPMorgan did not have a mandate to map out potential investors interested in acquiring licenses for subsalt oil reserves currently held by Petrobras. The company is in touch with banks to refinance existing credit lines or tap new ones, the filing said. The filing came after Brazil's securities regulator CVM requested clarifications from Petrobras following a report in the O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper that it was looking to sell subsalt drilling licenses. Subsalt refers to deep-sea oil resources off Brazil's coast, trapped beneath a layer of mineral salts under the seabed. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Petrobras hired JPMorgan  to advise on the sale of about $3 billion in assets, as fallout from a corruption scandal shut access to financing. Some of the assets included property and licenses outside the subsalt area.Asset sales have become imperative after Moody's Investors Service stripped the company of its investment-grade rating and warned further cuts were possible. Worries over a looming cash crunch and the scandal were behind the downgrade, Moody's said.

542,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A U.S. judge has dismissed antitrust litigation accusing a variety of Wall Street banks and commodity merchants of conspiring to drive up aluminum prices by reducing supply.In decisions on Tuesday night and Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan rejected claims brought by aluminum purchasers against several defendants including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, the mining company Glencore Plc, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, which owns the London Metal Exchange.Forrest said she will issue a decision later involving other defendants, including Detroit-based warehouse operator Metro International, which Goldman once owned.The decisions are a setback for aluminum purchasers who raised price-fixing claims, in the highest-profile litigation affecting the base metals market in two decades.These plaintiffs had accused Wall Street banks and commodity merchants of having colluded since May 2009 to hoard aluminum in warehouses. They said this led to higher storage costs, delays of up to 16 months to fill orders, and increases in prices of industrial products from soft drink cans to airplanes. U.S. and European regulators have also examined alleged metals price fixing.Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment, including on whether they will appeal.     Forrest said the plaintiffs did not show that the Goldman and JPMorgan parent companies had any role in the alleged anticompetitive conduct.

549,"   By Jesús Aguado | MADRID  MADRID A Spanish prosecutor has recommended extradition to the United States of Javier Martin-Artajo, an ex-JPMorgan Chase & Co executive indicted over the ""London Whale"" scandal which led to over $6.2 billion in trading losses at the bank in 2012. Spaniard Martin-Artajo, who was the London supervisor of Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale for his big derivatives bets, is resisting extradition and told the High Court in Madrid on Thursday he was innocent.But the prosecutor told the court she thought there were grounds for the extradition to be granted and that Martin-Artajo had allegedly helped cover up $767 million in trading losses. The court has to give its opinion on the request but Spain's government has the last say. The ex-banker is accused of helping to hide trading losses and would face charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud. ""I consider myself innocent, because I could not have done this ... nor did I do it,"" Martin-Artajo, wearing a white open-necked shirt and dark suit, told a public hearing at the court. ""I have no reason to do any of the things I am accused of."" He argued that the charges he faced, which could carry prison sentences of up to 95 years, were disproportionate and that the trading losses had in any case occurred in London. His defense team had long been expected to argue that the United States had no jurisdiction over the case. Martin-Artajo was arrested in Madrid last year and granted a conditional release. He is the most senior figure detained over the case, while Iksil, who cooperated with U.S. authorities, has not been charged.The London Whale scandal was an embarrassment for JPMorgan though its boss Jamie Dimon famously initially dismissed it as a ""tempest in a teapot"".

551,"  * Javier Martin-Artajo attends court hearing in Madrid* The ex-JPMorgan banker was supervisor of ""London Whale""* Faces extradition request from United States* Court ruling pending, prosecutor supports extraditionBy Jesús AguadoMADRID, March 5 A Spanish prosecutor has recommended extradition to the United States of Javier Martin-Artajo, an ex-JPMorgan Chase & Co executive indicted over the ""London Whale"" scandal which led to over $6.2 billion in trading losses at the bank in 2012. Spaniard Martin-Artajo, who was the London supervisor of Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale for his big derivatives bets, is resisting extradition and told the High Court in Madrid on Thursday he was innocent.But the prosecutor told the court she thought there were grounds for the extradition to be granted and that Martin-Artajo had allegedly helped cover up $767 million in trading losses. The court has to give its opinion on the request but Spain's government has the last say. The ex-banker is accused of helping to hide trading losses and would face charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud.""I consider myself innocent, because I could not have done this ... nor did I do it,"" Martin-Artajo, wearing a white open-necked shirt and dark suit, told a public hearing at the court. ""I have no reason to do any of the things I am accused of.""He argued that the charges he faced, which could carry prison sentences of up to 95 years, were disproportionate and that the trading losses had in any case occurred in London.

552,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal | RIO DE JANEIRO  RIO DE JANEIRO Petróleo Brasileiro SA, struggling with fallout from a corruption scandal and a decline in oil prices, could release audited financial information this month despite facing ""a perfect storm,"" analysts at JPMorgan Securities said on Tuesday.In a client note, JPMorgan analysts led by Marcos Severine said the state-run company known as Petrobras could report third- and fourth-quarter earnings this month and book a one-off average asset impairment of 29.4 billion reais ($9.37 billion) due to a graft scheme that may have inflated the value of some assets.Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras, which is Latin America's most indebted listed oil company, delayed the release of its results in the wake of accusations that it systematically overpaid for assets and work by contractors. The excess funds may have been funneled to political parties including President Dilma Rousseff's ruling Workers' Party, prosecutors said. According to the JP Morgan note, Petrobras' ""perfect storm"" began last year with the launch of the corruption probe known as ""Operation Car Wash"" and intensified with the plunge in oil prices, Moody's Investors Service's decision to cut the company's debt rating to below investment grade, and a tumbling Brazilian currency. Petrobras has the ability to preserve cash and reduce debt, although questions remain as to whether the federal government - which controls almost half of the company's capital - will adopt the necessary measures to curb capital spending, JP Morgan said. ""The journey back to health will take time and is likely to require a good bit of 'blood, sweat and tears' to put the company back on track,"" the note said. ""At this point, we do not know how the parent may alter Petrobras' course.""The report underscores the short-term headwinds facing Petrobras, once the crown jewel of Brazil's economy but in recent years a symbol of the country's financial problems, partly because of the Rousseff administration's meddling in the company's affairs. At this moment, Severine and his team believe Petrobras ""is a binary call, with more short-term downside than upside risks, given the lack of visibility of the relevant themes."" Although, at current prices, shares of the company might seem attractive, many potential drivers depend on government decisions, the note said.Severine took over coverage of Petrobras with a ""neutral"" recommendation. He set price targets of 11 reais for the preferred shares of Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and $7 for Petrobras' American common depositary receipts (PBR.N).

553,"  NEW YORK Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S.-based bank, defended the size and business model of his company, which has been criticized as being too big and complicated.Dimon, in a letter to shareholders with the company's new annual report on Wednesday, said the company is ""not a conglomerate"" and is ""not necessarily"" more risky because of its size. The bank is facing tougher capital requirements from regulators than its rivals and has seen analysts ask whether its returns to shareholders would be better if it were broken up.The threat of additional regulatory and legal costs being imposed on the company are holding down the value of JPMorgan stock and have led to it trade at lower price-earnings ratio than some of its competitors, Dimon lamented in the letter.Dimon has stepped up his public statements defending the company's business model since December when the Federal Reserve unveiled pending requirements that the biggest banks, and JPMorgan in particular, hold more capital to protect against losses. A report from a Goldman Sachs analyst in early January then spelled out how the bank might be worth more if broken up. In his letter on Wednesday, Dimon argued that JPMorgan has the same three basic businesses as regional U.S. banks -consumer banking, commercial banking, and asset management-plus one more, its global corporate and investment bank. The investment bank allows the bank to go further and serve big U.S. corporations doing business abroad, he said. ""Our mix of businesses works for clients-and for shareholders,"" Dimon wrote.""Large does not necessarily mean complex,"" he said. The company, Dimon said, has added about 8,000 people to improve legal compliance by the bank and its employees.JPMorgan now has more than 300 employees working on risk models. The team completed over 500 model reviews in 2014 and implemented a system to check the ongoing performance of more than 1,000 complex models, Dimon said. The letter, which covers 37 pages with text and graphics, also includes a commentary on stress tests of banks by the Federal Reserve. Dimon said he supports the testing, but he argued that JPMorgan would weather the downturns envisioned by the Fed ""far better"" that the regulator estimated. JPMorgan would be more aggressive cutting expenses than the Fed assumed and it would reduce its trading risks as a crisis developed, he said.

555,"   By Sonya Dowsett | MADRID  MADRID Spain on Thursday rejected a U.S. extradition request for Javier Martin-Artajo, an ex-JP Morgan Chase & Co executive indicted over the ""London Whale"" scandal which led to over $6 billion in trading losses in 2012.The case is the latest to show the complexity of transatlantic financial inquiries after a British trader accused of contributing to the 2010 Wall Street ""flash crash"" began a fight against extradition to the United States on Wednesday.The Spanish High Court said it would not send Martin-Artajo to the United States for judgment because the alleged crimes had not taken place in that country. However, the United States could pursue action against Martin-Artajo in Spain, it said. Extraditions from Spain to the United States are rare and Madrid has tended to shun requests to send its citizens to be tried there. Martin-Artajo was the supervisor of Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale for his big derivative bets. The Spaniard is accused of trying to minimize potential trading losses held on his group's books at the bank's London operations. The mismarking allegedly took place as the traders tried to hide mounting losses in an illiquid derivatives market, where they had made outsized bets.  Martin-Artajo, arrested in Madrid in 2013 and granted a conditional release, told the Spanish High Court in March that he was innocent. He opposes being extradited because the events happened in Britain, not the United States, and because he is a Spaniard.He faces charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud which could carry decades-long prison sentences in the United States. He is the most senior figure detained over the case, while Iksil, who cooperated with U.S. authorities, avoided criminal charges. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon initially dismissed the London Whale scandal as a 'tempest in a teapot'. The bank was fined more than $1 billion by U.S. and British regulators for the loss and the scandal stoked concerns in the U.S. Congress over Fed regulation.

562,"  (Adds detail from Deutsche Bank overhaul)By Steve SlaterLONDON, April 27 Deutsche Bank's plan to jettison much of its German retail bank and withdraw from one in ten countries sees it join a growing list of banks choosing to shrink and simplify to survive.The benefits of size and reach, for years considered the holy grail of global banking, are now viewed as being outweighed  by the cost and complexity of running businesses across dozens of countries.Many bank bosses have given up on trying to offer everything to everyone. But as unwinding years of expansion proves difficult, pressure for action has intensified, from politicians who show little patience with institutions they consider too big and complex and investors wanting more return on equity (RoE).""The underlying economics for banks ... means being all things to all people is too big a burden to sustain,"" said Bill Michael, head of financial services in Europe at consultancy KPMG. He cited low RoEs, high operational risk and hefty potential costs from regulation.After missing financial targets and racking up a string of regulatory fines and problems, Deutsche Bank said on Monday that it would sell retail arm Postbank, take a knife to its investment bank and exit seven of the 70 countries in which it operates.On Friday HSBC's bosses responded to investor criticism over misconduct scandals and weak profitability by emphasising how far they have shrunk and streamlined the bank in the past four years. HSBC has already sold or shut 77 businesses and could yet dispose of big operations in Brazil or Turkey.Credit Suisse's incoming CEO Tidjane Thiam is expected to cut trading operations drastically and pull back from other areas, while Barclays chairman John McFarlane signalled on his first day on Thursday that he will also wield the knife.The message is clear: bold action is on the cards to create leaner and simpler models, even after big cuts in recent years at Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley , UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland. ""NOT A SCRAP OF EVIDENCE BIGGER IS BETTER"" Pressure for banks to downsize has intensidfied since the global financial crisis, which was preceded by a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions of the kind that briefly made RBS one of the world's biggest banks.The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said in 2009 that ""there is not a scrap of evidence of economies of scale or scope in banking -- of bigger or broader being better"".Politicians worry that large and complex banks can miss problems, struggle to instill a common culture and are too hard to manage. Efforts by some national regulators to limit capital outflows have also encouraged lenders to quit countries in which they lack scale.Investors, too, are questioning the benefits of size as they lose patience with promises that returns will recover, with valuations reflecting their preference for simpler companies.Wells Fargo, which focuses mainly on U.S. retail and commercial banking, is now the world's biggest bank by market value. Its shares trade at 1.6 times book value, compared with an average for U.S. banks of close to book value.Lloyds' focus on UK retail and commercial lending has helped its shares trade at a big premium to rivals, while Deutsche Bank trades at only 0.6 times book value. ""SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT"" The main challenge for bosses is how far to go.Most banks want to continue offering a range of services -- from personal savings accounts to takeover advice for companies and wealth management for rich clients -- but to fewer customers.Some bankers argue that simplification reverses two decades of globalisation that have benefited trade and finance, and could leave only three truly global banks: HSBC, JPMorgan and Citigroup.JPMorgan has rejected calls for its break-up, saying scale has always ""defined the winner"" in banking. It says not having to duplicate audit functions or cybersecurity for the thousands of clients that use more than one part of the bank saves it $18 billion a year.But demands that 30 'systemically important' banks hold more capital, and the more intense regulatory scrutiny they face, also throw into question the benefits of scale.The list of banks and their capital requirements are judged annually on five criteria, including size, international reach and complexity.Lloyds is not on the list and Wells Fargo's capital surcharge is 1 percent of risk-weighted assets, well below the 2.5 percent HSBC and JPMorgan must hoard in case of losses -- in both cases an extra $30 billion or more of capital.One carrot from regulators is that surcharges can be reduced if banks simplify, as happened with UBS and Credit Agricole  last year.

564,"   By Steve Slater | LONDON  LONDON Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered (STAN.L) said the location of its headquarters is under constant review and a big increase in a tax on banks in Britain meant it was watching the situation closely.""At the moment it's something we're watching, we're looking at, we're thinking about, but at this point in time there's no change in our position,"" Andy Halford, Standard Chartered's finance director, said.""Clearly the increase in the (bank levy) number this time is pretty significant,"" Halford told reporters on Tuesday.Halford was speaking after the bank reported a 22 percent drop in profits in the first quarter as losses from bad loans jumped 80 percent from a year ago and trading conditions remained challenging.Some shareholders have told Reuters they want Standard Chartered to follow its rival HSBC (HSBA.L) and formally review its home base after a jump in the bank tax this year.""The potential for HQ relocation (to Singapore) is gaining greater traction too given the material damage from a permanent and rising UK bank levy,"" Chirantan Barua, analyst at Bernstein, said.The UK tax has increased eight times since being introduced in 2010 to ensure banks make a ""fair contribution"" after the financial crisis.HSBC's review of its domicile sparked a political row ahead of a national election in Britain on May 7, putting the spotlight on party policies on whether Britain will stay in Europe and how much banks should be taxed. Halford estimated Standard Chartered would pay about $540 million under the bank levy this year, which would represent about 11 percent of expected pretax profits and be up from $366 million in 2014.""The general reaction of shareholders is we're happy that you as a management team are giving this thought and we expect that with full detailed knowledge you will come to the best conclusions for the business,"" Halford said.He said there were a range of factors to consider as well as the bank levy, including the skill and availability of labor, other tax issues, regulatory issues and London's strength as a financial center and its ""neutrality"" as a headquarters for a bank that operates across dozens of Asian countries.Singapore, the hub for most of Standard Chartered's businesses, would be the most likely destination if it chose to move, industry sources have said. TURNAROUND The bank is trying to turn around its performance after two bad years and will get former JP Morgan (JPM.N) investment bank boss Bill Winters as its new chief executive in June. Standard Chartered's loan impairments rose to $476 million from $265 million a year ago, but slightly down from the fourth quarter. Pretax profit fell to $1.5 billion in the quarter, down from $1.9 billion. Standard Chartered shares were down 3 percent by 1100 GMT (7.00 a.m. EDT), underperforming a 1 percent drop in Europe's banking index .SX7P as revenues fell short of expectations, analysts said. The shares had risen 20 percent since Winters was appointed two months ago.Low commodity prices were a drag on trade finance revenues, which dropped 9 percent in the first quarter and helped pull total revenues down 4 percent from a year ago.In the face of lower growth, the bank is trying to cut costs and shrink its loan book to improve its profitability and deal with the market's concerns about its capital. It said it was on schedule to get its core capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, above 11 percent this year and would deliver cost savings of more than $400 million in 2015. Its core capital was 10.7 percent at the end of 2014, but it did not say what it was at the end of March.Halford said the bank had cut its exposure to commodities loans by a further $5 billion this year to $50 billion. The bank said it was well advanced with a plan to reduce its risk weighted assets by between $25 billion and $30 billion in the next two years.

565,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. prosecutors said Friday their efforts to extradite from Spain a former JPMorgan Chase & Co  executive charged in connection with the bank's $6.2 billion ""London Whale"" scandal had hit a dead end.In a filing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors said Spanish authorities have decided not to appeal an April 23 ruling by a court rejecting the extradition to the United States of Javier Martin-Artajo, a Spanish citizen.The filing came in a civil lawsuit brought in 2013 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Martin-Artajo and another trader, Julien Grout, who were charged criminally at the same time.The Spanish court's decision effectively has left both men out of U.S. prosecutors' reach. Grout lives in France, which does extradite its own citizens.With extradition off the table, prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said they no longer are seeking to delay depositions in the SEC's case. But prosecutors said they would support the SEC's bid for a court order requiring the defendants sit for depositions in New York.The SEC in its own letter on Thursday said the men, who would likely invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, are not willing to be deposed, and Martin-Artajo's lawyer has said any deposition must be in Europe.But the SEC said the men ""should not be able to dictate whether and where their depositions take place simply because they are fugitives,"" even if they fear being arrested by coming to New York. Edward Little, Grout's lawyer, objected in a letter Friday, saying the SEC's request would force his client to allow for a default judgment to be issued in the case.U.S. District Judge George Daniels has scheduled a hearing for May 8. Martin-Artajo's lawyer declined comment. Martin-Artajo and Grout were indicted in 2013 on five counts, including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.Prosecutors said the duo hid losses within JPMorgan's chief investment office in London by marking positions in a credit derivatives portfolio at inflated prices.Those losses were part of an overall $6.2 billion trading loss suffered by the bank centered on Bruno Iksil, the former trader known as the London Whale. Martin-Artajo supervised Iksil, while Grout worked for Iksil.Both men deny wrongdoing.

566,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. prosecutors said Friday their efforts to extradite from Spain a former JPMorgan Chase & Co executive charged in connection with the bank's $6.2 billion ""London Whale"" scandal had hit a dead end.In a filing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors said Spanish authorities have decided not to appeal an April 23 ruling by a court rejecting the extradition to the United States of Javier Martin-Artajo, a Spanish citizen.The filing came in a civil lawsuit brought in 2013 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Martin-Artajo and another trader, Julien Grout, who were charged criminally at the same time.The Spanish court's decision effectively has left both men out of U.S. prosecutors' reach. Grout lives in France, which does extradite its own citizens.With extradition off the table, prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said they no longer are seeking to delay depositions in the SEC's case.But prosecutors said they would support the SEC's bid for a court order requiring the defendants sit for depositions in New York. The SEC in its own letter on Thursday said the men, who would likely invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, are not willing to be deposed, and Martin-Artajo's lawyer has said any deposition must be in Europe. But the SEC said the men ""should not be able to dictate whether and where their depositions take place simply because they are fugitives,"" even if they fear being arrested by coming to New York.Edward Little, Grout's lawyer, objected in a letter Friday, saying the SEC's request would force his client to allow for a default judgment to be issued in the case. U.S. District Judge George Daniels has scheduled a hearing for May 8. Martin-Artajo's lawyer declined comment.Martin-Artajo and Grout were indicted in 2013 on five counts, including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors said the duo hid losses within JPMorgan's chief investment office in London by marking positions in a credit derivatives portfolio at inflated prices. Those losses were part of an overall $6.2 billion trading loss suffered by the bank centered on Bruno Iksil, the former trader known as the London Whale. Martin-Artajo supervised Iksil, while Grout worked for Iksil.Both men deny wrongdoing.

580,"  * Tech, new hires, client push to deliver gains -Citi exec* More cross-selling, hiring opportunities -JPMorgan exec* Echoes optimism on trading desks after bumper Q1* Banks taking more targeted approach for top clients* Deutsche Bank also planning to invest in equities   (Adds JPMorgan banker comments)By Lionel LaurentLONDON, May 7 U.S. banks Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase expect to gain market share in equities this year, executives told Reuters, pointing to technology investment and new hires as financial-market trading picks up.The comments echo a more optimistic stance from trading desks at global investment banks after a bumper quarter boosted by the European Central Bank's announcement of a bond-buying scheme to spur growth.They also contrast with last year's more lacklustre picture of stock trading, particularly in Europe, with tepid volume growth and increased regulatory scrutiny squeezing commissions and stoking fears of more cutbacks. ""We are not pulling back in equities, quite the opposite,"" said Tim Gately, Citi's head of equities for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), in an interview. ""We continuously invest in technology, have made a number of senior hires and expect to grow our market and wallet share in 2015.""Citi, which said in the fourth quarter it would take actions to turn around its underperforming EMEA equities franchise, is making a push for a bigger share of spending from top clients and hedge funds, Gately added.The bank has named Murray Roos as London-based global head of sales for equities and prime finance and Emmanuel Girod as global head of exotics trading.Larger rival JPMorgan also expects to gain market share, according to Michael Wilson, head of EMEA equity sales at the bank, thanks to a dedicated hedge-fund sales team, better client targeting and new global equity products. MORE TARGETED At a time of tighter balance-sheet rules and cost cuts, banks in general are taking a more targeted approach to client lists when allocating resources.""We are targeting market-share gains primarily via cross-selling, and so prime brokerage (specialist services for hedge funds) is a big opportunity ... We are also ready to be there for clients should rivals pull back,"" said JPMorgan's Wilson. ""We are investing and hiring within specialist sales, execution and technology.""Growing in cash equities is a multi-year objective for JPMorgan but the bank is already reaping some success from client segments including hedge funds.Some have warned, however, that the optimism in equities may be more a case of market bullishness than a new dawn for highly automated, high-return but volume-dependent stock trading.Some banking sources said they still expected some smaller players to cut back or exit equities given competitive pressures.Yet first-quarter equities revenue grew at double-digit percentage rates for a number of U.S. banks including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, though Citi bucked the trend with a 1 percent decline.The pick-up was also broadly felt in Europe, with Germany's Deutsche Bank unveiling a plan to invest in its small but growing equities trading division.Trading conditions are set to stay positive, said Gately, thanks to near-zero yields in much of the bond market, which made equities more attractive. ""The first quarter was not just a blip (for the industry),"" he said.

Chinese stocks in contrast have rallied to seven-year highs on liquidity and a series of stimulus steps to prop up flagging growth. More stimulus measures such as interest rate cuts are expected to keep the rally going despite a pullback this week.Shanghai's Composite Index is up nearly 30 percent since the start of the year - the best performing Asian equity index so far this year - though it is set for its biggest weekly loss in six years this week.Credit Suisse has also changed its Korean equity view to outperform from neutral and prefers H-shares, Hong Kong-listed Chinese shares, over A-shares, their mainland-listed counterparts ""given the wide valuation gap,"" Strobaek said. Stocks in South Korea and Taiwan have been supported by a  positive outlook on corporate earnings and the economies' large current account surpluses. These factors were seen shielding them from the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates.For these reasons, JP Morgan has also moved some money out of India into South Korea and Taiwan, said Adrian Mowat, chief emerging market and Asian equity strategist at JP Morgan.Three Australian fund managers said they had reduced their Indian exposure in favour of China, citing the need for more clarity over the proposed minimum alternate tax (MAT).""We are confused with the whole MAT issue, so have reduced shorts on China,"" one of the fund managers, managing $25 billion worth of assets, told Reuters. Foreign investors have to pay a 15 percent tax on short-term stock gains, 5 percent on bond profits and nothing on long-term gains and the government is attempting to claw back unpaid taxes via the tax, raising concerns about retrospective taxation.Since late 2014 many firms have received notices demanding MAT payments on past income, potentially bringing overall tax on these to as much as 20 percent. [ID: nL4N0XJ4EV]Last month, Junior Finance Minister Jayant Sinha said notices had been issued in 68 cases, demanding total payment of 6.02 billion rupees ($94.6 million). But Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has estimated claims could reach as much as 400 billion rupees. [ID: nD8N0W105I]""The debate over retro taxes on capital gains is noise for investors, who may take the opportunity to reduce their Indian equity exposure and look for value elsewhere, like China A market, that has fantastic momentum and trading at attractive multiples relative to Indian equities despite the recent rally,"" said Arild Johansen, fund manager at FMG EM funds told Reuters.Valuations are also a factor. Indian shares are trading at 3.24 times book value even after recent declines while Taiwan, at 1.76, is the third-cheapest.Relative to earnings, Hong Kong is the least expensive at 11.94 times, followed by South Korea at 12.21.

585,"   By Michael Turner  LONDON, May 18 (IFR) - The Republic of Albania has picked Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan to arrange a euro-denominated bond, according to two sources away from the banks.Albania's finance ministry said in March that it was eyeing a Eurobond of 300m or more. The new deal has been earmarked to refinance existing debt. Albania has a 300m maturing in November. The sovereign went on a non-deal roadshow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan in March. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan declined to comment. Albania is rated B1 by Moody's and B by Standard & Poor's.

587,"   By David Henry and Ross Kerber | DETROIT  DETROIT Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) narrowly approved on Tuesday the 2014 compensation packages for CEO Jamie Dimon and other top executives in a rebuke from investors over the bank's pay practices. Only 61 percent of votes cast at a shareholders meeting were in favor of the compensation, which came under criticism by influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. It  said the board does not sufficiently link pay to performance and shareholder interests.Dimon, 59, was paid $20 million for 2014, the same as for 2013. But 40 percent of his latest incentive bonus was in cash. The prior year all of his bonus came in stock. Among other things, ISS took issue with what it said was the lack of a compelling reason for shifting more of the bonus to cash.Lead independent director Lee Raymond said at the meeting that the board's method of setting pay properly aligns incentives for executives. But he added the board is mindful of other opinions and is looking for ways to improve its practices. Companies have been required since the financial crisis to  hold so-called ""say-on-pay"" advisory votes by their shareholders. Last year, pay practices at 92 percent of some 2,545 companies received endorsements from at least 70 percent of votes cast, according to research by compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy.Francis Byrd, an independent corporate governance analyst, said, ""As a practical matter, JPMorgan is going to need to do more work with their top investors on executive compensation."" The company changed its justification for Dimon's pay from year to year, citing shareholder returns for 2013 and company financial performance for 2014, ISS said.Directors said in the proxy report for the meeting, that it is better that they be flexible in setting pay rather than follow a formula that could be too restrictive for the diverse operations of the company.     A proposal from a shareholder calling for the board to separate the post of chairman and chief executive, but possibly not until Dimon is no longer CEO, received 36 percent of votes cast. The result was higher than the 32 percent who voted for a similar measure in 2013. In that vote, some investors feared the proposal would prompt Dimon to leave the bank if it passed.

588,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) and senior debt rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and the  Long-Term IDR of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to 'AA-' from 'A+' and upgraded the  Short-Term IDRs and debt ratings of both to 'F1+' from 'F1'. At the same time,  the agency has affirmed JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) Long-Term and Short-Term  IDRs at 'A+' and 'F1', respectively. The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are  Stable. JPM's Long-Term IDR is driven by its Viability Rating (VR), which has been  affirmed at 'a+'. The upgrade of JPM's operating subsidiaries' IDRs to one notch  above their VRs reflects the expected implementation of total loss absorbing  capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks  (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial debt buffer in the holding company. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this rating action  commentary. The rating actions are in conjunction with Fitch's review of sovereign support  for banks globally, which the agency announced in March 2014. In line with its  expectations announced in March last year and communicated regularly since then,  Fitch believes legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives have substantially  reduced the likelihood of sovereign support for U.S., Swiss and European Union  commercial banks. At the same time, Fitch has taken into account progress with  the U.S. single point of entry (SPE) resolution regime and TLAC implementation  for U.S. G-SIBs. Fitch believes that, in line with our Support Rating (SR) definition of '5',  extraordinary external support while possible can no longer be relied upon for  JPM or its subsidiaries. We have, therefore, downgraded their Support Ratings  (SR) to '5' from '1' and revised their Support Rating Floors (SRF) to 'No Floor'  from 'A'. The ratings actions are also part of a periodic portfolio review of the Global  Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs), which comprise 12 large and globally active  banking groups. A strong rebound in earnings from securities businesses in 1Q15  is a reminder of the upside potential banks with leading market shares can  enjoy. However, regulatory headwinds remain strong, with ever higher capital  requirements, costs of continuous infrastructure upgrades and a focus on conduct  risks.  As capital and leverage requirements evolve, GTUBs are reviewing the balance of  their securities operations with other businesses and adapting their business  models to provide the most capital efficient platforms for the future. We expect  the GTUBs' other core businesses, including retail and corporate banking, wealth  and asset management, to perform well as economic growth, which we expect to be  strongest in the U.S. and UK, will underpin revenue. However, pressure on  revenue generation in a low-interest environment is likely to persist,  particularly in Europe, but low loan impairment charges in domestic markets  should help operating profitability. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying earnings capacity of  the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing international  franchise, and significant progress made toward achieving compliance with  heightened capital and liquidity requirements. The affirmation also reflects the  firm's strong funding flexibility, given its deposit raising capabilities and  uninterrupted access to the global capital markets through an economic cycle.  JPM's Basel III tier 1 common equity ratio reached 10.6% at March 31, 2015,  which is only 40 basis points from management's year-end target of 11.0%. The  ratio has grown significantly in recent years and the gap with peers has  narrowed as JPM must build to higher regulatory minimums, given its expected  G-SIB surcharge. Capital improvements have been supported largely by growth in  retained earnings. Management is targeting a ratio of 12% longer-term, which  Fitch believes is prudent, although the target could evolve as further clarity  emerges surrounding regulatory requirements. Still, Fitch believes JPM is well  positioned to maintain compliance with Basel III capital requirements, even with  its higher surcharge, given the superior earnings capacity of the bank. JPM  gained compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) in 1Q15 as the  bank ratio reached 6.0%.  In March 2015, the firm received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve to its  revised capital plan as a result of the annual CCAR process. The board intends  to increase the common dividend by $0.04 per share, to $0.44, beginning in 2Q15,  which equates to a 30.3% payout based on 1Q15 diluted earnings per share. JPM  also has the authority to repurchase $6.4 billion of equity from 2Q15 to 2Q16.  JPM repurchased about $1.9 billion of common equity during the first quarter,  which compared to about $2 billion of remaining authorization based on the prior  year's CCAR process.  The bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $614 billion of high quality  liquid assets at March 31, 2015, up from $538 billion a year earlier. JPM  reports that it is in compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the  net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which Fitch views favorably. In 1Q15, the bank  made progress toward its goal of reducing non-operating deposits by $100 billion  by year-end 2015. Ending deposits grew $5 billion quarter-over-quarter, but did  include a mix shift, with $28 billion of growth in retail deposits and a $24  billion decline in deposits in the investment bank. Fitch views this shift  favorably, given the relative stability of retail deposits and favorable  treatment in liquidity ratios.      Earnings performance remains highly resilient, particularly on a relative basis,  given the firm's global reach and strong market position in a variety of  business lines. Credit costs are expected to be a headwind over the near-term,  given portfolio growth and normalization in certain asset categories, as are  interest rates, legal costs, and continued investment in the control agenda, but  market share gains and improved operating efficiencies are expected to serve as  an offset. JPM is targeting a 55% efficiency ratio in three years, with $2  billion of targeted expenses saves in consumer and community banking and another  $2.8 billion of cost reductions in the investment bank. Fitch believes these  results are achievable and noted progress on these goals was evident in 1Q15.  The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating consistency,  superior funding flexibility, strong liquidity, and gradual growth in capital  ratios. JPM has been relatively successful adapting its business model to the  evolving regulatory landscape and is expected to continue to make adjustments in  order to optimize its capital structure.  The VRs remain equalized between JPM and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of JPM and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between JPM and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes a  group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S. bank  subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  JPM's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of total loss absorbing capital  (TLAC) requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding  company debt reduces the default risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior  liabilities relative to holding company senior debt. In our view these buffers  would provide substantial protection to senior unsecured obligations in the  domestic operating entities in the event of group resolution, as they could be  used to absorb losses and recapitalize operating companies. Therefore,  substantial holding company debt reduces the likelihood of default on operating  company senior obligations. As at end-2014, JPM had hybrid and senior debt as a  percent of risk-weighted assets (RWA) of approximately 11%; more than its Pillar  1 capital requirement. The 'F1+' Short-Term IDRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries reflects substantial  liquidity at the banks and typically higher core deposit funding, liquidity  resources at JPM that could be extended to the bank, and access to contingent  liquidity sources such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances. JPM's and its  non-bank operating companies' Short-Term IDRs at 'F1' reflect Fitch's view that  there is less surplus liquidity at these entities than at the bank, particularly  given their greater reliance on the holding company for liquidity. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to deliver  meaningful earnings growth, particularly in light of the current regulatory  environment. Higher capital charges and what remains difficult market conditions  present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may be encouraged to seek more  aggressive ways to generate profits that take advantage of regulatory changes.  However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity risk  management, and product diversity mitigate some of these concerns. Negative rating actions could result from reputational damage or legal sanctions  that impact the firm's market position and/or material asset quality weakening  which pressures JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital, deterioration  in liquidity levels, material and unexpected litigation losses, and/or failure  to sufficiently address weaknesses noted in regulatory consent orders and  internal reviews following material losses in the chief investment officer.  Further, significant risk management or operational failures that result in  material losses to the firm could also result in a negative rating action.  Fitch's rating action assumes that any potential criminal charges as they relate  to foreign exchange manipulations will not materially impact ongoing business  operations. Absent that, ratings may be adversely impacted, though Fitch has  limited visibility into this outcome. Fitch considers JPM's ratings to be particularly sensitive to the degree and  scope of litigation risk going forward. Fitch recognizes that the large  litigation charges taken in recent years reflect JPM's desire to address  outstanding legal issues. To the extent JPM enters into any new and material  litigation settlements, Fitch will consider whether these effectively diminish  ongoing legal risks. Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the foreseeable  future given that its current rating level is among the highest of its peer  group and of the global bank universe.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that JPM  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and its subsidiaries  are all notched down from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of  each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk  profiles, which vary considerably. Subordinated debt issued by the operating  companies is rated at the same level as subordinated debt issued by JPM  reflecting the potential for subordinated creditors in the operating companies  to be exposed to loss ahead of senior creditors in JPM. This is also supported  by the FSB's proposal to have internal TLAC rank senior to regulatory capital at  the operating company. Their ratings are primarily sensitive to any change in  the common VR. They have, therefore, been affirmed due to the affirmation of the  common VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - DEPOSIT RATINGS The upgrade of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.'s and Chase Bank USA, N.A.'s deposit  ratings is based on the upgrade of their IDRs. Deposit ratings are one notch  higher than senior debt reflecting the deposits' superior recovery prospects in  case of default given depositor preference in the U.S.  SUBSIDIARY KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES Bear Stearns Companies LLC and JP Morgan & Co., Inc. are wholly owned  subsidiaries of JPM, therefore their IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with the  parent.

589,"  (Adds comment from analyst in 7th paragraph)By David Henry and Ross KerberDETROIT May 19 Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co narrowly approved on Tuesday the 2014 compensation packages for CEO Jamie Dimon and other top executives in a rebuke from investors over the bank's pay practices.Only 61 percent of votes cast at a shareholders meeting were in favor of the compensation, which came under criticism by influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. It  said the board does not sufficiently link pay to performance and shareholder interests.Dimon, 59, was paid $20 million for 2014, the same as for 2013. But 40 percent of his latest incentive bonus was in cash. The prior year all of his bonus came in stock. Among other things, ISS took issue with what it said was the lack of a compelling reason for shifting more of the bonus to cash. Lead independent director Lee Raymond said at the meeting that the board's method of setting pay properly aligns incentives for executives. But he added the board is mindful of other opinions and is looking for ways to improve its practices.Companies have been required since the financial crisis to  hold so-called ""say-on-pay"" advisory votes by their shareholders. Last year, pay practices at 92 percent of some 2,545 companies received endorsements from at least 70 percent of votes cast, according to research by compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy.Francis Byrd, an independent corporate governance analyst, said, ""As a practical matter, JPMorgan is going to need to do more work with their top investors on executive compensation."" The company changed its justification for Dimon's pay from year to year, citing shareholder returns for 2013 and company financial performance for 2014, ISS said.Directors said in the proxy report for the meeting, that it is better that they be flexible in setting pay rather than follow a formula that could be too restrictive for the diverse operations of the company.A proposal from a shareholder calling for the board to separate the post of chairman and chief executive, but possibly not until Dimon is no longer CEO, received 36 percent of votes cast.The result was higher than the 32 percent who voted for a similar measure in 2013. In that vote, some investors feared the proposal would prompt Dimon to leave the bank if it passed.   (Reporting by David Henry in Detroit.

595,"   By Kirstin Ridley | LONDON  LONDON May 19 A former JPMorgan  executive who supervised a division that ran up $6.2 billion of losses in the ""London Whale"" scandal of 2012 has won a second legal challenge against Britain's regulator in a closely-watched court battle.The Court of Appeal said on Tuesday that although Achilles Macris had not been named, he had been identified and should have been allowed to respond when the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined JPMorgan almost 140 million pounds ($217 million) in 2013 over huge bets by former trader Bruno Iksil.The decision could have implications for how much detail can be published in enforcement notices. The case has been closely watched by scores of traders who also allege they have been identified in FCA notices and not given a right of reply.The FCA, which could yet appeal to the Supreme Court, said only: ""We are considering the judgment carefully."" Macris, a Greek citizen, ran the London division of JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office (CIO) when Iksil, nicknamed ""the London Whale"" for his outsized derivatives trades, stacked up eyewatering losses. His job title was International Chief Investment Officer.In its enforcement notice, the FCA said that ""by virtue of the conduct of the CIO London management"", JPMorgan had deliberately misled the regulator.Arguing that the term ""CIO London management"" had been intentionally used to refer specifically to him, rather than a body, Macris argued that a series of FCA notices identified him and were clearly prejudicial to him and yet he had had no opportunity to contest the allegations. A secondary process should now start automatically to decide whether the criticisms against him are valid, his lawyer at Clifford Chance said.JPMorgan, whose Chief Executive Jamie Dimon initially dismissed the London Whale incident as a 'tempest in a teapot', was fined more than $1 billion by U.S. and British regulators. Iksil's former boss Javier Martin-Artajo and junior trader Julien Grout were indicted by U.S. authorities on five charges each, including securities fraud and conspiracy. Iksil has been cooperating with U.S. authorities and not faced charges.Martin-Artajo, who lives in Spain, and Grout, who lives in France, have not travelled to the U.S. to face charges. U.S. prosecutors said earlier this month their efforts to extradite Martin-Artajo had hit a dead end. France does not extradite its citizens.Macris was Martin-Artajo's supervisor.($1 = 0.6465 pounds)   (Reporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Keith Weir)",2015-05-19,JPM,"Tue May 19, 2015 | 11:09am EDT",Former JPMorgan exec wins London appeal over Whale case,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-jpm-whale-idUSL5N0YA3XT20150519?type=companyNews

597,"  * Citi, Barclays, JPMorgan and RBS plead guilty* UBS fine lower than expected, shares hit 6-1/2 yr high* Barclays fined $2.4 bln, fires 8 employeesBy Karen Freifeld, David Henry and Steve SlaterNEW YORK/LONDON, May 20 Four major banks pleaded guilty on Wednesday to trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates and, with two others, were fined nearly $6 billion in another settlement in a global probe into the $5 trillion-a-day market.Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Barclays Plc, UBS AG  and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc were accused by U.S. and UK officials of brazenly cheating clients to boost their own profits using invitation-only chat rooms and coded language to coordinate their trades.All but UBS pleaded guilty to conspiring to manipulate the price of U.S. dollars and euros exchanged in the FX spot market. UBS pleaded guilty to a different charge. Bank of America Corp  was fined but avoided a guilty plea over the actions of its traders in chatrooms.""The penalty all these banks will now pay is fitting, considering the long-running and egregious nature of their anticompetitive conduct,"" said U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a news conference in Washington.The misconduct occurred until 2013, after regulators  started punishing banks for rigging the London interbank offered rate (Libor), a global benchmark, and banks had pledged to overhaul their corporate culture and bolster compliance.In total, authorities in the United States and Europe have fined seven banks over $10 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates, which are used daily by millions of people from trillion-dollar investment houses to tourists buying foreign currencies on vacation.The investigations are far from over. Prosecutors could bring cases against individuals, using the banks' cooperation pledged as part of their agreements. Probes by federal and state authorities are ongoing over how banks used electronic forex trading to favor their own interests at the expense of clients.The settlements on Wednesday stood out in part because the U.S. Department of Justice forced Citigroup's main banking unit Citicorp, and the parents of JPMorgan, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland to plead guilty to U.S. criminal charges.It was the first time in decades that the parent or main banking unit of a major American financial institution pleaded guilty to criminal charges.Until recently, U.S. authorities rarely sought criminal convictions against the parents of global financial institutions, instead settling with smaller foreign subsidiaries. That made it easier for the government and the banks to control any fallout on the financial system and bank customers.Banks involved in the plea deals have been negotiating regulatory exemptions to avoid serious business disruptions that could be triggered by the pleas. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has granted waivers to JPMorgan and the other banks that pleaded guilty, allowing them to continue their usual securities business.With prosecutors and the banks working out ways for the institutions to keep doing business, analysts worried that convictions would become more routine and costly for banks.""The broader problem is that this now sets the stage for the Justice Department to try to criminally prosecute banks for all sorts of transgressions,"" said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities.Lawyers said the guilty pleas would make it easier for pension funds and investment managers who have regular currency dealings with banks to sue them for losses on those trades.""There is already a lot of work going on behind the scenes assessing how claims could be brought forward and those potential claimants will be looking to today's announcement for evidence to support their analysis,"" said Simon Hart, banking litigation partner at London law firm RPC.CITI BEHAVIOR ""EMBARRASSMENT"" - CEO  Citicorp will pay $925 million, the highest criminal fine, as well as $342 million to the U.S. Federal Reserve.Its traders participated in the conspiracy from as early as December 2007 until at least January 2013, according to the plea agreement.Traders at Citi, JPMorgan and other banks were part of a group known as ""The Cartel"" or ""The Mafia,"" participating in almost daily conversations in an exclusive chat room and coordinating trades and otherwise fixing rates.The bank's behavior was ""an embarrassment,"" Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat said in a memo to employees, which was seen by Reuters.Corbat said an internal investigation should conclude shortly. So far nine people have been fired.University of Virginia law school professor Brandon Garrett said the last case comparable to Citi or JPMorgan, involving a major U.S. financial institution pleading guilty to criminal charges in the United States was Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989.JPMorgan's share of the criminal fine was $550 million, based on its involved from July 2010 until January 2013. It also agreed to pay the Federal Reserve $342 million. JPMorgan Chase said the conduct underlying the antitrust charge was ""principally attributable to a single trader"" who has been fired.In New York, shares in JP Morgan and Citigroup were down 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.""IF YOU AIN'T CHEATING, YOU AIN'T TRYING"" Britain's Barclays was fined a record $2.4 billion. Its staff continued to engage in misleading sales practices despite a pledge by CEO Antony Jenkins to overhaul the bank's high-risk, high-reward culture.Barclays' sales staff would offer clients a different price to the one offered by the bank's traders, known as a ""mark-up"" to boost profits. Generating mark-ups was a high priority for sales managers, with one employee noting, ""If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.""Barclays fired four traders in the last month. New York state's banking regulator Benjamin Lawsky ordered the bank to fire another four who had been suspended or placed on paid leave.Barclays had set aside $3.2 billion to cover any forex-related settlement. Shares in the bank rose more than 3 percent to an 18-month high as investors welcomed the removal of uncertainty over the forex scandal.UBS was the first firm to report the misconduct to U.S. officials. It pleaded guilty and will pay a $203 million criminal penalty for breaching a non-prosecution agreement over manipulation of the Libor benchmark interest rate, in part based on its forex practices.UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, will also pay $342 million to the Federal Reserve over attempted manipulation of forex rates.The Royal Bank of Scotland will pay a criminal fine of $395 million, and a $274 million penalty to the Fed.The U.S. central bank fined six banks for unsafe and unsound practices in the foreign exchange markets, including a $205 million fine for Bank of America.UBS's penalty was lower than expected, and helped its shares rise to their highest in six-and-a-half years.The global investigation into manipulation of foreign exchange rates has put the largely unregulated forex market on a tighter leash and accelerated a push to automate trading. Authorities in South Africa announced this week they were opening their own probe.

599,"  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) officials have not done enough to show how well the company is run, Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday, after one-third of shareholders disapproved last week of his pay and the practice of one person holding his two jobs.""We have to do a better job of describing to the investor class"" how the board of directors oversees executives, Dimon said at an investor conference. Since he came to the bank a decade ago, Dimon said, he has stepped out of board meetings so that directors will discuss their views and his performance independently.""The board talks all of the time about what they want the agenda to be,"" Dimon said, adding that the entire panel approved his compensation.At the company's annual meeting last week in Detroit, JPMorgan's compensation for top executives was endorsed by only 61 percent of votes cast. A call for separation of the posts of CEO and chairman after Dimon has left was backed by 36 percent. Dimon also faulted investors for not thinking for themselves and instead following the recommendations of shareholder advisory services Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. Both firms had argued against Dimon's pay and for an independent chairman of the board.""God knows how any of you can place your vote based on ISS or Glass Lewis,"" Dimon said. ""If you do that you are just irresponsible, I am sorry. And, you probably aren't a very good investor, either. I know some of you here do it because you are lazy."" Dimon also said that it was ""terrible"" last week to have to go through with company's guilty plea to criminal conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates. Dimon, who blamed the crime on a handful of people, said executives had to brief employees and clients on the decision. The company will lose ""some"" business as a result, he said. Meanwhile, trading revenues in the second quarter are running about the same as a year ago, Dimon said. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said earlier in the day he expects trading revenue in the quarter to be ""flattish to down a little bit.""

603,"  (Adds company comments on Ahold talks)BRUSSELS May 28 Delhaize's Greek operations would survive if the country were to leave the common European currency, the finance chief of the Belgian supermarket operator said on Thursday.""Even in such a case, though the pain would hurt for a while in our accounts, we are confident Alpha Beta in Greece would survive, would continue to gain market share and could even profit from the difficult environment for other Greek retailers,"" Chief Financial Officer Pierre Bouchut told reporters.Bouchut added that growth in the group's same store sales in the United States in April was similar to that seen in the first quarter but was driven by the group selling more items rather than by inflation. In the first quarter, same store sales in the United States rose 2.5 percent, with retail inflation at 1.2 percent. The group made no further comments about preliminary talks with Dutch grocer Ahold about a possible tie-up of the two companies, beyond reading out a press release distributed two weeks ago which confirmed talks were taking place.President of the board Mats Jansson said he had temporarily stepped down from an advisory position at investment bank JPMorgan after reports in the Belgian media that this constituted a conflict of interest. ""Given the preliminary talks between Ahold and Delhaize and in order to avoid the perception of a conflict of interest, I have decided to temporarily suspend my advisory role at JPMorgan,"" Jansson told shareholders.(Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek, editing by David Evans)",2015-05-28,JPM,"Thu May 28, 2015 | 11:55am EDT",UPDATE 1-Delhaize CFO says its Greek operations would survive Grexit,http://www.reuters.com//article/delhaize-greece-idUSL5N0YJ4JQ20150528?type=companyNews

605,"  (Corrects headline to replace name with official's title)WASHINGTON May 27 U.S. regulators have subpoenaed JPMorgan Chase & Co for all of its communications related to 35 Chinese officials, including anti-corruption chief Wang Qishan, as part of an ongoing probe into the bank's hiring practices, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The newspaper, which reviewed a copy of the subpoena, said it was issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in late April. Citing people familiar with the matter, it said prosecutors at the U.S. Justice Department had also requested information about Wang.  U.S. authorities are investigating the Asian hiring practices of JPMorgan to determine whether the bank gave jobs to Chinese government officials' children in return for lucrative banking assignments, the newspaper has reported.

608,"  NEW YORK Voicemail is going the way of the typewriter, at least at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). The Wall Street bank is eliminating voicemail for thousands of employees who do not take calls from customers, at a savings of $10 a month per person, Gordon Smith, chief executive of the company's consumer banking operations, said at an investor conference on Tuesday.Smith made the point to show how his executives are questioning every cost in their drive to save $2 billion in annual expenses by 2017.""We realize that hardly anyone uses voicemail anymore,"" Smith said. ""We are all carrying something in our pockets that is going to get texts or email or a phone call,"" he said. ""We started to cut those off.""The service is being cut only for employees who do not deal directly with customers, spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said later. Managers still have discretion to keep it for employees who need it, she said. She declined to say exactly how many voicemail boxes are being taken out, but said the consumer bank is eliminating 65 percent of its boxes. The division expects to save $3.2 million a year from the move.At $120 of savings each year per person, the total implies  that more than 26,000 boxes are being closed. Wexler said some savings occurred when suppliers responded to the cuts by offering lower rates for reduced services.   When the consumer bank started to take out the service earlier this year, managers were surprised that some employees wanted their voicemail removed immediately, because they said it was too much trouble, Wexler said.The move to cut voicemail has now spread to JPMorgan's investment banking divisions, Wexler said. Information technology employees who work across the company started shedding their voice mail last year, she said.

613,"  NEW YORK, June 2 Investors sentiment on U.S. Treasuries deteriorated to its worst level in nine years in the latest week as selling since Monday has pushed longer-dated bond yields higher, a J.P. Morgan survey released on Tuesday showed.Net shorts on longer-dated Treasuries, or the difference between the share of ""short"" investors who hold less longer-dated debt versus portfolio benchmarks and the share of ""long"" investors who hold more longer-dated debt than benchmarks, jumped to 32 percent on Monday. This was the highest level of net shorts since May 5, 2006, J.P. Morgan said.  A week earlier, the survey's nets shorts were 13 percent.

614,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge on Wednesday limited JPMorgan Chase & Co's potential liability to buy back soured mortgages tied to the main unit of Washington Mutual Inc, the savings and loan it bought at the height of the 2008 global financial crisis.U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in Washington, D.C. said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp must shoulder some losses attributable to Washington Mutual's lending before the largest U.S. thrift was seized by the government in 2008, and immediately sold by the FDIC to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion.In a two-page order, Collyer said JPMorgan assumed liability for disputed mortgages ""only to the extent that Washington Mutual Bank reflected such liabilities at a stated book value"" on its books as of Sept. 25, 2008, the day it was seized.The FDIC, which was appointed Washington Mutual's receiver, had argued that JPMorgan assumed the bank's obligations ""irrespective of a book value cap.""Collyer also ruled that JPMorgan did assume all mortgage repurchase liabilities of another unit it bought, Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. The purchase of Washington Mutual helped make New York-based JPMorgan the largest U.S. bank by assets.In a research note, CRT Capital analyst Kevin Starke said the decision could limit JPMorgan's obligations tied to the former Washington Mutual units to about $1.7 billion, including just $259 million at the main banking unit.FDIC spokesman David Barr declined to comment. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the bank is pleased with Collyer's order. The judge did not make public her decision explaining her reasoning. She directed the FDIC and JPMorgan to propose a redacted version to be made public by June 17.Wednesday's decision does not affect JPMorgan's $13 billion settlement in November 2013 with the federal government over mortgage-related matters.The decision could affect Deutsche Bank National Trust Co, which in 2009 brought a $10 billion lawsuit against the FDIC on behalf of trusts it oversees, and which held soured mortgage securities tied to Washington Mutual. Clark estimated that the Washington Mutual receivership has only $2.75 billion of assets to cover $6.07 billion of claims by holders of the bank's senior notes, plus whatever claim Deutsche Bank is allowed.Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Oksana Poltavets declined to comment.The case is Deutsche Bank National Trust Co v.

616,"   By Jonathan Stempel | June 3  June 3 A federal judge on Wednesday limited JPMorgan Chase & Co's potential liability to buy back soured mortgages tied to the main unit of Washington Mutual Inc, the savings and loan it bought at the height of the 2008 global financial crisis.U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in Washington, D.C. said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp must shoulder some losses attributable to Washington Mutual's lending before the largest U.S. thrift was seized by the government in 2008, and immediately sold by the FDIC to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion.In a two-page order, Collyer said JPMorgan assumed liability for disputed mortgages ""only to the extent that Washington Mutual Bank reflected such liabilities at a stated book value"" on its books as of Sept. 25, 2008, the day it was seized.The FDIC, which was appointed Washington Mutual's receiver, had argued that JPMorgan assumed the bank's obligations ""irrespective of a book value cap.""Collyer also ruled that JPMorgan did assume all mortgage repurchase liabilities of another unit it bought, Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. The purchase of Washington Mutual helped make New York-based JPMorgan the largest U.S. bank by assets.In a research note, CRT Capital analyst Kevin Starke said the decision could limit JPMorgan's obligations tied to the former Washington Mutual units to about $1.7 billion, including just $259 million at the main banking unit. FDIC spokesman David Barr declined to comment. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the bank is pleased with Collyer's order.The judge did not make public her decision explaining her reasoning. She directed the FDIC and JPMorgan to propose a redacted version to be made public by June 17.Wednesday's decision does not affect JPMorgan's $13 billion settlement in November 2013 with the federal government over mortgage-related matters.

618,"   By Brett Wolf and Douwe Miedema | ST. LOUIS/WASHINGTON, June 3  ST. LOUIS/WASHINGTON, June 3 The disclosure that some of the world's largest banks had been used as a conduit for bribes allegedly paid to soccer officials has prompted the banks to scrutinize their ties with FIFA, and could make it more difficult for the sport's powerful governing body to move money around the world.Major U.S. and European banks say they are stepping up scrutiny of FIFA-related accounts, and are wary in particular of ties to two regional member organizations that feature prominently in the U.S. Department of Justice's indictment.U.S. authorities last week charged nine current or former FIFA officials and five sports industry executives in a $150 million bribery scheme, accusing them of running a ""criminal enterprise"" that lasted for 24 years and relied heavily on the U.S. financial system. As the scandal continued to worsen, Sepp Blatter, FIFA's long-serving president, said on Tuesday he was quitting.Of the nine soccer officials, seven were former or current officials at either CONCACAF, the North-American, Central American and Caribbean football association, or at CONMEBOL, the South American regional soccer organization.A top compliance official at one of the banks named in the court documents said it would close any accounts of accused parties and closely review other FIFA-related accounts, especially those associated with CONCACAF. More scrutiny will now also be given to other sporting entities, such as the U.S. Olympic Committee, the official added.U.S. authorities have not accused FIFA itself of wrongdoing, though a person familiar with the matter said on Monday that U.S. prosecutors believe that FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke was involved in a $10 million bank transaction that is under investigation. FIFA and Valcke have denied this was the case.And late on Tuesday, a source told Reuters that Blatter himself is being investigated by U.S. prosecutors and the FBI.When asked if FIFA is having any trouble getting banking services, spokeswoman Delia Fischer said no. A spokesman for CONMEBOL, Nestor Benitez, declined to comment. A CONCACAF spokesman also had no comment.CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED Unless government allegations of bribery and money laundering expand to include the organization itself, FIFA and its affiliated bodies should be able to use banking services, executives at several banks said. Blatter's departure should also give them some comfort.""They're going to be very closely scrutinized, but they won't lose their accounts ... absent the government bringing forth evidence that FIFA was acting as a corrupt organization,"" said a senior compliance officer at another large bank named in the court documents. None of the more than a dozen banks mentioned in the U.S. indictment, which include some of the largest global financial institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America , Citigroup, HSBC and Barclays, are accused of any wrongdoing.Still, the senior compliance officer told Reuters that banks ""kind of panicked"" after comments by Kelly T. Currie, acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, who said banks' actions would be reviewed to determine if they knowingly facilitated bribe payments.An HSBC spokesman said: ""We are continuing to review the allegations in the indictments ... to ensure that our services are not being misused for financial crime.""Citigroup has said it has cooperated with the U.S. probe. JPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment. Barclays did not return a request for comment.""WE JUST DON'T NEED IT""  FBI agents carrying bags and boxes went into CONCACAF'S offices last week to execute a search warrant. CONCACAF said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the developments and that it was cooperating with authorities.CONCACAF conducted business using accounts at the Florida and New York branches of major U.S. and Swiss financial institutions, the indictment shows, without being specific about the banks concerned.FIFA was dogged by corruption allegations for years before the latest scandal, and at least one major European bank said it has not been providing banking for FIFA because of that.""It's not forbidden (to do business with FIFA) but due to reputational risks, we just don't need it,"" said a spokesman at the bank, which asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic.When asked about FIFA, a spokeswoman for the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which sets international anti-money laundering standards, said that ""at this stage, there are no plans to issue further guidance on the provision of banking services to such officials.""The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a regulator that oversees major U.S. banks such as Bank of America and Citigroup, declined to comment on FIFA. But the OCC says it leaves it to banks to decide on a case-by-case whether to terminate relationships with individual clients, just telling them to keep a close eye on risk.""We expect banks to ... report suspicious activity, for instance an unusual and unexplained spike in clearing activity,"" said Grovetta Gardineer, deputy comptroller for compliance operations at the OCC. ""That doesn't mean that there's actual money laundering, but it shows a deviation in the pattern that should be looked into.""TOUGH TASK But unless payments were destined for government officials, it would have been difficult for banks to spot suspicious transfers, said Jonathan Lopez, a former official at the U.S. Justice Department's money laundering section.""To ask a bank to decipher between legitimate and illegitimate payments by a multinational organization who by its nature makes a lot of payments in different countries is going to be tough,"" Lopez said.The widespread use of the dollar means that banks with a presence in America may unwittingly play a role in facilitating crime through a network of so-called correspondent banks, which perform services for banks outside the country, and have long been considered a loophole in the U.S. regulatory barriers against money laundering.The indictment shows that a high-ranking FIFA official - believed by U.S. authorities to be Valcke - caused $10 million to be wired from a FIFA account in Switzerland, to a Bank of America correspondent account in New York. It was for credit to accounts held in the names of the Caribbean Football Union and CONCACAF at Republic Bank in Trinidad and Tobago. Those accounts were controlled by former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who is among those charged.FIFA also wired billions of dollars from its accounts at a major Swiss financial institution into beneficiary accounts in the U.S. and throughout the world, via a correspondent account at the U.S. branch of a major Swiss bank, prosecutors said.Back in 2001, a U.S. Congressional report found that correspondent banks had become conduits for dirty money and that many banks established relationships with shell banks with no physical presence, offshore banks that only did business outside their jurisdictions, and banks with weak controls.Since then, a slew of guidelines have been issued and legal requirements established on how to manage the risks of these accounts. Major banks, including Standard Chartered Plc  and JPMorgan, also have cut some ties with other foreign banks, particularly in risky countries.JPMorgan, for instance, has a few thousand correspondent banking relationships and, about two years ago, began terminating some 500 or 600 of them. It also adopted a policy of not taking on new correspondent banking clients.

629,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A managing director at a boutique investment bank has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors at an insider trading case involving a former Perella Weinberg Partners employee accused of passing stock tips to his father, according to court records.Richard Cunniffe, who worked at Chatsworth Securities LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, secretly pleaded guilty on May 12 in Manhattan federal court to charges including securities fraud, records show.Prosecutors say he has been cooperating since March 12 in an investigation that led to charges last month against Sean Stewart, a former managing director at investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners, and his father, Robert Stewart.Prosecutors had already revealed they secured a guilty plea from a cooperating witness who engaged in recorded conversations with Robert Stewart about the alleged scheme.But at the time charges were unveiled May 14, Cunniffe's name remained secret. Asked on Thursday, representatives for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara confirmed his identity.Kevin Kearon, Cunniffe's lawyer, confirmed the guilty plea occurred but declined further comment. Prosecutors say Sean Stewart routinely tipped his father about mergers being worked on at Perella and JPMorgan Chase & Co, where he worked until 2011.At JPMorgan, those mergers included INC Research Holdings Inc's 2011 acquisition of Kendle International Inc and Apax Partners' buyout that year of Kinetic Concepts Inc.At Perella Weinberg, the deals included Hologic Inc's 2012 acquisition of Gen-Probe Inc, Linde AG's purchase of Lincare Holdings Inc that year, and Becton, Dickinson & Co's deal for CareFusion Corp in October. Authorities said Robert Stewart traded on the tips and, after a regulator began inquiring into Kinetic Concepts trading, arranged to have Cunniffe make trades in exchange for some of the profits.In total, the scheme enabled Robert Stewart and Cunniffe to make $1.16 million, according to a criminal complaint.Lawyers for the Stewarts declined comment on Thursday. A related lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission described Cunniffe as having spent almost his entire career in the securities industry and having been a close friend of Robert Stewart.Records maintained by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority list a single person by Cunniffe's name, who had the same licenses as the individual the SEC described and was registered until April with Chatsworth.A Chatsworth executive did not respond to a request for comment.The cases in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v.

630,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK, June 11  NEW YORK, June 11 A managing director at a boutique investment bank has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors at an insider trading case involving a former Perella Weinberg Partners employee accused of passing stock tips to his father, according to court records.Richard Cunniffe, who worked at Chatsworth Securities LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, secretly pleaded guilty on May 12 in Manhattan federal court to charges including securities fraud, records show.Prosecutors say he has been cooperating since March 12 in an investigation that led to charges last month against Sean Stewart, a former managing director at investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners, and his father, Robert Stewart.Prosecutors had already revealed they secured a guilty plea from a cooperating witness who engaged in recorded conversations with Robert Stewart about the alleged scheme.But at the time charges were unveiled May 14, Cunniffe's name remained secret. Asked on Thursday, representatives for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara confirmed his identity. Kevin Kearon, Cunniffe's lawyer, confirmed the guilty plea occurred but declined further comment.Prosecutors say Sean Stewart routinely tipped his father about mergers being worked on at Perella and JPMorgan Chase & Co , where he worked until 2011.At JPMorgan, those mergers included INC Research Holdings Inc's 2011 acquisition of Kendle International Inc and Apax Partners' buyout that year of Kinetic Concepts Inc. At Perella Weinberg, the deals included Hologic Inc's  2012 acquisition of Gen-Probe Inc, Linde AG's  purchase of Lincare Holdings Inc that year, and Becton, Dickinson & Co's deal for CareFusion Corp in October.Authorities said Robert Stewart traded on the tips and, after a regulator began inquiring into Kinetic Concepts trading, arranged to have Cunniffe make trades in exchange for some of the profits.In total, the scheme enabled Robert Stewart and Cunniffe to make $1.16 million, according to a criminal complaint. Lawyers for the Stewarts declined comment on Thursday.A related lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission described Cunniffe as having spent almost his entire career in the securities industry and having been a close friend of Robert Stewart.Records maintained by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority list a single person by Cunniffe's name, who had the same licenses as the individual the SEC described and was registered until April with Chatsworth.A Chatsworth executive did not respond to a request for comment.The cases in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are U.S. v. Stewart, 15-mj-1634, and U.S. v. Cunniffe, No. 15-cr-287.

641,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and David Henry  Jimmy Lee, one of JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) most important dealmakers, died on Wednesday, the bank's chief executive said in a statement. He was 62.Lee was one of the first bankers to break up big corporate loans into small pieces to sell to other banks, an innovation that helped fuel the leveraged buyout boom of the 1980s. He was a rising executive at Chemical Bank and the banks it merged with, taking increasingly senior positions until 2000, when he was sidelined as head of investment banking at what was then Chase Manhattan. Lee started instead focusing on winning deals of all kinds —advising companies on buying rivals and selling themselves, and on raising money. He played a key role in the merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines to form United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), the takeover of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones by News Corp (NWSA.O), and the initial public offering of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).Clients praised his relentlessness and his willingness to fight for better prices for customers. On the initial public offering for General Motors Co (GM.N) in 2010, he pushed to make sure the shares sold at a higher price than originally planned, said Dan Akerson, vice chairman of private equity firm Carlyle Group CG.N and the former CEO of GM. ""He was street smart, savvy, never overplayed his hand, but he’d push it,"" Akerson told Reuters in an interview.Lee felt shortness of breath while running on a treadmill at home on Wednesday morning, according to a person briefed on the matter who requested not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The sudden death surprised colleagues who were working with Lee as recently as this week. ""We're in total shock,"" said one senior JPMorgan banker. Lee's father died at the age of 47 from a heart attack. The younger Lee was just 11 years old at the time, according to a 2000 profile in Forbes. Lee started his career with Chemical Bank in 1975, where he began selling pieces of loans to other banks, helping to pioneer what is now known as the ""syndicated loan"" market. Over time, Lee built a junk bond business, a private equity advisory group, and a merger advisory group.     ""Jimmy was a master of his craft, but he was so much more – he was an incomparable force of nature,"" Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, said in the statement.Lee was fiercely loyal to JPMorgan. In 2012, when the London Whale derivatives trading fiasco was bleeding billions of dollars from JPMorgan's results, Lee arranged to have New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady call Dimon and remind the CEO that even Super Bowl champs have bad days, according to a 2012 story in Vanity Fair.  Private equity firm Blackstone (BX.N) tried to hire Lee away in the early part of last decade, but failed in the end, Blackstone chairman and chief executive Steve Schwarzman told TheStreet in 2009.  ""We were quite close at that time to a deal. But he's been extremely loyal to JPMorgan over the years,"" Schwarzman said.LASTING RELATIONSHIPS Lee's clients viewed him as a gatekeeper to the hundreds of billions of dollars that JPMorgan lends out as well as money from bond investors. In a statement Henry Kravis, co-chief executive of private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), praised Lee for ""constantly finding new financing sources.""  Kravis added, ""He built lasting relationships unlike almost any banker I have ever known.""Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook Inc FB.N, posted on her company's website that Lee ""believed in us long before many others did – when we were a small company with little revenue he told us and anyone else who would listen how much potential he thought Facebook had."" Other clients agreed about Lee's drive to do deals.""He was eternally optimistic that a deal could be done when he started one,"" Jack Welch, former Chairman and Chief Executive of General Electric Co, (GE.N) told Reuters. Lee was a legendary rainmaker, but like a classic old-line banker, he cared about risk on the loans he was making, because JPMorgan would suffer when loans went bad. Enrico Dallavecchia, a former senior risk executive at JPMorgan, recalled meetings with Lee in the 1990s to decide whether the bank should make big loans. ""He was ahead of his time in terms of understanding risk,"" Dallavecchia said. ""If he felt that the returns were not high enough for the risk, he would turn down a deal, even if people underneath him were telling him to do it,"" he added.Lee lived in Darien, Connecticut, and is survived by his wife, Beth, and three children, Lexi, Jamie and Izzy.

He was a rising executive at Chemical Bank and the banks it merged with, taking increasingly senior positions until 2000, when he was sidelined as head of investment banking at what was then Chase Manhattan. Lee started instead focusing on winning deals of all kinds —advising companies on buying rivals and selling themselves, and on raising money. He played a key role in the merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines to form United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), the takeover of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones by News Corp (NWSA.O), and the initial public offering of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).Clients praised his relentlessness and his willingness to fight for better prices for customers. On the initial public offering for General Motors Co (GM.N) in 2010, he pushed to make sure the shares sold at a higher price than originally planned, said Dan Akerson, vice chairman of private equity firm Carlyle Group CG.N and the former CEO of GM. ""He was street smart, savvy, never overplayed his hand, but he’d push it,"" Akerson told Reuters in an interview.Lee had planned to be at a JPMorgan dinner on Wednesday night for clients of the bank - in particular, directors of companies that use the bank, a person familiar with the matter said. The banker felt short of breath while running on a treadmill at home on Wednesday morning, according to a person briefed on the matter who requested not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The sudden death surprised colleagues who were working with Lee as recently as this week. ""We're in total shock,"" said one senior JPMorgan banker. Lee's father died at the age of 47 from a heart attack. The younger Lee was just 11 years old at the time, according to a 2000 profile in Forbes. Lee started his career with Chemical Bank in 1975, where he began selling pieces of loans to other banks, helping to pioneer what is now known as the ""syndicated loan"" market. ""He saw the power of the market,"" said a person close to Lee. Over time, Lee built a junk bond business, a private equity advisory group, and a merger advisory group.     ""Jimmy was a master of his craft, but he was so much more – he was an incomparable force of nature,"" Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, said in the statement.Lee was fiercely loyal to JPMorgan. In 2012, when the London Whale derivatives trading fiasco was bleeding billions of dollars from JPMorgan's results, Lee arranged to have New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady call Dimon and remind the CEO that even Super Bowl champs have bad days, according to a 2012 story in Vanity Fair.   Private equity firm Blackstone (BX.N) tried to hire Lee away in the early part of last decade, but failed in the end, Blackstone chairman and chief executive Steve Schwarzman told TheStreet in 2009. ""We were quite close at that time to a deal. But he's been extremely loyal to JPMorgan over the years,"" Schwarzman said.LASTING RELATIONSHIPS Lee's clients viewed him as a gatekeeper to the hundreds of billions of dollars that JPMorgan lends out as well as money from bond investors.  In a statement Henry Kravis, co-chief executive of private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), praised Lee for ""constantly finding new financing sources."" Kravis added, ""He built lasting relationships unlike almost any banker I have ever known.""Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook Inc FB.N, posted on her company's website that Lee ""believed in us long before many others did – when we were a small company with little revenue he told us and anyone else who would listen how much potential he thought Facebook had."" Other clients agreed about Lee's drive to do deals.""He was eternally optimistic that a deal could be done when he started one,"" Jack Welch, former Chairman and Chief Executive of General Electric Co, (GE.N) told Reuters. Lee was a legendary rainmaker, but like a classic old-line banker, he cared about risk on the loans he was making, because JPMorgan would suffer when loans went bad. Enrico Dallavecchia, a former senior risk executive at JPMorgan, recalled meetings with Lee in the 1990s to decide whether the bank should make big loans. ""He was ahead of his time in terms of understanding risk,"" Dallavecchia said. ""If he felt that the returns were not high enough for the risk, he would turn down a deal, even if people underneath him were telling him to do it,"" he added.Lee lived in Darien, Connecticut, and is survived by his wife, Beth, and three children, Lexi, Jamie and Izzy.

Under his watch, Americas Equities revenue grew 12 percent a year between 2011 and 2014, at a time when margins in the broader equities industry were under pressure. Sippel's replacement has yet to be confirmed.Among a number of other appointments within the team, the memo said Paul Brannan would now become head of prime brokerage for the Americas, reporting into Sippel.

649,"   By Brett Wolf | ST. LOUIS  ST. LOUIS A high-ranking JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) executive responsible for revamping the bank's anti-money laundering practices after U.S. regulators found lax controls has left in recent days, according to internal memos read to Reuters and confirmed by the bank.Patrick Moore, a long-time JPMorgan executive who took over as global head of financial crimes investigations in May 2014, is being replaced by Peter Neilson, formerly the head of anti-money laundering compliance for JPMorgan’s consumer and community banking.""Patrick has been a tremendous asset to our firm, and we wish him the very best with his new opportunity. We're fortunate to have a deep bench of AML talent, which includes Peter, who is an extraordinary leader in this space,"" Pamela Dearden, the managing director of financial crimes compliance, said in a statement provided to Reuters.Before departing, Moore circulated a memo in which he said he was ""beyond proud"" of his accomplishments and said his ""decision to leave was a personal one."" He did not respond to a request for comment.After taking the reins of the investigations unit, Moore tried to increase efficiency to clear a backlog of probes into possible illicit activity. He initiated a number of changes that included pushing investigators to close more cases and shifting responsibilities traditionally performed by staff to a new automated transaction-monitoring system. Moore also oversaw the consolidation of 15 investigations offices across the country into three in Delaware, New York and Texas.But some of Moore's decisions and his aggressive approach to implementing them created friction, according to four current and former JPMorgan employees who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Dozens of managers from the investigations unit left on Moore's watch, either because they were unhappy or the offices in which they worked were shuttered, the employees said.Neilson, who left an anti-money laundering executive position at Capital One (COF.N) to join JPMorgan in 2013, will report to Dearden and Frank Pearn, chief administrative officer of the bank's global compliance department. Neilson declined comment through a JPMorgan spokeswoman.Neilson’s appointment comes at a time when the stakes are high for JPMorgan. In 2013, regulators faulted the bank for inadequacies in its anti-money laundering program. And the Justice Department followed with a deferred prosecution agreement over the bank's failures to catch red flags during Bernard Madoff's multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. The bank failed to alert U.S. authorities for more than a decade, U.S. prosecutors have said.That agreement with prosecutors leaves the bank open to criminal prosecution until 2016 in the event of additional lapses.

650,"   By Anjuli Davies | LONDON, June 24  LONDON, June 24 Barclays has appointed U.S. bank JPMorgan as its corporate broker replacing Credit Suisse, the British bank told Reuters on Wednesday, making the change as new chairman John McFarlane begins a revamp of the lender.Barclays said it made the choice after inviting investment banks to pitch for the role. It kept on Deutsche Bank  which was already one of its brokers, the bank said.Corporate brokers, a setup peculiar to Britain, are investment bankers who act as an intermediary between public companies and their institutional investors. They are meant to be a company's trusted adviser, using expertise built up over years of being its eyes and ears in the market. Swiss bank Credit Suisse had been broker to Barclays for around 25 years, while Deutsche Bank had been appointed to the role in 2011.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Credit Suisse did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Macfarlane, who took the helm after the bank's annual shareholder meeting in April, is overseeing Barclays' efforts to shrink its balance sheet as part of a plan to cut costs, simplify its business and improve returns for shareholders. Several London-listed banks have changed brokerships in the past few months. Royal Bank of Scotland is turning to Bank of America Merrill Lynch as its new corporate broker in preparation for the government's plan to start selling its 78 percent stake in the bank later this year.Standard Chartered also changed brokers at the end of 2014, replacing UBS with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and keeping on JPMorgan.JPMorgan retains the crown in terms of the most broking relationships, following its purchase of British brokerage Cazenove.

657,"  NEW YORK, June 30 Investors added longer-dated U.S. Treasuries to their portfolios as uncertainty over the outcome of the debt talks between Greece and its creditors stoked safe-haven demand for U.S. government debt, a J.P. Morgan survey released on Tuesday showed.The share of ""long"" investors who said on Monday they were holding more longer-dated U.S. government debt than their portfolio benchmarks rose to 18 percent from 16 percent the previous week.The share of ""short"" investors who said they were holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks fell to 29 percent from 34 percent last week.Greece was on path to miss a $1.77 billion debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund due on Tuesday in the absence of a cash-for-reform deal with its creditors. This may hasten its exit from the euro zone bloc and put stress on financial markets, analysts said. EU authorities made a last-minute offer to salvage a bailout deal that could keep Greece in the euro zone on Tuesday. Net shorts on longer-dated Treasuries, or the difference between the shares of ""short"" and ""long"" investors, fell to 11 percent from 18 percent.Four weeks ago, the net shorts in longer-dated U.S. government debt was 32 percent, the highest level since May 5, 2006.

658,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In September 2008, JPMorgan Chase & Co executives sifted through the rubble of Washington Mutual, the failed home loan bank that they had just won in a U.S. government auction.They found something unexpectedly good: about $30 billion of mortgages on apartment buildings, which earned strong returns whether the economy was performing well or not.""It was an unexpected bonus,"" JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters in an interview, adding that the apartment lending business is the single most valuable asset that JPMorgan acquired in the auction.Washington Mutual's apartment lending business was the biggest of its kind in the United States and Dimon has made it even bigger. JPMorgan now holds some 20 percent of the U.S. bank loans on apartment buildings.Before the crisis, the bank ranked closer to 20th. JPMorgan now has $52 billion of these loans outstanding, giving it a stronghold in a market that is increasingly important in the United States after the housing crisis brought down the homeownership rate. Within JPMorgan, apartment lending is a relatively small business, accounting for less than 2 percent of its $2.6 trillion of assets. But the unit is seen as a model for how JPMorgan wants to run its lending business overall: make smart lending decisions in good times, like now, so that it can be strong enough to buy distressed assets on the cheap during bad times. That's how JPMorgan's apartment lending business grew so much during the crisis: the bank bought assets from Washington Mutual and Citigroup Inc at low prices, which are generating solid income now. The bank is plowing income from crisis assets back into its business, to make it more efficient and better prepare it for the next downturn. For example, JPMorgan is building systems that will allow it to approve loans in 15 to 20 days, half its current time, which is already fast by industry standards. The bank believes that when it can make loans faster than rivals, it will win more business without having to lower its credit standards. Lending fast is critical for the niche that JPMorgan focuses on: small apartment building owners, who are served by fewer lenders than big building owners, and will therefore generally pay banks slightly higher rates—around 3.625 percent instead of the 3.5 percent charged for loans of more than $3 million.The bank's apartment business could be tested in at least two ways in coming years. As the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the value of apartment buildings, which are bond-like assets, could decline, making it harder for some landlords to refinance their loans.  Also, in some metro areas developers have built many new apartment buildings, which could cut into the value of the collateral backing JPMorgan's loans. But the bank is working to reduce its risk by taking steps like avoiding markets where building is happening at a torrid pace.CHERRY-PICKING JPMorgan's business is headed by former Washington Mutual executive Al Brooks, 58. He had been with JPMorgan for barely a year, and the economy was still fragile, when Dimon asked him what apartment lending assets he wanted to buy. Brooks said that he had heard Citigroup wanted to sell its apartment loans as part of its plan to shrink the company after having been bailed out by the government.  Within days, JPMorgan was negotiating to buy $3.5 billion of loans from Citi, which was willing to let him and his team choose loans one-by-one, he recalled in an interview with Reuters. ""We cherry-picked them,"" Brooks said. ""There were great customers in there. These were 100 percent performing loans with long repayment histories. We felt really fortunate.""A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment. Those loans helped boost JPMorgan’s apartment lending earnings, which reached $600 million in 2014. Expenses in the unit, which include the costs of processing loan applications and running offices, were only 22 percent of net interest income, low in an industry where 35 percent is considered good, Brooks said.Low expenses boost a key measure of profitability for JPMorgan—its return on equity from the business is about 17 percent, Brooks said.  That is at least two percentage points better than the return reported by New York Community Bancorp Inc, whose portfolio of apartment loans accounts for almost half of its assets, and, according to data from SNL Financial, is the second-biggest of any bank.  To make smaller loans profitable, Brooks automates as much of the loan process as possible, which JPMorgan tries to do with other high-volume businesses, such as issuing credit cards and mortgages on houses. Brooks is now upgrading his systems to allow loan work to be done by different people at the same time, instead of following a rigid assembly line sequence that can be held up by a single person.  ""They have built a great business there,"" said Mark Myers, head of commercial real estate lending at Wells Fargo & Co. ""It is a model that is hard to replicate. They have executed it very effectively.""That performance could face increasing challenges. For one, Brooks said he anticipates more competition from other lenders as their confidence in the economy builds. Brooks is competing with banks, which in total own some $250 billion of apartment loans, and also with bond investors, insurance companies, government agencies and others who, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, own another $700 billion or so of debt backed by apartments. JPMorgan is also managing risk in the sector by lending relatively low sums of money compared with the values of the buildings.  The bank's average loan is less than 60 percent of the value of the building. The most the bank will lend is 75 percent of the value. The bank bases its building valuations primarily on the rents they earn, not sales prices of comparable buildings, which can be inflated during booms.Brooks is focusing lending on places with local government limits on development, such as coastal California. He also likes older, rent-regulated buildings in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Those buildings rarely have vacancies because tenants want to keep their inexpensive leases.JPMorgan's loans are expensive to make because they are small—averaging $2.5 million, about one-third the size of the average loan made by Wells Fargo. Making a smaller loan can take just as much work as making a bigger loan, which is why so many other banks try to focus on larger deals.   Brooks also pushes lending teams to decide which loans the bank really wants to make, and for how much and at what price, before an application is completed. Someone from the bank goes inside every building to make sure it is being kept up before accepting an application. The goal: No time wasted with weak applications brought in by overly optimistic salesmen.""When it comes down to controlling your costs, not working on stuff that won't pay off is essential,"" Brooks said. ""No fishing expeditions.""

659,"  (For more Reuters coverage of recent changes in futures trading, please see ""Chicago Pits: End of an Era,"" ( here  )By John McCrankNEW YORK, July 1 U.S. commodities brokerages - a key focus of reforms designed to make the financial system safer - are increasingly struggling to eke out a profit, spurring many firms to think about leaving the business, or trying to boost commissions.The brokers, known as ""futures commission merchants"" or FCMs, are paying increasingly large sums to comply with new regulations, bolster their cybersecurity systems, and do business with exchanges, among other areas.The vanishing FCMs are one way the futures trading business is changing in the United States. Another example is the imminent closure of the grains futures ""open-outcry"" pits at CME Group Inc, although the two cases are not necessarily related.There were 74 FCMs in the United States at the beginning of 2015, down from 93 a year earlier, and 154 prior to the financial crisis, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.""Sadly, it appears that the markets where 'derivatives' were born are quickly losing their core service providers, possibly forever,"" CFTC Commissioner Christopher Giancarlo said in a statement in June.The decline is significant because it means more risk is concentrated among fewer firms and some customers of FCMs may find it more difficult to gain access to the market because they do not generate enough profit for the brokers to justify taking them on.The dwindling number of FCMs has also made it more expensive for some customers to use derivatives. Regulators and lawmakers are trying to push customers like hedge funds and farmers toward using more standardized derivatives contracts, which can be traded on an exchange, or at least ""cleared"" through a third party after the trade. Central clearing allows regulators and others to ensure that parties are keeping enough collateral on hand to guarantee their contracts if one party to the trade goes bust. Brokers help clear trades for clients.Steve Sanders, executive senior vice president at Interactive Brokers, said rising fees and regulatory costs have kept Timber Hill, the company's FCM, from growing as fast as the rest of Interactive Brokers' other business units. ""The decision might be at some point if the cost gets to be too much, it may not be worth it for us to be in this business,"" he said.Other firms have made their decisions. Bank of New York Mellon, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street , and Nomura have all pulled back from or quit the FCM business.The number of FCMs has also shrunk due to mergers, with Wedbush Securities buying KCG Holdings' futures execution and clearing business, and Societe Generale taking over Jefferies Group's Bache unit.""They are more concerned about whether they can get the return on equity that they need from a shareholder perspective in those businesses, and that seems to be getting harder and harder,"" said Kevin McPartland, head of market-structure research at consulting firm Greenwich Associates. The top 10 FCMs are mostly run by large, global banks, which hold around 75 percent of all customer funds. PROFIT-CUTTING RULES FCMs make money through commissions and interest income. Their profit is falling due to a number of market and rule changes. The brokers hold client money in what are known as ""segregated accounts,"" and they are entitled to invest that money in low-risk securities. With the Federal Reserve having kept interest rates at near zero levels for six years, the profit from those investments has dwindled. In 2014 interest income made up less than 10 percent of the $4 billion in revenue made by futures brokers, down from nearly 50 percent of $7.1 billion in 2008, according to TABB Group.New capital rules require banks to set aside more capital to cover client exposures in their FCMs - by JPMorgan Chase & Co's  estimate for its own business, four to six times more equity.JPMorgan, one of the largest providers of over-the-counter derivatives services, said in February that the new capital rules hampered its profitability.The bank recently raised clearing prices following a similar move by Goldman Sachs Group Inc, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who did not have permission to be quoted in the media. It is also hopeful that talks with regulators may prompt a pullback on some rules that are costly to FCMs but do not necessarily make the financial system safer, the person said. YOU'RE FIRED Some firms feel that increasing prices is not an option. Timber Hill said it has resisted raising the fees it charges on top of exchange and clearing fees even as its own expenses have risen.""The cost is already so high that if we were to raise it any higher, there would be a lot less business,"" said Sanders.Some FCMs have resorted to abandoning their least profitable clients, said Matt Simon, an analyst at TABB Group.""There may be certain customers where we say, 'Unless you're willing to provide us a higher return by having a higher rate, we're going to deploy that capital to a different customer segment,'"" said Gerry Corcoran, CEO of RJ O'Brien, in an interview in March. No such plan had yet been made, he added.To be sure, FCMs are not going to go away entirely, because new regulations require OTC derivatives to be cleared.But as more firms decide to leave the FCM business, more risk is concentrated among fewer players. Examples of FCMs that have collapsed include MF Global and Peregrine Financial.""If something was to go tragically wrong then it's going to be a much bigger problem if there's one entity handling 40 percent of derivatives flow,"" said Greenwich's McPartland.

661,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By David HenryNEW YORK, July 1 In September 2008, JPMorgan Chase & Co executives sifted through the rubble of Washington Mutual, the failed home loan bank that they had just won in a U.S. government auction.They found something unexpectedly good: about $30 billion of mortgages on apartment buildings, which earned strong returns whether the economy was performing well or not.""It was an unexpected bonus,"" JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters in an interview, adding that the apartment lending business is the single most valuable asset that JPMorgan acquired in the auction.Washington Mutual's apartment lending business was the biggest of its kind in the United States and Dimon has made it even bigger. JPMorgan now holds some 20 percent of the U.S. bank loans on apartment buildings.Before the crisis, the bank ranked closer to 20th. JPMorgan now has $52 billion of these loans outstanding, giving it a stronghold in a market that is increasingly important in the United States after the housing crisis brought down the homeownership rate.Within JPMorgan, apartment lending is a relatively small business, accounting for less than 2 percent of its $2.6 trillion of assets. But the unit is seen as a model for how JPMorgan wants to run its lending business overall: make smart lending decisions in good times, like now, so that it can be strong enough to buy distressed assets on the cheap during bad times.That's how JPMorgan's apartment lending business grew so much during the crisis: the bank bought assets from Washington Mutual and Citigroup Inc at low prices, which are generating solid income now. The bank is plowing income from crisis assets back into its business, to make it more efficient and better prepare it for the next downturn.For example, JPMorgan is building systems that will allow it to approve loans in 15 to 20 days, half its current time, which is already fast by industry standards. The bank believes that when it can make loans faster than rivals, it will win more business without having to lower its credit standards.Lending fast is critical for the niche that JPMorgan focuses on: small apartment building owners, who are served by fewer lenders than big building owners, and will therefore generally pay banks slightly higher rates-around 3.625 percent instead of the 3.5 percent charged for loans of more than $3 million. The bank's apartment business could be tested in at least two ways in coming years. As the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the value of apartment buildings, which are bond-like assets, could decline, making it harder for some landlords to refinance their loans.Also, in some metro areas developers have built many new apartment buildings, which could cut into the value of the collateral backing JPMorgan's loans. But the bank is working to reduce its risk by taking steps like avoiding markets where building is happening at a torrid pace.CHERRY-PICKING  JPMorgan's business is headed by former Washington Mutual executive Al Brooks, 58. He had been with JPMorgan for barely a year, and the economy was still fragile, when Dimon asked him what apartment lending assets he wanted to buy. Brooks said that he had heard Citigroup wanted to sell its apartment loans as part of its plan to shrink the company after having been bailed out by the government.Within days, JPMorgan was negotiating to buy $3.5 billion of loans from Citi, which was willing to let him and his team choose loans one-by-one, he recalled in an interview with Reuters.""We cherry-picked them,"" Brooks said. ""There were great customers in there. These were 100 percent performing loans with long repayment histories. We felt really fortunate.""A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.Those loans helped boost JPMorgan's apartment lending earnings, which reached $600 million in 2014. Expenses in the unit, which include the costs of processing loan applications and running offices, were only 22 percent of net interest income, low in an industry where 35 percent is considered good, Brooks said. Low expenses boost a key measure of profitability for JPMorgan-its return on equity from the business is about 17 percent, Brooks said.  That is at least two percentage points better than the return reported by New York Community Bancorp Inc, whose portfolio of apartment loans accounts for almost half of its assets, and, according to data from SNL Financial, is the second-biggest of any bank.To make smaller loans profitable, Brooks automates as much of the loan process as possible, which JPMorgan tries to do with other high-volume businesses, such as issuing credit cards and mortgages on houses. Brooks is now upgrading his systems to allow loan work to be done by different people at the same time, instead of following a rigid assembly line sequence that can be held up by a single person.""They have built a great business there,"" said Mark Myers, head of commercial real estate lending at Wells Fargo & Co . ""It is a model that is hard to replicate. They have executed it very effectively.""That performance could face increasing challenges. For one, Brooks said he anticipates more competition from other lenders as their confidence in the economy builds. Brooks is competing with banks, which in total own some $250 billion of apartment loans, and also with bond investors, insurance companies, government agencies and others who, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, own another $700 billion or so of debt backed by apartments.JPMorgan is also managing risk in the sector by lending relatively low sums of money compared with the values of the buildings.  The bank's average loan is less than 60 percent of the value of the building. The most the bank will lend is 75 percent of the value. The bank bases its building valuations primarily on the rents they earn, not sales prices of comparable buildings, which can be inflated during booms.Brooks is focusing lending on places with local government limits on development, such as coastal California. He also likes older, rent-regulated buildings in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Those buildings rarely have vacancies because tenants want to keep their inexpensive leases.JPMorgan's loans are expensive to make because they are small-averaging $2.5 million, about one-third the size of the average loan made by Wells Fargo. Making a smaller loan can take just as much work as making a bigger loan, which is why so many other banks try to focus on larger deals.Brooks also pushes lending teams to decide which loans the bank really wants to make, and for how much and at what price, before an application is completed. Someone from the bank goes inside every building to make sure it is being kept up before accepting an application. The goal: No time wasted with weak applications brought in by overly optimistic salesmen.""When it comes down to controlling your costs, not working on stuff that won't pay off is essential,"" Brooks said. ""No fishing expeditions.""

665,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. commodities brokerages - a key focus of reforms designed to make the financial system safer - are increasingly struggling to eke out a profit, spurring many firms to think about leaving the business, or trying to boost commissions. The brokers, known as ""futures commission merchants"" or FCMs, are paying increasingly large sums to comply with new regulations, bolster their cyber security systems, and do business with exchanges, among other areas.The vanishing FCMs are one way the futures trading business is changing in the United States. Another example is the imminent closure of the grains futures ""open-outcry"" pits at CME Group Inc, although the two cases are not necessarily related. There were 74 FCMs in the United States at the beginning of 2015, down from 93 a year earlier, and 154 prior to the financial crisis, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.""Sadly, it appears that the markets where 'derivatives' were born are quickly losing their core service providers, possibly forever,"" CFTC Commissioner Christopher Giancarlo said in a statement in June. The decline is significant because it means more risk is concentrated among fewer firms and some customers of FCMs may find it more difficult to gain access to the market because they do not generate enough profit for the brokers to justify taking them on.The dwindling number of FCMs has also made it more expensive for some customers to use derivatives. Regulators and lawmakers are trying to push customers like hedge funds and farmers toward using more standardized derivatives contracts, which can be traded on an exchange, or at least ""cleared"" through a third party after the trade. Central clearing allows regulators and others to ensure that parties are keeping enough collateral on hand to guarantee their contracts if one party to the trade goes bust. Brokers help clear trades for clients.Steve Sanders, executive senior vice president at Interactive Brokers, said rising fees and regulatory costs have kept Timber Hill, the company's FCM, from growing as fast as the rest of Interactive Brokers' other business units.   ""The decision might be at some point if the cost gets to be too much, it may not be worth it for us to be in this business,"" he said.Other firms have made their decisions. Bank of New York Mellon, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street, and Nomura have all pulled back from or quit the FCM business. The number of FCMs has also shrunk due to mergers, with Wedbush Securities buying KCG Holdings' futures execution and clearing business, and Societe Generale taking over Jefferies Group's Bache unit.""They are more concerned about whether they can get the return on equity that they need from a shareholder perspective in those businesses, and that seems to be getting harder and harder,"" said Kevin McPartland, head of market-structure research at consulting firm Greenwich Associates. The top 10 FCMs are mostly run by large, global banks, which hold around 75 percent of all customer funds.     PROFIT-CUTTING RULES FCMs make money through commissions and interest income. Their profit is falling due to a number of market and rule changes. The brokers hold client money in what are known as ""segregated accounts,"" and they are entitled to invest that money in low-risk securities. With the Federal Reserve having kept interest rates at near zero levels for six years, the profit from those investments has dwindled. In 2014 interest income made up less than 10 percent of the $4 billion in revenue made by futures brokers, down from nearly 50 percent of $7.1 billion in 2008, according to TABB Group.  New capital rules require banks to set aside more capital to cover client exposures in their FCMs - by JPMorgan Chase & Co's estimate for its own business, four to six times more equity.JPMorgan, one of the largest providers of over-the-counter derivatives services, said in February that the new capital rules hampered its profitability.The bank recently raised clearing prices following a similar move by Goldman Sachs Group Inc, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who did not have permission to be quoted in the media. It is also hopeful that talks with regulators may prompt a pullback on some rules that are costly to FCMs but do not necessarily make the financial system safer, the person said.          YOU'RE FIRED      Some firms feel that increasing prices is not an option. Timber Hill said it has resisted raising the fees it charges on top of exchange and clearing fees even as its own expenses have risen.    ""The cost is already so high that if we were to raise it any higher, there would be a lot less business,"" said Sanders.    Some FCMs have resorted to abandoning their least profitable clients, said Matt Simon, an analyst at TABB Group.      ""There may be certain customers where we say, 'Unless you're willing to provide us a higher return by having a higher rate, we're going to deploy that capital to a different customer segment,'"" said Gerry Corcoran, CEO of RJ O'Brien, in an interview in March. No such plan had yet been made, he added.    To be sure, FCMs are not going to go away entirely, because new regulations require OTC derivatives to be cleared.     But as more firms decide to leave the FCM business, more risk is concentrated among fewer players. Examples of FCMs that have collapsed include MF Global and Peregrine Financial.        ""If something was to go tragically wrong then it's going to be a much bigger problem if there's one entity handling 40 percent of derivatives flow,"" said Greenwich's McPartland.   (Editing by Daniel Wilchins and Matthew Lewis)",2015-07-02,JPM,"Thu Jul 2, 2015 | 4:39am EDT",Ranks of commodities brokers dwindle as U.S. futures industry evolves,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-cme-landmark-brokers-idUSKCN0PB5OT20150702?type=companyNews

668,"   By Jamie McGeever | LONDON  LONDON Banks scrambled to increase the chances of Greece leaving the euro after Sunday's referendum, but euro markets only flickered and many investors doubted the `No' vote was the watershed moment some had feared.Greece's rejection of the conditions its European creditors had demanded for releasing new loans was not what markets had assumed last week. But like so many other twists and turns in this six-month standoff, the market reaction was far from black and white. The fall on Monday in the euro, euro zone blue chips and the government bonds of other southern euro zone countries such as Italy and Spain was largely within recent parameters.Traders and investors posited four possible explanations for the muted reaction.First, many investment funds believe the prospect of ""Grexit"" has now been so widely flagged that its shock impact is gone. Markets are largely priced to account for it and direct financial fallout from would be small anyway.Second, a sizeable number of asset managers still believe Grexit can be avoided.Third, many are convinced the European Central Bank - now armed with quantitative easing and a host of other bond-buying tools - will act swiftly and forcefully to douse any contagion.And fourth, markets are simply too complacent and are vulnerable to a bigger shock as the effects of the first euro zone member to leave the bloc become clear.""Maybe the market is more immune to contagion than we think. But it's been amazingly calm. There's effectively been no contagion at all, and I find that hard to believe,"" said Michael Michaelides, rates strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland.RBS was one of a clutch of banks, including JP Morgan and Barclays, to come out after the referendum and say Greece's exit from the monetary union is more likely than not. INSIDIOUS  Goldman Sachs said a `No' vote, followed by a tightening of capital controls and Greece resorting to IOUs, would push 10-year Spanish and Italian yields up to around 3 percent and widen their premium over German yields to 200-250 basis points.JP Morgan and Barclays also said the spreads would widen  toward 200 basis points as investors grappled with the sudden realization Grexit could actually happen.Perhaps tellingly, credit ratings firm Standard & Poor's also said it had upped its chances of Grexit but saw no direct ratings impact on other euro sovereigns.   In the event, Spanish and Italian yields rose 8 basis points by late afternoon to around 2.35 percent. The spread over Germany widened to 160-165 basis points. At those levels, Spanish 10-year yields have risen more on 13 previous days this year and Italy's have risen 19. Similarly, euro zone stocks fell almost 2 percent but have fallen more seven times this year.Reaction in foreign exchange was even more muted. The euro fell more than a cent below $1.10 early in Asian trading, but in afternoon trade in Europe it was down 0.7 percent. It has had 27 steeper daily losses this year.This is all the more remarkable given how seismic the prospect of ""Grexit"" was during the first wave of the euro zone crisis in 2011 and 2012. ""Many were taking this referendum too literally,"" said Neil Williams, chief economist at Hermes Investment Management.""Markets have yet to be convinced in full either that the exit door will be open or that the extent of any contagion from this could be irreparably damaging to the system,"" he said. ""Greece still needs to default and restructure in or outside the euro."" Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments, echoed that: ""A `No' vote does not mean a Greek exit from the euro. A Greek exit is by no means certain.""Along with expectations of ECB support, it was also critical that, unlike 2012, the rest of the euro zone economy was growing at a reasonable pace, Milligan said.  Economists at JP Morgan, who now put the chances Greece will leave the euro at two in three, said in a worst-case messy Grexit, the ECB could pump an extra 1 trillion euros of bond-buying stimulus into the system on top of the 1 trillion it has already committed to. That might push the euro down as much as 10 cents.Analysts at Barclays echoed a common sentiment that financial market contagion will likely remain ""limited and manageable"" thanks to the ECB. But they highlight a potentially ""insidious"" channel of contagion if Greece leaves the euro.""It would change the nature of the currency union and would undermine the credibility of its irreversibility in the medium-term for investors in the real economy,"" they wrote in a note.A deal between Greece and its European creditors might be more likely after Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's controversial finance minister, resigned on Monday morning, removing a major obstacle to an agreement.In response to the referendum vote and Varoufakis's resignation, UK bookmaker Ladbrokes lengthened the odds on Greece leaving the euro zone this year to 7/4 and shortened the odds of it staying in the currency bloc to 2/5.Those odds imply a roughly 60 percent chance Greece will stay in the euro this year and a 40 percent chance of Grexit.

INSIDIOUS Goldman Sachs said a `No' vote, followed by a tightening of capital controls and Greece resorting to IOUs, would push 10-year Spanish and Italian yields up to around 3 percent and widen their premium over German yields to 200-250 basis points.JP Morgan and Barclays also said the spreads would widen  towards 200 basis points as investors grappled with the sudden realization Grexit could actually happen.Perhaps tellingly, credit ratings firm Standard & Poor's also said it had upped its chances of Grexit but saw no direct ratings impact on other euro sovereigns. In the event, Spanish and Italian yields rose 8 basis points by late afternoon to around 2.35 percent  . The spread over Germany widened to 160-165 basis points.At those levels, Spanish 10-year yields have risen more on 13 previous days this year and Italy's have risen 19. Similarly, euro zone stocks fell almost 2 percent but have fallen more seven times this year.Reaction in foreign exchange was even more muted. The euro fell more than a cent below $1.10 early in Asian trading, but in afternoon trade in Europe it was down 0.7 percent. It has had 27 steeper daily losses this year.This is all the more remarkable given how seismic the prospect of ""Grexit"" was during the first wave of the euro zone crisis in 2011 and 2012.""Many were taking this referendum too literally,"" said Neil Williams, chief economist at Hermes Investment Management. ""Markets have yet to be convinced in full either that the exit door will be open or that the extent of any contagion from this could be irreparably damaging to the system,"" he said. ""Greece still needs to default and restructure in or outside the euro.""Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments, echoed that: ""A `No' vote does not mean a Greek exit from the euro. A Greek exit is by no means certain.""Along with expectations of ECB support, it was also critical that, unlike 2012, the rest of the euro zone economy was growing at a reasonable pace, Milligan said.Economists at JP Morgan, who now put the chances Greece will leave the euro at two in three, said in a worst-case messy Grexit, the ECB could pump an extra 1 trillion euros of bond-buying stimulus into the system on top of the 1 trillion it has already committed to. That might push the euro down as much as 10 cents.Analysts at Barclays echoed a common sentiment that financial market contagion will likely remain ""limited and manageable"" thanks to the ECB. But they highlight a potentially ""insidious"" channel of contagion if Greece leaves the euro.""It would change the nature of the currency union and would undermine the credibility of its irreversibility in the medium-term for investors in the real economy,"" they wrote in a note.A deal between Greece and its European creditors might be more likely after Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's controversial finance minister, resigned on Monday morning, removing a major obstacle to an agreement.In response to the referendum vote and Varoufakis's resignation, UK bookmaker Ladbrokes lengthened the odds on Greece leaving the euro zone this year to 7/4 and shortened the odds of it staying in the currency bloc to 2/5.Those odds imply a roughly 60 percent chance Greece will stay in the euro this year and a 40 percent chance of Grexit.

676,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double-click on )By Guillermo Parra-BernalSAO PAULO, July 7 Goldman Sachs Group Inc  and JPMorgan Chase & Co are among the global banks looking to invest in Brazilian distressed loans, an area some are calling the flavor of the month in Latin America's largest economy.With unemployment spiking and inflation eroding disposable income, households are defaulting on their loans at the fastest pace in six years. Toxic debt is also increasing for companies, which are succumbing to flagging sales and rising borrowing costs.Some funds acquire a large portfolio of credit from a bank at a steep discount and then rework each loan individually, profiting after repackaging them into securities, taking over the collateral or restructuring the debt. For banks, bad-loan sales help them clean up their balance sheets in times of economic hardship.Industry players estimate sales of toxic loans will exceed 23 billion reais ($7.3 billion) this year, up 35 percent from 2014. State-controlled lender Caixa Econômica Federal, which only entered this market last year, targets the sale of 9 billion reais in bad loans this year alone.Taking advantage of that trend, Goldman, Credit Suisse Group AG and Cerberus Capital Management LP are picking up soured consumer and corporate loans, joining local companies to pay record amounts for distressed assets.Credit Suisse Hedging-Griffo, the Swiss bank's private-banking unit in Brazil, and São Paulo-based Jive Investments Holding Ltd are raising money for a bad-credit fund from up to 50 investors, two sources with knowledge of the plan said. Goldman is also teaming up with Jive to invest as much as $200 million in the area, another two sources said.In May, JPMorgan-controlled Gávea Investimentos paid 100 million reais for 46 percent of debt collector Paschoalotto Serviços Financeiros Ltda to gain expertise in credit recovery. A public relations executive working for RK Partners said the São Paulo-based restructuring adviser would help Cerberus find distressed assets in Brazil.Goldman, Credit Suisse, Jive and JPMorgan declined to comment.HEFTY PROFITS  Goldman and Credit Suisse's bet on Brazilian soured credit should deliver hefty profits for both them and their clients.Returns on such assets are about 8 percentage points above Brazil's benchmark interbank CDI rate, currently at 13.6 percent. That is about twice the spread of junk-rated local notes.""We view distressed credit as less of a bargain opportunity lasting a couple of years, and more like a structural play,"" said Alexandre Nobre, founding partner of São Paulo-based distressed loans firm RCB Investimentos. ""The ongoing downturn only accelerates the process and validates a long-term bet on the sector.""While the rise in non-performing loans poses no systemic risk to Brazil's top banks, market woes for lenders look rougher and may last longer than in previous cycles, Moody's Investors Service said in a report last week. Loans in arrears at Brazilian banks are now at the highest level in two years, while household debt now equals 44 percent of income, a decade high, central bank data showed. The approximately 74 billion reais in defaulted debt accounted for 4.7 percent of outstanding loans in Brazil's banking system, central bank data showed last month.""Our segment will keep growing, only that we are bracing for a rather tough debt-collection cycle out ahead,"" Paschoalotto Chief Financial Officer Bruno Villela said in an interview.Brazil's downturn has especially hit the quality of credit card, auto and low-ticket working capital loans. Collateralized loans such as payroll or mortgage credit have performed relatively well, although signs of deterioration are showing.According to RCB's Nobre, banks at some point will be pressed to sell pulverized mortgage loans as builders grapple with a cash squeeze, declining property prices and flagging demand for new homes.Caixa, Brazil's largest mortgage lender, is in the final stages of selling two pools of distressed consumer and mid-sized corporate loans to investors. The bank sounded out specialized investors for the deal, including Grupo Recovery do Brasil SA, Graça Participações and RCB, sources told Reuters last week.Caixa confirmed the plans.($1 = 3.1674 Brazilian reais)   (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2015-07-07,JPM,"Tue Jul 7, 2015 | 11:46am EDT","DEALTALK-Surge in Brazil toxic loans catches eyes of Goldman, JPMorgan",http://www.reuters.com//article/banks-brazil-distressed-assets-idUSL1N0ZI2P920150707?type=companyNews
677,"   By Karen Freifeld  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) will pay $136 million and reform its credit card debt collection practices as part of a joint state-federal settlement of a probe that found it had acted illegally, U.S. authorities said on Wednesday. The bank will also pay at least $50 million in consumer refunds and $30 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in a related action, authorities said.""This is a good, strong settlement that's going to help a lot of people,"" Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who helped lead the probe, said on a conference call with reporters.An investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state attorneys general showed the nation's largest bank had subjected consumers to collections for accounts that were not theirs, contained erroneous amounts, or were uncollectible, the authorities said.Chase relied on robo-signing and other discredited methods to pursue consumers and gave inaccurate information to debt buyers, the authorities said. Robo-signing refers to the signing of mass quantities of documents without reviewing records. As part of the settlement, Chase agreed to reform the bank's credit card collection practices and debt sales. The deal also bars Chase's debt buyers from reselling consumer debts to other purchasers, the authorities said.The CFPB, 47 states and the District of Columbia joined in the settlements, which were first reported by Reuters on Tuesday. California and Mississippi, which have lawsuits against JPMorgan over its debt collection practices, did not participate. Nor did Wyoming, authorities said. JPMorgan said the settlement related to practices stopped years ago. ""We are pleased to resolve these legacy issues and are working to complete our remediation of affected credit card customers,"" the bank said in a statement.The states will split some $95 million, while the CFPB will get $30 million. Another $11 million will go to the states that led the investigation and settlement negotiations, the attorneys general said.As part of the deal, the bank will cease collection actions on some 528,000 consumers it won judgments against between 2009 and mid-2014. Many of the same issues were included in a 2013 consent order with the OCC.The bank stopped filing credit card collection lawsuits in 2011. Iowa's Miller said he didn't think improper debt collection practices were unique to JPMorgan Chase and that other companies would be pursued.

682,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former associate of Bernard Madoff avoided prison on Thursday for his role in perpetuating the fraudster’s massive Ponzi scheme because of his extensive cooperation with prosecutors.Paul Konigsberg, 79, a lawyer and accounting firm executive, pleaded guilty in June 2014 to charges of conspiracy and falsifying books and records.At the time, his cooperation deal was seen as a signal that prosecutors were still pursuing a criminal case against Madoff's son, Andrew, who died of cancer three months later.U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in New York, citing an otherwise admirable life, said Konigsberg had been punished enough by the loss of his reputation.“You’ve demonstrated sincere remorse,” she said.Prosecutors said Konigsberg was unaware of the scheme but helped by conspiring with Madoff employees to create some of the fraudulent customer statements at its heart. “Not a day goes by that I don’t regret that I trusted Mr. Madoff,” a tearful Konigsberg told Swain. “As we’ve all come to know, this man was truly a monster.”Konigsberg’s plea last year included references to two unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly received sham tax-free loans from Madoff. Sources told Reuters the two people were Madoff’s sons, Mark and Andrew.Mark Madoff committed suicide in December 2010 on the second anniversary of his father’s arrest. Andrew Madoff died in September.The Madoff brothers denied any knowledge of or involvement in their father’s fraud. Bernard Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence after pleading guilty to running the Ponzi scheme, estimated to have cost investors $17 billion in principal.

683,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK, July 9  NEW YORK, July 9 A former associate of Bernard Madoff avoided prison on Thursday for his role in perpetuating the fraudster's massive Ponzi scheme because of his extensive cooperation with prosecutors.Paul Konigsberg, 79, a lawyer and accounting firm executive, pleaded guilty in June 2014 to charges of conspiracy and falsifying books and records.At the time, his cooperation deal was seen as a signal that prosecutors were still pursuing a criminal case against Madoff's son, Andrew, who died of cancer three months later.U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in New York, citing an otherwise admirable life, said Konigsberg had been punished enough by the loss of his reputation.""You've demonstrated sincere remorse,"" she said.Prosecutors said Konigsberg was unaware of the scheme but helped by conspiring with Madoff employees to create some of the fraudulent customer statements at its heart. ""Not a day goes by that I don't regret that I trusted Mr. Madoff,"" a tearful Konigsberg told Swain. ""As we've all come to know, this man was truly a monster.""Konigsberg's plea last year included references to two unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly received sham tax-free loans from Madoff. Sources told Reuters the two people were Madoff's sons, Mark and Andrew.Mark Madoff committed suicide in December 2010 on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. Andrew Madoff died in September. The Madoff brothers denied any knowledge of or involvement in their father's fraud. Bernard Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence after pleading guilty to running the Ponzi scheme, estimated to have cost investors $17 billion in principal.In the 1990s, Madoff began steering some of his biggest clients to Konigsberg's accounting firm.In several instances, Konigsberg agreed to return customer account statements to Madoff's firm, to be replaced by amended statements with fraudulent backdated trades.

685,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK, July 10  NEW YORK, July 10 With a slew of big banks reporting results next week, the key financial exchange traded fund has been drawing strong inflows, and trading in its options appears bullish.The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, which tracks the S&P 500 financials sector, is up 1 percent this year and touched a seven-year high of $25.31, on June 18. The shares have fallen as much as 5 percent since then.Investors, however, have been pouring money into the fund, and for the seven days ending July 8, the ETF had its biggest weekly inflow since 2008, according to Lipper data.While flows, which tend to strengthen when a security's price is already rising, can gyrate for different reasons, it is likely that the inflows stem from investors looking for a rebound, said Jason Goepfert, founder of Sundial Capital Research.Seven of the fund's top ten holdings, including Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, are expected to report results next week. ""Investors are expecting some better earnings out of the banks next week, compared to the broad S&P,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.Second quarter earnings for the financials sector are estimated to grow 14.9 percent, the best among the ten S&P sectors, according to Thomson Reuters data.Traders in the options market also appear to be getting more optimistic. Since June, the ETF's call options, usually used to place bullish bets, have drawn increased activity. For each put, there are 1.2 calls open, roughly the highest such ratio since April 2012, according to Trade Alert data.""Most people are bullish on financials,"" said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""The sentiment starts positively with the fact that U.S. bank balance sheets look pretty darned good right now,"" he said.The top three blocks of open interest in the financial ETF, are in calls and account for a fifth of all open contracts. September calls at the $26 strike price are the biggest block with about 363,000 contracts open. The ETF's shares were up 1 percent at $24.60 on Friday.A possible Federal Reserve interest rate hike later this year might also be on the minds of some investors, strategists said.""If you are a believer that the Fed is going to start to normalize policy, financials are a category that should work,"" Orlando said.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)WEEK AHEAD The stock market this quarter doesn't get its usual one-week on-ramp to earnings season, instead getting hit with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Intel, Netflix, Google, General Electric Co and Honeywell, all in one week. Add in the political yelling that has become the semi-annual Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's testimony and the ongoing craziness that is Greece's potential exit from the euro zone - to say nothing of China's turmoil - and it should be a lively week for markets, and one that will likely see a lot of volatility. Euro zone finance ministers may make a ""major decision"" when they hold a special meeting on Saturday to weigh a new Greek proposal for emergency funding. The ministers' conclusions will be reviewed by euro zone leaders at a summit called for on Sunday.Fed Chair Janet Yellen delivers semi-annual testimony on monetary policy before the House Financial Services Committee in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday. The July hearing has more drama heading into it than the February testimonies. For one, Yellen starts this time with the House, where she ended last time, after trading some testy exchanges with Republican congressmen. This week's congressional appearance also comes as the Fed appears closer to raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. Yellen's appearance comes just a few weeks after the Fed's last Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and two weeks before its next one - so Yellen will be unlikely to drop too many policy hints and changes in this round or testimony, unless she wants to point the market harder to September lift-off.Dow components Johnson & Johnson, General Electric Co, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Intel Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc are scheduled to report quarterly results in the coming week. Johnson & Johnson is expected to report on Tuesday lower second-quarter sales and earnings as weak revenue from medical devices and consumer products and a stronger dollar more than offset the benefit of surging sales of its newer prescription medicines. The same day, JPMorgan Chase & Co releases second-quarter results. Separately, Goldman Sachs is expected to report lower second-quarter profit on Thursday. Intel Corp is expected to report second-quarter revenue and profit below analysts' expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. General Electric reports second-quarter earnings on Friday, with Wall Street eyeing updates on the U.S. conglomerate's desired portfolio moves as it seeks to become a more focused industrial company. UnitedHealth Group Inc will report second-quarter earnings on Thursday. The quarter is expected to be a strong one for UnitedHealth, whose technology and pharmacy management business has helped it report regular growth in quarterly operating profit.Google Inc, the operator of the world's No. 1 Internet search engine, is scheduled to post second-quarter results on Thursday. The company is expected to report quarterly revenue slightly below analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by the impact of a stronger dollar. Google, which generates about half of its revenue outside the United States, has also faced challenges in mobile advertising and it is investing heavily in new businesses.Citigroup Inc reports second-quarter results on Thursday. The most international of banks based in the United States is expected to see quarterly profits rebound sharply from a year earlier, when net income was all but obliterated by high legal and restructuring costs. Separately, Wells Fargo & Co will also report second-quarter results on Tuesday. The bank's mortgage banking business is expected to do well during the quarter as more people buy new homes in an improving economy. On Wednesday, Bank of America Corp is expected to report an increase in its second-quarter profit. The bank's results from fixed-income trading are expected to lag those of competitors because it is more heavily weighted toward trading credit instruments such as corporate bonds and it handles relatively fewer interest rate-sensitive government securities, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson warned investors in June.The U.S. Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index for June on Friday. The index is expected to have risen at a slower pace than in the previous month. Separately, the department will issue on Wednesday its June producer price index for final demand. On the same day, the Federal Reserve releases data for June industrial output, which is expected to have risen 0.2 percent after falling 0.2 percent in May. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department issues June retail sales data on Tuesday. Economists expect retail sales, which surged 1.2 percent in May, to have risen just 0.3 percent in June. On Friday, the University of Michigan's preliminary reading on its overall index on consumer sentiment for July is expected to come at 96.0 compared with a final reading of 96.1 for the previous month. Also, the Federal Reserve issues its so-called Beige Book on Wednesday.Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George speaks on economic conditions and monetary policy before the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 2015 Agricultural Symposium in Kansas City, Missouri, on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester speaks on the economic outlook and participates in live interview before the Columbus Metropolitan Club Forum in Columbus, Ohio. The same day, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams will speak on the economic outlook before the Mesa Chamber of Commerce in Mesa, Arizona and in another event, he will also give a brief summary on the economy before a Greater Phoenix Economic Council panel on economic trends in Phoenix, Arizona.On Thursday, e-commerce company eBay Inc is expected to report second-quarter revenue below expectations, according to some analysts. Revenue from the company's marketplace business, which includes its e-commerce platform ebay.com, fell last quarter, hurt by increasing competition from rivals such as Amazon.com and changes in Google's search algorithms. Investors will be looking for signs of a turnaround at eBay's marketplace business. They will also look for any commentary from the company regarding post-spinoff valuation of the marketplace business. Schlumberger Ltd, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, is expected to report a fall in second-quarter profit on Thursday as lower oil prices weigh on global drilling activity. Schlumberger, which has cut 20,000 jobs this year, has swiftly controlled costs to maintain margins in a weak commodity market. With oil prices staying around $50 per barrel, a handful of optimistic shale producers are looking to deploy more rigs. Investors will also look for comments on pricing and expectations for industry spending in the second half of the year. Another topic of interest this quarter is the company's pending deal with Russia's Eurasia Drilling.BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, will report second-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will await Chief Executive Larry Fink's comments on the results, the markets, Greece and China, among other issues.Charles Schwab Corp will report its second-quarter results on Thursday. Analysts expect the company's profit to rise to 24 cents per share from 23 cents a year earlier, helped by higher fees for advisory accounts and slightly higher trading commissions. But the big revenue bonus that Schwab expects from investing cash it will get in its clients account once rates rise remains evasive, amid signs that the Federal Reserve may again delay rate hikes.Delta Air Lines Inc is expected to post second-quarter results in line with analysts' expectations on Wednesday. However, investors will want to know how the airline plans to respond to falling demand abroad due to a stronger dollar, a regulatory investigation into U.S. airlines' capacity plans and pilots' decision to reject management's proposal for a new contract. Yum Brands reports second-quarter results on Tuesday. Yum's China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from a food scandal in its biggest market for profit. Analysts say that the company is suffering from ""brand fatigue"" in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain. The KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chain owner said it expected another tough quarter before a recovery in China, but this recovery could be pushed further as consumers cut back on discretionary spending amid an economic slowdown and fears stemming from the sharp decline in the Chinese stock market over the past few weeks. Investors will be looking for outlook and commentary on the impact from recent developments in China. Profit and sales are expected to beat a generally low bar for second-quarter estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.Netflix Inc, a TV and movie streaming service provider, is scheduled to post second-quarter results on Wednesday. The company is expected to report quarterly revenue above estimates, according to analysts, as it is expected to sign up more video streaming subscribers than previously expected. The cost of driving subscriber growth has been high as Netflix continues to invest heavily in international markets, but it is yet to see any profits from outside the United States.Kinder Morgan Inc, the leading U.S. pipeline company, is expected to report a lower second-quarter profit on Wednesday, but the focus this quarter will be on the company's reorganization.  Kinder Morgan shed its tax-advantaged master limited partnership structure last August by folding its units into one publicly traded corporation in a $70-billion deal. Investors will see if the new structure will help allay concerns about the company's growth prospects and complicated financial structure. The company has said the reorganization would help it grow its dividend by about 10 percent a year and clock bigger income tax savings.Domino's Pizza Inc reports second-quarter results on Thursday. The second-largest U.S. pizza chain is expected to report revenue below the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Chief Executive Patrick Doyle has said the company would need to raise minimum wage to stay competitive following McDonald's announcement of wage hikes in April. Investors will look out for any related announcement and updates on commodity costs, which the company said are likely to come down after cheese prices soared last year.On Thursday, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc is expected to report second-quarter earnings below the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company lowered its revenue estimate for the second quarter on Monday, citing weaker-than-expected demand for personal computers. All eyes will be on weak PC sales and whether the company can mitigate some of the impact with cost cuts. Barbie doll and Fisher-Price toys maker Mattel Inc is expected to report on Thursday second-quarter revenue above the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company will report its first quarter under new Chief Executive Christopher Sinclair, who took the top post in April. Sinclair has said Mattel needs to move urgently to create toys that connect with young customers in the face of flagging Barbie sales. Investors will look for announcements from Sinclair, a former Pepsi executive, on how he plans to turn around Mattel and make it more competitive, and any updates on the company's preparations for the holiday season.Honeywell International Inc, a major manufacturer of aircraft electronics and climate control systems, is expected to report second-quarter results below analysts' expectations on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Honeywell said in April that it expected a stronger dollar to hurt revenue by 4-6 percent in the quarter ended June. Investors will be looking for updated comments on how Honeywell expects the dollar to affect business in the full year.The initial public offering of the U.S. deep discount retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc is scheduled for Thursday. Ollie's Bargain operates 181 stores across the United States, selling excess inventory and salvage merchandise such as houseware, sporting goods and toys from manufacturers who make too much of an item or change their packaging. Ollie's net income rose 38 percent to $27 million in fiscal 2014, while revenue increased 18 percent to $638 million.Bank of Canada announces its rate decision on Wednesday and Governor Stephen Poloz holds a news conference upon the release of the Monetary Policy Report.

687,"   By Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. banks may start preparing for higher loan losses in the coming quarters, after plunging oil prices have made oil producers more likely to default on loans, analysts said. To prepare, banks are expected to set aside more money to cover bad loans, known as ""provisioning,"" when they post results in the next few quarters. Big U.S. banks start posting second quarter results next week, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N) reporting on Tuesday. The move will cut into earnings, and may be an early sign that credit quality among U.S. borrowers is no longer improving after the financial crisis, representing a shift in the credit cycle. Banks for years have been setting aside less and less money to cover credit losses, as companies and consumers defaulted less frequently on a wide variety of loans. Analysts cautioned that higher provisions do not necessarily imply that credit is broadly deteriorating.     ""We're kind of trying to thread a needle here because on the one hand we don’t want to dismiss this situation but on the other hand this is not a catastrophic 'oh my God here we go again,'"" said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. There are some storm clouds in the global macroeconomy now, including slower growth in China and the threat of a Greek exit from the Eurozone. Barclays Capital analyst Jason Goldberg wrote Friday that he sees little direct impact to U.S. bank loan books from those events.At least one reason for higher provisions is actually a positive for economic growth: banks are making more loans, Goldberg told Reuters.""I think the credit environment is still good,"" Goldberg said. Annual provisions at Wells Fargo peaked at $22 billion in 2009 and have declined each year to about $1.4 billion in 2014. At Bank of America the number fell to roughly $2 billion from more than $48 billion over the same period.Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski forecasts rising loan loss provisions for both banks in the second quarter, as well as JPMorgan. He is looking for a slight decline in provisioning at Citigroup, however. The price of oil CLc1 fell by nearly 60 percent between June 2014 and March 2015, and while it has since rebounded about 20 percent, it is still well off its highs. In an annual exam of loan credit quality, banking regulators are pressing banks to set aside more money to cover their energy loans, according to a report last week from the Wall Street Journal. Loans to the energy sector account for 5.7 percent of total loan exposure at JPMorgan, the largest among the big four U.S. banks, according to a report Cassidy published July 9. It accounts for 3.5 percent of Citigroup's exposure, 2.5 percent at Bank of America Corp and 2.1 percent at Wells Fargo.Other big lenders with even larger exposure to the energy sector as a percentage of their overall portfolios are Zions Bancorporation (ZION.O) and Comerica Inc (CMA.N) at 7.9 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively, according to Cassidy’s report. A Wells Fargo spokesman did not respond to questions. Spokespeople at the other banks declined to comment on upcoming earnings.

699,"   By Pamela Barbaglia | LONDON  LONDON European private equity firm Apax [APAX.UL] has hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) and UBS UBSG.VX to explore a stock market listing or sale of its Italian auto-parts distributor Rhiag, six sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.     The London-based buyout firm has invested in Rhiag for less than two years and hopes to cash out for as much as 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion), the sources said.Private equity firms typically invest for three to five years. But Apax, which bought the company in October 2013, wants to take advantage of high industry valuations and growing investors' appetite for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals in Italy to finalise an exit, the sources said.    A dual-track process to explore an initial public offering (IPO) or an outright sale is expected to start after the summer, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.        Apax, Rhiag, JP Morgan and UBS declined to comment.    Headquartered in Pero, close to Milan, Rhiag was sold to Apax in October 2013 for an undisclosed amount.    It could be valued at roughly 11 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around 90 million euros, two of the sources said.    Another source said that Apax would sell for no less than 10 times Rhiag's core earnings and it was primarily looking at a stock market listing in Milan.      Rhiag competes with Mekonomen (MEKO.ST) in the Nordics and Inter Cars CARP.WA in Poland, one of the sources said.    Swedish spare-part chain Mekonomen trades at 9.6 times its EBITDA while other industry peers trade at an average 9.9 times their EBITDA, according to Thomson Reuters data.        The decision to put Rhiag on the block comes amid a surge in M&A activity in Italy.     Bain Capital and Advent International recently trumped a series of heavyweight international funds to buy Italian banking services provider Istituto Centrale Banche Popolari (ICBPI).     The ICBPI deal, worth 2.15 billion euros, contributed to a significant rise in Italian M&A activity with $25.5 billion worth of deals recorded in the first six months of the year, up 240 percent from the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.         PRIVATE EQUITY CAPITAL     Rhiag has a long history of private equity ownership as buyout funds have consistently injected capital for the past 17 years.     It was first sold to London-based buyout fund CVC in 1998 and later acquired by Alpha Associates in 2007.    Alpha tried to list the business in 2011 and subsequently sold it to Apax.       Apax backed its acquisition of Rhiag with a 415 million euro high-yield bond issue in October 2013, leaving the company with five times net debt to EBITDA. The bond was increased by a further 50 million euros a year later.     The debt has performed well in the secondary market since then.    Rhiag could still appeal to international buyout funds as it offers growth prospects across Eastern European markets, one of the sources said, adding that some industry players may also consider submitting a bid.    Founded in 1962, Rhiag operates as a distributor of replacement automotive components to after-market wholesalers in 10 European countries including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Romania and Ukraine.

703,"   By Joseph Ax and Jonathan Stempel  U.S. and Israeli authorities arrested four people in Israel and Florida on Tuesday in connection with several fraud schemes tied to last summer's massive data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co, according to news reports.The hacking of JPMorgan's computers compromised information in 83 million household and small business accounts, making it one of the largest such breaches in history.Federal prosecutors in New York confirmed the four arrests but did not mention the breach, and charging documents unsealed on Tuesday did not refer to the hack. Bloomberg was the first news outlet to report the connection. The New York Times reported that federal authorities had identified some of the JPMorgan hackers because the attack was relatively unsophisticated but authorities were unable to collect enough evidence to charge anyone with the breach itself.Investigators then turned to other activities in which the hackers were involved, leading to the charges unsealed on Tuesday, the Times reported.In one indictment, U.S. authorities accused three men of engaging in a stock manipulation scheme involving U.S. penny stocks.Gery Shalon, 31, and Ziv Orenstein, 40, are Israeli nationals who were arrested on Tuesday at their homes in Israel, U.S. prosecutors said. Joshua Samuel Aaron, 31, is a U.S. citizen who resides in Moscow and Tel Aviv and remains at large, authorities said. When initially asked about Tuesday's case, an Israeli police spokesman referred to three arrests made last week in a separate, unrelated cybercrime case pursued by U.S. investigators.An Israeli police spokeswoman subsequently confirmed Tuesday’s arrests but did not comment on any possible tie to the JPMorgan breach. She said the Federal Bureau of Investigation had asked that Shalon and Orenstein be held to begin extradition proceedings and also requested permission to interrogate them in Israel.The two men are expected in court on Wednesday. Prosecutors in New York announced charges against two Florida men, Anthony Murgio, 31, and Yuri Lebedev, 37, for operating an unlicensed money exchange using the digital currency bitcoin. The two men were also arrested on Tuesday in Florida and were expected to appear in federal court there later in the day.A spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office brought the charges, did not respond to requests for comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment on the arrests.According to the indictment, Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein worked with two unnamed stock promoters, one from New Jersey and one from Florida, to run a ""pump-and-dump"" scheme. The defendants would acquire shares in thinly traded companies, send millions of spam emails inducing investors to buy the stocks in order to drive up the price, and then sell off their holdings. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil action against Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein.Murgio and Lebedev were accused of operating Coin.mx, a bitcoin exchange that was used to facilitate criminal activity  including cyberattacks. Between October 2013 and January 2015, the site processed at least $1.8 million for tens of thousands of customers, authorities said.The JPMorgan attack initially prompted speculation that Russian hackers were involved, but U.S. investigators ruled out Moscow early in the case.The criminal complaints against Lebedev and Murgio include a brief mention of Russia, alleging the two men sought to provide money laundering services to Russian criminals.

In one indictment, U.S. authorities accused three men of engaging in a stock manipulation scheme involving U.S. penny stocks.Gery Shalon, 31, and Ziv Orenstein, 40, are Israeli nationals who were arrested on Tuesday at their homes in Israel, U.S. prosecutors said. Joshua Samuel Aaron, 31, is a U.S. citizen who resides in Moscow and Tel Aviv and remains at large, authorities said.When initially asked about Tuesday's case, an Israeli police spokesman referred to three arrests made last week in a separate, unrelated cybercrime case pursued by U.S. investigators.An Israeli police spokeswoman subsequently confirmed Tuesday's arrests but did not comment on any possible tie to the JPMorgan breach. She said the Federal Bureau of Investigation had asked that Shalon and Orenstein be held to begin extradition proceedings and also requested permission to interrogate them in Israel. The two men are expected in court on Wednesday.Prosecutors in New York announced charges against two Florida men, Anthony Murgio, 31, and Yuri Lebedev, 37, for operating an unlicensed money exchange using the digital currency bitcoin.The two men were also arrested on Tuesday in Florida and were expected to appear in federal court there later in the day. A spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office brought the charges, did not respond to requests for comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment on the arrests.According to the indictment, Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein worked with two unnamed stock promoters, one from New Jersey and one from Florida, to run a ""pump-and-dump"" scheme. The defendants would acquire shares in thinly traded companies, send millions of spam emails inducing investors to buy the stocks in order to drive up the price, and then sell off their holdings.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil action against Shalon, Aaron and Orenstein.Murgio and Lebedev were accused of operating Coin.mx, a bitcoin exchange that was used to facilitate criminal activity  including cyberattacks. Between October 2013 and January 2015, the site processed at least $1.8 million for tens of thousands of customers, authorities said.The JPMorgan attack initially prompted speculation that Russian hackers were involved, but U.S. investigators ruled out Moscow early in the case.The criminal complaints against Lebedev and Murgio include a brief mention of Russia, alleging the two men sought to provide money laundering services to Russian criminals.

705,"   By Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. banks are setting aside more money to cover bad loans to energy companies after oil prices plunged over the last year, raising the possibility that deteriorating loans could start to weigh on their earnings, some analysts said. Loan credit quality for U.S. banks has been improving since the financial crisis. In the first quarter, 2.49 percent of loans on banks' books were delinquent, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007, according to the Federal Reserve, which hasn't released second quarter data. The rate peaked at 7.4 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Weakness among energy company loans could be a sign that overall credit quality among U.S. banks has little room to improve, analysts said. Executives from both JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. told investors last week, when posting earnings, that they were increasingly concerned about loans to oil and gas companies. Texas bank Comerica Inc on Friday set aside about three times as much money to cover bad loans as analysts had expected, sending the regional bank's shares lower by more than 6 percent after the bank reported earnings Friday. Setting aside more money, known as ""provisioning,"" hurts earnings.""The banks really have very low credit costs and those can go higher,"" said Fred Cannon, who heads research at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. While ""energy overall is not a life threatening issue for the banks, it is earnings threatening,"" he said.JPMorgan said on Tuesday it provisioned another $252 million to cover potentially bad wholesale business loans in the quarter, with $140 million of that related to oil and gas lending.Oil prices rallied in March and April, but in recent weeks have fallen again on expectations that loosened sanctions against Iran create the potential for greater supplies. U.S. crude oil prices fell below $50 a barrel on Monday for the first time since April.U.S. accounting rules require that banks set aside money to cover losses on loans only after the loan has shown visible signs of deteriorating, such as a borrower having missed an interest payment. The rules are subject to wide interpretation, however, so that such things as weaker oil and gas prices could potentially prompt some borrowers to increase their provisions.The hit to earnings from banks' higher provisioning could pour cold water on shares of a sector that has been on fire recently. Since the end of January, U.S. bank stocks have risen 18.7 percent, compared with a 6.6 percent gain for the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index. Much of that optimism has come from investors preparing for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, boosting the rates at which banks can lend and therefore their profits.Bank profits have been essentially stagnant in recent years, thanks to low rates and tepid economic growth. JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said the bank ""might expect"" to add more reserves before this year is out. ""It is possible we will be selectively downgrading some clients,"" she said. She described the increases in reserves as ""completely normal"" in the business cycle. ""We are still very happy,"" Lake said.CEO Jamie Dimon, interjecting as Lake spoke, said, ""Those reserves do not mean we're going to have losses.""To be sure, credit quality is still good. Wells Fargo said that for its overall loan book, the balance of loans on which borrowers had stopped making interest payments declined $67 million in the second quarter, even though delinquencies rose among energy sector companies. Residential mortgage loans are performing better.CFO John Shrewsberry predicted energy-related credit performance will remain weak.""We're still resolving these issues,"" he said on a conference call with investors on Tuesday. ""Some of them are just coming to light for certain borrowers, but it's a very contained portion of our loan portfolio and the aggregate impact should not be material to Wells Fargo."" Energy exposure accounts for just 2 percent of Wells Fargo's loan portfolio. However, as KBW's Cannon said, the total money the bank has provisioned for bad loans over time is even smaller— just about 1.2 percent. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment.     PLUNGING OIL PRICES Following an annual exam of loan credit quality, regulators are pressing banks to set aside more money to cover their energy loans, according to a report earlier this month from the Wall Street Journal.Comerica CFO Karen Parkhill said in an interview that provisions could increase further if oil prices remain low, though this could be offset somewhat if borrowers begin paying down debt, as has occurred in past periods of weak oil prices.  As for why provisioning was so much larger than expected, Parkhill said, ""we did always say that we would expect continued negative credit migration if oil prices remained low and that’s what has happened.""Moody's Investors Service flagged the issue in a report published Monday. Banks it singled out as having particularly high exposure to the energy sector by at least one measure were led by BOK Financial Corp., Hancock Holding Co, Texas Capital Bancshares Inc. and Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc. While noting ""asset quality deterioration"" in the energy loan portfolios of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, Moody's analyst Joseph Pucella wrote that the exposure of those banks is ""comparatively small.""BOK Financial investor relations director Joseph Crivelli responded to questions with a statement noting the bank forecasted loan loss provisions of $15 million to $20 million for 2015.""We continue to believe that our energy portfolio is sound from a credit standpoint,"" the statement read in part. ""Stress tests on the portfolio conducted earlier this year reveal only a handful of customers who would demonstrate weakness in a highly stressed environment.""Spokespeople for Hancock, Texas Capital Bancshares and Cullen/Frost declined to comment.

Madoff Investment Securities.Five decades later, Lipkin, 77, is set to be sentenced on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court for falsifying records, marking the end of the criminal case stemming from the collapse of Madoff's multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme more than six years ago.Lipkin is the last of 15 people who either pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial in connection with the fraud, which cost investors approximately $17 billion in principal.Madoff, 77, who is serving a 150-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2009 to masterminding the fraud, has always insisted he acted alone.Prosecutors have conceded that Madoff alone knew the full extent of his deception. Even his deputy, Frank DiPascali, who was intimately involved in the fraud, testified he believed Madoff had hidden assets to cover customers' liabilities almost until the end.Madoff tearfully confessed to him that he didn't ""have any more goddamn money"" in the firm's final days, DiPascali said in 2013 while testifying against five former colleagues.But prosecutors have used millions of documents and the cooperation of key co-conspirators to prove that while Madoff was the architect, he had plenty of help. The task was complicated by the sheer scope of the fraud and involved poring through countless paper records, since the scheme began before computers were widespread.""It was a fraud that lasted for 40-something years; it involved thousands upon thousands of customers,"" said former prosecutor Matthew Schwartz, now a partner at Boies Schiller & Flexner, who helped lead the Madoff investigation.

Prosecutors criticized those sentences as too light and have taken the unusual step of appealing.Besides DiPascali, six defendants cooperated with prosecutors and were rewarded with non-prison sentences. DiPascali died in May before his sentencing.As part of the criminal investigation, the Justice Department has also recovered $4 billion for victims, including $1.7 billion from Madoff's longtime bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co , as part of a deferred prosecution agreement.Over the years, there was speculation as to whether the government would expand its criminal case to others, including major Madoff clients and other firm employees.Last year, Reuters reported that prosecutors were still considering a case against Madoff's son, Andrew.

716,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 12 The father of a former investment banker at Perella Weinberg Partners pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a charge that he illegally traded securities ahead of healthcare mergers based on information supplied by his son.Robert Stewart, 60, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to a conspiracy count, three months after he was arrested for engaging in an insider trading scheme that enabled him and an associate to make $1.16 million based on his son's tips.""I knew what I was doing was wrong,"" Stewart said, according to a transcript.Under a plea deal, Stewart agreed not to appeal any prison term below 37 months when he is sentenced Nov. 12. The deal did not call for him to cooperate in the case against his son, Sean Stewart.A lawyer for Robert Stewart declined comment. Tai Park, Sean Stewart's lawyer, said his client was ""looking forward to trial and being fully vindicated."" The case was the latest in a string of insider trading prosecutions under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office has since 2009 charged 96 people.The case is one of the first criminal prosecutions the office has pursued after a federal appeals court in December issued a ruling that restricted their ability to pursue insider trading cases. Prosecutors said that Sean Stewart, 34, routinely tipped his father about mergers being worked on at Perella and JPMorgan Chase & Co, where he worked until 2011.At JPMorgan, those mergers included INC Research Holdings Inc's 2011 acquisition of Kendle International Inc and Apax Partners' buyout that year of Kinetic Concepts Inc.At Perella Weinberg, the deals included Hologic Inc's  2012 acquisition of Gen-Probe Inc, Linde AG's  purchase of Lincare Holdings Inc that year, and Becton, Dickinson & Co's deal for CareFusion Corp in October. Authorities said Robert Stewart, an accountant, traded on the tips and, after a regulator began inquiring about Kinetic Concepts trading, arranged to have a business associate, Richard Cunniffe, make trades for a cut of what became $1.16 million in profits.Cunniffe, an investment banker at Chatsworth Securities LLC, ultimately agreed to cooperate with authorities, secretly pleading guilty in March before the Stewarts were charged and participating before that in recorded conversations of Robert Stewart.In one recording, authorities say, Robert Stewart told Cunniffe that his son once chastised him for failing to use a tip, saying, ""I can't believe I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn't invest in it.""The case is U.S. v.

717,"  AMSTERDAM Aug 13 The director of the Dutch government agency that oversees nationalised bank ABN Amro  regrets having accepted an invitation to dine in Amsterdam with the head of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon, the finance ministry said on Thursday.NLFI director Michael Enthoven, himself a former JPMorgan employee, attended the dinner on June 30 with Dimon and 15  executives and supervisory board members of major Dutch companies and banks.Formal questions about whether Enthoven's attendance at the dinner was appropriate had been lodged by a member of Dutch parliament, given that the NLFI was at the time in the process of selecting the banks that would assist in the initial public share offer of ABN Amro, which is planned for later this year. JPMorgan was at the time competing for the job of 'global coordinator' of the listing but lost out to Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and ABN Amro itself. In a letter to parliament dated Aug. 13, Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said that Enthoven had not acted in conflict with any rules or norms. But ""Mr. Enthoven indicated in his explanation that, in retrospect, he should have declined the invitation, given the ongoing selection process for the proposed listing of ABN Amro,"" Dijsselbloem wrote.

720,"  (Adds J.P. Morgan Libor forecasts, byline)By Richard LeongNEW YORK Aug 14 A key interbank lending rate rose at a slower pace on Friday following its biggest single-day increase in more than five years, while overnight borrowing costs for Wall Street remained elevated.The London interbank offered rate for three-month dollar borrowings climbed to 0.32445 percent, the highest since October 2012, from Thursday's fixing of 0.32050 percent. The 0.4 basis point rise was less than half its 1.1 basis point jump on Thursday, which was its biggest gain since May 2010.This benchmark rate for $350 trillion worth of financial products has been posting a series of multi-year peaks as traders have anticipated the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by the end of the year.J.P. Morgan analysts forecast on Friday if the U.S. central bank were to raise rates in its September 16-17 policy meeting, three-month dollar Libor would rise to 0.55 percent. One-month Libor and six-month Libor  would climb to 0.46 percent and 0.84 percent, respectively, compared with 0.19960 percent and 0.52490 percent on Friday, the analysts said in a research note.Meanwhile, the interest rate on U.S. repurchase agreements was last quoted at 0.23 percent to 0.26 percent early Friday , compared with 0.25 percent late Thursday, according to ICAP. In the repo market, money funds and other investors make short-term loans to banks and Wall Street dealers. Banks and dealers pledge Treasuries and other securities as collateral.The U.S. Treasury Department this week sold $64 billion in bonds for its quarterly refunding to mixed results.Typically, Wall Street dealers who buy bonds at auctions seek funding in the repo market until they settle. In the derivatives market, interest rate futures fell as jitters about China's devaluation of its currency earlier this week abated. The surprise move in a bid to help Chinese exporters roiled financial markets worldwide and stoked bets the Federal Reserve would delay an interest rate increase.Beijing took steps to ease concerns about further devaluation, but some analysts remain wary.The yuan held steady versus the greenback on Friday, but booked a record 2.9 percent weekly loss.U.S. interest rate futures suggested traders expect a 45 percent chance the Federal Reserve will raise rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, up from 39 percent on Thursday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

724,"  * FDIC, as receiver for Guaranty Bank, also sues US Bancorp* FDIC says lost money after selling troubled mortgage debt* Defendants are accused of shirking duties as bond trustees   (Adds US Bancorp response)By Joseph AxNEW YORK, Aug 19 A U.S. regulator sued Bank of New York Mellon Corp on Wednesday over $2.06 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities purchased by a failed Texas bank, and accused it of breaching its duties as bond trustee to protect investors.In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which sued in its capacity as receiver for the former Guaranty Bank, said it suffered more than $440 million in losses when it sold the securities in March 2010. The FDIC filed a similar lawsuit against US Bancorp, another major bond trustee, over more than $248 million of mortgage debt bought by Guaranty, and resulting in ""significant"" losses when those securities were sold.Austin, Texas-based Guaranty Bank closed in August 2009, and the FDIC arranged for its deposits to be assumed by BBVA Compass of Birmingham, Alabama, a unit of Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. At the time, the regulator estimated the closure would cost its deposit insurance fund $3 billion.The Bank of New York Mellon lawsuit concerned 12 mortgage-backed trusts issued by Bear Stearns Cos' EMC Mortgage Corp unit and by Countrywide Home Loans Inc in 2005 and 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co bought Bear in 2008, and Bank of America Corp bought Countrywide in the same year.As bond trustee, BNY Mellon ""shirked its duty"" to ensure the loan documents were not incomplete or defective, the FDIC said. ""While BNY Mellon stood idly for years, the sponsors kept defective mortgage loans in the covered trusts, servicers reaped excessive fees for servicing the defaulted loans from the covered trusts, and plaintiff was left to suffer enormous losses,"" the lawsuit said.A spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon had no immediate comment. US Bancorp spokesman Dana Ripley declined to comment.Since 2013, the FDIC has secured $1.83 billion in settlements with financial institutions over mortgage-backed securities sold to banks it took into receivership.In July, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay the FDIC $24 million to resolve a lawsuit filed in a Texas state court, according to a settlement agreement on the regulator's website.The cases are Federal Deposit Insurance Corp v. The Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 15-06560; and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp v U.S. Bank NA in the same court, No. 15-06570.

The two bankers will focus on ""acquisitions and divestitures"" (A&D) for oil and gas companies. A&D transactions, which often involve mineral rights or acreage, incorporate complex engineering and technical research needed to value oil and gas deposits far beneath the earth's surface.Deverka will join JP Morgan as head of A&D, according to the memo. The hires come amid depressed oil and gas prices which have caused the investment banking business to shift from a focus on initial public offerings, when oil prices were high, to advising companies on deals to raise cash as their earnings dwindle.Prior to founding Catalyst, Deverka worked at Petrie Parkman & Co and Merrill Lynch. Sloan, in addition to his CFO duties at Catalyst, advised on deals involving oil and gas pipelines as well as A&D assignments.During its five years of operation, Catalyst advised clients on $5 billion worth of acquisitions and divestitures.Deverka and Sloan will be based in Houston, and report to the co-heads of JPMorgan's oil & gas investment banking practice, Paschall Tosch and Lackland Bloom.

730,"   By Gayatri Suroyo | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Aug 27 Indonesia said on Thursday it had ""sanctioned"" JPMorgan Chase & Co after the investment bank recommended smaller exposure to government bonds of Southeast Asia's biggest economy, but did not say what the sanctions entailed.Investor sentiment toward Indonesia has turned increasingly negative due to its fragile economy, with slowing domestic consumption, declining forex reserves, and rock-bottom commodity prices.JPMorgan moved to ""underweight"" from ""overweight"" on Indonesian government bonds in a report dated Aug. 20. Some of the reasons it cited were China's devaluation of its currency and Indonesia's planned increase in government borrowings. The report drew a sharp reaction from Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro and central bank governor Agus Martowardojo. The Bank Indonesia chief had accused JPMorgan on Wednesday of spreading panic in the country.""When there is negative analysis about Indonesia, we as the authorities have to take action because no matter what, it is something that is also unethical: turning a country into a commodity,"" Brodjonegoro told reporters. When asked repeatedly what the sanctions against JPMorgan were, the minister declined to elaborate, only saying they ""will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable"".Brodjonegoro later added jokingly that JPMorgan should do 100 push-ups as punishment. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.Indonesia is grappling with its weakest growth in six years and policymakers have stepped up efforts in the past two weeks to stem the sell-off in the currency and stock markets.Some analysts have overlooked the ""micro data"" and equated emerging economies without taking into account the fundamental differences, Brodjonegoro said.

The legal actions have brought only mixed results as banks strongly contested claims that they discriminated.Los Angeles is still pursuing similar complaints against Bank of America <BAC.N >, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N).JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said the bank was pleased with the city's decision.

In court filings, JPMorgan denied that it discriminated against minority borrowers. It said Los Angeles was trying to make the bank responsible for lending by Washington Mutual, which JPMorgan acquired in 2008 during the financial crisis. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright dismissed the lawsuit last year, agreeing that under U.S. law, the city could not sue in federal court before exhausting claims involving Washington Mutual at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Los Angeles filed an amended complaint in August 2014.In a court filing last month, lawyers for JPMorgan said the new complaint should be dropped because the bank did not foreclose on a single loan to African-American or Hispanic borrowers during the time covered by the lawsuit. The city's lawsuits against Bank of America and Wells Fargo are on appeal in the 9th Circuit after Wright dismissed them earlier this year.

733,"   By Dena Aubin | NEW YORK, Sept 3  NEW YORK, Sept 3 Los Angeles has dropped a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, of discriminatory mortgage lending, ending the first of the city's four lawsuits accusing major banks of driving up foreclosures among minority borrowers.Disclosed in a filing on Tuesday in a California federal court, the agreement ends a lawsuit attempting to hold the bank liable for lost property tax revenues caused by falling home values and the cost of repairing blight in minority neighborhoods hit by foreclosures.A hangover from the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the lawsuit and others like it were brought by a handful of local governments claiming damages for economic destruction wrought nationwide by foreclosures, lost taxes and neighborhood blight. The legal actions have brought only mixed results as banks strongly contested claims that they discriminated.Los Angeles is still pursuing similar complaints against Bank of America <BAC.N >, Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc.JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said the bank was pleased with the city's decision. ""We have consistently supported the Los Angeles community"" and helped thousands of families get into homes they can afford, he said.A spokesman for the city was not immediately available.Filed last year in U.S. District Court in Central California, the lawsuit accused JPMorgan of engaging in mortgage discrimination since 2004. The complaint said the bank practiced ""red-lining,"" or the denial of credit to minority borrowers, and then ""reverse red-lining,"" or targeting minorities for costly subprime loans they could not afford.In court filings, JPMorgan denied that it discriminated against minority borrowers. It said Los Angeles was trying to make the bank responsible for lending by Washington Mutual, which JPMorgan acquired in 2008 during the financial crisis. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright dismissed the lawsuit last year, agreeing that under U.S. law, the city could not sue in federal court before exhausting claims involving Washington Mutual at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

But on Monday the LME said in a members' notice that JP Morgan Securities would change as of Tuesday from Category 1 to Category 2 membership, which allows electronic and telephone trading, but not ring dealing.JP Morgan said it left the ring because client preferences had shifted. “We’ve given this a lot of thought with the strong tradition and history involved,” Michael Camacho, head of commodities at JP Morgan, said. “A very high percentage of our LME contract volumes are now traded electronically ...

742,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By David HenryNEW YORK, Sept 8 JPMorgan Chase & Co. is cutting prices for a group of its credit card customers and getting Visa Inc to shoulder at least some of the burden of the lost revenue, underscoring how the largest U.S. bank's size can help it hang onto business in fiercely competitive markets.At stake are the billions of dollars that banks receive annually from consumer use of a credit card to pay a retailer. Chase, which generated roughly $3.6 billion of revenue last year from those fees, is increasingly occupied with fending off banking rivals like Citigroup Inc, as well as Silicon Valley companies such as Paypal Inc and Square Inc.Chase's revenue from those fees is showing signs of eroding. In the first half of 2015, fee income in the bank's credit and debit card business fell 2 percent from the same period a year earlier, even as the bank processed a higher volume of transactions. A person familiar with the matter said lower processing fees were a critical part of that decline.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon pledged in an April letter to shareholders ""to be very aggressive in growing this business."" At a conference with securities analysts in February, he cited the credit card operation as an example of how JPMorgan has to cut prices and upgrade products to keep from falling behind competitors.""In a capitalist world,"" Dimon said, ""you've got to be giving the client more, better, faster, quicker, or you lose.""Credit card fees generated about 4 percent of the bank's revenue in 2014, but analysts said that much of that money has historically fallen to the bottom line, making it a critical support for the bank's $22 billion of annual profits.To stem the decline, Chase is assembling a vast array of parts into what will become either a brilliant machine or a makeshift disappointment. A key part of the strategy came in 2013, when Chase inked a deal with Visa that allowed the bank to essentially lease Visa's network for 10 years at what industry sources said is a fixed rate.There are some signs that the Visa deal is starting to pay off for Chase. This year, the bank won the right to process credit card transactions for customers of Marriott International at some 3,700 hotels in the U.S. and Canada and for Chevron USA at nearly 8,000 gas stations.Steve Mott, an independent payments consultant said, ""Fizzle was the watchword until they got the Chevron deal.""Some wonder if the bank is wasting its time. ""So far, there is no evidence that it has mattered in a way that changes market share,"" said veteran card company analyst Craig Maurer of Autonomous Research.BRAINCHILD Chase's efforts are the brainchild of Gordon Smith, the head of JPMorgan's consumer business, who joined Chase in 2007 after 26 years at American Express. He is trying to recreate large parts of American Express inside of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets.An American Express spokeswoman declined to comment.To imitate American Express, Smith needed a few components. When a consumer pays for a sweater at a department store with a credit card, three parties usually get involved: money moves from the bank that issues the consumer's credit card through a network like Visa or MasterCard to the bank that processes transactions for the retailer. Each of those three, the two banks and the network, collects a fee for its role. American Express usually occupies all three links of the chain. But Chase, without borrowing Visa's network, was only able to be two of the three: the bank for retailers and the bank that issued the credit card to the consumer.The deal that Chase signed with Visa allows the bank to essentially serve as all three links, which in the near term gives it more leeway to cut costs.Longer term, the deal with Visa will allow Chase to corral more information about what its customers are up to, said Mike Passilla, the Chase executive running this effort, in an interview.When a retailer uses Chase to process its credit card transactions, it can now sign up for a service known as ChaseNet, which means that when a consumer buys something with a credit card issued by Chase, the bank will process the transaction from start to finish, essentially serving as all three links in the chain. When that happens, Chase can charge the retailers lower fees for processing partly because of terms it negotiated with Visa, although the details of how much lower the charges can be have not been disclosed.Consumers may never know that ChaseNet exists. Their cards feature a Visa brand, and they can use them wherever Visa cards are accepted.ChaseNet works only when Chase is both the consumer's bank and the retailer's bank. That could happen fairly often, because Chase is second only to American Express among U.S. issuers in spending on cards, with market share of 19.4 percent last year, according to the Nilson Report. Chase is the biggest U.S. card issuer by outstanding balances, according to Nilson.Having the chance to cut fees for retailers is important now because many merchants are pressing on every front for lower processing costs. Retailers have won court cases against card companies over pricing in recent years. Mark Horwedel, CEO of the Merchants Advisory Group, said merchants expect more concessions because they have seen regulators in Europe move to cap fees on credit cards at about 15 percent of U.S. levels.Costco Wholesale Corp is widely believed to have chiseled lower fees out of Citigroup and Visa when it decided to stop using American Express as its transaction processing bank, and to stop putting its brand on American Express cards. Costco declined to comment on the specific terms of its agreement with Citi and Visa.Neither Visa, nor Chase, which is the biggest issuer of its cards, have disclosed the terms of their deal, but payments experts believe both sides had reasons to sign on the dotted line.For Visa, it was the chance to lock in 10 years of business from the biggest issuer on their network, without the fear of their fleeing for rival MasterCard Inc.For Chase, the deal gives it the chance to run as much additional volume over the network as it can gather for no extra cost, which gives it more leeway to cut rates to retailers, two people in the industry said.The bank's sales pitch has worked on at least some companies.Michael Cullen, a finance executive for Marriott International, said that Chase's deal with his hotel company will yield ""significant"" cost savings. He added that the bank's history of investments in its credit card business gives him confidence that Chase will keep up with technology and customer demand for advanced payment devices and spending information.""Payment processing is such an important part of the business,"" Cullen said.

But Chase, without borrowing Visa's network, was only able to be two of the three: the bank for retailers and the bank that issued the credit card to the consumer.The deal that Chase signed with Visa allows the bank to essentially serve as all three links, which in the near term gives it more leeway to cut costs.Longer term, the deal with Visa will allow Chase to corral more information about what its customers are up to, said Mike Passilla, the Chase executive running this effort, in an interview.When a retailer uses Chase to process its credit card transactions, it can now sign up for a service known as ChaseNet, which means that when a consumer buys something with a credit card issued by Chase, the bank will process the transaction from start to finish, essentially serving as all three links in the chain. When that happens, Chase can charge the retailers lower fees for processing partly because of terms it negotiated with Visa, although the details of how much lower the charges can be have not been disclosed.Consumers may never know that ChaseNet exists. Their cards feature a Visa brand, and they can use them wherever Visa cards are accepted.ChaseNet works only when Chase is both the consumer's bank and the retailer's bank. That could happen fairly often, because Chase is second only to American Express among U.S. issuers in spending on cards, with market share of 19.4 percent last year, according to the Nilson Report. Chase is the biggest U.S. card issuer by outstanding balances, according to Nilson.Having the chance to cut fees for retailers is important now because many merchants are pressing on every front for lower processing costs. Retailers have won court cases against card companies over pricing in recent years. Mark Horwedel, CEO of the Merchants Advisory Group, said merchants expect more concessions because they have seen regulators in Europe move to cap fees on credit cards at about 15 percent of U.S. levels.Costco Wholesale Corp is widely believed to have chiseled lower fees out of Citigroup and Visa when it decided to stop using American Express as its transaction processing bank, and to stop putting its brand on American Express cards. Costco declined to comment on the specific terms of its agreement with Citi and Visa.Neither Visa, nor Chase, which is the biggest issuer of its cards, have disclosed the terms of their deal, but payments experts believe both sides had reasons to sign on the dotted line.For Visa, it was the chance to lock in 10 years of business from the biggest issuer on their network, without the fear of their fleeing for rival MasterCard Inc.For Chase, the deal gives it the chance to run as much additional volume over the network as it can gather for no extra cost, which gives it more leeway to cut rates to retailers, two people in the industry said.The bank's sales pitch has worked on at least some companies.Michael Cullen, a finance executive for Marriott International, said that Chase's deal with his hotel company will yield ""significant"" cost savings. He added that the bank's history of investments in its credit card business gives him confidence that Chase will keep up with technology and customer demand for advanced payment devices and spending information.""Payment processing is such an important part of the business,"" Cullen said. ""You're going to go with the provider that has the technology and the customer base and is investing.""

745,"  * JP Morgan evicts Nigeria from key emerging market bonds index* Move comes amid policy vacuum, decline in stocks* President has not named cabinet since taking office in May* Index expulsion forces fund managers to sell bonds   (Adds sovereign wealth fund comments)By Chijioke Ohuocha and Felix OnuahLAGOS/ABUJA, Sept 9 Nigeria's stocks fell on Wednesday after JP Morgan said it would eject Africa's biggest economy from its influential emerging markets bond index due to tough controls imposed to prevent a currency collapse.In a move that came earlier in the year than expected, JP Morgan said late on Tuesday it would remove the bond listings belonging to the West African nation by the end of October, forcing fund managers to sell Nigerian bonds, which might raise the country's borrowing costs.The decision is a blow for President Muhammadu Buhari, who has promised to diversify an oil-dependent economy hit by a slump in global crude prices but who faces criticism for not having appointed a cabinet since his inauguration on May 29.With no finance minister in place, foreign investors have been left wondering about government policies and struggling to sell shares or bonds as the central bank adopted tough currency restrictions to halt a slide in the value of the naira.Anders Faergemann, senior sovereign portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, said he was surprised that Buhari had not started tackling Nigeria's economic problems more than three months into his tenure.""As an investor it is flabbergasting that the Nigerian authorities have allowed themselves to be put in this situation,"" he said.All Nigerian stocks listed in the MSCI frontier market index fell by more than 3 percent, while bond yields spiked across maturities. The stock market, which has the second-biggest weighting after Kuwait on the MSCI frontier market index, recovered some ground from earlier falls but still closed down 2.99 percent on Wednesday.While many foreign bonds investors have exited the market since JP Morgan warned Nigeria in January and again in June that it would get kicked out of the index unless conditions improved, stocks investors were now also pondering whether to stay.The U.S. bank had placed Nigeria on its index watch but a decision had not been expected until later this year.""You can only imagine the chaos that is unfolding here,"" a regional African investment analyst said from Lagos, asking not to be named.""There are many more investors still in equities who are keenly watching how the central bank manages the exit process because if they even sniff the possibility that they won't be able to get dollars in the future they are going to run for the door,"" he said.The benchmark 2024 bond yield rose to 17 percent on Wednesday from 16.20 percent the previous day. Nigeria's hard currency-denominated sovereign debt nudged lower across the curve, shedding around 0.2 cents, while prices of corporate dollar-debt issued by banks gained across the sector.Diamond Bank's 2019 dollar-issue   gained 1.01 cents to trade at 90.510 cents in the dollar.Nigeria's central bank has adopted several currency restrictions to defend the naira after the use of dollar reserves failed to halt a slide.Traders told Reuters the central bank started rationing dollars to foreign investors last week.NO CABINET  The naira has lost around 15 percent in the last year, with devaluations in November and February. Some have predicted another may be coming, but central bank governor Godwin Emefiele said in July that the currency was ""appropriately priced"".Currency forwards, a derivative product used to hedge against future exchange rate moves, reflected expectations of a weaker naira with the 1-year non-deliverable forwards  on Nigeria's currency rising 2.79 percent to 268.50""The basic story is very clear the currency is too expensive ... The question now is, does the central bank devalue the currency to respond or tighten down even more on other capital measures to try and prolong the inevitable,"" said Arko Sen, director EMEA strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Buhari has said he found the treasury ""virtually empty"", forcing him to deal with inherited problems, along with the impact of falling oil prices on Africa's top crude producer, which relies on sales for 70 percent of government revenues.But investors and business leaders say the lack of a finance minister, and general uncertainty around the cabinet which Buhari has said will be appointed later this month, has resulted in a lack of clear policies that has hurt the economy.JP Morgan had warned Nigeria that to stay in the index, it would have to restore liquidity to its currency market in a way that allowed foreign investors tracking the index to conduct transactions with minimal hurdles.On Wednesday, Buhari's spokesman Femi Adesina declined to comment on JP Morgan's decision beyond a government statement issued late on Tuesday saying liquidity for financial markets was improving.In an indication of the dire state of public finances, the head of Nigeria's sovereign wealth fund said authorities had not made any payments to the fund this year.The last contribution to the fund, worth $1 billion, came from the previous government in 2014, said Uche Orji, Chief Executive of the Nigeria Investment Authority, which rolls out infrastructure projects and serves as a future generation fund.""We haven't got additional funds from the government but the fund is structured in a way that it can go through hard times,"" he told reporters in Abuja after meeting Buhari.

JP Morgan late on Tuesday said it will remove Nigeria from its Government Bond Index (GBI-EM) by the end of October, after warning the government of Africa's biggest economy that currency controls were making transactions too complicated.

He faces criticism for not appointing a cabinet since his inauguration on May 29. With no government in place, equity and bond investors have been wondering the direction of about policy after the central bank imposed tough currency controls to halt the naira's slide.Traders said the FMDQ, a regulator comprising Nigeria's main commercial banks and the central bank, widened the bid-ask  spreads on bond trading to 1 naira from 0.30 naira to contain volatility, helping to moderate a debt market sell-off.""Without it, the market would have frozen and there would have been no offer for quotes. We've done the best thing in terms of risk management,"" Bola Onadele, FMDQ's managing director, told Reuters.The yield on Nigeria's benchmark 2024 bond eased to 16.63 percent on Thursday from the previous day's close of 16.68 percent. It had spiked to 17 percent on Wednesday after JP Morgan's announcement. Stock market investors joined the sell-off, worrying that Nigeria might also be evicted from the MSCI frontier index and dollar shortages would make it hard to exit the market.""Sooner or later, equity investors will wonder whether this could also lead to action by MSCI,"" Renaissance Capital said in a note.Nigerian stocks were among the worst performers on the MSCI frontier market index for a second day.FBN Holdings fell the most, dropping 4.98 percent. Access Bank fell 4.9 percent, Union Bank of Nigeria  4.24 percent and United Bank for Africa 4.11 percent. CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENS DOLLAR FLOWS In another attempt to reduce naira speculation, the central bank reduced the time limit for funding currency purchases to 24 hours from 48 hours to stem the surge in demand for dollars, dealers said.Ayodeji Ebo, head of research at Afrinvest, said that investors were increasingly concerned over whether the $31.5 billion in foreign reserves was enough to allow the bank to meet rising dollar demand.""The central bank's ability to defend the naira may be hampered, hence a devaluation may be inevitable. Foreign investors exposed to Nigerian equities will prefer to exit positions ahead of any official devaluation,"" Ebo of Afrinvest said.The stock market, which has the second-biggest weighting after Kuwait on the MSCI frontier market index, was down 1.87 percent in early trade but recovered to a slight gain of 0.06 percent by the close.Analysts estimate foreign holdings of Nigerian bonds at less than $2.75 billion compared with about $8 billion in September last year, said Samir Gadio, head of Africa strategy at Standard Chartered Bank in London.

758,"   By Arno Schuetze | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Swiss agricultural chemicals group Syngenta SYNN.VX is about to launch the sale of its vegetable seeds business as it seeks to raise money for a share buyback, according to sources familiar with the matter.The company, whose main business is making pesticides, is under pressure to offer tangible rewards to shareholders after it turned its back on a $47 billion bid from Monsanto (MON.N). It said this month it plans to buy back more than $2 billion worth of stock to boost investor returns. It has asked JP Morgan (JPM.N) to organize the sale of the vegetable seeds business and it could fetch around $2 billion, the sources said. The unit had sales of $663 million last year, representing about 4 percent of group sales.Information packages on the unit, which includes a strong tomato-seeds business, are expected to be sent to prospective buyers as early as this month and tentative bids are likely to be due before Christmas, they added.Syngenta and JP Morgan declined to comment.The vegetable seeds business is likely to appeal to other large agricultural chemicals groups, some of who may however shy away due to antitrust concerns, the sources said.  Smaller players seeking to expand their product range may also bid, they added.In the seeds business, Syngenta competes with big groups like DuPont (DD.N), Dow (DOW.N), Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Monsanto.

Some smaller firms may tie up for a potential bid, due to the size of the asset, one of the sources said.  KWS and Limagrain have partnered in the past, merging their North American corn seeds businesses in 2000 to form the third-largest player in corn seeds in the United States, AgReliant.KWS, a supplier of conventionally bred seeds, said in June that it would look at vegetable seed assets if they were put for sale by Syngenta or Monsanto.While the vegetable seeds unit represents a relatively small proportion of Syngenta's revenue, it is the most profitable of its seeds businesses. It has gross profit margins of well above 60 percent compared with about 45 percent for all seeds last year. But the need to raise cash for the share buyback has persuaded Syngenta to part with it, according to the sources.Valuation multiples in vegetable seeds are ""quite easily"" in the 3-6 times sales range, Syngenta's finance chief said earlier this month, although industry bankers said the business was more likely to fetch a multiple of around 3. Syngenta has not released a figure for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the business. But bankers said they estimate it having a margin of roughly 20 percent - which would imply an annual EBITDA of around $130 million. ""I can imagine the unit fetching a multiple of more than 15 (times EBITDA) in a sale,"" one of the sources said.

759,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON, Sept 17  BOSTON, Sept 17 There will be no champagne corks popping in the $2.7 trillion U.S. money-market fund industry.The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday, meaning investors will continue to receive next-to-nothing yields on their money funds. And money-fund providers that have slashed fees to provide those paltry yields will have to wait to recapture billions of dollars of lost annual revenue.An interest rate increase would have boosted money fund yields while allowing money fund providers such as Fidelity Investments, JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc, BlackRock Inc  and Federated Investors Inc to boost fees. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the industry has waived more than $30 billion in fees so investors can have a few basis points of annual yield.Money market funds, used by corporate treasurers and individual savers to park spare cash, are meant to offer a higher return than an instant access bank account. Analysts at Moody's estimate money-fund providers could recover $5 billion of foregone revenue when the yields produced by their portfolios increase by 22 basis points. As those money-fund revenues rise, funds will use that money to reduce waivers and then to increase investor yields.In the immediate aftermath of a Fed increase, prime money market fund managers who cater to big institutional investors could pull an estimated $50 billion or more immediately from U.S. money market funds to get an instant advantage in commercial paper and other securities that price overnight. Prime institutional funds had $986 billion in assets as of Sept. 15th.""This will allow the funds to re-invest at the new higher rate faster,"" said Rory Callagy, an analyst at Moody's. But that cash is expected to flow back into money market funds as their securities reprice.""Higher rates are poised to be incorporated in fund yields quicker than in the past,"" said Mike Krasner, managing editor of iMoneyNet, a money fund research firm. That is because the maximum weighted average maturity for money funds, a measure of  interest rate sensitivity, is now 60 days compared with the previous 90 days.Prime money market fund managers have already moved aggressively to position themselves for an increase in short-term rates. Their investments in assets that price overnight have reached the highest level in years, according to Moody's. About 40 percent of prime money fund assets are invested in overnight securities, up from about 30 percent six months ago, Moody's said.

763,"  (Adds detail on vote, comments from major investor, background about Federal Reserve)By Ross Kerber and Dan FreedBOSTON/NEW YORK, Sept 22 Bank of America Corp  shareholders voted to allow Chief Executive Brian Moynihan to remain as chairman, handing a victory to a CEO who has been slowly turning the bank around since the financial crisis.A group of shareholders, mainly public pension plans, had campaigned to strip Moynihan of his chairman title, arguing that the CEO needed more oversight from an independent overseer on the board. They were upset that the bank had unilaterally changed its bylaws last year to allow Moynihan to hold both roles, after investors had voted in 2009 to separate them.But mutual funds and institutional investors, which are among the bank's top shareholders, largely did not support the campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the vote. These investors tend to prefer talking directly to management about governance matters, instead of agitating externally.One of those investors, State Street Global Advisors, told Reuters that it wanted to allow Bank of America's board ""the flexibility to choose their own leadership structure.""The more vocal investors that campaigned for change, including California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, held smaller stakes.They managed to rally 37 percent of votes cast, a sizeable minority that is larger than average for such votes.""Shareholders sent a message to the board that they are not happy,"" said Mike Mayo, a veteran banking analyst at CLSA Americas.Jack Bovender, the bank's lead independent director, acknowledged investor discontent, and promised to do a better job reaching out to investors. The meeting to discuss Moynihan's fate was held in a sparsely filled auditorium in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina and lasted for less than 20 minutes.The bank's shares fell 1.1 percent, performing better than the KBW bank stock index, which fell 1.5 percent.MIXED TRACK RECORD Moynihan's record at Bank of America, the second biggest U.S. bank by assets, has been mixed. He has cleaned up most of its crisis era mistakes, paying more than $70 billion to settle lawsuits and other claims. He has slashed costs during his nearly six years as CEO.But the bank's shares and profits this year have underperformed those of rivals. It will be hard for Bank of America and other U.S. banks to boost profits much more than they have as long as the Federal Reserve refrains from boosting interest rates. Its next policy meeting is in October. Moynihan was also tripped up by the Fed in March, when the central bank said Bank of America does not do enough to evaluate how it might suffer during times of market stress. The Fed asked the bank to resubmit its plan for paying dividends and buying back shares by the end of September.Analysts believe the Fed's comments played a role in the bank's decision in July to replace its chief financial officer.AN UPHILL BATTLE  Shareholder attempts to strip CEOs of their chairman titles typically fail, garnering an average of 31 percent of votes, according to the ISS Voting Analytics database.The 63 percent of votes favoring the bank is in line with the voting when JPMorgan Chase & Co shareholders sought to strip CEO Jamie Dimon of his chairman title. Dimon won 60 percent of votes in 2012 and 68 percent the next year.But even if shareholders accept having one person as chairman and CEO, more company boards are opting to separate those roles. Twenty-eight percent of the boards of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index had independent chairmen in 2014, up from 9 percent in 2004, according to a report from executive search firm Spencer Stuart. (See graphic: reut.rs/1OOfhxK)Many of Bank of America's difficulties stem from decisions made by Moynihan's predecessor, Ken Lewis.His ill-timed acquisitions, including buying subprime mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp at the height of the housing crisis, forced the bank to seek at least two government rescues. Lewis's mistakes spurred investors to successfully strip his chairman title in a vote at the bank's 2009 annual meeting.The bank initially did not respond to investor complaints about making Moynihan chairman, but days before its 2015 annual meeting, Bank of America said it would allow investors to vote on the matter sometime over the next year.Signaling their discontent at Bank of America's annual meeting on May 6, various mainstream mutual funds cast unusual votes ""against"" directors on the bank's corporate governance committee, recent securities filings show. These include American Funds' Growth Fund of America and some index funds sponsored by Fidelity Investments.Technically, Bank of America investors voted on whether to approve bylaw changes the bank made last year to give Moynihan the chairman title when previous chair Charles Holliday stepped down.(Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston, Dan Freed in New York, Greg Lacour in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chuck Mikolajczak in New York; Writing by Daniel Wilchins in New York; Editing by Alan Crosby and Richard Chang)",2015-09-22,JPM,"Tue Sep 22, 2015 | 4:42pm EDT",UPDATE 4-B of A shareholders allow CEO Moynihan to remain chairman,http://www.reuters.com//article/bankofamerica-vote-idUSL1N11S11W20150922?type=companyNews

770,"   By Chijioke Ohuocha | LAGOS, Sept 29  LAGOS, Sept 29 Half the Nigerian bonds listed on JP Morgan's emerging markets bond index (GBI-EM) will be removed on Wednesday and the rest next month, the U.S. bank said on Tuesday.The decision, which means investment funds tracking the index will sell Nigerian bonds, adds to upward pressure on national borrowing costs from a sharp drop in oil revenues.JP Morgan said this month it would drop Africa's largest economy from its index, citing a lack of liquidity and currency restrictions.The bank said in a note 50 percent of bonds will be removed as of Sept. 30, part of its month-end index rebalancing, cutting Nigeria's weight to 0.79 percent. The weight of Brazil and South Africa will increase by 0.80 percent and 0.20 percent respectively. In 2012, Nigeria became the second African country after South Africa to be listed in the index with a weight of 1.8 percent.The estimated yield for Nigeria bonds on the index was quoted at 14.83 percent as of Sept. 25, marking the second highest yield after Brazil at 15.75 percent, the bank said. Analysts said they expected bond yields to trade flat after the removal on Wednesday because domestic buyers have stepped in since foreigners left the market.Yields on government bond spiked this month on the news of the index removal with the 10-year benchmark debt rising to as much as 16.68 percent, prompting the bond market regulator to widen spreads to calm volatility. One European asset manager told Reuters in Lagos his fund was still interested in naira debt despite the index expulsion but would buy only if the yield rose to around 20 percent, to compensate for currency risk.Nigeria's central bank, trying to stop the naira's slide, has pegged its rate against the dollar, turning inter-bank trading into a one-way quote market whose lack of transparency has upset investors.JP Morgan said Nigeria would not be eligible for re-inclusion in the index for a minimum of 12 months.

JP Morgan removed half of Nigerian bonds listed on its emerging markets bond index (GBI-EM), as part of its month-end index rebalancing, cutting the West African country's weight to 0.79 percent. The U.S. bank had warned Nigeria this month that it would drop it from its index, citing a lack of liquidity and currency restrictions.Traders said bond yields were muted on Wednesday as foreign buyers had cut their exposure to 0.69 percent ahead of the index expulsion. The 2024 bond to be issued from October will pay a coupon of 14.20 percent while the 2020 paper will pay 15.54 percent.The central bank on Wednesday said the banking system had enough liquidity to take up what foreign investors might sell after JP Morgan removed Nigeria from its bond index.

772,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 29  NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 29 Mergers and acquisitions globally exceeded $1 trillion in value in the third quarter of 2015, the third highest on record, as a stock market plunge and more expensive debt financing did not prevent big companies from going ahead with their dream deals.Concerns about an economic slowdown in China, plummeting energy and commodity prices, and the prospect of potentially higher interest rates have all fueled market volatility which, if sustained, could weigh on dealmakers' confidence.Yet the dealmaking frenzy has not abated. Just this week, pipeline giant Energy Transfer Equity LP clinched a stock-and-cash deal to acquire rival Williams Companies Inc  for $37.7 billion, including the assumption of debt.""The key trends that have been driving M&A - global scale, synergies, low financing costs, strong balance sheets - continue to be there, and I think they will continue to drive M&A activity into 2016,"" said Larry Hamdan, head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas at Barclays Plc.While the number of deals around the world dropped to 8,989 in the third quarter from 10,614 a year ago, their volume totaled $1.02 trillion, up 11 percent year-on-year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Only two quarters, the second quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2007, have recorded higher volumes, at $1.29 trillion and $1.41 trillion, respectively.The year-on-year rise in transaction volumes was due to big deals. Among them was Allergan Plc's acquisition of Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd's generic drug business for $40.5 billion, Berkshire Hathaway Inc's purchase of aerospace equipment maker Precision Castparts Corp for $37.2 billion, and ACE Ltd's acquisition of property and casualty insurer Chubb Corp for $28.3 billion.A key difference with previous quarters has been the cooler reception of some deals by stock market investors. Shares of acquirers are no longer rising indiscriminately on the day their deals are announced. When Energy Transfer announced its deal on Monday, for example, it its shares dropped 12.7 percent. ""Investors tend to be more supportive of well thought out transformational deals, and expect management teams and boards to have done their homework before coming to market with large-scale acquisitions,"" said Dag Skattum, vice chairman for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at JPMorgan Chase & Co .As a result, acquirers became more cautious in the quarter about upsetting their investors with a potentially pricey deal.For example, business research provider IHS Inc said on Tuesday it would not pursue an acquisition of software maker Solera Holdings Inc, four days after Reuters reported that IHS was working with investment banks to submit a bid. IHS was phased by a 5.8 percent drop in its share price following the Reuters report, as well as pricier debt markets, according to the sources. Dealmaking has remained brisk across all sectors of the economy. Despite the tumult in energy prices, M&A activity in the energy sector has accounted for 15 percent of overall dealmaking year to date, followed by healthcare with 14 percent and technology with 10 percent. M&A advisory fees for investment bankers have increased 9 percent year-to-date to $18.2 billion.Dealmaking was up year-on-year across all regions, with M&A in the Americas reaching $618.3 billion, the highest since the second quarter of 2007, when it reached $687.8 billion.SEEKING GROWTH  Some dealmakers argued that some of the economic headwinds could in fact provide a boost to deals. A slowdown in emerging market economies, for example, is driving some companies to seek growth in the United States through acquisitions.""China's economic slowdown is not curbing enthusiasm for dealmaking, quite the contrary. It pushes people to do deals to offset subdued growth,"" said Severin Brizay, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at UBS AG.A drop in the value of the shares of companies could also be a catalyst for M&A if it helps narrow valuation expectations between sellers and buyers.""I think if the stock market declines a little bit, this could enhance M&A deal volumes. It could cause some people to get off the sidelines as their prized asset becomes more attractive from a valuation perspective,"" said Robin Rankin, co-head of global M&A at Credit Suisse Group AG.To be sure, the market volatility could, if protracted, weigh on the confidence of company chief executives, reducing their appetite to take risks with M&A. It could also reduce the number of mega deals that have dominated the M&A landscape this year.""The number of stock-for-stock deals as a percentage of all M&A deals will likely decline somewhat as a result of the market volatility, and we are likely to see fewer mega deals overall as well because these have a significant stock component,"" said George Casey, head of Shearman & Sterling LLP's global M&A group.

Both funds ended last month with $568 million and $124 million, respectively, in assets under management.Gávea, which was founded by former Brazilian central bank president Arminio Fraga in 2003, cut risk exposure last month. Value at risk, a widely followed gauge that measures the maximum amount an investor can lose in a trading session, fell to 0.6 percent of capital for Gávea Fund and 0.9 percent for Gávea Fund Plus, from 1 percent and 1.5 percent in August, respectively. Their performance highlights Fraga's successful bet on a slump in Brazil's currency, which is grappling with the impact of a swelling budget deficit, rapidly eroding political support for President Dilma Rousseff and fallout from slowing growth in China. Last month, the real hit a 13-year low while Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index traded near the lowest levels in eight years, when measured in dollars.""Within this context, market expectations continue to deteriorate and should lead to further growth contraction and rising unemployment"" in Brazil, the letter said. Gávea's funds kept so-called short positions - or bets on price declines - in Brazil currency and equity markets.In the first nine months, Gávea Fund and Gávea Fund Plus returned their investors 12.32 percent and 20.02 percent in dollars, outpacing key rivals.  The HFRX Macro/CTA Index, which tracks hedge funds using a similar strategy as that of Gávea, is down 1.79 percent through Oct. 2. The index shed 0.55 percent in September.In July, Fraga and his partners agreed to repurchase Gávea from JPMorgan Chase & Co, to focus on private equity and hedge fund investments. A JPMorgan Asset Management affiliate kept Gávea's real estate and equity businesses under terms of the deal. At the end of July, Gávea had $5.1 billion in assets.

Value at risk, a widely followed gauge that measures the maximum amount an investor can lose in a trading session, fell to 0.6 percent of capital for Gávea Fund and 0.9 percent for Gávea Fund Plus, from 1 percent and 1.5 percent in August, respectively.Their performance highlights Fraga's successful bet on a slump in Brazil's currency, which is grappling with the impact of a swelling budget deficit, rapidly eroding political support for President Dilma Rousseff and fallout from slowing growth in China. Last month, the real hit a 13-year low while Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index traded near the lowest levels in eight years, when measured in dollars.""Within this context, market expectations continue to deteriorate and should lead to further growth contraction and rising unemployment"" in Brazil, the letter said. Gávea's funds kept so-called short positions - or bets on price declines - in Brazil currency and equity markets. In the first nine months, Gávea Fund and Gávea Fund Plus returned their investors 12.32 percent and 20.02 percent in dollars, outpacing key rivals.The HFRX Macro/CTA Index, which tracks hedge funds using a similar strategy as that of Gávea, is down 1.79 percent through Oct. 2. The index shed 0.55 percent in September. In July, Fraga and his partners agreed to repurchase Gávea from JPMorgan Chase & Co, to focus on private equity and hedge fund investments. A JPMorgan Asset Management affiliate kept Gávea's real estate and equity businesses under terms of the deal.At the end of July, Gávea had $5.1 billion in assets. Gávea officials could not be immediately reached for comment.Both funds are within the so-called macro fund class, in which fund managers bet on macroeconomic trends using a variety of security types.

785,"   By Olivia Oran and Dan Wilchins | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 6 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are winning back the trading business of hedge fund clients that they lost to European rivals during the financial crisis, as new capital rules spur banks like Deutsche Bank to scale down their businesses.The two U.S. banks together now have about 37 percent of the market for trading with hedge funds and financing positions, known as ""prime brokerage,"" up about 6 percentage points from the end of last year, according to research firm Preqin.The market share gains are fueling stock trading profits at JPMorgan Chase & Co. as well as at Goldman and Morgan Stanley, and could be a bright spot when the companies post results later this month.Prime brokerage is one of the few areas on Wall Street where revenue and prices are rising, even though competition is receding, executives in the business and analysts told Reuters.""With the foreign banks backing away, it's become a greener pasture for some of the U.S. prime businesses,"" said Larry Tabb, founder of financial markets advisory firm Tabb Group.It's a business which the U.S. banks are marketing aggressively. Steve Boyd, founder of hedge fund Armistice Capital, originally used just Zurich-based UBS AG as a prime broker when he started the fund in 2012. Last year, a Morgan Stanley representative told him the bank wanted his business.""We weren't even looking for a second prime yet,"" Boyd said. ""They told us they were interested in investing in a relationship with us, and didn't just want to work with us when it was highly profitable for them."" Armistice ended up giving some of its business to Morgan Stanley.European banks are falling behind because of new global rules, known as Basel III, designed to make banks safer. Those rules limit the amount of debt that banks can take on to fund their assets, and specify the minimum amount of equity, or capital, that banks must use.Prime brokerage for stocks, bonds, and related derivatives demands high amounts of capital, by one measure, forcing Europeans banks that are close to the lower limits of capital to scale down their businesses. Preqin data show that since 2013, Deutsche Bank's market share has fallen by a percentage point to 7 percent, with the losses happening mainly in 2014. Credit Suisse's new chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, is planning to slash its prime brokerage business, according to a Swiss newspaper report in September. [ID: nL5N11J06U] In April, Credit Suisse's co-head of investment banking, Tim O'Hara, had said the bank is fully committed to the business.Both Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are in the middle of global strategic reviews, spokeswomen for the banks separately said.The gains at the U.S. banks underscore how being faster to comply with new rules can result in greater revenue gains.Analysts said that even if the prime brokerage business itself is often low margin, it can be a crucial source of stock trading revenue. Coalition estimates that prime brokerage accounted for 35 percent of all equities revenue in 2014, up from 31 percent the year before and 25 percent in 2009.  Morgan Stanley, for example, posted an 28 percent increase in stock trading revenue in the second quarter thanks in part to equity prime brokerage.For Goldman Sachs, stock trading revenue rose 63 percent in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, also helped by prime brokerage. Goldman chief financial officer Harvey Schwartz said that the bank has been benefiting from higher pricing, though it was not the primary driver of performance. For the ten biggest global investment and universal banks, prime brokerage revenue in 2014 grew to about $14.2 billion, according to research firm Coalition, up 11 percent from the year before.A REVERSAL U.S. banks have been able to boost revenue in part by raising prices. One prime brokerage executive at a European bank estimated that financing a stock trade could be as much as five times more expensive than it had been. Many executives across Wall Street stressed that without charging more, the business cannot be profitable for them anymore, because prime brokerage demands so much capital. Prices for services can vary widely even from one customer to another at the same bank, depending on such things as how big the fund is and how much business it does with the bank.Many banks are pressing customers to either do more trading with them or find a new prime broker. For hedge funds, that is translating to more of them working with fewer prime brokers: in 2012, 54.6 percent of newly launched hedge funds worked with one prime broker. In 2015, that figure had risen to 71.2 percent, according to industry data tracker Eurekahedge. [ID: nL5N10W0YC] A rebound in the hedge fund industry has also helped to boost prime brokerage revenue for the banking industry. Total global hedge fund capital rose for the 11th consecutive quarter during the second quarter to $2.97 trillion.In 2008 during the crisis, hedge fund capital fell to as low as $1.4 trillion. Those were dark times for banks globally, particularly in the United States. After JPMorgan rescued Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers started wobbling and ultimately failed, hedge funds began pulling money out of U.S. banks.Preqin's data does not go back to before the financial crisis, but Global Custodian magazine said 44 percent of hedge funds reduced balances with Goldman Sachs and 70 percent pulled back from Morgan Stanley.Some customers turned to banks perceived as having the explicit backing of their home governments, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, and those viewed as having strong credit like JPMorgan.European banks are suffering because of Basel III capital rules known as ""leverage rules"" that don't give banks a break for having less risky assets. In prime brokerage businesses, banks finance customers' trades, which tend to be relatively low-risk loans. But the size of the positions can be relatively large, forcing banks to use high amounts of capital to fund the assets.The Basel III global leverage rules are expected to be finalized next year. The current preliminary Basel minimum is 3 percent, a figure that is expected to be higher for the final rules that become mandatory in the beginning of 2018.  The U.S. set its own rules last year that are more severe than the expected global minimum requirements. U.S. banks have built capital to meet those rules, and now have more than enough, allowing them to take more risk, executives said.Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which both must have a 5 percent minimum leverage ratio for their holding companies under U.S. rules, have a 9.6 percent and 7.9 percent ratio, respectively, according to regulatory filings as of June 30.  Other jurisdictions are requiring levels above the Basel minimums too-Swiss banks are required to have at least a 6 percent leverage ratio.Individual nations' may calculate leverage differently from one another and from the Basel Committee of global banking supervisors, which sets the Basel capital rules. Under those rules, Credit Suisse has a 3.7 percent ratio, but under Swiss rules, it has a 4.3 ratio, meaning it will have to build capital. Deutsche Bank's leverage ratio is 3.6 percent under Basel rules.(Reporting by Olivia Oran and Dan Wilchins in New York.

786,"  * Kogas, JERA freeze long-term purchases-note* Kogas to renegotiate deals with Qatar and Oman-note* New Australian LNG plants to see mid single-digit returns-note* Sellers to cave into buyer demands as supply grows-note   (Adds JERA response on U.S. gas price-linked LNG purchases)By Oleg VukmanovicMILAN, Oct 6 U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase  warned that new global gas price lows will demolish producer profits as top Asian consumers freeze big purchases and rework or ditch existing import deals.In a client note seen by Reuters, the bank spells out the changing strategies of the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) importers -- Japan's JERA and South Korea's Kogas  -- emboldened by surging supply to demand concessions from producers facing a decade of pain. These include breaking away from oil-indexed LNG supply deals, which tend to be costly, and abolishing restrictions that currently bar buyers from diverting or re-selling cargoes.""Sellers may be forced to offer buyers contract offtake flexibility as demand growth slows, providing continued challenges to producer profitability especially those exposed to lower-tier buyers,"" JPM's head of Asia oil and gas equity research, Scott Darling, wrote in the Oct. 1 report.The note draws on 28 meetings between JPM and major Asian LNG players, including Kogas, JERA, Inpex and PetroChina, providing new insight into the buying strategies of major consumers.Rising supply worldwide has cut spot LNG prices by more than 60 percent since February 2014 as demand wanes and new production gets underway in Australia and the United States. Citing sources at the company, JPM says Kogas should avoid taking an impairment on its investment in two high-cost Australian LNG export projects -- Prelude and Gladstone -- so long as oil prices stay around $50/barrel.At current oil prices Kogas sees an internal rate of return on Gladstone at 6 percent and Prelude at 7-9 percent, JPM says.According to the note, both JERA, a joint venture between Tokyo Electric Power Co and Chubu Electric, and Kogas will not sign any new long-term import deals this decade. Kogas intends to renegotiate existing contracts with top exporter Qatar and Oman, which expire in the early 2020s, while JERA will wait for deals signed with Qatar after the Fukushima disaster to run down before agreeing new ones, the bank said.Kogas will also take advantage of expiring long-term deals to reduce exposure to oil-linked supply to half of its total LNG supply, pegging the rest to U.S. gas prices.Kogas said nothing has been decided regarding its LNG fuel purchase strategy. JERA said it is reviewing what long-term contracts it will sign and has not yet decided on the amount of U.S. gas price-linked LNG it intends to buy.In the note, JPM, citing JERA sources, said the firm plans to have 10 million tonnes/year of U.S. gas price-linked LNG by 2020.Kogas expects cheap coal to reduce South Korean LNG imports in 2016 and sees stagnant demand from 2017, JPM said, removing a key pillar of support to global gas prices.Spot LNG prices could drop below $6 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) next year, traders told the bank, compared with $6.60/mmBtu currently.

787,"   By Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co, looking to stem falling revenue in its mortgage business as fewer Americans refinance, is increasingly buying loans from smaller lenders, a practice that competitors including Bank of America view as risky.In the first half of 2015, the bank bought 62 percent of the $58 billion in home loans it added to its books, compared with 56 percent in 2014 and 37 percent in 2011. While other big banks buy mortgages from other lenders, known as correspondents, JPMorgan has racked up the biggest increase among its peers in the proportion of loans it buys from others, according to data from trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance. JPMorgan is fighting for business in what has been a shrinking market. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications for U.S. home loans have fallen by about 25 percent since mid-January, when a temporary drop in rates spurred a small wave of refinancing. Since May 2013, when mortgage rates first started jumping amid fears the Federal Reserve would hike rates, application volume has fallen by more than 50 percent. Fewer applications overall make it harder for JPMorgan to make as many loans directly to consumers in its bank branches. Still, JPMorgan's willingness to buy loans from correspondent banks is a sign that banks are comfortable taking more risk in the mortgage market, nearly a decade after the housing bubble popped. ""As they gain more confidence about the environment, they go right back to the correspondent channel for more volume,"" said banking analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. To be sure, Bank of America Corp avoids the loans, because it doesn't want to be exposed to bad decisions made by smaller banks that do the actual lending. ""There's more risk in being that far away from the customer,"" said D. Steve Boland, the Bank of America executive in charge of mortgage and auto lending. For example, a smaller lender could fail to verify a borrower's income properly, and just sell the loan on to a bigger bank.         HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE    To minimize that risk, JPMorgan, like other banks, specifies exactly what correspondent lenders have to do to vet loans, and forces the smaller lenders to buy back loans that turn out to have fallen short of those requirements. Greg Beliles, correspondent lending head at JPMorgan, wrote through a spokeswoman that the bank works with ""experienced, well managed and high quality"" lenders. Bank of America's concerns may stem from its experience with Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America bought in 2008, the largest correspondent lender in the U.S. at the time. Countrywide failed at least in part due to bad loans that it bought from correspondent banks and could not sell back to them. The Countrywide deal has been a huge millstone for Bank of America—the bank has paid some $70 billion in settlements and legal penalties linked to the financial crisis, much of which came from its acquisition of the lender.  Other lenders had trouble with correspondent loans during the crisis. Residential Capital, once the mortgage arm of Ally Financial Inc, filed for bankruptcy in 2012, in part because of its exposure to correspondent lenders that were not able to make good on claims. Ally is the successor firm to GMAC, the car financing arm of General Motors.NO BUNDLING     JPMorgan said it reviews every loan it buys in detail. That attention gives it a ""very high degree of confidence in the loan quality we are purchasing,"" JPMorgan's Beliles wrote in his email.  He said JPMorgan keeps the bulk of mortgages it buys from other lenders on its balance sheet, rather than bundling them into bonds and selling them to investors. Banks like JPMorgan may be dialing up their risk taking a bit, but there is little evidence of a new bubble forming. While a few small lenders are creeping back into products like subprime mortgages, bigger banks are by and large avoiding them. Delinquency rates on single family mortgages, which peaked at 11.26 percent in the first quarter of 2010, have declined fairly steadily ever since and stood at 5.77 percent at the end of the second quarter, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In the last crisis, delinquency rates started rising in 2004, and by the third quarter of 2007, a year before Lehman Brothers failed, reached 2.76 percent, their highest level in 14 years. Correspondent loans can bolster a bank's bottom line. Eric Stoddard, the Wells Fargo & Co executive who has overseen the bank's business of buying mortgages from other lenders for almost 15 years, said it is cheaper to buy these loans than to make home loans in its branches. The loans carry another advantage: the buying bank gains the right to collect monthly mortgage payments from the borrower, and receives a small monthly payment for its efforts. That right, known as a ""mortgage servicing right,"" can be a valuable asset, especially when rates are rising. One lender said banks who buy loans from him are taking less risk than they would be making their own loans because of their ability to force him to buy the loans back. PERL, which has 200 employees and expects to make about $1.6 billion in home loans this year, sells about 60 percent of its loans to JPMorgan, according to founder and president Ken Perlmutter. ""I think B of A's a little foolish"" not to buy loans, Perlmutter said. Bank of America, however, believes the risk isn't worth taking. The bank, which serves one out of two U.S. households, doesn’t need to buy loans from other lenders if it has so many customers of its own. ""I've already got a relationship with the customer,"" said Boland. ""Our strategy is about capturing more of that relationship.""

791,"   By Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 7 JPMorgan Chase & Co, looking to stem falling revenue in its mortgage business as fewer Americans refinance, is increasingly buying loans from smaller lenders, a practice that competitors including Bank of America view as risky.In the first half of 2015, the bank bought 62 percent of the $58 billion in home loans it added to its books, compared with 56 percent in 2014 and 37 percent in 2011. While other big banks buy mortgages from other lenders, known as correspondents, JPMorgan has racked up the biggest increase among its peers in the proportion of loans it buys from others, according to data from trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.JPMorgan is fighting for business in what has been a shrinking market. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications for U.S. home loans have fallen by about 25 percent since mid-January, when a temporary drop in rates spurred a small wave of refinancing. Since May 2013, when mortgage rates first started jumping amid fears the Federal Reserve would hike rates, application volume has fallen by more than 50 percent.Fewer applications overall make it harder for JPMorgan to make as many loans directly to consumers in its bank branches. Still, JPMorgan's willingness to buy loans from correspondent banks is a sign that banks are comfortable taking more risk in the mortgage market, nearly a decade after the housing bubble popped.""As they gain more confidence about the environment, they go right back to the correspondent channel for more volume,"" said banking analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners.To be sure, Bank of America Corp avoids the loans, because it doesn't want to be exposed to bad decisions made by smaller banks that do the actual lending.""There's more risk in being that far away from the customer,"" said D. Steve Boland, the Bank of America executive in charge of mortgage and auto lending.For example, a smaller lender could fail to verify a borrower's income properly, and just sell the loan on to a bigger bank. HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE To minimize that risk, JPMorgan, like other banks, specifies exactly what correspondent lenders have to do to vet loans, and forces the smaller lenders to buy back loans that turn out to have fallen short of those requirements. Greg Beliles, correspondent lending head at JPMorgan, wrote through a spokeswoman that the bank works with ""experienced, well managed and high quality"" lenders.Bank of America's concerns may stem from its experience with Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America bought in 2008, the largest correspondent lender in the U.S. at the time. Countrywide failed at least in part due to bad loans that it bought from correspondent banks and could not sell back to them. The Countrywide deal has been a huge millstone for Bank of America-the bank has paid some $70 billion in settlements and legal penalties linked to the financial crisis, much of which came from its acquisition of the lender.Other lenders had trouble with correspondent loans during the crisis. Residential Capital, once the mortgage arm of Ally Financial Inc, filed for bankruptcy in 2012, in part because of its exposure to correspondent lenders that were not able to make good on claims. Ally is the successor firm to GMAC, the car financing arm of General Motors. NO BUNDLING JPMorgan said it reviews every loan it buys in detail. That attention gives it a ""very high degree of confidence in the loan quality we are purchasing,"" JPMorgan's Beliles wrote in his email. He said JPMorgan keeps the bulk of mortgages it buys from other lenders on its balance sheet, rather than bundling them into bonds and selling them to investors.Banks like JPMorgan may be dialing up their risk taking a bit, but there is little evidence of a new bubble forming. While a few small lenders are creeping back into products like subprime mortgages, bigger banks are by and large avoiding them.Delinquency rates on single family mortgages, which peaked at 11.26 percent in the first quarter of 2010, have declined fairly steadily ever since and stood at 5.77 percent at the end of the second quarter, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In the last crisis, delinquency rates started rising in 2004, and by the third quarter of 2007, a year before Lehman Brothers failed, reached 2.76 percent, their highest level in 14 years. Correspondent loans can bolster a bank's bottom line. Eric Stoddard, the Wells Fargo & Co executive who has overseen the bank's business of buying mortgages from other lenders for almost 15 years, said it is cheaper to buy these loans than to make home loans in its branches.The loans carry another advantage: the buying bank gains the right to collect monthly mortgage payments from the borrower, and receives a small monthly payment for its efforts. That right, known as a ""mortgage servicing right,"" can be a valuable asset, especially when rates are rising.One lender said banks who buy loans from him are taking less risk than they would be making their own loans because of their ability to force him to buy the loans back.PERL, which has 200 employees and expects to make about $1.6 billion in home loans this year, sells about 60 percent of its loans to JPMorgan, according to founder and president Ken Perlmutter.""I think B of A's a little foolish"" not to buy loans, Perlmutter said.Bank of America, however, believes the risk isn't worth taking. The bank, which serves one out of two U.S. households, doesn't need to buy loans from other lenders if it has so many customers of its own.""I've already got a relationship with the customer,"" said Boland. ""Our strategy is about capturing more of that relationship.""(Reporting by Dan Freed; Editing by Dan Wilchins and John Pickering)",2015-10-07,JPM,"Wed Oct 7, 2015 | 1:00am EDT",INSIGHT-JPMorgan buys more mortgages from other lenders as market shrinks,http://www.reuters.com//article/jpmorgan-mortgages-idUSL1N1261GI20151007?type=companyNews

793,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co on Friday won the dismissal of a U.S. whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former vice president who claimed the bank ignored red flags about a client's potential fraud, even after authorities exposed the massive Ponzi scheme operated by longtime JPMorgan client Bernard Madoff.U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in New York granted the bank's motion to throw out the complaint, finding that Jennifer Sharkey had failed to demonstrate that her termination in August 2009 was in retaliation for speaking out.Instead, he said, JPMorgan had shown there were legitimate performance-related reasons to fire her at the time.Sharkey's lawyer, Lawrence Pearson, said she would appeal. JPMorgan, which has previously denied her allegations, did not respond to a request for comment. The decision marks the second time Sweet has dismissed Sharkey's lawsuit. In December 2013, Sweet ruled that Sharkey had not met the necessary standard for whistleblower protection under the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act.In an unrelated case in 2014, however, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals imposed a lower bar for whistleblower protection under Sarbanes-Oxley. The court then reversed Sweet's decision, ordering him to reconsider whether Sharkey's case should be allowed to proceed under the newer, more lenient standard. Sweet said on Friday that Sharkey's lawsuit should be dismissed even using the less stringent standard.Sharkey claimed bank executives ignored concerns she began voicing in January 2009 about whether an Israeli client was engaging in fraud and money laundering involving Colombia, just weeks after Madoff's multibillion-dollar scheme became exposed. The client is not identified in court papers. Madoff was a client of JPMorgan for more than 20 years, sending deposits and transfers from his investors totaling about $150 billion through the bank.In January 2014, JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion to the U.S. government and Madoff victims to settle allegations it failed to alert authorities to its suspicions of fraud at Madoff's firm.The case is Sharkey v.

JPMorgan had 235,678 employees as of Sept. 30, down 3 percent from a year earlier.The bank's total assets shrank 4 percent to $2.42 trillion, making it the first time the bank's assets have fallen for two quarters in a row since 2009.JPMorgan, like other big banks, is shedding assets to appease regulators, who fear its size could pose a risk to the financial system in the event of a failure.(Reporting by Sweta Singh and Richa Naidu in Bengaluru, David Henry and Dan Freed in New York; Editing by Ted Kerr)",2015-10-13,JPM,"Tue Oct 13, 2015 | 6:50pm EDT","UPDATE 4-Weak trading hits JPMorgan, profit falls in three core businesses",http://www.reuters.com//article/jpmorgan-results-idUSL3N12D5OO20151013?type=companyNews
803,"  Oct 13 JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported a 22.3 percent rise in quarterly profit as lower costs and a smaller provision for credit losses made up for weaker trading revenue.JPMorgan said its net income rose to $6.80 billion from $5.57 billion in the year-earlier period. On a per share basis, the bank earned $1.68 in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $1.35, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the results reported on Tuesday were comparable.

804,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which has grown by more than 50 percent since the start of the financial crisis, is going on a diet.     The largest U.S. bank is shedding holdings to appease regulators including the Federal Reserve: if the bank gets rid of enough trading assets, derivatives, and investment securities, it can be deemed a little less risky by the Fed, which in turn could help it boost profitability and return more capital to shareholders.     By the Fed's formula, JPMorgan is the U.S. bank whose failure would be the most catastrophic for the financial system, because of its size, complexity, and connections to other lenders and institutions.    In the second quarter, in a little-noticed move, the bank cut almost $128 billion, or 5 percent, of assets from its books compared with the first quarter, bringing the total to $2.45 trillion.    The bank could post a decline in assets again when it reports third quarter earnings on Tuesday, making it the first time its assets have declined for two quarters in a row since 2009. Even if the bank does not cut total assets in the third quarter, it will likely shed some of its riskiest assets. Sources said the bank aims to cut more of its most problematic holdings without hurting revenue much.    JPMorgan's efforts in the first half of the year alone could allow it to buy back as much as $3 billion more in shares, equal to about 1.5 percent of the outstanding total, according to a report from Susan Roth Katzke, a bank stock analyst at Credit Suisse.     By buying back more shares, the bank could increase its 2016 return on equity, a key measure of how effectively it wrings profits from shareholders' funds, to 10.9 percent from 10.8 percent, by her estimate.     Another analyst, Steven Chubak of Nomura, reckons that the bank's moves could lift its share price by $2 a share. JPMorgan shares traded at about $61.50 on Tuesday afternoon.     The biggest U.S. banks grew much bigger during the financial crisis as they swallowed up rivals that came close to failing, such as Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch. JPMorgan Chase's assets are now almost 60 percent higher than they were pre-crisis.      But in recent years regulators have been crafting new rules to help ensure that bigger banks do not create too much risk for the financial system. One of those rules, known as capital surcharges for globally systemically important banks, essentially forces banks that are too complicated to swallow higher costs: the banks must fund their operations with less debt, which is cheaper, and more equity, which is more costly.      JPMorgan's efforts to slim down underscore how new capital rules issued by the Fed are goading banks to rethink a host of businesses. In the second quarter, the bank returned $100 billion of deposits to customers, largely hedge funds that were parking money they had no immediate need to trade. JPMorgan sold the short-term assets it bought with those deposits.    ""Going out to your clients and saying we don't want your money is a very funny thing for a bank to do,"" Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive officer, said at an investor conference last month.    The bank also offloaded some $10 billion of unspecified hard-to-value assets in the second quarter, according to company filings, and uncluttered its derivatives books.      IT GETS HARDER     Those efforts should allow the bank to hold down the amount of equity it funds itself with and reduce its costs. Before the second quarter and under current rules, JPMorgan needed to fund at least 12 percent of its total adjusted assets with equity, and the rest with debt. That equity ratio is at least 4.5 percentage points higher than smaller lenders, and adjusts assets for how risky they are. After slimming down, the bank could fund itself with just 4 percentage points more equity than smaller lenders, according to Katzke, the Credit Suisse analyst.     Doing more cutting from here is possible, but won’t be easy, bank executives said. For example, JPMorgan wants to cut another $100 billion of deposits from customers that are not profitable for it.     ""The second one is a little harder,"" Dimon said at the conference last month.    Even as JPMorgan sheds some assets, it is willing to take on others. For example, JPMorgan is pouring technology and marketing dollars into credit cards. It is pushing rewards programs to encourage spending by cardholders and it is promoting transaction processing services for merchants, two businesses that bring in high fees and have relatively low capital needs.         The bank is likely to promote corporate treasury and cash management services, as well as asset management, for similar reasons, Katzke said.

806,"  * Appointment to signal renewed focus on investment bank* Staley ran JPMorgan's investment bank, asset management* Role has been vacant since Jenkins was axed in July* Shares dip 2.6 pct in weak banking sector   (Adds statement from Barclays, updates shares)By Lawrence Delevingne and Sinead CruiseNEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 13 British bank Barclays PLC is close to naming former JPMorgan Chase  banker Jes Staley as chief executive, signalling a renewed focus on an investment banking division that has been pared back over the past three years.Barclays offered the position to Staley, currently managing partner of U.S. hedge fund firm BlueMountain Capital Management, and he accepted the offer, a person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.Boston-born James 'Jes' Staley, 58, ran JPMorgan's investment bank and asset management business and had been at the bank for 34 years before leaving in early 2013 to join BlueMountain. He made the shortlist when Barclays last looked for a CEO three years ago.""His appointment will indicate a greater commitment to the IB (investment bank), but then Barclays' profitability problems are linked to the IB and not the traditional bank,"" said Chintan Joshi, analyst at Nomura.Previous CEO Antony Jenkins was fired in July after losing the support of non-executive directors in a clash over style and the pace of the bank's turnaround.Jenkins set about reducing the importance of the investment bank after a series of scandals, while changes in regulation also made many trading activities unprofitable. It was intended as a clear break from his predecessor Bob Diamond, another American investment banker. Investors and analysts said Staley should improve morale and set a clear strategy for the investment bank after years of uncertainty, but they warned he should not build it back up aggressively.""At first sight he would not appear to be the person to downsize the IB, but maybe that is too much of a snap reaction,"" said Richard Marwood, senior investment manager at Axa Investment Managers.A top 20 Barclays investor, who asked not to be named, said: ""We don't have a problem with them retaining some investment banking activities, it just needs to be done in a rational way ... given the volatility and reputational risk that comes with the investment bank, the bar needs to be set very high.""Barclays shares were down 2.6 percent at 249.9 pence by 1340 GMT, underperforming a 2 percent fall by Europe's bank index .CHOPPY WATERS  Any appointment would also still depend on Staley getting approval from Britain's financial regulators.The appointment is expected to be announced in the next two weeks, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the expected hiring.A Bank of England spokeswoman said on Tuesday no-one had been approved yet as new Barclays CEO.Barclays said it noted the speculation regarding Staley but the process of appointing a new CEO ""has not yet concluded"".""If this change is approved, it could signal that UK and U.S. regulators are comfortable with the renewed ascendancy of investment banking,"" said Jim Antos, analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia in Hong Kong. Staley, a keen yachtsman, joined JPMorgan in 1979 and spent eight years in its Brazilian business. He helped found its equities business and later became CEO of asset management.He was long seen as a possible successor to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, but was sidelined after a management reshuffle in 2012 and moved to BlueMountain a year later.Staley will face a number of challenges at Barclays.The bank is just over halfway through a three-year plan to cut 19,000 jobs, including 7,000 in the investment bank, and it still faces litigation issues.It needs to cut costs to improve returns, is trying to wind down 57 billion pounds of non-core assets, and needs to separate its domestic retail bank from more risky activities by 2019 to meet new regulations. Industry sources have said it has had more difficulty finalising its ""ring-fencing"" plans than rivals.Staley, who also previously ran JPMorgan's private banking, may also look to fix Barclays' underperforming wealth management business.Barclays Chairman John McFarlane, who has been running the bank since Jenkins' exit, has also put more emphasis back on the investment bank and this week said European investment banks should consider merging to create a regional champion to compete with U.S. rivals, which are gaining market share.An appointment of Staley would see a second former JPMorgan investment bank boss running a British bank, after Standard Chartered this year picked Bill Winters as its new CEO.Barclays' Finance Director Tushar Morzaria is another former JPMorgan executive, showing the growing influence of the U.S. bank's alumni in London.(Writing by Steve Slater; Additional reporting by Sangameswaran S, Aurindom Mukherjee and Lawrence White; Editing by Mark Potter and Keith Weir)",2015-10-13,JPM,"Tue Oct 13, 2015 | 10:01am EDT",UPDATE 5-Barclays set to name former JPMorgan banker Staley as new CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/barclays-ceo-staley-idUSL3N12D01S20151013?type=companyNews
807,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 14 (Fitch) JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) third quarter 2015  (3Q15) results benefited from the recognition of several unusual items, and  while core results were down from 3Q14, they were still solid, with an adjusted  return on tangible equity of approximately 12%. Increased market volatility,  interest rate uncertainty, and pressures in oil & gas had an impact on a variety  of segments, but Fitch Ratings believes the diversity of the platform and the  bank's market positioning in the businesses in which it operates continued to  support peer-superior performance.  Unusual items in the quarter included about $1 billion of firmwide legal  expenses, which includes CDS settlements and $2.2 billion of tax benefits, both  of which are after-tax numbers. JPM also recognized $591 million of consumer  reserve releases in the quarter, which were partially offset by a $310 million  increase in wholesale reserves related to select downgrades in the oil & gas  portfolio.   Corporate and Investment banking (CIB) produced a return on equity of 8%, or 13%  adjusting for legal expenses, tax benefits, and reserve builds. Revenues were  down in the quarter as strong investment banking, advisory, and equity markets  activity were more than offset by weaker performance in fixed income markets,  securities services, and treasury services, which was largely anticipated by  Fitch. Markets revenues were down 16% from 3Q14, or down 6% adjusting for  business simplification. There was a $232 million reserve build in the quarter,  which included about $128 million directly associated with oil & gas exposure.  Still, net charge-offs in the segment, at 0.01% in the quarter, remain very  strong.  CIB reported average VaR of $57 million for the quarter, which was up from $43  million in the prior quarter and $35 million in 3Q14, due largely to an increase  in fixed income VaR. Fitch expects segment VaR to rise with increased market  volatility. Overall, Fitch believes CIB segment performance continues to benefit  from the firm's global reach and scale, and market share gains, at least on the  margin, are likely to continue.  The Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment produced a return on equity of  about 20% in the quarter due to a reduction in provision expense and improved  cost efficiencies. The business is committed to reducing expenses by $2 billion  by the end of 2017. Through 3Q15, expenses have declined $600 million, or $700  million adjusting for legal expense. Core loans were up 23% year over year,  driven by growth in mortgage loans, business banking, and auto.  Mortgage origination was up 41% year over year and about 2% sequentially given a  stronger pipeline and an improvement in the purchase market. JPM continues to  balance sheet high-quality mortgages, adding about $19 billion in the quarter.  Mortgage servicing revenue continued to decline, given a reduction in the  servicing book, but servicing expenses are also down as the bank looks to  right-size the business. Fitch expects mortgage servicing expenses to continue  to improve in 4Q15. Credit trends in the real estate portfolio remained strong,  with non-purchased credit impaired (PCI) losses of 0.10% in the quarter; down 11  basis points (bps) sequentially. JPM released $575 million of reserves in the  mortgage portfolio during the quarter, including $200 million associated with  the non-credit-impaired portfolio and $375 million associated with the PCI  portfolio. Releases for both segments were supported by reduced delinquencies  and improving home prices.       The card, commerce solutions and auto segment generated a return on equity (ROE)  of 22%, which was a solid quarter, but down year over year. Net interest income  was up due to strong volume and a reduction in the reserve for uncollectable  interest and fees. However, non-interest revenues were down due to the  re-pricing of certain co-brand partnerships to market, including the bank's  relationships with United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, partially offset by  higher auto lease volume and a 5.9% increase in card sales volume. Average card  loans were flat year over year and total segment loans grew about the same.  Credit performance remained pristine, with card net charge-offs declining 20bps  sequentially, to 2.41%. That said, delinquencies were up 9bps from the prior  quarter, due in part to seasonality, and JPM expects losses to be about 2.5%  over the medium term. While net charge-off dollars were down 7.6% from 3Q14,  provision expense rose about 1%, to account for portfolio growth. The allowance  for loan losses for the segment was 2.16% of ending loans in 3Q15, down 2bps  sequentially. Fitch believes credit metrics in the segment are at or near a  bottom. Commercial Banking's (CB) contribution to earnings was down in the quarter given  a decline in investment banking revenues, higher operating expenses, and an  increase in provision expense. Still, management expects investment banking  revenue in the segment to be at record levels for the year, surpassing $2  billion, given a strong pipeline. Despite a modest reserve build, partially  attributable to oil & gas exposure, credit performance remains strong, with no  net charge-offs in the quarter.  Market sentiment negatively affected asset management (AM) earnings in the  quarter given lower transactional revenues. The sale of the retirement planning  services business in 2014 also had an impact year-over-year comparisons. Assets  under management (AUM) declined to $1.7 trillion at quarter-end as JPM  experienced its first quarter of net outflows in some time, driven by interest  rate uncertainty and equity market declines. From a liquidity perspective, JPM's high quality liquid assets remained strong,  at $505 billion in the quarter, and the bank has reduced non-operating deposits  by more than $150 billion through 3Q15; outpacing its year-end 2015 target by  over $50 billion. Over the same period, total deposits are down by approximately  $90 billion, as growth in more stable balances helped to offset the decline.  Average deposits in the CCB segment were up $38.3 billion from year-end 2014,  while average CIB deposits were down about $61.8 billion. Fitch views this shift  favorably, given the relative stability of retail deposits and favorable  treatment in liquidity ratios.     JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common equity (CET1) ratio rose 40bps sequentially, to  11.4%, given earnings retention and a decline in risk-weighted assets. The  bank's capital ratio is now the same under both the advanced and standardized  approaches, and the standardized ratio is expected to be the binding constraint  going forward. The supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) grew 30bps at the firm  level and 40bps at the bank level, to reach 6.3% and 6.5%, respectively, at  quarter-end, which is compliant with regulatory requirements. In terms of G-SIB  requirements, JPM believes it is currently in the 4% bucket, with regard to the  buffer, given actions taken by the bank and final U.S. rules. This is down from  the 4.5% bucket previously, but remains at the high-end of the peer group. Fitch  regards JPM's capital levels to be consistent with its current ratings and would  expect the bank to achieve full compliance with all regulatory requirements,  well ahead of required implementation.  JPM paid a dividend of $0.44 per share in the quarter, equating to a payout of  26.2% of reported earnings per share, or a payout of 33.3% adjusting for unusual  items in the quarter. The bank repurchased $1.2 billion of equity in the  quarter, leaving approximately $3.9 billion of repurchase authority, based on  the results of this year's CCAR process.

808,"   By Sweta Singh and Richa Naidu  JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported a 6.4 percent decline in revenue and profit declines in three of its four main businesses, underscoring how weak trading markets and low interest rates have hurt banks in recent months.Like other banks, JPMorgan has been struggling to increase  revenue in the face of weak demand for loans and low interest rates, which have been stuck near zero for overnight funds since December 2008.Trading was particularly volatile during the quarter as worries about the impact of an economic slowdown in China roiled financial markets, discouraging investors from making big bets and muddying the outlook for U.S. interest rates.Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake offered little hope that conditions would improve anytime soon, saying on a conference call that analyst estimates for the current quarter appeared to be too high in light of slow market trading.The lender, kicking off third-quarter results for big U.S. banks, managed a 22 percent rise in net income but this was mainly due to a tax benefit and lower spending on employee pay.The bank, whose shares were little changed in extended trading on Tuesday, said net income fell in its commercial banking, asset management, and corporate and investment banking businesses. The only unit to post a higher profit was consumer and community banking, where net income rose 4 percent.Revenue from trading fixed income, currencies and commodities fell 22.6 percent to $2.93 billion. Adjusted for the sale of a physical commodities business and other changes, revenue from fixed-income trading would have fallen 11 percent.""When you look at other companies that will report I expect it's going to be exactly the same situation,"" said Michael Yoshikami, who oversees $1.5 billion as chief executive of Destination Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California. Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, which report on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, have said they expect trading revenue to drop about 5 percent in the quarter.Markets and Investor Services revenue fell 15.6 percent to $5.41 billion, contributing to a more-than-expected 6.4 percent drop in overall net revenue to $23.54 billion.Net income applicable to common stockholders was $6.27 billion, or $1.68 per share, up from $5.13 billion, or $1.35 per share last year. Analysts on average had expected $1.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. LOW RATES, WEAK DEMAND The results in the latest quarter included tax benefits of $2.2 billion. The prior-period results included legal expenses of $1 billion, which had reduced earnings per share by 26 cents.""We saw the impact of a challenging global environment and continued low rates reflected in the wholesale businesses’ results, while the consumer businesses benefited from favorable trends and credit quality,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.The U.S. Federal Reserve held off on an interest rate rise that many had expected in mid September, citing worries about global growth, jittery markets and muted inflation. Low interest rates compress the spread between banks' cost of funds and the interest earned from loans and securities.Noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $15.4 billion, while provision for credit losses fell 10 percent to $682 million.Compensation costs fell 6.5 percent to $7.32 billion in the quarter, and were down 1 percent in the first nine months of the year. JPMorgan had 235,678 employees as of Sept. 30, down 3 percent from a year earlier.The bank's total assets shrank 4 percent to $2.42 trillion, making it the first time the bank's assets have fallen for two quarters in a row since 2009.JPMorgan, like other big banks, is shedding assets to appease regulators, who fear its size could pose a risk to the financial system in the event of a failure.

809,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co, which has grown by more than 50 percent since the start of the financial crisis, is going on a diet.    The largest U.S. bank is shedding holdings to appease regulators including the Federal Reserve: if the bank gets rid of enough trading assets, derivatives, and investment securities, it can be deemed a little less risky by the Fed, which in turn could help it boost profitability and return more capital to shareholders.JPMorgan's efforts underscore the extent to which regulators are influencing banks' business decisions after the financial crisis cost the global economy trillions of dollars. In the first nine months of the year, the bank returned $150 billion of deposits to customers, largely hedge funds that were parking money not immediately needed for trading. The bank is hoping to shed more assets over time, and may also look to do less trading business with other financial institutions and more with companies, which would allow regulators to view it as less risky.""We made great progress,"" said Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, adding, ""it becomes increasingly more difficult"" to make progress in cutting assets from here. By the Fed's formula, JPMorgan is the U.S. bank whose failure would be the most catastrophic for the financial system because of its size, complexity, and connections to other lenders and institutions.The bank said on Tuesday its assets shrank by $32.48 billion, or 1.3 percent, in the third quarter from the second quarter, to $2.42 trillion. In the second quarter, its assets fell by 4.9 percent. This marks the first time JPMorgan's assets have declined for two quarters in a row since 2009. JPMorgan's efforts in the first half of the year alone could allow it to buy back as much as $3 billion more in shares, or about 1.5 percent of the outstanding total, according to a report last week from Susan Roth Katzke, a bank stock analyst at Credit Suisse.      By buying back more shares, the bank could increase its 2016return on equity, a key measure of how effectively it wrings profits from shareholders' funds, to 10.9 percent from 10.8percent, by her estimate.     Another analyst, Steven Chubak of Nomura, reckons that the bank's moves could lift its share price by $2. JPMorgan shares fell 1.6 percent to $60.55 in extended trading on Tuesday after the bank posted results. The biggest U.S. banks grew much bigger during the financial crisis as they swallowed up rivals that came close to failing, such as Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch. JPMorgan Chase's assets are now almost 60 percent higher than they were pre-crisis.      But in recent years regulators have been crafting new rules help ensure that bigger banks do not create too much risk forth financial system. One of those rules, known as capital surcharges for globally systemically important banks, essentially forces banks that are too complicated to swallow higher costs: the banks must fund their operations with less debt, which is cheaper, and more equity, which is more costly. In addition to returning deposits to hedge funds, the bank also offloaded some $10 billion of unspecified hard-to-value assets in the second quarter, according to company filings, and uncluttered its derivatives books. Those efforts should allow the bank to hold down the amount of equity it funds itself with and reduce its costs. Before the second quarter and under current rules, JPMorgan needed to fund at least 12 percent of its total adjusted assets with equity, and the rest with debt. That equity ratio is at least 4.5percentage points higher than for smaller lenders, and adjusts assets for how risky they are. After slimming down, the bank expects to be able to fund itself with just 4 percentage points more equity than smaller lenders.Making more cuts will not be easy, because the bank has picked the low-hanging fruit by scaling down clearly unprofitable client relationships, and it does not want to alienate valued customers. ""Going out to your clients and saying we don't want your money is a very funny thing for a bank to do,"" JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said at a conference last month.On a call with analysts on Tuesday, Dimon said the bank could make more progress on its capital surcharge ratios in the next five to six years. Even as JPMorgan sheds some assets, it is willing to take on others. For example, JPMorgan is pouring technology and marketing dollars into credit cards. It is pushing rewards programs to encourage spending by cardholders and it is promoting transaction processing services for merchants, two businesses that bring in high fees and have relatively low capital needs.     The bank is likely to promote corporate treasury and cash management services, as well as asset management, for similar reasons, Katzke said.

810,"  (Adds third-quarter asset decline, CEO comments)By David HenryNEW YORK Oct 13 JPMorgan Chase & Co, which has grown by more than 50 percent since the start of the financial crisis, is going on a diet.The largest U.S. bank is shedding holdings to appease regulators including the Federal Reserve: if the bank gets rid of enough trading assets, derivatives, and investment securities, it can be deemed a little less risky by the Fed, which in turn could help it boost profitability and return more capital to shareholders.JPMorgan's efforts underscore the extent to which regulators are influencing banks' business decisions after the financial crisis cost the global economy trillions of dollars. In the first nine months of the year, the bank returned $150 billion of deposits to customers, largely hedge funds that were parking money not immediately needed for trading. The bank is hoping to shed more assets over time, and may also look to do less trading business with other financial institutions and more with companies, which would allow regulators to view it as less risky.""We made great progress,"" said Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, adding, ""it becomes increasingly more difficult"" to make progress in cutting assets from here.By the Fed's formula, JPMorgan is the U.S. bank whose failure would be the most catastrophic for the financial system because of its size, complexity, and connections to other lenders and institutions. The bank said on Tuesday its assets shrank by $32.48 billion, or 1.3 percent, in the third quarter from the second quarter, to $2.42 trillion. In the second quarter, its assets fell by 4.9 percent. This marks the first time JPMorgan's assets have declined for two quarters in a row since 2009.JPMorgan's efforts in the first half of the year alone could allow it to buy back as much as $3 billion more in shares, or about 1.5 percent of the outstanding total, according to a report last week from Susan Roth Katzke, a bank stock analyst at Credit Suisse.By buying back more shares, the bank could increase its 2016 return on equity, a key measure of how effectively it wrings profits from shareholders' funds, to 10.9 percent from 10.8 percent, by her estimate.Another analyst, Steven Chubak of Nomura, reckons that the bank's moves could lift its share price by $2.

821,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Oct 23 The cyberattack on British broadband supplier TalkTalk this week raises a host of questions over who could be behind it and what their aims are.TalkTalk said on Friday it had received a ransom demand from an unidentified party claiming responsibility for the attack that may have led to the theft of personal data from its more than 4 million customers, including bank and credit card details.Computer experts say details provided by TalkTalk and publicly available network data suggest that the hackers gained access by exploiting vulnerabilities in TalkTalk's customer website rather than by some form of insider attack.Samples of financial data which appeared to come from TalkTalk customers are already for sale in cybercriminal forums on the so-called dark web, experts from two separate security research firms, FireEye and Rapid7, told Reuters.A TalkTalk spokeswoman declined to comment, citing the ongoing police investigation. Most experts say they want to wait to learn more technical details following the police investigation before they try to assess how the attack took place and who may be responsible. It may take weeks or months for forensic investigators to unravel what happened.But theories have been put forward.Copenhagen-based cyber forensics investigator Jens Monrad said hackers seeking to exploit the value of stolen customer data often publish small samples of stolen data in order to attract buyers in the criminal underworld who will in turn try and exploit customer details for financial gain. Adrian Culley, a former detective at Scotland Yard's cybercrime unit, told the BBC the cyberattack appeared to be the work of an Islamist group, but provided no specific evidence for his theory.""We are aware of speculation regarding alleged perpetrators; this investigation remains at an early stage; a full assessment of the alleged data theft is ongoing,"" London's Metropolitan Police Cyber Crime Unit said in a statement. An attack on French television network TV5Monde in April that was originally attributed to pro-Islamic State hackers is now believed by many security experts to be the work of a Russian-based hacking group which they have dubbed APT 28.Gavin Millard, the Europe, Middle East and Africa regional technical director of U.S. security firm Tenable Networks, said the breadth and regularity of attacks had led the American public to suffer ""breach fatigue,"" a hapless passivity in the face of forces beyond their control.Retailers such as Target, Wall Street bank J.P. Morgan and several U.S. healthcare providers have each had tens of millions of customer records stolen. These attacks affected far more customers than the TalkTalk assault, which nonetheless ranks as one of the biggest ever in Britain.The difficulties involved in tracing those behind such hacks have been shown by the investigations into the attack on infidelity website Ashley Madison in August, when details of 39 million customers of were leaked, and into the invasion of the corporate network of Sony Corp's film studios last year.No culprit has been identified in either attack yet, despite many false trails.

822,"  (Repeats with no changes)By Carl O'DonnellNEW YORK Oct 23 The controversy surrounding Valeant Pharmaceuticals' strategy and its market slide this week are bad news for Wall Street investment banks that stand to lose one of their best clients.The specialty drug company has emerged as the fifth largest payer of investment banker fees over the past three years thanks to its rapid acquisition-driven and debt-financed expansion that has made it a darling of investors.But its business model, which has also relied on aggressive price hikes for acquired drugs, has come under growing scrutiny because of political backlash against high drug prices, dragging Valeant shares down from record highs scaled in August.The company said earlier this week it would now focus on buying back shares and paying off debt after spending about $40 billion on some 150 acquisitions since 2008 only to see its shares plummet further after a short-selling firm raised questions about its strategy and accounting practices. The firm's woes mean a likely loss of lucrative business for JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other major investment banks.Since 2012, only General Electric Co, Allergan Plc , AT&T Inc and Dell Inc have paid more than Valeant in fees to Wall Street, according to data from Freeman and Co, a consulting firm.Valeant's investment banking fees totaled $500 million since 2012, according to Freeman. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have been top beneficiaries, pocketing $97 million and $84 million respectively in the last three years. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and RBC Capital Markets each earned roughly $50 million, according to the data.The handsome fee payments have come even though Valeant has closed a number of its largest deals without hiring a mergers and acquisitions adviser, including its largest acquisition, the $15.8 billion takeover of Salix Pharmaceuticals in April.In going alone in some deals, Valeant relied on the deal-making expertise of its top executives. Its Chief Executive Michael Pearson, previously led the pharmaceutical practice at McKinsey & Co., and Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller, who left the company in June, was a top investment banker at Goldman Sachs. Valeant still paid fees for the financing of the deals. Valeant's capital raising, mostly in the form of debt, has been by far the most lucrative source of deal-making fees, accounting for nearly $450 million of the total, according to the data.For Valeant, the legacy of those capital raises is more than $40 billion in debt, which currently exceeds its market capitalization of around $39 billion.Several other drug companies that have followed similar strategies of aggressive acquisitions, cuts in research and development budgets and price increases, have also come under pressure amid concerns about tougher drug pricing scrutiny.Several Valeant peers, including Endo International Plc , Mallinckrodt Plc and Horizon Pharma Plc , have also seen their shares fall, potentially limiting their ability to make acquisitions in the future.

839,"   By Dan Freed  Six big U.S. banks need to raise an additional $120 billion, most likely in long-term debt, under a rule proposed on Friday by the Federal Reserve.The requirements are aimed at ensuring that some of the biggest and most interconnected banks, which include Goldman Sachs Group Inc,, JPMorgan Chase & Co,, and Wells Fargo & Co, can better withstand another crisis by turning some of their debt, particularly debt issued by their holding companies, into equity without disrupting markets or requiring a government bailout. The banks are expected to meet the $120 billion shortfall by issuing debt, which is usually more cost-effective than issuing equity, according to Federal Reserve officials speaking at a background press briefing Friday. The rule proposed Friday, largely in line with banks' expectations, concerns the lenders' total loss-absorbing capacity.It is one of a series of rules aimed at reducing risk in the banking system by determining how much debt and equity banks should use to fund themselves.In a procedural vote, the Fed's governors approved a draft of the proposal, meaning it will be submitted for public comment. During a public meeting with Fed officials, one staffer who worked on the rule said banks should have an easy time complying, because many requirements overlapped with existing rules. Further, the bulk of the debt requirements can be fulfilled by refinancing existing debt, the staffer said.Some requirements must be met by Jan. 1, 2019, while more-stringent requirements must be met by Jan. 1, 2022.The requirements are most stringent for JPMorgan, followed by Citigroup Inc. After that come Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, all of which have the same requirement. Wells Fargo & Co's requirement is the next highest, followed by State Street Corp and finally Bank of New York Mellon Corp. JPMorgan has more than $2 trillion in total assets, making it the largest U.S. bank by that measure.The officials declined to say which two banks already meet the long-term debt requirements under Friday's proposal. The rules also apply to U.S. operations of foreign globally systemically important banks, establishing roughly parallel requirements as those for U.S. banks, Fed officials said. Also announced was a draft final rule establishing minimum margin requirements for swaps that are not cleared through an exchange. The rule is identical to one proposed by other regulators.A Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement the bank is reviewing the proposal and it appears to be in line with expectations. Representatives from the other banks either declined comment or were not immediately available.

841,"   By Dan Freed  Oct 30 Six of the eight globally systemically important U.S. banks need to raise an additional $120 billion to comply with a regulatory requirement proposed Friday by the Federal Reserve.The requirements are aimed at ensuring the banks, which include Bank of America Corp., Bank of New York Mellon Crop., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, State Street Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. are able to recapitalize without disrupting markets or requiring a government bailout.The banks are expected to meet the $120 billion shortfall by raising debt, as that will be more cost-effective than equity, according to Federal Reserve officials speaking at a background press briefing Friday. The rule proposed Friday, widely anticipated by the market, concerns banks' total loss-absorbing capacity. It is one of several rules aimed at reducing risk in the banking system. ""By making the failure of even the largest banks more manageable, the proposed regulation will be another important step in solving the too-big-to-fail problem,"" said Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo in a statement Friday.

A weaker Australian dollar also bolstered profits.The strong performance contrasted with other global investment banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Inc, which reported poor quarterly results this month. It also puts the Sydney-based bank, which generates over 70 percent of its income overseas, on track to report its highest profit to date for the year ending March 2016.""One of our strengths lies in our ability to change,"" Chief Executive Nicholas Moore told Reuters in an interview on Friday.""The initiatives of doing new activities come from our people who are close to the market place ... They are not directed by a central executive telling people top down what to do.""Growth in niche operations such as leasing and energy trading have helped lift the group's income since the global financial crisis in 2008. It now earns about 30 percent of profits from businesses that did not even exist in 2008. Stable annuity-style businesses such as asset management and retail banking have now replaced investment banking in contributing the lion's share of earnings, accounting for about 70 percent of group profit.Investors cheered Macquarie's strong performance, sending its shares to a three-month high in a weak broader market. They ended 2 percent higher at A$85.70.The bank announced it would issue new shares on Nov. 2 at either A$78.40 each, or at a 1 percent discount to the volume-weighted average price during the pricing period, to help fund the acquisition of a $5.6 billion vehicle finance portfolio it bought from ANZ Banking Group this month.It did not say how many shares would be issued or how much it expected to raise. Since Moore took charge in May 2008, the bank's shares have jumped about 40 percent, versus a 6 percent drop in the benchmark 200-share Australian index.CHINA TURMOIL Macquarie's commission-earning securities division turned in a first-half net profit of A$240 million ($171 mln), more than 14 times what it made in the year-ago period, as a rout in China's stock markets triggered volatility in global markets.The division is part of Macquarie's market-facing business that contributes under 30 percent of total profit.Overall, the group's net profit for the first six months rose about 16 percent year-on-year to A$1.07 billion.""In the immediate short term we are not going to see the step up in earnings that we've just seen but in the medium term because of good long-term reasons we expect to continue to grow,"" Moore said.

846,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON Investment banks Guggenheim Partners LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) have secured key roles in Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) merger negotiations with Allergan Plc (AGN.N), according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be the biggest ever deal in the pharmaceutical sector. Guggenheim is advising Pfizer alongside Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), while JPMorgan is advising Allergan alongside Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the people said on Monday. Other investment banks are also vying to secure roles, the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the financial advisory roles are not yet public. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Pfizer, Allergan, Guggenheim and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Banks advising Allergan stand to collectively earn between $140 million and $180 million, while banks advising Pfizer could make between $80 million and $100 million in total, depending on the purchase price, according to estimates by consultancy Freeman & Co.   Pfizer, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan disclosed last week they were in friendly talks to merge. Pfizer and Allergan have market capitalizations of $215 billion and $122 billion respectively. The deal, which is several weeks away from an agreement, would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates, where Allergan is domiciled, according to the sources.

847,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 2 Barclays Plc agreed to pay $94 million to settle U.S. antitrust litigation by investors that accused 11 banks of conspiring to manipulate the benchmark European Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) and related derivatives.The London-based bank is the first defendant to settle, according to court papers filed late Friday in federal court in Manhattan.Kenneth Feinberg, a prominent mediator who helped broker the accord, said in an affidavit ""this first and early settlement with Barclays provides plaintiffs with a precedent and settlement structure that may encourage other interested defendants to settle.""Barclays' preliminary settlement requires court approval.Other defendants include BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc, Credit Agricole SA, Deutsche Bank AG , HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co , Rabobank BA, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Societe Generale SA and UBS AG. The electronic broker-dealer ICAP Plc is also a defendant. Barclays spokesman Mark Lane declined to comment. Representatives for the other defendants declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The plaintiff investors included the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or CalSTRS, one of the world's largest public pension funds. Lawyers for the plaintiffs were not immediately available for comment. Euribor is the euro-denominated equivalent to Libor, a benchmark for setting rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of debt, including for credit cards, student loans and mortgages.The defendants were accused of violating the Sherman Act, a U.S. antitrust law, by conspiring to rig Euribor and fix prices of Euribor-based derivatives from June 2005 to March 2011 to benefit their own positions.Barclays reached $453 million in settlements with U.S. and British regulators in June 2012, admitting it manipulated Libor and Euribor. Several other defendants have reached similar deals, including Deutsche Bank's $2.5 billion accord in April and UBS' $1.5 billion accord in December 2012.The European Union in December 2013 fined defendants including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Rabobank and RBS a combined 1.7 billion euros - $2.3 billion at the time - to settle rate-rigging charges.Feinberg has overseen programs to compensate victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, as well as a program to compensate owners of General Motors Co  vehicles with defective ignition switches.The case is Sullivan et al v Barclays Plc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-02811.

848,"  (Adds background, quotes from analyst and BlackRock)By Trevor HunnicuttNEW YORK Nov 3 Bank of America Corp, the No. 2 U.S. bank, has agreed to sell its $87 billion money-market fund business to BlackRock Inc in one of the cash-management industry's largest deals ever.The transaction comes as big banks have faced pressure to simplify their businesses since the global financial crisis and marks the largest in a series of deals reshuffling the cash-management industry before costly regulatory reforms take effect in 2016.Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The agreement is expected to lift BlackRock's global cash-management business to $372 billion from about $285 billion, according to the New York-based company.BlackRock, a manager of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, private equity pools and other investment products, is already the world's largest money manager with $4.5 trillion in assets.""Combining our business together with the Bank of America assets and distribution puts us in a unique competitive position,"" said Tom Callahan, co-head of global cash management at BlackRock, in an interview. ""It's a challenge managing cash in a low interest-rate environment, so we have to be highly efficient.""BlackRock's heft is partly the result of similar acquisitions, including Merrill Lynch's investment management business in 2006. Merrill was later acquired by Bank of America and remains a major distributor of BlackRock products to individual investors and institutions.""This transaction is consistent with Bank of America's ongoing efforts to simplify its business, in this instance, by outsourcing certain product manufacturing functions to an industry leader,"" said Bank of America spokeswoman Susan McCabe. She added that the bank will focus on distributing money market funds from BlackRock and other third-party providers.The profitability of money-market funds, which invest in relatively low-risk corporate and government debt that can be paid back within days or weeks, has been hemmed in by U.S. interest rates hovering near zero. Mergers and acquisitions trimmed the money funds industry from 75 providers in the United States last summer to just 67 this year, according to Crane Data, an industry research service.Once the deal closes next year, BlackRock will leapfrog JPMorgan Chase & Co to become the second largest money fund family, behind Fidelity Investments, according to Peter Crane of the research service.The $2.7 trillion industry has lost some $30 billion in revenue since 2009, according to trade group Investment Company Institute, after slashing fees to prevent investors from losing money in an era of rock-bottom interest rates. The funds are expected to face increasingly stiff competition for a dwindling supply of the lowest-risk debt. A set of reforms adopted last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission requires money-market funds that serve institutional investors let their asset values stray from the typical $1 per share unless the funds invest primarily in government securities.Some $200 billion in funds have announced plans to invest primarily in government-backed debt.""Everybody has been talking about consolidation for years, but it really didn't happen until today,"" said Crane. ""So many large players have resisted getting out of the business until now, but it's just a matter of the costs and uncertainty of money fund reforms proving to be overwhelming to some players.""Crane said Bank of America's decision came after an evaluation of which businesses were essential.""At the same time asset managers are trying to get bigger, banks are trying to get smaller,"" he said. ""This reflects regulatory pressure on both sides.""The deal is subject to regulatory and fund shareholder approvals.

855,"   By Huw Jones and Steve Slater | LONDON  LONDON Even as world leaders prepare to endorse new banking rules to draw a line under the financial crisis, many bankers see no end in sight to the painful demands on an industry that became the focus of public and political anger.More than six years after the 2008-09 crisis, the Group of 20 economies is this month set to approve the last major piece of regulation designed to avoid a repeat of the bank collapses that led to massive taxpayer bailouts in the United States and Europe.The reform, which requires the biggest banks to hold a substantial layer of bonds that can be converted into equity if the lender hits trouble, follows the introduction of rules known as Basel III that increased the amount of capital banks must hold, as well as curbs on bonuses, risk-taking and trading. Regulators say the G20 summit represents a milestone that will allow them to shift focus away from rule-making, to implementation.   But bankers are not calling the turn yet.       Many say another wave of capital demands is coming down the tracks from precisely that review and standardization phase.""We are now looking at capital increases that are significant across the industry - potentially larger than earlier capital rule changes that were specifically designed to increase capital levels,"" said Wilson Ervin, vice-chairman in Credit Suisse's executive office. The drive to keep up close bank supervision was illustrated on Thursday when regulators said Europe's lenders would be tested to measure their financial resilience next year, although there will be no minimum capital hurdle. It came a day after the European Central Bank's chief supervisor said some still faced a ""significant credit risk"".'CAUTIOUS ABOUT SIREN VOICES' G20 leaders, meeting in Turkey on Nov. 15-16, are due to endorse the reform that requires the world's 30 biggest banks including HSBC, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to hold bonds that can be ""bailed in"". But Ervin said a separate review of banks' trading books, coupled with how the bail-in bonds plan is structured, means the 30 top banks face having to collectively issue $1 trillion more of the bonds than they originally thought. Banks also say they need to increase capital due to moves by the Basel Committee and other regulators to standardize how the riskiness of loans is calculated.

JPMorgan has hired around 40 people net in Brazil this year, Berenguer noted, adding that the bank's loan book in Latin America's largest economy is growing.

Other defendants include Citigroup Inc, Credit Agricole SA, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Rabobank BA , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Societe Generale SA and UBS AG.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs were not immediately available for comment. Euribor is the euro-denominated equivalent to Libor, a benchmark for setting rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of debt, including for credit cards, student loans and mortgages.The defendants were accused of violating the Sherman Act, a U.S. antitrust law, by conspiring to rig Euribor and fix prices of Euribor-based derivatives from June 2005 to March 2011 to benefit their own positions. Barclays reached $453 million in settlements with U.S. and British regulators in June 2012, admitting it manipulated Libor and Euribor.Several other defendants have reached similar deals, including Deutsche Bank's $2.5 billion accord in April and UBS' $1.5 billion accord in December 2012.The European Union in December 2013 fined defendants including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Rabobank and RBS a combined 1.7 billion euros - $2.3 billion at the time - to settle rate-rigging charges.Feinberg has overseen programs to compensate victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, as well as a program to compensate owners of General Motors Co  vehicles with defective ignition switches.The case is Sullivan et al v Barclays Plc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-02811.

868,"  Federal prosecutors are pursuing criminal cases against executives from the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS.L) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) for allegedly selling flawed mortgage securities, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.People familiar with the probes said officials were trying to determine whether the bankers ignored warnings from associates that they were packing too many weak mortgages into investment offerings and whether they can prove that constituted fraud, the newspaper said. (on.wsj.com/1QKB76u)If filed, the charges would be among the first pursued against specific employees of the largest Wall Street firms over the housing collapse, the WSJ said. Prosecutors are scrutinizing a $2.2 billion deal that repackaged home mortgages into bonds in 2007 at RBS and two people who worked on a different residential-mortgage deal at JPMorgan, the Journal said. JPMorgan, RBS and Department of Justice declined to comment.JPMorgan said in a filing in November that it was responding to an investigation by the DoJ's criminal division.   Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are preparing a civil case against UBS Group AG UBSG.VX that could result in substantial penalties, some of the people told the Journal.  UBS received a subpoena from the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York in 2014, seeking documents and information related to UBS’s residential mortgage-backed security business from 2005 through 2007, the company said in a filing.

869,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The credit card industry won a big legal victory on Thursday as a federal appeals court rejected claims by a group of consumers that big issuers colluded to require that disputes be settled in arbitration rather than through class action lawsuits.By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld a lower court ruling that American Express Co , Citigroup Inc and Discover Financial Services  did not violate the Sherman antitrust law in forcing cardholders to submit to arbitration.Consumers argued that card-issuing banks and their lawyers broke the law when they held 28 meetings from May 1999 to October 2003 to discuss how to impose mandatory arbitration clauses in cardholder agreements.In April 2014, U.S. District Judge William Pauley ruled after a five-week bench trial that consumers failed by only a ""slender reed"" to show collusion, despite ""conscious parallel action"" among banks to require arbitration clauses.The appeals court said Pauley's findings did not constitute ""clear error,"" and upheld them. ""The district court found that the 'final decision to adopt class-action-barring clauses was something the issuing banks hashed out individually and internally,'"" the appeals court wrote. ""That conclusion is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, and we cannot say that the district court was 'clearly erroneous' in reaching this conclusion.""Merrill Davidoff, a lawyer for the cardholders, said his clients disagree with the decision, and have not decided whether to appeal. Citigroup and American Express had no immediate comment. Discover did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Arbitration clauses have in recent years become more prevalent in consumer contracts, including for such things as cellphone, cable TV and Internet service.Companies often prefer them to class-action litigation, which lets consumers pool resources and potentially obtain greater recoveries. In contrast, many consumers may choose not to arbitrate because the chance of success is low, and the cost of pursuing individual claims can be prohibitive.Cardholders had sought to force American Express, Citigroup and Discover to remove arbitration clauses from their cardholder agreements for eight years.In April 2010, Bank of America Corp, Capital One Financial Corp, HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co settled with the cardholders by agreeing to remove their arbitration clauses for 3-1/2 years.The case is Ross et al v.

The FBI investigation was prompted by last year's announcement by Milwaukee-based cybersecurity firm Hold Security that it obtained information that a Russian hacker group it dubbed CyberVor had stolen the 1.2 billion credentials and more than 500 million email addresses. The FBI subsequently found lists of domain names and utilities that investigators believe were used to send spam, the documents said.The FBI also discovered an email address registered in 2010 contained in the spam utilities for a ""mistergrey,"" documents show.A search of Russian hacking forums by the FBI found posts by a ""mr.grey,"" who in November 2011 wrote that if anyone wanted account information for users of Facebook, Twitter and Russian-based social network VK, he could locate the records. Alex Holden, Hold Security's chief information security officer, told Reuters this message indicated mr.grey likely operated or had access to a database that amassed stolen data from computers via malware and viruses.Facebook and Twitter declined comment. The FBI declined to comment, and U.S. Justice Department had no immediate comment. The probe appears to be distinct from another investigation linked to Hold Security's reported discovery that 420,000 websites, including one for a JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) corporate event, were targeted by the Russian hackers. In a case spilling out of the discovery of the JPMorgan breach, U.S. prosecutors this month charged three men with engaging in a cyber-criminal enterprise that stole personal information from more than 100 million people.Prosecutors accused two Israelis, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, and one American, Joshua Samuel Aaron, of being involved in a variety of schemes fueled by hacking JPMorgan and 11 other companies.An indictment in Atlanta federal court against Shalon and Aaron names as a defendant an unidentified hacker believed to be in Russia.

(bloom.bg/1Xqutr6)Reuters could not immediately reach JP Morgan for a comment outside regular business hours. JP Morgan's move comes at a time when U.S. regulators inch closer to finalizing rules for banker bonuses in the ""near term"". Other U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs have already announced plans to reduce their bonus compensation from last year by as much as 16 percent, as trading revenue plunges. Bankers in Europe too face a cut in bonuses as tougher rules force a change in pay structure. Bonuses in Britain's finance industry fell 10 percent to 13.6 billion pounds ($20.44 billion) and are down more than a quarter from their 2008 peak, figures from Britain's Office for National Statistics showed, although payouts were still more than eight times the average of 1,500 pounds across all industries.Deutsche Bank Chief Executive John Cryan said last week that bankers, even after the financial crisis, are still paid too much and that he is in favor of claw-backs.

884,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Dec 7 JPMorgan Chase & Co  hired four executives to increase coverage of private-banking activities in Brazil, where competition for existing and new clients is mounting as Latin America's largest economy plunges into recession, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.The New York-based bank, which has served wealthy families in Brazil for over half a century, hired Ricardo Taira, Leonardo Bulgareli, Carlos Amarante and Jayme Freixo last month to focus on increasing JPMorgan's customer base in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states and the country's south, said the sources, who requested anonymity since the decision is private.Taira, a banker with over two decades in the industry, had quit rival Credit Suisse Group AG before joining JPMorgan, the first source said. Bulgareli, Amarante and Freixo also left the Swiss lender, one of the largest wealth managers in Brazil, the second source noted. The four bankers will report to Juliana Pagetti, a managing director for JPMorgan's private banking unit based in São Paulo, the first source added.A spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York declined to comment. JPMorgan and other players in Brazil's $190 billion industry are responding to a recession and rising benchmark interest rates by offering clients a broader mix of investment options. Industry players expect Brazil's private-banking assets to expand less than 10 percent this year and next, down from about 20 percent annually between 2008 and 2013, when the number of Brazilian millionaires surged to a record. According to the sources, JPMorgan's expertise in fund management, foreign exchange and brokerage services is already attracting clients from rivals. Increased demand for succession and estate planning, now that the government is raising taxes to plug a swelling budget deficit, is also expected to bring in more businesses.A new window of expansion in Brazil's private-banking industry has also opened for local and international shops in the wake of massive client fund withdrawals from Grupo BTG Pactual SA, which until the Nov. 25 arrest of founder André Esteves was the nation's largest independent wealth manager.According to the second source, JPMorgan and other banks have been getting former BTG Pactual clients since Esteves was arrested for allegedly trying to obstruct investigations in Brazil's largest corruption scandal ever.

Consob said that JP Morgan's position included a previously disclosed, actual stake of 4.515 percent. The rest is held through call options that can be exercised at different dates up to July 7, 2017 and other contracts, Consob said without giving details. The position was held as of Nov. 26, when tighter disclosure rules about stakes held in listed Italian companies came into force.The Italian press has speculated that the U.S. bank could have acted as a counterpart to Niel in his investment.

887,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s  (JPM) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and Short-Term IDR at 'F1'.  Fitch has also affirmed JPM's viability rating (VR) at 'a+', support rating at  '1', and its support rating floor (SRF) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A  full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with Fitch's periodic review  of the Global Trading and Universal Banks (GTUB), which comprises 12 large and  globally active banking groups. Fitch's outlook for the GTUBs is stable as we  expect the stable outlook for the groups' commercial banking and wealth and  asset management businesses in 2016 to mitigate pressure on earnings from  capital markets activities, particularly in fixed income trading.  As globally active universal banks, the 12 GTUBs are among the most affected by  evolving regulation, which is bringing capital and resource constraints to some  businesses. This means that business models are being adjusted. Specific changes  and their timing vary by bank. In the medium term, we believe that the GTUBs  with the strongest franchises in their core businesses, sound business models  and clear strategies are best placed in this environment, and these company  profiles are an important rating factor for many of the GTUBs. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying earnings capacity of  the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing international  franchise, and significant progress made toward achieving compliance with  heightened capital and liquidity requirements. The affirmation also reflects the  firm's strong funding flexibility, given its deposit raising capabilities and  uninterrupted access to the global capital markets through an economic cycle.  JPM's Basel III tier 1 common equity ratio reached 11.4% at Sept. 30, 2015,  which was only 60 basis points from management's long-term target of 12.0%. The  ratio has grown significantly in recent years, with an increase in retained  earnings and the issuance of perpetual preferred securities, and the gap with  peers has narrowed meaningfully. JPM must build to higher regulatory minimums,  given its expected G-SIB surcharge, but actions by the bank in 3Q15 may have  reduced its G-SIB buffer by 50 bps to 4.0%. In 3Q15, advanced approach and  standardized approach capital ratios became aligned and JPM expects the  standardized approach to be its binding constraint going forward, and is  capitalizing operating segments accordingly. Fitch believes JPM is well  positioned to maintain compliance with Basel III capital requirements, even with  its higher surcharge, given the superior earnings capacity of the bank.  In early 2015, JPM raised its quarterly dividend $0.04 per share, to $0.44. Its  payout through the first nine months of 2015 was approximately 27.4% on a  diluted per share basis. In March, the firm received a non-objection from the  Federal Reserve to its revised capital plan as a result of the annual CCAR  process. JPM has the authority to repurchase $6.4 billion of equity from 2Q15 to  2Q16. The bank repurchased $2.5bn of equity in 2Q15 and 3Q15, leaving  approximately $3.9 billion of repurchase authority, based on the results of this  year's CCAR process.  JPM reports that it is in compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and  the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which Fitch views favorably. Through 3Q15  the bank reduced non-operating deposits by more than $150 billion; outpacing its  year-end target by over $50 billion. Total deposits are down more than $90  billion since the start of the year, but deposits in the consumer and community  banking segment are up $36.6 billion, given an increased focus on more stable  funding. Fitch views the deposit shift favorably, given the relative stability  of retail deposits and favorable treatment in liquidity ratios.   Overall the  bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $505 billion of high quality liquid  assets at Sept. 30, 2015. Earnings performance remains highly resilient, particularly on a relative basis,  given the firm's global reach and strong market position in a variety of  business lines. Adjusting for legal expenses, pre-tax earnings are down only  1.8% through the first three quarters of 2015, year over year, despite an  increase in provision expenses and a decline in the markets business. Credit  costs are expected to be a growing headwind heading into 2016, given portfolio  growth and normalization in certain asset categories, as are legal costs and  continued investment in the control agenda, but market share gains and improved  operating efficiencies are expected to serve as an offset.  JPM adjusted its operating expense guidance in 3Q15, reducing full year  expectations by $500 million, to $56.5 billion, which Fitch believes is  achievable with flat adjusted expenses in the fourth quarter. The bank is  targeting $2 billion of expense saves in consumer and community banking and  another $2.8 billion of cost reductions in the investment bank over the next  several years. Fitch believes these results are achievable and noted progress on  these goals was evident through 3Q15.  Legal expenses amounted to $2.3 billion through the first three quarters of the  year, up 31.4% year over year. Legal costs are likely to remain elevated in  coming quarters, but Fitch expects the incremental impact to earnings will be  manageable. Still, the emergence of material and unexpected litigation losses  could alter the agency's view, particularly if capital ratios are negatively  impacted. The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating consistency,  superior funding flexibility, strong liquidity, and gradual growth in capital  ratios. JPM has been relatively successful adapting its business model to the  evolving regulatory landscape and is expected to continue to make adjustments in  order to optimize its capital structure.  The VRs remain equalized between JPM and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of JPM and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between JPM and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes a  group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk at the operating company would be lower given total loss absorbing capacity  (TLAC). All U.S. bank subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as  U.S. banks are cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform,  Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and its subsidiaries  are all notched down from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of  each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk  profiles, which vary considerably.  Subordinated debt issued by the operating companies is rated at the same level  as subordinated debt issued by JPM reflecting the potential for subordinated  creditors in the operating companies to be exposed to loss ahead of senior  creditors in JPM. Subordinated lower Tier 2 debt is rated one notch below the VR  for loss severity, reflecting below average recoveries.  Legacy Tier 1 securities are generally rated four notches below the VR, made up  of two notches for high loss severity relative to average recoveries, and two  further notches for non-performance risk, reflecting the fact that coupon  omission is not fully discretionary.  High and low trigger contingent capital Tier 1 instruments are rated five  notches below the VR. The issues are notched down twice for loss severity,  reflecting poor recoveries as the instruments can be converted to equity or  written down well ahead of resolution. In addition, they are also notched down  three times for very high non-performance risk, reflecting fully discretionary  coupon omission.  DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.'s and Chase Bank USA,  N.A.'s are rated one notch higher than the banks' IDRs and senior unsecured debt  because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S.  depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one notch above  JPM's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of TLAC requirements for U.S.  G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default  risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities relative to holding  company senior debt. In our view these buffers would provide substantial  protection to senior unsecured obligations in the domestic operating entities in  the event of group resolution, as they could be used to absorb losses and  recapitalize operating companies. Therefore, substantial holding company debt  reduces the likelihood of default on operating company senior obligations.  The 'F1+' Short-Term IDRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries reflects substantial  liquidity at the banks and typically higher core deposit funding, liquidity  resources at JPM that could be extended to the bank, and access to contingent  liquidity sources such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances. JPM's and its  non-bank operating companies' Short-Term IDRs at 'F1' reflect Fitch's view that  there is less surplus liquidity at these entities than at the bank, particularly  given their greater reliance on the holding company for liquidity. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that JPM  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to deliver  meaningful earnings growth, particularly in light of the current regulatory  environment. Higher capital charges and what remains difficult market conditions  present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may be encouraged to seek more  aggressive ways to generate profits that take advantage of regulatory changes.  However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity risk  management, and product diversity mitigate some of these concerns. Negative rating actions could result from reputational damage or legal sanctions  that impact the firm's market position and/or material asset quality weakening  which pressures JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital, deterioration  in liquidity levels, material and unexpected litigation losses, and/or failure  to sufficiently address weaknesses noted in regulatory consent orders and  internal reviews following material losses in the chief investment officer.  Further, significant risk management or operational failures that result in  material losses to the firm could also result in a negative rating action. Fitch considers JPM's ratings to be particularly sensitive to the degree and  scope of litigation risk going forward. Fitch recognizes that the large  litigation charges taken in recent years reflect JPM's desire to address  outstanding legal issues. To the extent JPM enters into any new and material  litigation settlements, Fitch will consider whether these effectively diminish  ongoing legal risks. Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the foreseeable  future given that its current rating level is among the highest of its peer  group and of the global bank universe.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for JPM and its subsidiaries' subordinated debt and other hybrid  capital ratings are primarily sensitive to a change in JPM's VRs. The  securities' ratings are also sensitive to a change in their notching, which  could arise if Fitch changes its assessment of the probability of their  non-performance relative to the risk captured in the issuers' VRs. This may  reflect a change in capital management in the group or an unexpected shift in  regulatory buffer requirements, for example. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in JPM's  long-and short-term IDR.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY Given that JPM's and the bank's VRs remain equalized, the bank's ratings are  broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect JPM's VR.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since JPM's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.

891,"   By Michelle Price | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Hong Kong's securities watchdog said on Tuesday it had fined JPMorgan HK$30 million ($3.87 million) for a range of control failures, including breaches in its dark pool business. The U.S. bank is the latest institution to fall foul of a broader crackdown by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on electronic trading and dark pools in the financial center. The SFC said in a statement published on Tuesday the bank's Hong Kong broking business had mistakenly routed principal orders into its off-exchange dark pool trading platform, despite advising the SFC the pool only matched client trades.Control failures also led the bank's broking and securities units to breach the rules governing how short sale trades are aggregated and documented. The SFC also found that 14 principal traders had been given incorrect access rights allowing them to see client orders. The breaches occurred between May 2010 and December 2012.  ""We have fully co-operated with the SFC and are pleased to have resolved these legacy issues in relation to certain aspects of our systems and controls in the institutional equities business in Hong Kong,"" a spokeswoman for JPMorgan said in a statement. ""The firm has strengthened its internal systems and controls to ensure compliance with the prevailing rules and regulations.""She added that the fine does not affect the bank's ability to continue serving clients.JPMorgan is the latest bank to be penalized for failings in its Hong Kong electronic trading franchise after the SFC stepped up scrutiny of this business amid a global regulatory push to clamp down on automated trading and dark pools. Dark pools are off-exchange share trading platforms that allow investors to keep their orders secret, with prices displayed after a transaction has taken place. French lender BNP Paribas' Asia unit paid HK$15 million ($1.9 million) to the SFC for dark pool control failures in August, while HSBC was fined HK$5 million ($640,000) in 2013 for providing inaccurate information about its dark pool.  Critics of the platforms say they distort public markets and disadvantage traditional investors, while their proponents say they offer an important source of liquidity.The total SFC fine, which comprises three separate penalties levied on the bank's three separate broking and securities Hong Kong entities, is one of the largest ever issued by the SFC, although it remains small compared with U.S. and European penalties.

892,"  HONG KONG Dec 15 Hong Kong's securities watchdog has fined U.S. bank JP Morgan HK$30 million ($3.87 million) for systems and control failings in its institutional equities business in Hong Kong, in one of the largest fines ever levied by the watchdog.In a statement published on Tuesday, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said an investigation had revealed that the bank had breached the watchdog's rules relating to short-selling, client facilitation and principal trading. The bank also breached the regulator's rules on dark-pool trading, making it the latest bank in the financial centre to fall foul of an SFC crackdown on these off-exchange share trading platforms.  In a statement, JP Morgan said: ""We have fully co-operated with the SFC and are pleased to have resolved these legacy issues in relation to certain aspects of our systems and controls in the institutional equities business in Hong Kong. The firm has strengthened its internal systems and controls to ensure compliance with the prevailing rules and regulations.""

911,"  WASHINGTON Jan 5 JPMorgan Chase has been fined $48 million for failing to meet terms of a settlement to resolve mortgage servicing violations, U.S. bank regulators said on Tuesday.The fine will be on top of another $2 billion that JPMorgan had been ordered to pay to cover remediation costs and foreclosure assistance to borrowers, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said. JPMorgan was among a number of banks which participated in a 2013 nationwide settlement with regulators over the practice of robo-signing, in which banks pursued faulty foreclosures by using defective or fraudulent documents.

925,"   By Olivia Oran and Dan Freed  Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on Wednesday promoted its investment banking chief, Colm Kelleher, to president, making him the heir apparent to current Chief Executive James Gorman, and prompting Greg Fleming, the head of wealth management, to depart.Fleming, who was once seen as a likely successor to Gorman, before losing out in a management reshuffle in October, emailed the bank's 15,800 brokers to tell them the new year would bring challenges ""on the horizon beyond Morgan Stanley.""Speaking at a Reuters event last June, Fleming said he hoped to reshape the bank's wealth management's workforce in the coming years to include more women and millennial advisers, and was investing more in the firm's technology in order to attract them.Fleming, who is seen by Wall Street power brokers as CEO material and ambitious to lead a major company, declined Morgan Stanley's offer to stay on and told the firm this week he was leaving, a source said.In addition to becoming president, Kelleher, 58, will take on Fleming's responsibilities overseeing wealth management. His elevation to president makes him the second most powerful executive at Morgan Stanley and the obvious successor to Gorman, who is nearly six years into a turnaround plan.But Gorman, 57, is in no hurry to leave, and because they are close in age, there is no guarantee that Kelleher will eventually replace him.Other potential successors include Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan, head of trading Ted Pick and Shelley O’Connor, a veteran of the wealth management business who was promoted as co-head of the division on Wednesday along with Andy Saperstein.""James Gorman's going to be there a long time. I'm not really thinking about who's going to succeed him when he leaves,"" Sandler O’Neill analyst Jeff Harte said.A trading veteran known for his sarcastic sense of humor, Kelleher was Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer during the 2007-09 financial crisis and helped shrink the bank's balance sheet from $1 trillion in 2007 to $659 billion in 2008.“He achieved one of the most miraculous shrinkages of a company that I’ve ever seen ever,” Rafferty Capital Markets analyst Dick Bove said. Kelleher is currently overseeing a retrenchment of Morgan Stanley's fixed-income trading business, with 1,200 jobs set to be axed worldwide.Morgan Stanley's bond trading revenue slid 42 percent during the third quarter, in one of the bank's worst performances since the financial crisis. Shares of Morgan Stanley have fallen over 21 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a decrease of 12 percent from arch rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Bove said Kelleher's appointment was about creating a balance of power at Morgan Stanley between wealth management, where Gorman's expertise lies, and the securities unit overseen by Kelleher.""Why would you have two wealth management guys running the company? If you do that, you're signaling to anyone who doesn't work in wealth management that they have no future at Morgan Stanley,” he said.         It is the second time Kelleher, a 27-year veteran of the bank, has won out in internal power struggles.In 2012, Paul Taubman, one of Morgan Stanley's top dealmakers, left the bank after Kelleher was named as sole head of sales and trading, a division they had run jointly.A native of county Cork in Ireland, Kelleher spent a large part of his youth in England and currently splits his time between London and New York.SECOND TIME UNLUCKY  Fleming, who joined Morgan Stanley in 2009, was widely seen as a successor to Gorman. He helped grow Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm into an operation that generated nearly half of the firm's revenue as it shifted away from trading to more stable earnings. Fleming also steered the bank through its merger with Citigroup Inc's (C.N) Smith Barney brokerage. But his star appeared to fade in October when his responsibilities were narrowed to focusing solely on wealth management. The task of running the investment management unit, which he had led, was given to Dan Simkowitz, an investment banker who co-led the firm's stock- and debt-underwriting business.Fleming has been left at the altar before.During the financial crisis, a period when Fleming was president and chief operating officer at Merrill Lynch, the board of Merrill Lynch made him interim chief executive, but his role was short-lived. It hired John Thain, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executive, to fill the job permanently.After helping to negotiate the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America (BAC.N) at the height of the crisis, Fleming left Wall Street and went to teach at Yale Law School, his alma mater.Morgan Stanley lured him back to the banking world in 2010 and he gained clout after he steered Morgan Stanley Wealth Management through a complicated merger with Citigroup Inc's (C.N) Smith Barney brokerage, lifting the division's profit margins to a targeted level after a bumpy start.""Greg Fleming is a strong manager who could run something bigger or become CEO somewhere,"" said analyst Mike Mayo of securities firm CLSA. ""He got the job done in executing the brokerage merger and we wouldn't be surprised to see him running something bigger, or becoming CEO at another firm over time.""

926,"   By Sweta Singh  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) ended the year with a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost cuts and a smaller legal bill, and expressed confidence about its businesses in 2016 despite a grim start for stocks and energy prices.The biggest U.S. bank by assets - the first big lender to report since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate in mid-December - said it expected net interest income to rise by about $2 billion as a result of the hike and loan growth.JPMorgan forecast incremental increases in the amount of money set aside for losses on loans to the energy sector in the coming year, but said oil prices would need to remain at current levels for an extended period for provisions to be significant.The bank's shares rose as much as 3.5 percent in morning trading. Other bank shares also rose, as investors took JPMorgan's results and positive noises about the U.S. economy as indicators of the health of the sector.U.S. banks, like their global counterparts, have had a tough year as falling oil prices and worries about slowing growth in China contributed to weakness in credit markets.However, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told analysts that investors were adjusting to China's slowdown, and said there were winners and losers in the commodity rout.""Hopefully this will all settle down and it's not the beginning of something really bad,"" he said.""We're not forecasting a recession. We think the U.S. economy looks pretty good at this point.""Legal charges and the costs of meeting stricter capital requirements have also weighed on the lenders. And U.S. interest rates remain near historic lows even after the Fed rate hike. That has meant that cost cutting - the one thing banks can best control - has become a main driver of profits.Two of the bank's five business lines achieved profit increases - investment banking by 80 percent and consumer and community banking, the largest contributor to net income, by 10 percent. Income from commercial banking fell 21 percent.JPMorgan's total non-interest expenses fell 7.4 percent to $14.26 billion in the quarter, while legal expenses fell to $644 million from $1.1 billion.""We are very happy with our expense story for the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a call with reporters.Total compensation expenses fell 2.4 percent to $6.69 billion as the bank's employee count fell to 234,598, from 241,359 at the end of 2014. RECORD ANNUAL EARNINGS JPMorgan's net income rose 10.2 percent to $5.43 billion, boosting annual profit to a record $24.44 billion.On a per-share basis, the bank earned $1.32, handsomely beating the average analyst estimate of $1.25 per share.Total net revenue rose about 1 percent to $23.75 billion, topping the average estimate of $22.89 billion. Revenue from fixed-income trading, usually JPMorgan's most volatile business, fell 3 percent to $2.57 billion.The bank's balance sheet shrank 2.7 percent on a sequential basis to $2.35 trillion as of the end of December.Like other big banks, JPMorgan has been shedding assets to appease regulators, who fear its size could pose a risk to the financial system in the event of a failure.Provision for bad loans rose 49 percent to $1.25 billion. JPMorgan's shares were trading at $58.82 in early afternoon trading. The stock was the only one among the six big U.S. banks to finish 2015 in positive territory, rising 5.5 percent.But through Wednesday the shares had fallen 13.2 percent this year, the second worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the third and fourth biggest U.S. banks, report on Friday.

931,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co  will not expand its retail branch network into Washington, D.C. this year as Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon had hoped, a company spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday.The company concluded that venturing into a new market this year to compete for deposits and loans was not as promising as spending on other goals, said Trish Wexler.Dimon wants to build a beachhead of storefronts in a new territory because the government will not allow JPMorgan to expand by buying another retail bank. Banks are generally prohibited from acquiring a bank that would leave them with more than 10 percent of deposits in the United States.JPMorgan already has 11.2 percent of U.S. deposits, the third-biggest share, according to data compiled by SNL Financial. Bank of America Corp has the most with 12.3 percent and Wells Fargo & Co has 11.5 percent. Dimon said in April in his annual letter to shareholders that JPM can grow, despite the government restrictions, by opening offices in cities where it has never been. ""We hope to begin doing this in 2016,"" Dimon wrote.In July, Dimon told analysts in a conference call that the bank was considering ""attacking a new city for the first time, like in a major way, because we want to see how that works out."" But it is a complicated undertaking and bank executives are trying to pace their investments in the business.Moving into Washington with enough scale to be convenient for customers and efficient for the bank would require about 20 storefronts to start, said an executive who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. JPMorgan would likely have to find lots where it could erect new buildings and it would have to recruit and train staff, all in relatively short order. The cost could run roughly $50 million, the executive said. Providing top customer service would be critical because so many bank regulators and lawmakers live in the city.The bank has not asked regulators for permission to open in any new city, the executive said.Instead, the bank will first spend to fill gaps in JPMorgan's storefront coverage in its existing markets in California, Florida and Texas, as well as develop more mobile and online banking tools and remodel existing branches with better teller machines and spaces for selling loans and investment products.

932,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) executives said on Thursday they do not expect losses on the bank's oil and gas loans to accelerate with the pace and severity that the decline in oil market prices might suggest.""The oil folks have been surprisingly resilient,"" Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a conference call with analysts.His comment came after being challenged on whether the bank had boosted its reserves too little in the fourth quarter when it added $124 million to cover losses on its oil and gas portfolio. The portfolio amounted to $42 billion, 5.3 percent of wholesale loans and less than 2 percent of total assets, as of the end of September.At Citigroup Inc, (C.N) which is to report results on Friday, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said last month that sustained low oil prices would be the primary reason the bank would likely add to its reserves in the quarter.  Dimon said the damage to oil producers' revenue from lower prices had been offset somewhat by the fact that the cost of getting oil out of the ground has ""dropped dramatically, and probably much more than most of us would have expected.""  In some cases production costs are down as much as 50 percent, Dimon said earlier, on a call with journalists after posting quarterly results.How much money oil companies and their lenders could lose has become a big issue for investors, who have been shaken by losses surfacing in the junk energy bond market. Credit spreads, a measure of the market's view of risk, touched their highest levels on Wednesday as oil prices plunged to a new 12-year low. [L2N14Y15G]On Wednesday, energy-focused regional bank BOK Financial Corp BOK.O, which operates primarily in Oklahoma and Texas, said it expected a big jump in provisions for potential losses on its energy portfolio. [L3N14X5ML] A clutch of regional lenders, including Associated Banc-Corp (ASB.N) and Hancock Holding Co (HBHC.O) have upped their provisions in recent weeks. Dimon said the additional reserves at JPMorgan were mostly for smaller companies. ""We're not worried about the big oil companies,"" he said. Bank loans are backed by oil company assets and do not necessarily go bad when companies go into bankruptcy to restructure their obligations, he added.Still, JPMorgan expects to record additional expenses in coming quarters to increase its reserves for oil and gas loan losses, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. Dimon said he would prefer to build reserves more aggressively, but accounting rules limit the discretion that banks have in the those decisions.

933,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 14 JPMorgan Chase & Co  executives said on Thursday they do not expect losses on the bank's oil and gas loans to accelerate with the pace and severity that the decline in oil market prices might suggest.""The oil folks have been surprisingly resilient,"" Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a conference call with analysts.His comment came after being challenged on whether the bank had boosted its reserves too little in the fourth quarter when it added $124 million to cover losses on its oil and gas portfolio. The portfolio amounted to $42 billion, 5.3 percent of wholesale loans and less than 2 percent of total assets, as of the end of September.At Citigroup Inc, which is to report results on Friday, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said last month that sustained low oil prices would be the primary reason the bank would likely add to its reserves in the quarter.Dimon said the damage to oil producers' revenue from lower prices had been offset somewhat by the fact that the cost of getting oil out of the ground has ""dropped dramatically, and probably much more than most of us would have expected."" In some cases production costs are down as much as 50 percent, Dimon said earlier, on a call with journalists after posting quarterly results.How much money oil companies and their lenders could lose has become a big issue for investors, who have been shaken by losses surfacing in the junk energy bond market. Credit spreads, a measure of the market's view of risk, touched their highest levels on Wednesday as oil prices plunged to a new 12-year low. On Wednesday, energy-focused regional bank BOK Financial Corp, which operates primarily in Oklahoma and Texas, said it expected a big jump in provisions for potential losses on its energy portfolio.A clutch of regional lenders, including Associated Banc-Corp  and Hancock Holding Co have upped their provisions in recent weeks.Dimon said the additional reserves at JPMorgan were mostly for smaller companies. ""We're not worried about the big oil companies,"" he said. Bank loans are backed by oil company assets and do not necessarily go bad when companies go into bankruptcy to restructure their obligations, he added. Still, JPMorgan expects to record additional expenses in coming quarters to increase its reserves for oil and gas loan losses, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said.Dimon said he would prefer to build reserves more aggressively, but accounting rules limit the discretion that banks have in the those decisions. The rules aim to keep companies from boosting future earnings by reversing reserves they booked in excess.Lake repeated the bank's statement from October that if oil remains around $30 a barrel for 18 months, JPMorgan could add $500 million to $750 million to reserves.(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Tom Brown)",2016-01-14,JPM,"Thu Jan 14, 2016 | 3:32pm EST",JPMorgan rebuffs suggestions it too optimistic on energy loans,http://www.reuters.com//article/jpmorgan-results-energy-idUSL2N14Y1NW20160114?type=companyNews
934,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 14 (Fitch) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) produced modest net  revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 (4Q15), year over  year, as expected declines in market activity and higher provision expenses were  more than offset by overall cost efficiencies and strong core loan growth,  according to Fitch Ratings. Market volatility and depressed oil & gas prices  continued to plague a variety of segments, but the diversity of JPM's business  model and its strong market positioning supported the generation of record  revenues and earnings for the year. JPM's return on tangible common equity was  13% in 2015, which Fitch believes is strong for the peer group.  Unusual items in the quarter included $417 million of post-tax legal expense,  offset by $318 million of after-tax benefits related to a legal settlement.  Non-recurring items (on a pre-tax basis) included an $85 million gain associated  with the sale of a branch, a $160 million gain on the initial public offering of  Square, a $50 million impairment on leased corporate aircraft, and a $178  million benefit associated with recognizing the unamortized discount on certain  debt securities called at par.  For the first time in a long time, no reserve releases were noted, but there  were reserve builds of $124 million associated with the oil & gas portfolio and  $35 million related to metals & mining. While additional reserve builds in these  portfolios are expected in 2016, JPM does not believe they will be significant  unless commodity prices flat-line from here for an extended period. However,  should that occur, incremental reserves could be upwards of $750 million, which  was about 0.38% of Tier I capital at 4Q15.     Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) had a relatively quiet quarter but  generated a respectable return on equity (ROE) of 10%. As expected, revenues  were down, almost across the board, as declines in debt underwriting hurt  investment banking revenues and weaker currency and emerging markets activity  negatively impacted markets revenue. There was a $76 million reserve build in  the quarter, which included about $63 million of oil & gas exposure. Still, net  charge-offs in the segment, at 0.02%, remain very strong. Operating expenses  fell 20.4% from 4Q14 given reductions in legal and compensation expense.  Management had committed to $2.8 billion of expense reductions in CIB by the end  of 2017 and was about $1.3 billion through that target at year-end 2015 (YE15).  The Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment produced a ROE of about 18% in  the quarter driven by cost efficiencies and strong core loan growth, offset to  some extent by higher provision expenses. JPM is committed to reducing segment  expenses by $2 billion by the end of 2017 and the bank was halfway through that  target at YE15. Core loans were up 25% year over year, driven by growth in  mortgage loans, business banking, and auto.  Mortgage originations were down 2.2% in 4Q15 year over year, but on-balance  sheet loans were up 21.6% as JPM continued to retain high quality loans, adding  $16 billion of loans in the quarter and about $60 billion for the year. This  supported an 11.4% annual increase in net interest income for the segment.  Mortgage servicing revenue continued to decline, given a reduction in the  servicing book, and management expects non-interest revenue to be down about  $700 million in 2016. Credit trends in the real estate portfolio remained  strong, with non-PCI losses of 0.13% in the quarter; down 20 basis points (bps)  from 4Q14, driven by improvements in home equity and prime mortgage. The card, commerce solutions and auto segment generated an ROE of 24%, which was  a solid quarter, but year over year comparisons were impacted by several  non-recurring items. Net interest income was up due to loan growth, while  non-interest revenues were relatively flat on an adjusted basis. Operating  expenses rose 3.7% year over year given higher auto lease depreciation expense  and growth in marketing expenses.    Credit performance was strong, with card net charge-offs up 1 bp sequentially  and down 6 bps from 4Q14, to 2.42%. Card delinquencies were down 1 bps year over  year. Card charge-offs were 2.51% for the year and JPM expects losses to be  relatively flat in 2016. Segment net charge-off dollars were down 9.6% from  4Q14, but provision expense rose about 6.4%, given an absence of reserve  releases combined with loan growth. The allowance for loan losses, for the  segment, was 2.07% of ending loans in 4Q15, down 9 basis points sequentially.  Fitch believes credit metrics in the segment are at-or-near a bottom. Commercial Banking's (CB) contribution to earnings was up sequentially but down  year over year given a reduction in investment banking revenues, higher  operating expenses, and an increase in provision expense. Still, investment  banking revenue was a record $2.2 billion for the year. The growth in operating  expenses was impacted by $50 million of impairment on leased corporate aircraft  and higher investment in controls. Provision expense included $60 million of  higher reserves for the oil & gas portfolio and $26 million for the metals &  mining book. That said; segment credit performance remained strong with net  charge-offs of just 4 bps. Average segment loans grew 13.9% year over year,  driven by commercial real estate and commercial & industrial portfolios.  Asset management (AM) earnings were down 6.1% in the quarter given lower  performance fees on alternative products. Assets under management (AUM) declined  1.2% due largely to outflows in fixed income products, though total flows were  positive for the year. Average loans were up 6.7% in 4Q15, year over year, given  growth in mortgage and traditional loans, which supported expansion in net  interest income.  From a liquidity perspective, JPM's HQLA remained strong, at $496 billion in the  quarter and the bank reduced non-operating deposits by about $200 billion for  the year; which was double the bank's initial target. Over the same period,  total deposits are down by approximately $83.7 billion, as growth in more stable  balances helped to offset the decline. Fitch views this shift favorably, given  the relative stability of retail deposits and favorable treatment in liquidity  ratios.     JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common equity (CET1) ratio rose 20 bps sequentially, to  11.6%, given earnings retention and a decline in risk-weighted assets. The  bank's capital ratio was 10 bps lower under the advanced approach in 4Q15, but  JPM believes the standardized ratio will eventually be the binding constraint.  The supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 6.5% and 6.6% at the firm and bank  level, respectively.  In terms of G-SIB requirements, JPM reported a surprise reduction in its Method  2 G-SIB surcharge, and is now in the 3.5% bucket, according to its calculations.  This was driven by a reduction in non-operating deposits, a decrease in level 3  assets and a reduction in over-the-counter derivative notional amounts.  Additional work is expected in order to ensure the maintenance of the current  buffer, but Fitch views the reduction favorably, particularly if it has no  meaningful impact on JPM's market position and earnings potential.  JPM paid a dividend of $0.44 per share in the quarter, equating to a payout of  33.3% of reported earnings per share. The bank repurchased $1.2 billion of  equity in the quarter, leaving approximately $2.7 billion of repurchase  authority, based on the results of last year's CCAR process.

936,"  LONDON Royal Bank of Scotland could reach a settlement within weeks on claims it misled investors in selling U.S. mortgage-backed securities, passing another milestone in its recovery from the financial crisis, analysts said on Friday.U.S. authorities struck a $5.1 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs on Thursday, leaving British taxpayer-backed RBS as the only other major case involving mis-sold U.S. mortgage-backed bonds still to be resolved.Court documents filed in the United States in June suggested RBS could have to pay as much as $13 billion to settle the mortgage-backed securities claims, although some analysts' estimates are much lower. Analysts expect U.S. regulators will be keen to wrap up the case well before U.S. presidential election campaigning begins in earnest.""RBS is next in line and we would expect a settlement very soon,"" Chirantan Barua, analyst at Bernstein Research, said.""These are things from the last crisis and we are already into the next one ... I feel the U.S. regulators want things done before the end of Obama's presidency, maybe even before the primaries start,"" he said, referring to votes held to choose candidates for the U.S. presidential race, which begin next month.The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Although costly, investors and analysts say a settlement would be a major step in RBS's recovery from financial crisis in 2007-2009, when it was rescued with a 46 billion pound ($65.75 billion) government bailout. The British government still holds a 73 percent stake. RBS has so far set aside 1.9 billion pounds ($2.7 bln) to deal with the claims.""This is the final step before RBS resumes dividends and potentially returns excess capital. It resolves the biggest tail risk for the bank,"" Barua said.RBS's Chief Executive Ross McEwan told reporters on a third-quarter earnings call in October that the bank wanted to get the mortgage issue dealt with, but the timing was really in the hands of the United States. The U.S. investigation into RBS has focused on allegations it misled some investors in securities backed by residential mortgages during the financial crisis.   These are bonds backed by home loans that are packaged up and sold to investors. The process, known as securitization, is used by banks to help to finance mortgage lending.""After the Goldman settlement, and as time moves on, you would assume that an RBS settlement would be imminent,"" Alex Potter, banking analyst at Mirabaud Securities said. ""RBS are keen to get on with it because it's the last big regulatory uncertainty for the bank.""  The U.S. Department of Justice and state officials have already struck settlements with several U.S. banks including JP Morgan, Bank of America and Citigroup over the sale of mortgage-backed securities. The Goldman settlement is at the lower end of previous penalties. Bank of America reached a $16.65 billion settlement in 2014 while JP Morgan settled for $13 billion in 2013.Bernstein estimated RBS could face fines of $7.5 billion from the U.S. Department of Justice and other agencies, but said it could be as high as $13 billion in a worst case scenario.

941,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) directors raised Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's total compensation by 35 percent to $27 million for 2015, a regulatory filing on Thursday showed.But the board cut the cash portion and tied three-fourths of the total to more performance-sensitive stock awards, the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said.The company pegged Dimon's base salary at $1.5 million, the same as a year earlier, and set his variable compensation at $5 million in cash and $20.5 million in performance share units. A year earlier the cash portion was $7.4 million and $11.1 million of stock came in more secure restricted stock units.The package was changed to tie more of Dimon's compensation to objective measures of performance and leave less leeway for judgment and is a response to investor complaints that Dimon's pay was too arbitrary, according to a person familiar with the matter. How Dimon's pay is set is sensitive at JPMorgan. At the company's last annual meeting in May, Dimon contended that criticism of the company's compensation by services advising institutional investors on proxy votes was off base in its view that more restrictive formulas are better.The services usually comment on compensation packages once companies fill their annual proxy statements discussing rationales for pay.

946,"   By William James and Rachel Armstrong | LONDON  LONDON Jan 21 Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are making large donations to the campaign to keep Britain inside the European Union, sources said, highlighting the concern among some of the world's biggest banks over the impact of a British exit.Goldman Sachs has agreed to donate a ""substantial six-figure sum"" according to one source, while JPMorgan  was preparing to make a similar donation, another source familiar with the matter said.In the face of growing Euroscepticism among the British electorate and political pressure from within his own party, Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on Britain's EU membership by the end of 2017.On Thursday, Cameron was preparing to urge business leaders at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos to speak up in favour of Britain staying in a reformed EU.Cameron is hoping to head off the threat of a British exit, or 'Brexit', by negotiating a package of reforms to the bloc that address concerns about immigration, sovereignty and competitiveness. He received some support on Thursday from French President Francois Hollande, who said none of Britain's EU reform demands were ""insurmountable"", but that they must not prevent the euro zone from pursuing further integration.But with British public opinion finely balanced and renegotiations with Cameron's EU peers meeting resistance, multinational businesses in Britain are facing up to the risk that the vote could sever links with the country's biggest trading partner.A spokesman for pro-EU group Britain Stronger in Europe, the expected recipient of the donations, said it had a broad range of backers: ""This includes many small donors, philanthropists and businesses worried by job losses and price rises if we were to leave."" Until a date for the referendum is set, campaigns on both sides can accept and spend donations without restriction. However they may be required to declare details of prior donors once the government sets a referendum date. Spending will be capped during the period immediately before the referendum.""THE ESTABLISHMENT"" The donations were dismissed as ""no surprise"" by Leave.EU, one of several pro-Brexit campaigns, which says the EU works against ordinary Britons and protects vested political and commercial interests. ""The referendum will be a campaign of the British people against the establishment of international bankers, multinational corporate tax dodgers and out-of-touch politicians,"" said Arron Banks, the group's co-founder.Arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party whose popularity put pressure on Cameron to make the offer of a referendum, described the donations as ""the unholy alliance of big banks and big politics.""Cameron, however, is keen to enlist the support of businesses to help his reform agenda clear political hurdles in other European capitals, and to illustrate the damage that he believes leaving the bloc would do to the country's economy.""If you believe like I do that Britain is better off in a reformed European Union ... then when the time comes, help me make that case for Britain to stay,"" he will say in Davos later on Thursday.""This is a once in a generation moment - and the stakes are high.""

964,"   By Olivia Oran  Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and other U.S. banks are looking at ways to slash expenses further this year as market turmoil, declining oil prices and concerns about Germany's Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) have sent the sector's shares down sharply.""We can absolutely do a lot more on the cost side if we have to, especially now, when you have to deliver a return,"" Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said on Tuesday at the Credit Suisse financial services forum in Miami. ""We take a particular and energetic look at continued cost cuts when revenues are stalled,"" he said. "" ... Necessity is the mother of invention.""U.S. Bancorp Chief Financial Officer Kathy Rogers echoed Blankfein's comments at a separate panel, saying her bank would keep cutting costs this year. She cited a smaller chance that interest rates would rise, which would have indicated a stronger economy and more revenue for the bank.BB&T Corp (BBT.N) CEO Kelly King said the bank has rejected broad-based layoffs so far and remains focused on managing expenses in a way that will not hurt business in the long-term.""Cutting expenses with a butcher's knife and a bad attitude is not going to produce good results,"" he said. As executives were speaking at the conference, Deutsche Bank shares hit a record low, following their 9.5 percent plunge on Monday. Although the bank has said it has sufficient reserves, investors have worried that it will not be able to repay some bonds that are coming due. The bonds, called AT1 securities, convert into equity in times of market stress. Deutsche Bank's woes reflect broader concerns about the health and profitability of euro zone banks. Last week, Sanford Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua said Barclays Plc (BARC.L) should spin off its investment bank in an effort to revive its core UK retail and commercial business.Major Wall Street banks have also had a brutal start to 2016, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank index down 18 percent on concerns about profitability. Most of the large U.S. banks ended trading on Tuesday with shares flat, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) closed up 1.2 percent. Since demand for U.S. bank shares began to weaken in late November, the sector's top five stocks have lost 20 percent of their market capitalization, or around $120 billion.    Almost 70 percent of the banks deemed globally significant are trading below their tangible book values, or what they would be worth if liquidated. Analysts say if this continues, banks may have to restructure more drastically to cut costs.    Investors said bank executives would need to look at other ways to boost profitability now that hopes for further interest rate hikes have faded.     ""They're going to have to come up with other levers to pull, whether it is investing in technology or reducing headcount,"" said John Fox, chief investment officer at Feinmore Asset Management, which invests in financials. ""There will be more pressure on expenses because of the interest rate environment."" NOT SINGING ""KUMBAYA"" Banks have already engaged in major cost-cutting over the last several years, as low interest rates and strict regulations have crimped profits in areas like fixed income trading.At Goldman, headcount in its troubled fixed-income trading business has already declined 10 percent since 2012, Blankfein said. The bank has transferred many jobs to lower-cost locations like Bengaluru, India, Salt Lake City and Dallas, where 25 percent of its employees are now based.  Goldman is also looking for ways to reduce payments to outside vendors.Other U.S. banks have been taking similar steps.Morgan Stanley said in January it planned to cut another $1 billion in costs by 2017 by leaning more on technology and increased outsourcing. Last year, it eliminated about 25 percent of jobs in its fixed income division as it tries to lift its profitably to 10 percent.     JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) investment bank is in the middle of a $2.8 billion expense-reduction program.

Negative interest rates are potentially damaging for banks' balance sheets and net interest margins, a concern that has contributed to current global market turmoil.But the rates' lower limits are far below what many have assumed, the JP Morgan report concludes, suggesting banks could absorb the extra hit more easily than feared.The Bank of Japan and European Central Bank have already adopted negative interest rates on bank deposits, while official lending rates in Switzerland and Sweden are negative.

Bank of England studies have put a rough limit to negative central bank rates at about minus 0.5 percent - the point below which banks would find it cheaper to hoard physical cash than pay fees for depositing it.""Our analysis suggests that the use of these schemes could allow for considerably lower policy rates without undue pressure on bank profitability,"" the economists wrote.""Central banks are likely to move cautiously into NIRP as they are sensitive to the uncertain consequences of these policies on local markets,"" Barr said.

They're also expected to offer some fresh details on how the bank is using technology to improve operations and slash costs - an initiative Dimon and his deputies have long been touting.But for the first time in years, JPMorgan is not expected to expand further its cost-cutting targets. The bank is only halfway through a previously announced $4.8 billion cost-cutting target, and cutting any deeper could hurt its businesses, analysts said. JPMorgan has already cut more than 25,000 jobs since 2011.That would run counter to what other big banks have been doing. Executives from banks including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Bank of America Corp and U.S. Bancorp have all recently talked about further cost-cutting efforts. Because of that, and the troubles at European rivals, top brass at JPMorgan have an incentive to reinvest in key businesses to take market share from competitors who are pulling back.""This is the sort of environment that Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan live for: sluggishness in the environment, competitors feeling pain,"" said Mike Mayo, a bank stock analyst with CLSA. Even so, analysts said they and their investor clients will want more insight into how JPMorgan strikes the fine balance between cutting costs to protect profits, and spending money for growth at a time when interest rates remain stubbornly low and the economy shows signs of becoming sluggish.Some analysts and investors worry that JPMorgan may have to lower its profit target again.The bank's publicly stated goal going into investor day is to achieve a 15 percent return on tangible common shareholder capital over the long term. That is down from a 16 percent target in 2013, which JPMorgan lowered to a range of 15-to-16 percent in 2014. JPMorgan delivered returns of 13 percent in both 2014 and 2015. ""What is that going to be and how can they get there without higher interest rates?"" said Chris Mutascio, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. He should have an answer at 6:45 a.m. on Tuesday, when JPMorgan is expected to post a slidedeck on its website ahead of the event.Last year, executives showed a slide in which higher rates would contribute about half of the additional profits needed to reach the 15 percent target. But, with the exception of the small boost to rates from the Federal Reserve in December, that tailwind has not appeared.JPMorgan's investor day is about more than just one bank. As the biggest U.S. lender by assets, with widespread consumer and investment banking operations, its executives are well placed to offer broad perspectives on the state of banking and the global economy.

980,"  * London Mayor Johnson's defection unnerves currency market* On track for biggest daily loss vs dollar since 2010* Bond markets also hit, raising UK yields* Less impact on stock market as global mood improvesBy Patrick GrahamLONDON, Feb 22 Sterling headed towards its biggest loss in almost six years against the dollar on Monday as traders homed in on narrowing bookmaker odds on a British exit from the European Union, but the weaker pound lifted UK blue chip stocks.The scale of the reaction on sterling, an almost 2 percent fall driven chiefly by the defection of London Mayor Boris Johnson to the ""out"" camp on Sunday, also sent government bond prices spiralling lower.London's stock markets, however, were up more than 1 percent.""The out camp were struggling to get a figurehead who was popular and Boris has given them that boost,"" said Alvin Tan, a strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London. ""There is genuine worry that Britain might vote to leave and the uncertainty is going to rise into the referendum.""The cost of hedging against falls in the exchange rate shot up to its highest in more than four years and the Bank of England's trade-weighted measure of the pound's value hit a 15-month low.Concern over Britain's possible exit from the EU -- ""Brexit"" -- have been at the heart of a fall in sterling since November and several banks are now talking up the chances of a slide to as little as $1.30 from $1.4155 on Monday.""We've not seen many Brexit trades being put on (today) but our corporate desk is seeing more hedging being put on by corporates who have sterling exposure,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Jacob Nell said.Nell, who expects the pound to fall to $1.30 by the end of 2016 in the event of a Brexit, said he would be watching for signs of how active Johnson plans to be in campaigning in the months ahead. Opinion polls and further turbulence around migration or terrorist attacks on cities in Europe may also shift sentiment, he said.STOCK SPLIT Beyond the currency, the impact on business, banking and policy of a four-month run-in to the June 23 vote looks more nuanced. Some banks have raised the prospect of the Bank of England cutting record-low interest rates further to offset any damage to economic growth in the short-term.That might weaken the pound but could further inflate the value of other assets including stocks seen as well-insulated against the negatives of a Brexit.U.S. bank JP Morgan recommended buying British exporters against domestically focussed companies and blue chip stocks over smaller-cap stocks.""In the event of the UK leaving, the initial knee-jerk impact on the market could be quite negative,"" JPM said.""But we believe the resulting weakness of sterling and the BoE action will cushion a chunk of the fall in equities.""The FTSE 100 index rose 1.4 percent while the smaller-cap FTSE 250 gained less - around 1 percent.""We expect UK markets to be volatile over coming days as the campaigns step up a gear, but our central case remains that the UK population will decide to remain in the EU,"" UBS economists Dean Turner and Bill O'Neill wrote in a note.""Our 'Brexit' probability remains at 30 percent as we monitor the public response to the agreement with other EU members.""

984,"   By David Henry and Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) signalled a rough first quarter on Tuesday with double-digit declines in investment banking revenues and a $500 million increase in provisions for expected losses on energy loans. Plummeting oil prices, volatile markets, stubbornly low interest rates, pressure from regulators and a slowdown in China have combined to hurt banks worldwide over the past few months.Against such a backdrop, companies are either shying away from or unable to issue debt and equity and investors are reluctant to take on more risk, said Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's head of investment banking.""There is no doubt that so far it has been a very tough quarter,"" Pinto said during a presentation at the bank's investor day in New York.JPMorgan's investment banking fee revenues were down 25 percent so far this quarter compared with a year ago and its trading revenues were 20 percent lower, although Pinto said some of the decline in trading was due to a strong year-ago performance when JPMorgan profited from Switzerland's decision to remove its currency cap.The biggest U.S. bank by assets also gave itself another year to meet one of its most important profit goals, as hopes for higher interest rates fade, hampering the bank's ability to make profits on its loans.JPMorgan's shares closed down 4.18 percent, helping to drag down the S&P financials index .SPSY 1.8 percent.IT'S ONLY JUST BEGUN  Thousands of jobs have been cut in the U.S. energy industry alone and roughly a third of oil producers, or 175 companies, are at high risk of slipping into bankruptcy this year, according to a study by Deloitte, increasing the risk that bank loans will not be repaid.JPMorgan's move to raise its energy loan loss reserves by over 60 percent comes a month after the bank said oil companies were ""surprisingly resilient,"" but a drop in the price of oil CLc1 LCOc1 below $30 a barrel in January has made the situation worse.Around half of the increase in reserves for oil and gas loans was concentrated on a couple of corporate clients, the bank said.""There will be a meaningful number of these players who have no options. I think we have only begun to see the range of bankruptcies in oil and gas,” said Doug Petno, the head of JP Morgan's commercial bank.      Under a ""relatively severe"" scenario, with oil prices at $25 a barrel for 18 months, the bank said it would have to set aside an additional $1.5 billion in reserves. JPMorgan's oil and gas loan portfolio amounted to $42 billion, or less than 2 percent of total assets, as of the end of September, according to the bank's latest available data.The global rout in commodities is beating up banks worldwide. Standard Chartered Plc (STAN.L), which is heavily exposed to energy and mining, reported its first annual loss since 1989 on Tuesday after bad loans soared.JPMorgan's U.S. rivals stockpiled their defenses against energy losses last month with Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) raising provisions against soured assets by more than 70 percent, nearly half of them for oil and gas loans. [L8N14Z40K]JPMorgan also expects to increase reserves for metals and mining loan exposure by $100 million to $350 million.The bank said it had not seen any significant contagion from the troubles in the energy sector into its other lending businesses such as commercial real estate and business banking. RATES DISAPPOINTMENT Lake said JPMorgan was now targeting 2018 rather than 2017 to meet its profitability target of a 15-percent return on tangible common equity as hopes fade that the U.S. Federal Reserve will follow up its quarter-percentage-point December rate hike with more increases this year.JPMorgan achieved a 13-percent return on tangible common equity last year. Lake declined to say when she expected the Fed to resume its rate increases.Despite market volatility and rising provisions, JPMorgan did not ramp up its cost-cutting targets as it has in previous years. The bank is only halfway through a previously announced $4.8 billion cost-cutting plan, and further belt tightening could hurt its businesses, according to analysts.Rivals such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) have all recently talked about further cost-cutting efforts.The bank also predicted ""massive uncertainty"" if Britain, the home of JP Morgan's European headquarters, votes to exit the European Union in a referendum on June 23.

987,"  NEW YORK Cash-strapped energy firms are coming under increasing pressure from U.S. bank lenders and, on average, could see a 15 percent to 20 percent cut in their credit lines, the head of JP Morgan's (JPM.N) commercial bank told investors on Tuesday.Until now, banks could be more lenient with their energy clients despite a prolonged slump in the price of oil, but Doug Petno, the head of JP Morgan's commercial bank, said that is changing.Moves, disclosed in securities filings, by oil and gas companies such as Linn Energy LINE.O and SandRidge Energy to max out revolving credit lines - designed to cover short-term funding gaps - have prompted banks to take action.Petno said JP Morgan was not waiting for April, when banks traditionally reassess the value of oil reserves underpinning energy loans - a process known as redetermination - to reassess its exposure.“We are not waiting for the spring redetermination to discuss this with our clients,"" he said during a presentation at JP Morgan's annual investor day in New York. Petno said JP Morgan had been working closely with its energy customers through the current price rout.

988,"   By David Henry and Dan Freed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) signalled a rough first quarter on Tuesday with double-digit declines in investment banking revenues and a $500 million increase in provisions for expected losses on energy loans. Plummeting oil prices, volatile markets, stubbornly low interest rates, pressure from regulators and a slowdown in China have combined to hurt banks worldwide over the past few months.Against such a backdrop, companies are either shying away from or unable to issue debt and equity and investors are reluctant to take on more risk, said Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's head of investment banking.""There is no doubt that so far it has been a very tough quarter,"" Pinto said during a presentation at the bank's investor day in New York.JPMorgan's investment banking fee revenues were down 25 percent so far this quarter compared with a year ago and its trading revenues were 20 percent lower, although Pinto said some of the decline in trading was due to a strong year-ago performance when JPMorgan profited from Switzerland's decision to remove its currency cap.The biggest U.S. bank by assets also gave itself another year to meet one of its most important profit goals, as hopes for higher interest rates fade, hampering the bank's ability to make profits on its loans.JPMorgan's shares closed down 4.18 percent, helping to drag down the S&P financials index .SPSY 1.8 percent.IT'S ONLY JUST BEGUN  Thousands of jobs have been cut in the U.S. energy industry alone and roughly a third of oil producers, or 175 companies, are at high risk of slipping into bankruptcy this year, according to a study by Deloitte, increasing the risk that bank loans will not be repaid.JPMorgan's move to raise its energy loan loss reserves by over 60 percent comes a month after the bank said oil companies were ""surprisingly resilient,"" but a drop in the price of oil CLc1 LCOc1 below $30 a barrel in January has made the situation worse.Around half of the increase in reserves for oil and gas loans was concentrated on a couple of corporate clients, the bank said.""There will be a meaningful number of these players who have no options. I think we have only begun to see the range of bankruptcies in oil and gas,” said Doug Petno, the head of JP Morgan's commercial bank.      Under a ""relatively severe"" scenario, with oil prices at $25 a barrel for 18 months, the bank said it would have to set aside an additional $1.5 billion in reserves. JPMorgan's oil and gas loan portfolio amounted to $42 billion, or less than 2 percent of total assets, as of the end of September, according to the bank's latest available data.The global rout in commodities is beating up banks worldwide. Standard Chartered Plc (STAN.L), which is heavily exposed to energy and mining, reported its first annual loss since 1989 on Tuesday after bad loans soared.JPMorgan's U.S. rivals stockpiled their defenses against energy losses last month with Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) raising provisions against soured assets by more than 70 percent, nearly half of them for oil and gas loans. [L8N14Z40K]JPMorgan also expects to increase reserves for metals and mining loan exposure by $100 million to $350 million.The bank said it had not seen any significant contagion from the troubles in the energy sector into its other lending businesses such as commercial real estate and business banking. RATES DISAPPOINTMENT Lake said JPMorgan was now targeting 2018 rather than 2017 to meet its profitability target of a 15-percent return on tangible common equity as hopes fade that the U.S. Federal Reserve will follow up its quarter-percentage-point December rate hike with more increases this year.JPMorgan achieved a 13-percent return on tangible common equity last year. Lake declined to say when she expected the Fed to resume its rate increases.Despite market volatility and rising provisions, JPMorgan did not ramp up its cost-cutting targets as it has in previous years. The bank is only halfway through a previously announced $4.8 billion cost-cutting plan, and further belt tightening could hurt its businesses, according to analysts.Rivals such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) have all recently talked about further cost-cutting efforts.The bank also predicted ""massive uncertainty"" if Britain, the home of JP Morgan's European headquarters, votes to exit the European Union in a referendum on June 23.

998,"  * Banks accused of rigging municipal derivatives prices* More than $226 million settlements reached overall* JPMorgan, others settled with U.S. Department of JusticeBy Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, Feb 24 UBS AG, Natixis SA  and four other banks and brokerages agreed to pay just over $100 million to settle investor claims that they conspired to rig prices for municipal securities.If approved by a federal judge, the settlements disclosed on Wednesday would end seven years of private class action litigation, and result in more than $226 million of payouts from 11 defendants. The plaintiffs, including the City of Baltimore and the Central Bucks School District in Pennsylvania, accused the defendants of conspiring to fix prices for municipal derivatives, causing them to receive lower interest rates than they would have gotten in a competitive marketplace.Municipalities that sell bonds typically invest proceeds  they do not need to spend immediately elsewhere, and hire banks and brokers to seek out competitive bids.The defendants were accused of abusing this process through such means as getting advance peeks at their rivals' bids, or purposely submitting non-winning bids. Wednesday's settlements include $32 million with UBS, $28.45 million with France's Natixis, $25.41 million with Societe Generale, $9.75 million with Piper Jaffray Cos , $3.5 million with Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc's  National Westminster Bank, and $1.4 million with George K. Baum & Co, court papers show.The defendants denied wrongdoing. Their settlements require approval by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan. Other defendants that have settled include JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp , General Electric Co and Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan's $44.6 million settlement was the largest.A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The U.S. Department of Justice and state regulators have also prosecuted corruption in the municipal bond markets.At least five banks agreed to pay more than $740 million in penalties, restitution and disgorgement, including $228 million for JPMorgan, and at least 17 people have been convicted or pleaded guilty, the Justice Department has said.The case is In re: Municipal Derivatives Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-02516.

999,"  LONDON Feb 25 Up to $430 billion of yuan bonds could join JPMorgan's widely used emerging currency debt index once some key regulatory hurdles are scrapped, giving China a 10 percent weight in the benchmark, the bank said.The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Wednesday said more foreign institutions would be allowed to invest in domestic interbank bond markets, while other entities, including pension funds and charities, would also be allowed in once they are approved by the PBOC (www.pbc.gov.cn/).Easier access for a broader set of foreign investors brings the world's third-largest bond market a step closer to meeting entry criteria for emerging debt indexes.But JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used indexes of emerging debt, said Beijing's stipulation of a minimum three-month holding period for investors and monthly withdrawal limits after that were stumbling blocks for China's inclusion in JPM's GBI-EM index of government bonds denominated in emerging currencies Once these restrictions are removed, China can join the GBI-EM with a 10 percent weight, the maximum allowed for any one country JPM said in a note received on Thursday.""There is an estimated $180 billion in (assets under management) tracking the GBI-EM Global Diversified. We estimate the total debt stock of yuan-denominated government bonds is close to $1.5 trillion, of which around $430 billion would be index eligible,"" JPM said. Membership of global indexes that contain both developed and emerging debt is still some way off for China, the bank noted. That is because benchmarks such as JPMorgan's Global Investment Grade Aggregate have more stringent criteria than EM indexes, requiring members to be completely accessible to foreigners without any capital controls or barriers to entry. China's inclusion in the GBI-EM will raise Asia's weight in the index to 35.4 percent from the current 29.4 percent, though countries such as Thailand and Indonesia could be cut by 1.8 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.Other notable reductions will be in Hungary and Turkey, whose weight could fall by 1.0 to 1.4 percent, JPM added.(Reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)",2016-02-25,JPM,"Thu Feb 25, 2016 | 5:24am EST",Up to $430 bln in yuan bonds may join EM index in future-JPMorgan,http://www.reuters.com//article/emerging-china-index-idUSL8N1642HR?type=companyNews
1000,"   By Philip Scipio  NEW YORK, Feb 29 (IFR) - JP Morgan has swiftly severed ties with a top bond trader who circumvented its compliance procedures earlier this year as the bank moves to reinforce its commitment to risk management.The bank fired its head of US Treasury trading Andrew Lombara in the second week of January, according to a regulatory filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.The dispute centered around Lombara's ""failure to adhere to certain control processes,"" prompting JP Morgan to ask for his resignation, said the US bank. A Finra spokesman said the regulator will review the firing as a matter of practice as it does with all dismissals for cause.

1001,"  (Adds details of competition)NEW YORK Feb 29 JPMorgan Chase & Co  will offer a richer cash-back credit card in April to better compete against products from Capital One Financial Corp  and Citigroup Inc.The new ""Freedom Unlimited"" card will pay back 1.5 percent on all purchases, a higher standard rate than its current Freedom card, Pamela Codispoti, president of Chase Consumer Branded Cards, said in an interview.The new card is the latest salvo in credit card wars that have escalated in recent years due to new regulations imposed on other bank businesses after the financial crisis.Capital One's Quicksilver card is currently the best cash-back card for customers with limited, fair or good credit scores, according to cardhub.com. It pays back 1.5 percent. Citi's Double Cash Card, which pays 2 percent, is rated best for people with excellent credit. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said at the company's annual investor day conference last week that Chase would ""have a new card coming out that would compete better with (Capital One's) cash-back product.""Citi's 2 percent rate, introduced in September 2014, is at the limit of profitability because banks often collect less than that amount from merchants who accept the cards, industry experts have said. Last year, Citi raised the stakes for co-branded cards with retailers and travel companies when it took the Costco Wholesale Corp business from American Express Co. Since then, JPMorgan has agreed to give up some $900 million in annual revenue to renew some co-brand deals.Chase is the biggest issuer of general purpose credit cards in the United States, according to the Nilson Report. It also operates the biggest wholly-owned business handling payments to merchants for their card transactions. JPMorgan's card operations earned $3.9 billion in 2015, accounting for 16 percent of total net income.The credit card business is attractive for banks because it does not face the same fee restrictions as debit cards under post-crisis regulations. And, it requires less capital than trading businesses.Codispoti said the Freedom Unlimited card will available as an alternative, or a companion, to Chase's current Freedom card, whose standard cash-back rate is back 1 percent. It also offers quarterly specials of 5 percent back on changing categories of spending, such as groceries or gasoline, up to $1,500.""I don't think we were late, per se,"" with the simpler, richer cash-back card, she said. Different customers like different offers and some like the current Freedom card, she said.

1005,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former JPMorgan Chase & Co  investment adviser was sentenced to five years in prison on Tuesday after admitting that he stole at least $20 million from client accounts to fund a gambling addiction and to trade in stock options.Michael Oppenheim, 49, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to forfeit almost $20.2 million and pay restitution to JPMorgan after pleading guilty in November to charges of embezzlement and securities fraud.In court, Oppenheim said he was horrified by his conduct, which led him to steal a ""mind-boggling"" sum. But he sought mercy from the court, saying his actions stemmed from his gambling addition, ""a destructive disease.""""I wish I had stopped or sought help, but I kept going,"" he said. According to U.S. prosecutors and securities regulators, Oppenheim worked with about 500 wealthy clients as a vice president and private client adviser in JPMorgan's midtown Manhattan offices.Prosecutors said that from 2008 to 2015, Oppenheim persuaded clients to let him withdraw some of their money, in some cases millions of dollars, falsely claiming he would invest it in low-risk municipal bonds. In other cases, Oppenheim, who lived in Livingston, New Jersey, simply took their money without permission, prosecutors said.In court papers, Oppenheim's lawyer, Paul Shechtman, had urged Torres to be lenient in sentencing, saying his client's crime, while serious, was fueled by a ""pathological gambling addiction that has haunted him for much of his adult life."" But Torres said while she recognized his gambling addiction drove the conduct, his offense was serious, and mitigating factors ""do not alleviate the need for punishment.""At the time of Oppenheim's arrest in April 2015, JPMorgan issued a statement saying it had alerted U.S. authorities, noting that it was ""angry that this person violated the trust our clients place in us.""The case is U.S. v.

1012,"   By Koh Gui Qing | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. energy companies facing a likely cut in their bank loans are seeking a costly alternative - borrowing from private equity firms at hefty interest rates to stay alive for longer.In a sign of the times, U.S. oil and gas producer Clayton Williams Energy Inc said this month it was borrowing $350 million from private equity firm Ares Management LP  to replace an equivalent loan from a group of banks.The loan from Ares is the first publicly-known deal of its kind, and does not come cheap.Ares will charge interest rates more than triple that collected by banks, win the rights to buy up to 18.5 percent of outstanding Clayton shares and can appoint two directors to Clayton's board. Crucially, it could also give Ares control over Clayton's assets if it should fall into bankruptcy.Clayton and Ares declined to comment when reached.But like other cash-strapped energy firms, Clayton does not have a choice. Tens of billions worth of loans are expected to be downsized - or ""re-determined"" - across the energy sector this spring as banks pare their exposure to the battered industry, a Reuters calculation showed.Desperate to hang on to their sources of financing, energy companies are likely to accept stringent deal terms they may not have accepted in normal times. Indeed, some are also restructuring their debt with bondholders.""The deal here for Ares gives them an opportunity to win in almost every situation,"" said John Sirico, an analyst at independent credit research firm Covenant Review.More of such deals could be struck this spring as loans get renegotiated, he said, and private equity firms with big credit arms such as Blackstone Group LP, Apollo Global Management LLC and Oaktree Capital Management  are likely to take the lead. Blackstone, Apollo and Oaktree declined to comment.The worst energy slump in 12 years that has seen oil prices  tumble 65 percent since mid-2014 has cost tens of thousands of jobs and triggered dozens of bankruptcies.With oil prices widely expected to hover around $40 this year, many analysts expect many more companies to fall into bankruptcy in coming months.U.S. banks have been increasing the amount of money they set aside to cover energy-related losses and some have been looking to sell blocks of distressed energy loans to private equity firms, to remove the risk from their balance sheet.

The loans allowed borrowers to use the cash when they needed to, much like a credit card.Often priced at a couple of percentage points above benchmark rates, revolvers were the cheapest form of financing for energy producers and were considered mostly risk-free by banks.But as oil prices plunged, banks, under pressure by regulators to shed risky business, started slashing loans to energy businesses since October. U.S. oil and gas producers Energy XXI Ltd and Rex Energy Corp said on Tuesday their credit lines had been cut by banks, regulatory filings showed. Some banks are even selling their energy revolver loans to private equity firms at deep discounts.Indeed, Clayton's financing may have shrunk if not for Ares.Previously, Clayton had a revolver worth $450 million from banks. It is not clear who backed Clayton's most recent credit facility but banks including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Co , Union Bank and Frost National Bank have done so previously. The banks declined to comment.A senior JPMorgan banker had warned in February that lenders could cut credit lines by 15 percent to 20 percent in the upcoming negotiation season.Under the new arrangement, Clayton would borrow $350 million from Ares for five years, and get the remaining $100 million in a revolver loan from a consortium of 16 banks that include JPMorgan, a regulatory filing showed.Ares, which manages about $94 billion worth of assets, will charge Clayton an annual interest rate of 12.5 percent for its loan.

That would allow Ares to control Clayton's assets, a ""loan-to-own"" strategy favored by private equity houses.""If the loan does not perform, then the private equity firm may be in the driver's seat to potentially own the company after a bankruptcy,"" Sirico said.

1016,"  Large amounts of aluminum traded on the London Metal Exchange over the past couple of years have at times been in the hands of a dominant position holder, a situation which has created anomalies and meant prices do not always reflect fundamentals.

The shift in tactic comes as the US$600bn CMBS market has struggled to find its feet after a steep selloff. Two weeks ago, Wells Fargo was able to slightly dial back spreads from their multi-year wides with a smaller US$712m transaction that included smaller lenders in its pool.That deal's benchmark 10-year Triple A rated class cleared at Swaps plus 143bp. Investors, who expect intial price thoughts to roll out later on Monday, said bankers hope the absence of smaller lenders will help Deutsche and JP Morgan build on that deals' momentum.""The expectation is that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank will come in the same vicinity of the Wells Fargo deal,"" said one buyside source watching the transaction.

Beyond Xtandi, Medivation has a number of other potential cancer treatments in advanced stages of research and development.  The company's stock has traded down more than 40 percent in the past year, in tandem with a broader selloff in the life sciences sector.

1035,"  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) urged shareholders on Thursday to vote against appointing a committee to explore a break up of the bank, reiterating that splitting its businesses would not be in investors' best interests.According to a regulatory filing, a shareholder, Bartlett Naylor, plans to propose at JPMorgan's annual general meeting on May 17 that the bank consider splitting into two or more companies. (1.usa.gov/1YgB3MQ)Naylor's resolution recommends that one company perform basic business and consumer lending, while the other units focus on investment banking operations.Naylor, who works for the non-profit Public Citizen, has filed nearly identical resolutions at Bank of America (BAC.N), and Citigroup (C.N) in recent years.

1037,"  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) urged shareholders on Thursday to vote against appointing a committee to explore a break up of the bank, reiterating that splitting its businesses would not be in investors' best interests.According to a regulatory filing, a shareholder, Bartlett Naylor, plans to propose at JPMorgan's annual general meeting on May 17 that the bank consider splitting into two or more companies. (1.usa.gov/1YgB3MQ)Naylor's resolution recommends that one company perform basic business and consumer lending, while the other units focus on investment banking operations.Naylor, who works for the non-profit Public Citizen, has filed nearly identical resolutions at Bank of America (BAC.N), and Citigroup (C.N) in recent years.

1040,"   By Olivia Oran  It is only April, but some on Wall Street are already predicting a rotten 2016 for U.S. banks.Analysts say it has been the worst start to the year since the financial crisis in 2007-2008 and expect poor first-quarter results when reporting begins this week. Concerns about economic growth in China, the impact of persistently low oil prices on the energy sector, and near-zero interest rates are weighing on capital markets activity as well as loan growth.Analysts forecast a 20 percent decline on average in earnings from the six biggest U.S. banks, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Some banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), are expected to report the worst results in over ten years. This spells trouble for the financial sector more broadly, since banks typically generate at least a third of their annual revenue during the first three months of the year.""What's concerning people is they're saying, 'Is this going to spill over into other quarters?'"" Goldman's lead banking analyst Richard Ramsden said in an interview. ""If you do have a significant decline in revenues, there is a limit to how much you can cut costs to keep things in equilibrium."" Investors will get some insight on Wednesday, when earnings season kicks off with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the country's largest bank. That will be followed by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) on Thursday, Citigroup Inc (C.N) on Friday, and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, in the following week. Banks have been struggling to generate more revenue for years, while adapting to a panoply of new regulations that have raised the cost of doing business substantially.The biggest challenge has been fixed-income trading, where heavy capital requirements, new derivatives rules, and restrictions on proprietary trading have made it less profitable, leading most banks to simply shrink the business. Bank executives have already warned investors to expect major declines across other areas as well. Citigroup Inc (C.N) CFO John Gerspach said to expect trading revenue more broadly to drop 15 percent versus the first quarter of last year. JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) Daniel Pinto said to expect a 25 percent decline in investment banking. Several bank executives have warned about declining quality of energy sector loans. Global investment banking fees for completed merger and acquisitions, and stock and bond underwriting, totaled $15.6 billion in the first quarter, a 28 percent decline for the year-ago period, according to Thomson Reuters data.Volatility in stock prices and plunging commodities prices caused trading volume to dry up during most of the quarter. Trading activity picked up slightly in March but was not strong enough to offset declines during the first two months of the year. Analysts have been lowering first-quarter estimates over the last month in light of business pressures. They now expect JPMorgan to report adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share, Bank of America to report 24 cents per share, Wells Fargo to report 99 cents per share, Citigroup to report $1.11 per share, and Morgan Stanley to report 63 cents per share. Goldman is expected to report $3.00 per share, the lowest first-quarter earnings since before the financial crisis. Matt Burnell, a Wells Fargo banking analyst, said in a research note Friday that capital markets weakness may extend at least into the second quarter.Analysts said there may be some loan growth outside of the energy sector, and a small uptick in net interest margins, a measure of loan profitability, but overall, the tone was less-than-optimistic.    ""The first quarter is going to be ugly and we don't think that necessarily gets recovered in the back half of the year,"" said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust, which owns shares of Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman. ""There are a lot of challenges ahead.""

A JPMorgan spokesman declined further comment. JPMorgan said its total exposure to oil and gas and natural gas pipeline industries had risen $1.5 billion to $47.9 billion, or 5.8 percent of total wholesale loans and commitments to lend.The company said earlier this month that it had some attractive opportunities to make additional loans to the industry.

1058,"  LONDON A vote to leave the European Union in a June 23 referendum could cost each Briton around 45,000 pounds ($65,718), or around half the value of the United Kingdom's housing stock, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said in a research report.Some financiers say a British exit would sap London's wealth, hammer sterling, undermine the world's fifth-largest economy and prompt some traders to move their business to other centers such as New York and Singapore.Using the British finance ministry's central estimate that UK gross domestic product would be 6.2 percent lower by 2030 after a Brexit than it would be if Britain stayed in the EU, JPMorgan said the impact on British wealth could be huge.""To make it personal, each individual's wealth would be lower than it would otherwise have been by around 45,000 pounds,"" JPMorgan said in the note for clients. ""This is huge.""  ""To put it differently, the hit to wealth would be equivalent to a loss of around half of the value of the UK's housing stock and the land associated with it.""JPMorgan also projected the impact on wealth based on a group of Brexit-supporting economists who on Thursday forecast a British exit would benefit the economy. Under that scenario, which sees a 4 percent boost for gross domestic product after around 10 years, each Briton would get a wealth boost of about 29,000 pounds, equivalent to about 40 percent of the UK housing stock, JPMorgan said.The note did not mention a timeframe for the different estimates of changes to wealth. JPMorgan, which has donated to the ""In"" campaign, did not say which scenario was most likely but noted the wide range of forecasts. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said this week that a Brexit would leave Britain's economy 5 percent smaller by 2030 than if it stayed in the EU.

1059,"   By Brendan Pierson  The father of a former investment banker at Perella Weinberg Partners and JPMorgan Chase & Co was sentenced on Wednesday to a year of home confinement and three more years of probation, for trading securities ahead of healthcare mergers based on tips from his son.U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan sentenced Robert Stewart, 61, at a court hearing. She also ordered Stewart to forfeit the $150,000 he gained from the trading and to do 750 hours of community service.Before being sentenced, Stewart said he was ""humiliated"" and accepted responsibility for his actions.Swain said she would have sentenced Stewart to prison if not for the ""unusually serious"" medical condition of his wife, Claudia Stewart, who required his care. The details of her condition were not discussed.""Mr. Stewart is grateful for the opportunity to move forward with his life in a positive way,"" Stewart's lawyer, Seth Levine, told reporters outside the courtroom. Stewart was arrested on insider trading charges last May and pleaded guilty in August.[L1N10N37E] The plea deal did not call for him to cooperate in the case against his son, Sean Stewart, 35, who is also charged with insider trading. Sean Stewart has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said Robert Stewart, an accountant, traded on tips from Sean about mergers being worked on at Perella Weinberg and JPMorgan Chase, where Sean worked until 2011. At JPMorgan, the mergers included INC Research Holdings Inc's 2011 acquisition of Kendle International Inc and Apax Partners' buyout that year of Kinetic Concepts Inc.At Perella Weinberg, the deals included Hologic Inc's 2012 acquisition of Gen-Probe Inc, Linde AG's purchase of Lincare Holdings Inc that year, and Becton, Dickinson & Co's deal for CareFusion Corp in October.Prosecutors said that, after a regulator began inquiring about Kinetic Concepts trading, Robert Stewart arranged to have a business associate, Richard Cunniffe, make trades for a cut of what became $1.16 million in profits. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Cucinella, a lead prosecutor in the case, said at Wednesday's hearing that Cunniffe kept most of that money himself.Cunniffe, an investment banker at Chatsworth Securities LLC, secretly pleaded guilty in March 2015 and agreed to cooperate with authorities.The case is U.S. v.

1061,"  HONG KONG JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has become the first global investment bank to fall foul of Hong Kong's stricter IPO sponsorship rules, dealing a blow to its reputation in the region.The Hong Kong stock exchange introduced tougher disclosure rules in 2014, which can make banks criminally liable if a listing prospectus is found to have misled investors. It returned a listing application for Shenhua Health Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of monosodium glutamate (MSG) producer Fufeng Group Ltd (0546.HK), on March 29 saying it needed more information, exchange data showed. JPMorgan Securities (Far East) Ltd acted as sole sponsor of the IPO. Only seven other initial public offerings (IPOs) have been returned since the new rules came into effect. After applications are returned, companies must wait at least eight weeks before re-submitting an application. The new rules aimed to crack down on sloppy work by underwriters and issuers that filed incomplete or inaccurate documents, particularly after a series of scandals at Chinese companies that ran into trouble after listing in Hong Kong. JPMorgan declined to comment on Shenhua Health's listing application on Thursday. Fufeng Group, the world's largest producer of food flavor enhancer MSG, didn't return a Reuters request for comment after regular business hours.The sponsors of the previous seven listings on the stock exchange's main board and Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) that needed further vetting were all from China and Hong Kong, exchange data showed.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has limited SWIFT access to some employees amid questions about the breaches at two Asian banks, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.The actions are not tied to a specific concern about JPMorgan's vulnerability to SWIFT, but are part of its policy to review user access to certain systems following news of a security threat, The Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the bank.Representatives with JPMorgan could not immediately be reached for comment.Brussels-based SWIFT is a cooperative owned by some 3,000 global financial institutions. Separately, Bloomberg News reported that major U.S. banks want SWIFT to boost security in the wake of the attacks, which involved fraudulent transfer requests sent over SWIFT's private bank messaging system.Some U.S. banks want to discuss with SWIFT whether it responded quickly enough to the breaches and if it should help banks better secure their systems, Bloomberg cited one unidentified source as saying.Some U.S. banks expect SWIFT to come up with a technological solution to reduce the risk of further attacks, the report cited a second unidentified source as saying.  SWIFT codes for at least seven international banks were written into malware used in an attack that Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank disclosed over the weekend, Bloomberg reported, citing a private report published by BAE Systems PLC (BAES.L).The malware was configured to hide transaction messages involving those banks, Bloomberg reported. It said they included Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS), Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd [MTFGTU.UL], UniCredit SpA (CRDI.MI), Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX), United Overseas Bank Ltd (UOBH.SI) of Singapore, South Korea’s Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL] and Japan’s Mizuho Bank Ltd [MZFGAE.UL]. The revelations that such banks were mentioned in the code raised concerns of global lenders because they show that the attackers were not focusing solely on small banks in developing nations, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with several banks in the U.S. and Europe.

Helen Chaitman, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said the New York-based bank is pleased with the decision.

Many net winners say Irving Picard, a court-appointed trustee liquidating Madoff's firm, undervalued their claims and have filed lawsuits to hold other individuals and companies that dealt with Madoff liable for their alleged losses.The JPMorgan lawsuit began in March 2014, after the bank agreed to pay $2.6 billion to settle other Madoff litigation, and in a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. government acknowledged responsibility for failing to stop Madoff.Madoff, 78, is serving a 150-year prison term.The case is Friedman et al v.

1076,"  Major U.S. banks are scrutinizing security of the SWIFT messaging network following cyber attacks in Bangladesh and Vietnam involving fraudulent transfer requests, according to media reports on Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has limited SWIFT access to some employees amid questions about the breaches at two Asian banks, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.The actions are not tied to a specific concern about JPMorgan's vulnerability to SWIFT, but are part of its policy to review user access to certain systems following news of a security threat, The Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the bank.Representatives with JPMorgan could not immediately be reached for comment.Brussels-based SWIFT is a cooperative owned by some 3,000 global financial institutions. Separately, Bloomberg News reported that major U.S. banks want SWIFT to boost security in the wake of the attacks, which involved fraudulent transfer requests sent over SWIFT's private bank messaging system.Some U.S. banks want to discuss with SWIFT whether it responded quickly enough to the breaches and if it should help banks better secure their systems, Bloomberg cited one unidentified source as saying.Some U.S. banks expect SWIFT to come up with a technological solution to reduce the risk of further attacks, the report cited a second unidentified source as saying.  SWIFT codes for at least seven international banks were written into malware used in an attack that Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank disclosed over the weekend, Bloomberg reported, citing a private report published by BAE Systems PLC (BAES.L).The malware was configured to hide transaction messages involving those banks, Bloomberg reported. It said they included Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS), Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd [MTFGTU.UL], UniCredit SpA (CRDI.MI), Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX), United Overseas Bank Ltd (UOBH.SI) of Singapore, South Korea’s Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL] and Japan’s Mizuho Bank Ltd [MZFGAE.UL]. The revelations that such banks were mentioned in the code raised concerns of global lenders because they show that the attackers were not focusing solely on small banks in developing nations, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with several banks in the U.S. and Europe. A SWIFT spokeswoman declined comment on both reports.

1077,"   By Olivia Oran  A majority of Goldman Sachs Group Inc shareholders voted in favor of executive pay plans on Friday at the bank's annual meeting in its Jersey City offices.Around 66 percent of shareholders voted for the plan. Goldman paid Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein $22.6 million in 2015, his first pay decline in four years. He received $24 million in 2014.That percentage was less than at JPMorgan Chase & Co, where 92 percent of investors approved executive pay plans at their annual meeting this week.  Goldman shareholders also rejected a proposal to require an independent board chairman with a 30 percent vote. Blankfein currently serves as both CEO and chairman of the board.Blankfein said the economy was slowly emerging from a period of slow growth and there were signals of improvement. “There are signs on the horizon we are finally coming out of that environment,” he said, pointing to the fact that the Federal Reserve had begun to raise interest rates and employment was growing. “We’ve been looking for these things before and seen false dawns but there is a little more confidence this time around.""  During the first quarter of 2016, Goldman reported its worst results in four years as revenue tumbled 40 percent. Return on average common equity (ROE), a measure of how well the bank uses shareholder money to generate profit, was 6.4 percent in the quarter, down from 14.7 percent a year earlier.

Future changes in revenue will be more in keeping with market cycles, he said. JPMorgan has been reducing costs and scaling back businesses put at disadvantage by the regulatory and market changes. Compensation in fixed-income is down 25 percent over the past five years and headcount is down 10 percent, Pinto said. At the same time, the bank has been holding, or increasing, its market share of fixed-income businesses, in anticipation of better profits in the future, he said.Pinto also said the biggest banks will have a scale advantage in defending against cyber attacks on payments services banks provide.

1085,"  (Adds amount of JPMorgan oil and gas loans, other comments)NEW YORK, June 2 JPMorgan Chase & Co  will book additional expenses in the second quarter to increase its reserves against losses on oil and gas loans, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Thursday.Dimon, speaking at an investor conference about a wide range of topics, did not say how much the additional provisions would be, but said he would not consider the amount to be ""material.""The additions will be made in part because of slipping in the creditworthiness of a few large borrowers, and regulators have pushed for more conservative loss reserves, Dimon said.A warning from JPMorgan in February about rising costs for energy loan losses foreshadowed announcements of sharply higher provisions by smaller banks with more of their loans to the sector. While JPMorgan is a major lender to energy companies, loans to oil and gas and pipeline industries are relatively small compared to the overall size of JPMorgan, which is the biggest U.S. bank by assets with $2.42 trillion. Loans to those industries at the end of March totaled $48 billion, or 5.8 percent of JPMorgan's total wholesale loans.Dimon, who spoke in response to questions from a moderator  and not from a prepared speech, voiced more concerned about taking appropriate caution in other areas. These included bond market trading amid rising interest rates, auto finance and deploying new information technology, such as cloud computing and distributed ledgers to provide customer services record transactions. Too many autos are being financed with leases or loans that are too large for the value of the cars, he said, adding that JPMorgan was being more cautious in the sector.Dimon said it was ""my fault"" that the bank had not moved faster to use the cloud for customer accounts and transactions, and that he has worried about security. He added later that he wants to make sure that distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology that the bank is testing is safe before overhauling the way trades are recorded.Asked about threats to his generally upbeat outlook for the bank and banking, Dimon recommended that people be on alert for extreme bond market volatility toward the end of the year.Trouble will come, he warned, if the pace of economic growth builds and interest rates rise more quickly than expected.

DeNunzio was formerly the global chairman of M&A at Credit Suisse.At Wells Fargo, DeNunzio will partner with Sam Farnham, an investment banker who will be promoted to become head of M&A in the Americas, the people added, requesting not to be named because the moves have not yet been announced.Farnham was formerly head of middle market investment banking. John Laughlin, the former head of M&A, will become a vice chairman of M&A, according to the people.  Representatives from Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Bloomberg first reported the news on Friday.DeNunzio worked at Credit Suisse for more than 25 years and had been global chairman of M&A since 2012. He joined the M&A group of the First Boston Corp in 1989, a year before it was merged into Credit Suisse, after nine years at Kidder, Peabody & Co. Wells Fargo, a San Francisco-based lender known for its retail banking business, is a relatively small player in investment banking compared to other U.S. giants JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp. It is bulking up its practice, however, and has started to land larger deals. In March, Wells Fargo was named sole adviser to TransCanada Corp on its acquisition of Columbia Pipeline Group, a deal worth $13 billion including debt, putting it on track for its biggest fees from a single deal since at least 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting Services.Credit Suisse has seen several bankers depart in recent months. Last month it lost a managing director in New York who went to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), five bankers in San Francisco who joined Jefferies LLC and two in Chicago who were hired at Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX).

1104,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s  (JPM) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and Short-Term IDR at 'F1'.  Fitch has also affirmed JPM's Viability Rating (VR) at 'a+'. The Rating Outlook  is Stable. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. The rating affirmations have been taken in conjunction with Fitch's periodic  review of the Global Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs).  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying earnings capacity of  the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing international  franchise, strong funding flexibility, given its deposit-raising capabilities  and uninterrupted access to the global capital markets through an economic  cycle, strong liquidity profile, solid capital ratios, and experienced  management team, which has deep bench strength.  JPM's Basel III tier 1 common equity (CET1) ratio reached 11.7% at March 31,  2016, which was above management's long-term minimum target of 11.0%. The ratio  has grown significantly in recent years, with an increase in retained earnings  and the issuance of perpetual preferred securities, and the gap with peers has  narrowed meaningfully. In first quarter 2016 (1Q16), the CET1 ratio under the  standardized approach was 11.9%; JPM expects the standardized approach to be its  binding constraint over the near term, and is capitalizing operating segments  accordingly.  In 2015, JPM reduced its estimated G-SIB surcharge by 100 bps, to 3.5%, given an  approximate $200 billion decline in non-operating deposits, a $22 billion  reduction in level 3 assets, and a $15 trillion decline in notional derivative  amounts. Fitch views this meaningful reduction favorably, as it puts the firm on  more equal footing with the peer group. Fitch believes JPM is well positioned to  maintain compliance with Basel III capital requirements, given the superior  earnings capacity of the bank.  JPM had another solid year of earnings performance on a core basis in 2015.  Fitch estimates that pretax earnings were up about 1.9% year over year,  adjusting for legal expenses, DVA/FVA, and other non-recurring items of note, as  lower non-interest expense more than offset lower net revenue and higher  provision expenses. Looking ahead to the balance of 2016, Fitch expects a  continuation of strong core operating performance, although credit costs will  remain a headwind as asset quality metrics rise from historical lows, downgrades  in energy-related industries continue, and legal and regulatory expenses remain  elevated. A continued focus on operational improvements is expected to offset  the impact to some extent and management expects adjusted expenses to be flat in  2016.  Exposure to the oil & gas industry was $42.1 billion at YE2015, which  represented about 5.3% of the wholesale loan portfolio. About $24 billion of the  exposure was investment grade, of which $4 billion was drawn, and $18 billion  was non-investment grade, of which $9 billion was drawn. Exposure to metals &  mining was $14 billion at YE2015, representing about 1.8% of the wholesale loan  portfolio. Drawn exposure was $4.6 billion, of which 46% is investment grade  (down from 55% at YE2014).  JPM added $529 million of reserves related to oil & gas and $162 million related  to metals & mining in 1Q16. The firm also experienced about $48 million of net  charge-offs in these sectors in the quarter and a $1 billion uptick in  non-accrual loans. Using reasonable assumptions on draws and downgrades and  considering spillover effects to related companies, the bank believes additional  reserves could be about $500 million over the remainder of the year, or 0.25% of  Tier 1 capital, although with a high degree of variability. Wholesale reserves  were about 6.3% of drawn energy exposure at quarter-end. Overall, Fitch believes  JPM's exposure to energy is manageable.  In March 2015, the firm's board authorized a $6.4 billion common equity  repurchase program. The bank repurchased approximately $5.4 billion under that  authority through 1Q16, leaving about $1 billion of availability under the  program. However, JPM received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve  regarding incremental share repurchases of $1.88 billion through the end of  2Q16, giving them aggregate remaining authority of about $2.9 billion. JPM's net  payout ratio was approximately 48% including share repurchases in 2015. Fitch  believes the firm's capital plans are prudent. On April 13, 2016, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal  Reserve Board announced they had determined that JPM's resolution plan was not  credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy  Code. Areas of deficiency included liquidity, legal entity rationalization,  governance mechanisms, and derivatives and trading activities. If the bank fails  to remediate deficiencies by Oct. 1, 2016, it may be subject to more stringent  prudential requirements. Fitch believes the bank will work diligently to address  all deficiencies noted in the regulatory feedback.  The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating consistency,  superior funding flexibility, strong liquidity, and stability in capital ratios.  JPM has been relatively successful adapting its business model to the evolving  regulatory landscape and is expected to continue to make adjustments in order to  optimize its capital structure.  The VRs remain equalized between JPM and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of JPM and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate, between JPM and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes a  group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk at the operating company would be lower given total loss absorbing capital  (TLAC). All U.S. bank subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as  U.S. banks are cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform,  Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that JPM  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation has now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and its subsidiaries  are all notched down from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of  each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk  profile, which vary considerably.  Subordinated debt issued by the operating companies is rated at the same level  as subordinated debt issued by JPM reflecting the potential for subordinated  creditors in the operating companies to be exposed to loss ahead of senior  creditors in JPM. Subordinated lower Tier 2 debt is rated one-notch below the VR  for loss severity, reflecting below-average recoveries.  Legacy Tier 1 securities are generally rated four-notches below the VR, made up  of two notches for high loss severity relative to average recoveries, and two  further notches for non-performance risk, reflecting the fact that coupon  omission is not fully discretionary.  High and low trigger-contingent capital Tier 1 instruments are rated five  notches below the VR. The issues are notched down twice for loss severity,  reflecting poor recoveries, as the instruments can be converted to equity or  written down well ahead of resolution. In addition, they are also notched down  three times for very high non-performance risk, reflecting fully discretionary  coupon omission.  DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and Chase Bank USA,  N.A. are rated one-notch higher than the banks' IDRs and senior unsecured debt  because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S.  depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one-notch above  JPM's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of TLAC requirements for U.S.  G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default  risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities relative to holding  company senior debt. In our view these buffers would provide substantial  protection to senior unsecured obligations in the domestic operating entities in  the event of group resolution, as they could be used to absorb losses and  recapitalize operating companies. Therefore, substantial holding company debt  reduces the likelihood of default on operating company senior obligations.  The 'F1+' Short-Term IDRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries reflect substantial  liquidity at the banks and typically higher core deposit funding, liquidity  resources at JPM that could be extended to the bank, and access to contingent  liquidity sources such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances. JPM's and its  non-bank operating companies' Short-Term IDRs, at 'F1', reflect Fitch's view  that there is less surplus liquidity at these entities than at the bank,  particularly given their greater reliance on the holding company for liquidity. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to deliver  meaningful earnings growth, particularly in light of the current regulatory  environment. Higher capital charges and what remain difficult market conditions  present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may be encouraged to seek more  aggressive ways to generate profits that take advantage of regulatory changes.  However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity risk  management, and product diversity mitigate some of these concerns. Negative rating actions could result from reputational damage or legal sanctions  that impact the firm's market position, and/or material asset quality weakening  which pressures JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital. Deterioration  in liquidity levels, material and unexpected litigation losses, and/or failure  to address noted deficiencies in the firm's resolution plan which results in  increased capital requirements and places the firm at a competitive  disadvantage, could also pressure ratings. Further, significant risk management  or operational failures that result in material losses to the firm could also  result in a negative rating action. Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the foreseeable  future given that its current rating level is among the highest of its peer  group and of the global bank universe.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Since JPM's SR and SRFs are '5' and 'NF', respectively, there is limited  likelihood that these ratings will change over the forseeable future.  Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for JPM and its subsidiaries' subordinated debt and other hybrid  capital ratings are primarily sensitive to a change in JPM's VRs. The  securities' ratings are also sensitive to a change in their notching, which  could arise if Fitch changes its assessment of the probability of their  non-performance relative to the risk captured in the issuers' VRs. This may  reflect a change in capital management in the group or an unexpected shift in  regulatory buffer requirements, for example. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in JPM's  Long- and Short-Term IDR.

1107,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 16 (Fitch) (This is a correction of a release originally  published June 14, 2016. It includes JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.'s market linked  securities which were omitted from the original release.) Fitch Ratings has affirmed JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) at 'A+' and Short-Term IDR at 'F1'. Fitch has also affirmed JPM's  Viability Rating (VR) at 'a+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of  ratings is provided at the end of this release. The rating affirmations have been taken in conjunction with Fitch's periodic  review of the Global Trading and Universal Banks (GTUBs).  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT JPM's ratings affirmation reflects the strong underlying earnings capacity of  the bank, given its dominant domestic franchise and growing international  franchise, strong funding flexibility, given its deposit-raising capabilities  and uninterrupted access to the global capital markets through an economic  cycle, strong liquidity profile, solid capital ratios, and experienced  management team, which has deep bench strength.  JPM's Basel III tier 1 common equity (CET1) ratio reached 11.7% at March 31,  2016, which was above management's long-term minimum target of 11.0%. The ratio  has grown significantly in recent years, with an increase in retained earnings  and the issuance of perpetual preferred securities, and the gap with peers has  narrowed meaningfully. In first quarter 2016 (1Q16), the CET1 ratio under the  standardized approach was 11.9%; JPM expects the standardized approach to be its  binding constraint over the near term, and is capitalizing operating segments  accordingly.  In 2015, JPM reduced its estimated G-SIB surcharge by 100 bps, to 3.5%, given an  approximate $200 billion decline in non-operating deposits, a $22 billion  reduction in level 3 assets, and a $15 trillion decline in notional derivative  amounts. Fitch views this meaningful reduction favorably, as it puts the firm on  more equal footing with the peer group. Fitch believes JPM is well positioned to  maintain compliance with Basel III capital requirements, given the superior  earnings capacity of the bank.  JPM had another solid year of earnings performance on a core basis in 2015.  Fitch estimates that pretax earnings were up about 1.9% year over year,  adjusting for legal expenses, DVA/FVA, and other non-recurring items of note, as  lower non-interest expense more than offset lower net revenue and higher  provision expenses. Looking ahead to the balance of 2016, Fitch expects a  continuation of strong core operating performance, although credit costs will  remain a headwind as asset quality metrics rise from historical lows, downgrades  in energy-related industries continue, and legal and regulatory expenses remain  elevated. A continued focus on operational improvements is expected to offset  the impact to some extent and management expects adjusted expenses to be flat in  2016.  Exposure to the oil & gas industry was $42.1 billion at YE2015, which  represented about 5.3% of the wholesale loan portfolio. About $24 billion of the  exposure was investment grade, of which $4 billion was drawn, and $18 billion  was non-investment grade, of which $9 billion was drawn. Exposure to metals &  mining was $14 billion at YE2015, representing about 1.8% of the wholesale loan  portfolio. Drawn exposure was $4.6 billion, of which 46% is investment grade  (down from 55% at YE2014).  JPM added $529 million of reserves related to oil & gas and $162 million related  to metals & mining in 1Q16. The firm also experienced about $48 million of net  charge-offs in these sectors in the quarter and a $1 billion uptick in  non-accrual loans. Using reasonable assumptions on draws and downgrades and  considering spillover effects to related companies, the bank believes additional  reserves could be about $500 million over the remainder of the year, or 0.25% of  Tier 1 capital, although with a high degree of variability. Wholesale reserves  were about 6.3% of drawn energy exposure at quarter-end. Overall, Fitch believes  JPM's exposure to energy is manageable.  In March 2015, the firm's board authorized a $6.4 billion common equity  repurchase program. The bank repurchased approximately $5.4 billion under that  authority through 1Q16, leaving about $1 billion of availability under the  program. However, JPM received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve  regarding incremental share repurchases of $1.88 billion through the end of  2Q16, giving them aggregate remaining authority of about $2.9 billion. JPM's net  payout ratio was approximately 48% including share repurchases in 2015. Fitch  believes the firm's capital plans are prudent. On April 13, 2016, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal  Reserve Board announced they had determined that JPM's resolution plan was not  credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy  Code. Areas of deficiency included liquidity, legal entity rationalization,  governance mechanisms, and derivatives and trading activities. If the bank fails  to remediate deficiencies by Oct. 1, 2016, it may be subject to more stringent  prudential requirements. Fitch believes the bank will work diligently to address  all deficiencies noted in the regulatory feedback.  The Stable Outlook reflects expectations for continued operating consistency,  superior funding flexibility, strong liquidity, and stability in capital ratios.  JPM has been relatively successful adapting its business model to the evolving  regulatory landscape and is expected to continue to make adjustments in order to  optimize its capital structure.  The VRs remain equalized between JPM and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of JPM and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate, between JPM and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes a  group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk at the operating company would be lower given total loss absorbing capital  (TLAC). All U.S. bank subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as  U.S. banks are cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform,  Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that JPM  becomes non-viable. In Fitch's view, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly  Liquidation Authority legislation has now sufficiently progressed to provide a  framework for resolving banks that is likely to require holding company senior  creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the  company receiving sovereign support. Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by JPM and its subsidiaries  are all notched down from the common VR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of  each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk  profile, which vary considerably.  Subordinated debt issued by the operating companies is rated at the same level  as subordinated debt issued by JPM reflecting the potential for subordinated  creditors in the operating companies to be exposed to loss ahead of senior  creditors in JPM. Subordinated lower Tier 2 debt is rated one-notch below the VR  for loss severity, reflecting below-average recoveries.  Legacy Tier 1 securities are generally rated four-notches below the VR, made up  of two notches for high loss severity relative to average recoveries, and two  further notches for non-performance risk, reflecting the fact that coupon  omission is not fully discretionary.  High and low trigger-contingent capital Tier 1 instruments are rated five  notches below the VR. The issues are notched down twice for loss severity,  reflecting poor recoveries, as the instruments can be converted to equity or  written down well ahead of resolution. In addition, they are also notched down  three times for very high non-performance risk, reflecting fully discretionary  coupon omission.  DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and Chase Bank USA,  N.A. are rated one-notch higher than the banks' IDRs and senior unsecured debt  because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S.  depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The Long-Term IDRs for the material U.S. operating entities are one-notch above  JPM's to reflect Fitch's belief that the U.S. single point of entry (SPE)  resolution regime, the likely implementation of TLAC requirements for U.S.  G-SIBs, and the presence of substantial holding company debt reduces the default  risk of domestic operating subsidiaries' senior liabilities relative to holding  company senior debt. In our view these buffers would provide substantial  protection to senior unsecured obligations in the domestic operating entities in  the event of group resolution, as they could be used to absorb losses and  recapitalize operating companies. Therefore, substantial holding company debt  reduces the likelihood of default on operating company senior obligations.  The 'F1+' Short-Term IDRs of JPM's bank subsidiaries reflect substantial  liquidity at the banks and typically higher core deposit funding, liquidity  resources at JPM that could be extended to the bank, and access to contingent  liquidity sources such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances. JPM's and its  non-bank operating companies' Short-Term IDRs, at 'F1', reflect Fitch's view  that there is less surplus liquidity at these entities than at the bank,  particularly given their greater reliance on the holding company for liquidity. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT Going forward, Fitch believes JPM is going to be challenged to deliver  meaningful earnings growth, particularly in light of the current regulatory  environment. Higher capital charges and what remain difficult market conditions  present a challenge for all GTUBs, which may be encouraged to seek more  aggressive ways to generate profits that take advantage of regulatory changes.  However, Fitch expects that JPM's strong global franchise, liquidity risk  management, and product diversity mitigate some of these concerns. Negative rating actions could result from reputational damage or legal sanctions  that impact the firm's market position, and/or material asset quality weakening  which pressures JPM's earnings and its ability to build capital. Deterioration  in liquidity levels, material and unexpected litigation losses, and/or failure  to address noted deficiencies in the firm's resolution plan which results in  increased capital requirements and places the firm at a competitive  disadvantage, could also pressure ratings. Further, significant risk management  or operational failures that result in material losses to the firm could also  result in a negative rating action. Upward rating momentum for JPM is believed to be limited for the foreseeable  future given that its current rating level is among the highest of its peer  group and of the global bank universe.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Since JPM's SR and SRFs are '5' and 'NF', respectively, there is limited  likelihood that these ratings will change over the forseeable future.  Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change  in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is  highly unlikely in Fitch's view.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for JPM and its subsidiaries' subordinated debt and other hybrid  capital ratings are primarily sensitive to a change in JPM's VRs. The  securities' ratings are also sensitive to a change in their notching, which  could arise if Fitch changes its assessment of the probability of their  non-performance relative to the risk captured in the issuers' VRs. This may  reflect a change in capital management in the group or an unexpected shift in  regulatory buffer requirements, for example. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change in JPM's  Long- and Short-Term IDR.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES Given that JPM's and the bank's VRs remain equalized, the bank's ratings are  broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect JPM's VR.

1108,"  June 20 (IFR) - JP Morgan has appointed Aloke Gupte as head of equity-linked in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, replacing Alex Large, who is stepping down and taking a sabbatical.Gupte has spent the last four-and-a-half years running equity-linked in Asia-Pacific. Gaurav Maria, an executive director in the bank's equity capital and derivative markets team in Hong Kong, will succeed Gupte in that position. Large will take a sabbatical over the summer months and is expected to return to JP Morgan in a new role after that. He has worked at JP Morgan for a quarter of a century, including 19 years in equity capital markets. JP Morgan ranked second in EMEA structured equity last year, having led nine issues and earning league table credit for US$2.05bn of deals, according to Thomson Reuters data. In Asia excluding Japan, the bank ranked top with five deals for credit of US$1bn. The bank held the same positions in each region as of the end of the first quarter of 2016.

1111,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former JPMorgan Chase & Co  executive indicted eight years ago for allegedly embezzling about $5.4 million from clients at the bank and at prior employer UBS AG pleaded not guilty on Thursday after being extradited from Argentina.Hernan Arbizu, who fled to Argentina where he became involved in a tax-evasion probe involving the bank, entered the plea through his lawyer in federal court in Manhattan to charges including wire fraud, bank fraud and embezzlement.In court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Sagar Ravi said Arbizu, 47, voluntarily agreed to his extradition and said prosecutors had held discussions with him about resolving the case, which could result in a plea at a later date.U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan scheduled Arbizu's trial for Dec. 5. A lawyer for Arbizu declined comment after the hearing.

U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan, however, said the plaintiffs, who also included traders Mark Grumet and Thomas Wacker, did not show that JPMorgan made ""uneconomic"" bids, or intended to rig the market at counterparties' expense.He also questioned the plaintiffs' use of Silver Indicative Forward Mid Rates (""SIFO"") as a benchmark for determining proper levels for the spreads in their lawsuits. ""Given the (lawsuits') failure both to explain why SIFO should track silver futures spreads, and to concretely plead that it did so consistently, a mere general correlation between these two is not sufficient to make SIFO a reliable benchmark such that deviations from it support a claim of irrational pricing animated by anticompetitive aims,"" Engelmayer wrote.David Kovel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment.

1128,"   By Liana B. Baker  Coupa Software Inc, a U.S. provider of applications that help companies run their financial affairs, has hired investment banks for an initial public offering that could come later this year, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Coupa would be one of the largest software companies looking to float on the U.S. stock market this year, which has seen few IPOs due to market volatility. It would come on the heels of an offering by communications software maker Twilio Inc TWLO.O, which went public last month.San Mateo, California-based Coupa, which said last year it was valued at $1 billion in a private funding round, has already registered for an IPO confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and could file its IPO prospectus publicly in the fall, the people said.Under a federal law, ""Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act,"" young companies that generate less than $1 billion in revenue can file for IPOs with the SEC without immediately disclosing details. Coupa has hired Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to be the lead underwriter on the IPO, along with investment banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Barclays (BARC.L) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), according to the people, who asked not to be named because the plans are private.Representatives for Coupa and the banks declined to comment.For most of 2016, market jitters and poor performance by technology stocks had kept growth-oriented technology companies such as Coupa on the sidelines of the public markets.   The company offers ""savings as a service"" software to its customers including Sanofi (SASY.PA), Salesforce.com (CRM.N), and banks such as Royal Bank of Canada and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA). Its cloud-based subscription software, which monitors expenses for companies, competes with Ariba, which was acquired by SAP SE (SAPG.DE) for $4.5 billion in 2012. Coupa's last funding round was announced a year ago when it raised $80 million from T. Rowe Price Associates Inc (TROW.O) and Iconiq Capital, a wealth manager for billionaires such as Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. It was founded in 2007 by former Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) executives and has raised $165 million to date.  Another software firm, Talend Inc, filed an IPO prospectus last month, looking to raise $86.25 million and list on the Nasdaq. The Wall Street Journal had reported last December that Coupa was interviewing banks for an IPO. (Reporting by Liana B.

1136,"  LONDON, July 8 Emerging market bond funds received $3.3 billion over the past week, JPMorgan said on Friday, the largest weekly inflow since it started tracking the data in 2004.While Britain's June 23 vote in favour of leaving the European Union caused initial knee-jerk selling of emerging assets, those flows have reversed as bond yields in the developed world collapsed to ever new lows and the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled it would likely postpone raising rates.With more than $10 trillion worth of debt now estimated as carrying sub-zero yields, more and more funds are flocking to higher-return emerging bonds.JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used emerging bond indexes, said the resurgence in inflows was broad-based and benefiting both hard and local currency debt. It said this was the first time since early 2013 that both segments had received inflows in excess of $1 billion each. So far this year, emerging fixed income funds have absorbed a total of $12.1 billion, the bank estimates, contrasting with 2015 outflows of $14.4 billion.However, flows to debt in local currencies remain in negative territory, amounting to minus $3.2 billion. The picture is less bullish on emerging equities, which continue to suffer from sluggish economic growth across the developing world and the prospect of more slowdowns in China.While JPM data showed emerging equity funds receiving $616 million in the past week, the sector has seen net outflows of $11.2 billion year-to-date, having seen a whopping $64 billion flee in 2015 and losing $28.5 billion in 2014.

1137,"   By Liana B. Baker  Mixed martial arts entertainment franchise Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has agreed to be bought by Talent agency WME-IMG in a transaction a source valued at $4 billion, reflecting the growing popularity of a once-fringe spectator sport. The acquisition, which has one of the largest ever price tags for a sports brand, is also backed by private, equity firms Silver Lake Partners LP [SILAK.UL] and KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), as well as investment firms owned by billionaire Michael Dell and his family.""We’re now committed to pursuing new opportunities for UFC and its talented athletes to ensure the sport’s continued growth and success on a global scale,"" WME IMG Co-CEOs Ariel Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell said in a statement on Tuesday. UFC, founded in 1993, popularized cage fighting and now holds more than 40 fights around the world every year. These events, which feature mixed martial arts and have surpassed pro wresting and boxing in popularity, are broadcast in more than 156 countries, reaching 1.1 billion households. Mixed martial arts has loose roots in a Brazilian form of fighting.While UFC initially drew a niche following, it has now created global stars such as Conor McGregor, Anderson Silva, Georges St-Pierre and Ronda Rousey, a female fighter, who have mainstream followings and marketing deals. The deal comes after the franchise last weekend hosted one of the biggest events in its history, UFC 200, a series of title fights, in Las Vegas.The deal represents the biggest acquisition to date by WME-IMG, a talent agency formed in a 2013 merger of William Morris Endeavor Entertainment and IMG Worldwide. Last year, it acquired the Miss Universe organization from Donald Trump and rodeo-events company Professional Bull Riders. UFC would be the latest live-events media brand with strong ties to Las Vegas to end up owned by private equity firms. Cirque du Soleil, the global circus and entertainment company, was sold to Texas-based TPG Capital LP last year in a deal valued at about $1.5 billion. WME-IMG did not provide the terms of the deal in a statement, but a source confirmed the deal values the mixed martial arts franchise at around $4 billion. Previously, the largest sports deal was Liberty Media Corp's purchase of the Atlanta Braves in 2007 for $2.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. UFC's parent, Zuffa LLC [ZUFFA.UL], which gets its name from the Italian word for ""fight,"" was previously controlled by casino moguls Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta. The Fertitta brothers, who bought UFC for $2 million in 2001, will hold a passive minority stake in the company after the deal closes. UFC's chief executive and chairman, Lorenzo Fertitta, will no longer be involved in the company's day-to-day operations. Dana White, UFC's outspoken president, will remain in his post.ESPN first reported in May that the franchise was for sale and had drawn interest from a number of parties including WME-IMG and Chinese firms China Media Capital and Dalian Wanda Group.Barclays (BARC.L), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and KKR Capital Markets advised the buyers and provided financing for the deal, while The Raine Group and JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) were financial advisers to the sellers of UFC.

1145,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 14 (Fitch) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) logged strong 2Q16 earnings  despite global market turbulence, according to Fitch Ratings. JPM's 2Q16 net  income came in at $6.2 billion on the back of revenue growth of 5%  quarter-on-quarter reflecting solid loan growth in consumer and wholesale  banking and uptick in trading volumes, while overall credit costs stabilized.  JPM continues to remain disciplined on expenses. There were few notable items  during the quarter, and JPM reiterated its full year guidance.  The Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) reported strong year-over-year revenues.  Market volatility in the wake of the Brexit vote lifted fixed income and  currency trading income in most products, which were up 35%, while Equity  capital markets were up a more modest 2%. Conversely, investment banking  revenues were down 15% year-over-year given market uncertainties. Lending was  down 8% year-over-year reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual  loans. Credit costs were $235 million during the quarter mainly reflecting Oil &  Gas credits, although energy loans appear to be stabilizing following increases  in energy prices. Nonetheless, net charge-offs were relatively high at 0.32%.  The Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment continues to produce a strong  return on equity of about 20% reflecting across the board revenue growth of 4%  coupled with good expense control. Reported revenue was affected by $200 million  one-time gain on the sale of Visa Europe as well as a mark-to-market loss on  Square. Excluding these items, revenues were still up 2%. Auto originations came  down $1.1 billion during the quarter to $8.5 billion, although average auto  loans and leases outstanding grew a modest $3.2 billion. JPM continued to build  reserves reflecting expected weakness in credit card as the company has expanded  its underwriting standards, although credit card asset quality remains strong.  Commercial Banking (CB) revenues continued to build on loan growth and  investment banking, with loan growth up 13%, year-over-year, while investment  banking was up 23% quarter-over-quarter, albeit flat to last year. Commercial  real estate (CRE) loan growth was notably strong, particularly when viewed year  over year, growing 18%, while C&I was only 9%. JPM continues to push out  non-operational deposits, which came down 13% year on year reflecting their more  punitive treatment under the bank regulatory liquidity rules. Credit costs were  muted during the quarter following builds in prior periods mainly related to Oil  & Gas credits with charge-offs coming in at a still modest 14bps for the  portfolio. Non-accrual loans held steady at $1.3 billion.  Asset management (AM) softened in the quarter reflecting weaker markets and  lower performance fees. Despite this, AM turned in reasonable earnings and still  strong ROE of 22%. Assets under management (AUM) rebounded slightly from the  first quarter and came in at $1.7 trillion on inflows into long-term and  liquidity products.  From a liquidity perspective, JPM's high-quality liquid assets remained strong,  at $516 billion in the quarter, and the bank remained in compliance with the  liquidity coverage ratio and the proposed net stable funding ratio requirements.  JPM continued to grow average consumer deposits in CCB $21 billion during the  quarter, more than offsetting the decline in CB and allowing JPM to report  overall deposit growth. Fitch views the continued deposit shift positively,  given the relative stability of retail deposits and favorable treatment in  liquidity ratios.  JPM's Basel III fully phased in Common equity (CET1) ratio was up slightly to  11.9%, reflecting earnings retention and flat risk-weighted assets. CET1 was  12.1% under the standardized approach, which JPM believes will eventually be the  binding constraint. The enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (ESLR) was 6.6%  and 6.6% at the firm and bank level, respectively, putting the company in  compliance well ahead of full implementation.  JPM raised its dividend $0.04 during quarter to $0.48 a share, while the  dividend payout ratio fell slightly to 31% from the prior quarter. In addition,  JPM supplemented this with $2.8 billion of share repurchases, resulting in a  total payout of ratio of approximately 75%. JPM comfortably passed this years'  Federal Reserve CCAR stress tests and received approval for its capital plan,  which included share repurchases of $10 billion. Notwithstanding, given its  higher GSIB surcharge, JPM's capital plans could be affected in the future to  the extent the GSIB surcharge is included as part of the CCAR results.

1146,"  * JPMorgan revenue beat boosts stock; other banks also up* Yum rises on strength in key China business* Japan's Line Corp soars in U.S. market debut* Indexes up: Dow 0.69 pct, S&P 0.51 pct, Nasdaq 0.55 pct   (Updates to early afternoon)By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Tanya AgrawalJuly 14 The benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow scaled new highs yet again as JPMorgan's strong results on Thursday set an upbeat mood for earnings and spurred a rally in financial stocks.JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and the first among its peers to issue results, reported a much better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue.The bank's shares rose 2.1 percent, while the S&P financial index rose 0.91 percent, leading the advancers among the 10 major S&P sectors.The materials index gained 0.85 percent, boosted by Monsanto's 3 percent increase after Bayer  raised its offer for the seed company. ""We saw a significant beat from JPMorgan and that's helping the psychology of the market,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.""With the weaker dollar helping commodities and better-than-expected economic data, the market is taking the path of least resistance with an upward bias.""Expectations of more central bank stimulus has contributed to stocks' gains. The view that the U.S. economy is on solid footing, as well as reduced political uncertainty in Britain and Japan, have also buoyed stocks.At 12:34 p.m. ET (1634 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 127.1 points, or 0.69 percent, at 18,499.22, the S&P 500 was up 11.01 points, or 0.51 percent, at 2,163.44 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 27.55 points, or 0.55 percent, at 5,033.27. The S&P 500 hit 2,168.99, its fourth straight intraday record peak, while the Dow hit 18,537.57 to mark its third straight intraday record high.Hogan said the market needs to see earnings growth to sustain the rally. As the earnings season gathers steam, investors will parse reports to justify stock valuations.Earnings at S&P 500 earnings are expected to have fallen 5 percent in the second quarter, but analysts expect steady growth through the rest of the year, according to StarMine.That should calm investors nervous about the index trading near 17.3 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times. Results so far have been reassuring. KFC owner Yum Brands  rose 3.6 percent to $88.86 after its key China business showed signs of strength.Delta's higher-than-expected quarterly profit sent its shares 2.7 percent higher and led to gain in other airline stocks.Japanese messaging app operator Line Corp soared as much as 36 percent in their debut.Strong economic data also helped the markets. Weekly jobless claims holding at lower levels and producer prices recording their biggest gain in a year in June.Traders say if data continues to point to momentum in the economy, the Federal Reserve could raise rates later in the year.Still, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart said the Fed should remain ""cautious and patient"" until the fallout of Brexit vote becomes clear.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,834 to 1,061. On the Nasdaq, 1,680 issues rose and 1,045 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 66 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 115 new highs and 14 new lows.

1147,"   By David Henry and Sweta Singh  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is lending more and keeping a lid on expenses to combat the scourge of low interest rates, allowing management to stick to financial goals for the year.JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, beat subdued expectations, reporting a 1 percent slide in second-quarter earnings on Thursday, in the face of historically low rates, volatile markets and questions about its future in one of Europe's biggest economies.Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake struck a resilient tone when discussing results, saying JPMorgan would be at the higher end of management's forecast for 2016 loan growth and was also on track to reach a cost-cutting target.During the second quarter, JPMorgan's average book of core loans – those related to ongoing businesses it plans to maintain – grew 16 percent, with particular expansion in mortgages and commercial real estate. Even as deposits grew, the portion it lent out also rose to 66 percent, compared with 61 percent a year ago and 64 percent in the prior quarter.The bank's share price climbed 2 percent in afternoon trading to $64.42 after it reported results.""We had broad-based demand for loans pretty much across categories,"" Lake said on a conference call with journalists. ""I would say that that speaks well for the U.S. economy.""Growing the loan book is especially important as JPMorgan, like other banks, faces extreme challenges in earning money on idle deposits because of very low rates. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) the third- and fourth-biggest U.S. banks, report results on Friday, providing more insight into the health of the industry.The difference, or spread, between 10-year and two-year U.S. Treasuries, an indicator of how much profit banks can make from loans, dropped to 75 basis points on Friday, its lowest level since late 2007.The Fed last raised rates in December, by 0.25 percentage points, after keeping them near zero for almost a decade. At the start of the year, further rate hikes were widely expected but now Wall Street is uncertain whether the Fed will raise rates at all this year. Declining rates put pressure on the amount of money banks can earn relative to their cost of funding, known as net interest income. JPMorgan's net interest income fell during the second quarter relative to the previous one.Another symptom of the bank's struggle with low rates was its return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability. It fell to 13 percent from 14 percent a year earlier. Management has said it should be about 15 percent, but to get there the bank needs higher rates.However, Lake said low rates have sparked ""robust"" demand for new loans, which will help boost net interest income and keep net interest margins stable through the end of the year. He expects the bank to come in at the higher end of its forecast loan growth for 2016, a range of 10 to 15 percent.Executives were also quick to defend the pace of loan growth. They described conditions in certain markets as frothy but manageable, and said they were being careful, and JPMorgan's portfolio of loans was solid.When an analyst described the bank's commercial real estate loan book as ""growing like a weed"" during a conference call, Lake responded: ""Growing like a sunflower, not like a weed."" TOUGH ENVIRONMENT Overall, JPMorgan's second-quarter net income slipped to $6.2 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 from $6.3 billion a year earlier. Net revenue rose 3 percent to $25.2 billion.Earnings per share of $1.55 handsomely beat the average analyst estimate of $1.43 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts had reduced their forecasts for big banks in recent weeks.(For a graphic on bank earnings and stock prices, click here: tmsnrt.rs/1mZb4h8) Even as business grew last quarter, JPMorgan managed to keep down costs, apart from technology. Overall operating expenses fell 6 percent compared with the year-earlier period.""JPMorgan continues to execute really well in a tough environment,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr, noting that the bank beat his expectations not only in loan growth, but also in fixed income trading, investment banking and expenses.JPMorgan stock helped push the S&P 500 and the Dow to fresh highs. However, financial firms are underperforming the wider jump in U.S. stocks. The sector in the S&P .SPSY is down 1.23 percent year to date, the only loser in a wider index up 5.88 percent in the same period.JPMorgan is the first U.S. bank to announce results since Britain voted on June 23 to leave the European Union.The vote to leave the EU, known as Brexit, helped push JPMorgan's fixed-income trading revenue up 35 percent last quarter, as investors scrambled to react to the vote. So far in the third quarter, trading volumes have been ""fine,"" but a normal seasonal decline is expected, Lake said.In addition to its impact on interest rates and markets, Brexit also raised questions about whether banks will shift some of their London operations to other cities.After the vote, JPMorgan said it was considering changes that could result in moving some of its 16,000 UK-based employees.

1149,"  JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) commodity market trading risk measure, known as Value-at-Risk (VaR), was steady in the three months through June, the bank said on Thursday, the first Wall Street bank to report earnings.The bank's VaR indicator was $9 million in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior three months and the same period a year earlier.  The news came as the bank reported a marginally lower second-quarter profit but still beat subdued analyst expectations, helped by loan growth and a tight control on operating expenses. The VaR is a risk-reward indicator that measures the commodities exposure of Wall Street banks, which typically group commodities revenue under the fixed income category and do not break out the sector.

1153,"   By Paula Arend Laier and Luciano Costa | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Shares of Brazil's Cesp rose as much as 21 percent on Friday after the finance secretary of Sao Paulo state, the company's main shareholder, told investors that Cesp is considering a sale of a controlling stake in the power utility.According to a source present at an investor meeting arranged by JPMorgan Chase & Co, state secretary Renato Villela said Sao Paulo state will analyze the sale of the 36 percent stake it has in Brazil's No. 4 electricity generator. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.The state owns 94 percent of Cesp's common shares (CESP3.SA) and 6 percent of preferred shares, which are only lightly traded. The state, coupled with a 5 percent stake that a state participations company owns in Cesp, has voting control of the utility. Preferred shares in Cia Energética do Estado de São Paulo SA (CESP6.SA), as Cesp is formally known, rose in midday trading in Sao Paulo, putting them on track for their biggest one-day jump in nearly eight years.Common shares rose 26 percent, on track for their biggest gain since October 2008. Word of a potential sale comes amid a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in Brazil's electricity industry as longtime holders exit the sector - among them, debt-laden regional governments that need raise cash to cope with Brazil's harshest recession in eight decades. CESP has 6,650 megawatts of generation capacity and is the largest power supplier in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous and industrialized state. It operates five hydropower dams, three on the Paraná River and three in the drainage basin of the Paraíba do Sul River.

1179,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 4 A former Wall Street investment banker proclaimed on Thursday that he was innocent of insider trading charges, testifying that he never tipped his father off to inside information about healthcare mergers.Sean Stewart, an ex-banker at Perella Weinberg Partners and JPMorgan Chase & Co, took the stand in his own defense and told jurors in federal court in Manhattan that he had a great relationship with his father but never intended to help him profit through insider trading.""I never gave my father information so he could trade on it,"" Stewart testified. Stewart's trial began last week, and he testified shortly after prosecutors rested in presenting evidence against him.Stewart, 35, was charged in May 2015 alongside his father, Robert Stewart, an accountant. Prosecutors say Robert Stewart and a friend made $1.16 million trading on tips about five healthcare deals provided by his son from 2011 to 2014. The case has resulted in guilty pleas by Robert Stewart, 61, and his friend, Richard Cunniffe, 62, who, according to prosecutors, secretly recorded the elder Stewart saying his son criticized him for not trading on a tip.Lawyers for Sean Stewart contend their client was unaware of the insider trading scheme. They contend the banker's father betrayed his son to execute trades based on company names his son mentioned while discussing his work. The trial stems from one of several insider trading cases pursued by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office, which has charged 107 people since 2009.The trial is the office's first since it suffered a major setback in 2014 when an appellate court limited the scope of insider trading laws, causing charges against 14 people to be dropped or dismissed.The case is U.S. v.

1183,"  (Revises throughout with comment from JPMorgan memo)Aug 16 Citigroup Inc made another change among consumer banking tech executives on Tuesday and JPMorgan Chase & Co revealed a change of its own as the big banks try to find their way through the changing landscape of digital finance.Citigroup said it named Gavin Michael, who was JPMorgan's head of digital for consumer banking, to be head of technology for its Global Consumer Bank, replacing Mark Torkos, who retired in July.On Thursday afternoon JPMorgan said in an internal memo, which was reviewed by Reuters, that Michael ""will be looking for other opportunities"" and was being replaced by Bill Wallace, who has been at the bank 23 years, heads consumer bank operations and runs the Customer Experience Council.Michael had said he was interested in jobs outside of JPMorgan, according to the memo from Gordon Smith, the chief executive of JPMorgan's consumer bank. Citigroup had been speaking to Michael ""for some time"" as it looked to fill the job, said Citi spokeswoman Elizabeth Fogarty.Smith credited Michael, who was at JPMorgan for three years, with starting a mobile banking application and redesigning the online banking site. Michael was named 2016 digital banker of the year by American Banker, Citigroup said in a statement.At Citigroup, Michael will lead more than 4,000 employees and report to Stephen Bird, chief executive of the consumer bank, and work with Don Callahan, head of operations and technology for the entire company. The developments come after it was announced last week that Heather Cox, who Citigroup hired two years ago to spearhead innovations in digital consumer banking, was leaving the bank for financial services provider USAA. Cox was head of the Citi FinTech unit, which is within the consumer bank and supported by the technology group to be headed by Michael.Citigroup, the most geographically diverse of U.S. banks, has consumer banking operations in 19 countries globally. It is counting more on digital technology to sign and keep customers as it scales back branch offices to be more efficient.JPMorgan is pruning branch locations and adjusting staff as customers change their use of branch services and digital account access. The bank recently said it had to add back some branch employees to reduce lines.

1184,"  LONDON, Aug 16 (IFR) - JP Morgan has set up a credit product development team, which will be headed by Ryan O'Grady, currently co-head of the bank's global debt syndicate, according to a memo seen by IFR.The unit is a new creation which aims to ""better deliver the full range of credit products"" to clients and ""partner more effectively"" with investment banking coverage and sales teams.O'Grady started in his present position in October 2014, after the bank merged its regional debt syndicates into one global team. His co-head, Bob LoBue, will remain in joint charge of this global syndicate team. But because of his new role, O'Grady will now only focus on international syndicate work. His direct reports in the global team will now also report to LoBue.In addition, the global unit will now also include the public finance syndicate business, run by Robert Servas. Previously, it consisted of supranationals, sovereigns and agencies, covered bonds and financial institutions in EMEA, as well as securitised products and Asia-Pacific, North America and International. ""Acting as one global team will promote the sharing of best practices and enable us to better coordinate across products as well as with our partners in coverage,"" said the memo from Matt Cherwin and Guy America, co-heads of Credit Trading & Syndicate, Securitized Products and Public Finance.In May, JP Morgan promoted Richard Gustard and Keith Price in its SSA business after Carl Norrey retired from his position head of rates securities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

1192,"   By A. Ananthalakshmi, Bernardo Vizcaino and Carolyn Cohn | KUALA LUMPUR/SYDNEY/LONDON  KUALA LUMPUR/SYDNEY/LONDON Aug 19 U.S. investment bank JPMorgan will include Islamic bonds, or sukuk, in its emerging markets indices for the first time from later this year, widening the appeal of Islamic instruments among global debt investors.JPMorgan, which runs the most widely used benchmarks of emerging market debt, will include eight sukuk across its index family starting Oct. 31.The decision was taken after JPMorgan conducted an annual governance review it said in a research report to clients, and seen by Reuters.Dollar-denominated sukuk from Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia will be included in JPMorgan's flagship EMBI Global Diversified index, against which an estimated $313 billion in assets is benchmarked.The move could help sukuk break away from their traditional buy-and-hold investor base.""Despite having a market size of $200 billion, so far sukuk was seen as an exotic asset class mainly targeted at Islamic banks,"" said Okan Akin, emerging market credit analyst at AllianceBernstein in London.The decision by JPMorgan would increase the liquidity of sukuk instruments, the lack of which has been the main negative feature of the market, Akin said. Including sukuk into such benchmarks would attract higher bids and may support prices at higher levels, said Anita Yadav, head of fixed income research at Emirates NBD in Dubai.""Non-traditional investors that generally hesitate to  invest in sukuk may also be forced to buy should they be using JPMorgan as their performance benchmark,"" Yadav said.Sukuk, which follow religious principles such as bans on interest and gambling, have their core centres in the Gulf region and Southeast Asia although the funding format has made inroads in Western markets in recent years. TEST FOR REGULATORY REGIME While the inclusion of sukuk will benefit the sector in the short term, the omissions of some names could also encourage regulators to address persistent weaknesses in the sector.To be eligible sukuk must be rated, have their liquidity assessed prior to inclusion in the JPMorgan indices and meet other criteria similar to conventional bonds. At the outset, however, not all issuers might meet such requirements.Only two corporate sukuk will be included in the JPMorgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index: a 2023 sukuk from Dubai's DP World and a 2024 sukuk from the Gulf region's largest utility Saudi Electricity Co. Pakistan's $1 billion sukuk maturing in 2019 will be included in the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index alongside sukuk from Indonesia and Malaysia, but the likes of Qatar and Bahrain are currently absent.Malaysia was the only country to have its local currency sukuk included in JPMorgan's Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets, which comprises higher yielding local debt.Two sukuk from Malaysia maturing in 2023 and 2026 will be included in the GBI-EM index, which is tracked by an estimated $207 billion in assets under management.""We believe this move could boost foreign interest on a gradual basis,"" said Mohamad Safri Shahul Hamid, deputy chief executive officer of Malaysia's CIMB Islamic Bank.""Active investors will move into markets when they spot opportunities and this would be one of them.""Foreign holdings in the two Malaysian sukuk would be expected to increase over the next three to six months due to inclusion in the index, said Winson Phoon, fixed income analyst at Maybank Investment Bank.

1193,"   By Carl O'Donnell and Ransdell Pierson  Medivation's MDVN.O $14 billion sale to U.S. drug giant Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) for a hefty premium, the largest U.S. biotechnology acquisition so far this year, had investors on Monday speculating about more dealmaking in the sector.Shares of Incyte Corp (INCY.O) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O), rose as much as 11 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Incyte and Seattle Genetics, which have respective market capitalizations of $15.4 billion and $6.7 billion, focus on innovative cancer treatments and, like Medivation, are already producing revenue.For the other companies that also bid for Medivation, including Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O), such targets could serve as coveted consolation prizes.  Major drug makers are vying for a foothold in oncology because the sector promises to be among the single biggest contributors to sales growth over the next five years, according to data from consultancy Ernst and Young. Large pharmaceutical companies have been itching to make big deals all year. The most deal-hungry are wrestling with generic competition, or are rushing to gain a leadership position in a burgeoning therapeutic area, such as cancer or rare diseases. This acquisition drive could spell deals even for other promising biotechnology companies outside the oncology sector. Shares of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc (BMRN.O) for example, a $16.7 billion market capitalization company that focuses on rare diseases, rose as much as 7 percent on takeover speculation.Pfizer's acquisition of Medivation for $81.50 per share in cash, represents a close to 120-percent premium to Medivation's stock price before Reuters reported on March 30 that the company was working with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to field takeover approaches.It is a rich valuation by most metrics. The deal values Medivation at 17.9 times its revenue, versus a 12.8 times average for deals in the sector in the last eight years, according to a research note by BMO Capital Markets.  The deal could be a much needed shot in the arm for dealmaking in the biotech sector, which has been tepid ever since the Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI plunged more than 30 percent late last year, largely due to heightened political pressure on drug prices.So far this year, dealmaking activity in life sciences is down 64 percent from this time last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters.  But that could change as the corporate boards of mid-sized biotech companies, which have been hesitant to seriously consider a sale in a down market, are tempted by the prospect of juicy premiums, investors, analysts and investment bankers said.""Given the scarcity of mid-cap biotech, we believe the remaining companies could see increasing interest, as large pharma continues to look toward biotech as a source of growth,"" Do Kim, an analyst for BMO Capital Markets, wrote in his note.Other companies to watch for as possible acquisition targets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRTX.O), Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc (ALXN.O), Neurocrine Biosciences Inc (NBIX.O) and Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (ICPT.O), Kim noted.

1200,"   By Steve Slater  LONDON, Sept 5 (IFR) - Barclays has poached another executive from JP Morgan to head its investment bank, leaving the British bank with seven of its most senior bankers as alumni of its US rival.Barclays on Monday named Tim Throsby, currently global head of equities at JP Morgan, as president of Barclays corporate and international (BC&I) and chief executive of its corporate and investment bank.He will run the investment bank and fill the gap left by the departure of Tom King in March. He will also be in charge of corporate banking, Barclays' UK and US credit cards, wealth management and the payments business.It fills the last major senior appointment by Jes Staley since he joined as chief executive in December 2015.Throsby, an Australian, is expected to join in January and will be based in London. He will join the executive committee and report to Staley. Throsby adds to a bulging group of former JP Morgan bankers at Barclays, including Staley himself, who used to run its investment bank.They include finance director Tushar Morzaria; chief operating officer Paul Compton; and chief risk officer CS Venkatakrishnan. Mark Ashton-Rigby, its chief information officer, and Emily Portney, chief financial officer for corporate and international, have also previously worked at JP Morgan, which prides itself on having a deep bench of talented bankers.Throsby is well regarded at JP Morgan for helping strengthen its equities business and expand its electronic trading platform, people familiar with the matter said. JP Morgan ranked third for global equities revenues last year behind Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according to analysis firm Coalition.Throsby joined JP Morgan in April 2010 as head of equity derivatives and was promoted to head of equities in September 2012. He has held senior roles at a number of banks, including at  Credit Suisse and Macquarie before he joined Goldman Sachs in 1995 as co-head of equity derivatives for Asia and Japan. In 2002, he moved to Lehman Brothers to head the Asia and Japan equities division and then its global equities business in 2004, and in 2005 he joined US hedge fund Citadel, where he ran its Asian business from Hong Kong.The appointment of Throsby effectively completes Staley's top team, at a time when his turnaround plan appears to be gaining traction but there are still considerable operational and strategic challenges ahead.The bank has to separate its UK retail banking business by 2019 to shield depositors from any problems that could arise in its investment bank or other businesses.The investment bank is being slimmed down, and Staley has quit some countries to pursue a transatlantic strategy focused on its two ""home"" markets of Britain and the US.",2016-09-05,JPM,"Mon Sep 5, 2016 | 7:02am EDT",MOVES-Barclays taps JP Morgan's Throsby to run investment bank,http://www.reuters.com//article/moves-barclays-throsby-idUSL8N1BH212?type=companyNews

Starting early next year, the bank will use InvestCloud to customize website dashboards and mobile apps for clients ranging from individuals with investments of $1,000 to managers of family investment offices with $1 billion or more.Over time, the tools will become more refined for people who make their own trading decisions, people who only check managed accounts, and people who manage part and hire out the rest.

1228,"  * JP Morgan lifts target for OTP Bank shares     * Polish stock index up on clothes retailer LPP, insurer PZU     * Currencies, bonds ease slightly, Fed rate hike in prospect     * Czech minister says exit from crown cap should be cautious   (Adds insurer PZU stocks rise, updates prices)     By Sandor Peto     BUDAPEST, Oct 4 Budapest led a firming of Central European stock markets on Tuesday, with OTP Bank  rising to a two-week high after JP Morgan lifted its target price for the shares.     Shares in OTP, the region's biggest independent lender, rose 2.9 percent to 7,481 forints ($27.17) by 1305 GMT, after JP Morgan boosted its target to 9,570 forints from 7,310 forints.     Stocks on the Frankfurt bourse, reopening after a public holiday, reflected improved sentiment over Deutsche Bank , whose problems cast gloom on Europe's banking sector last week.     Deutsche shares firmed to a two-week high from a record low hit on Friday, on prospects of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar fine.      OTP, heading towards 8-1/2-year highs reached last month, helped Budapest's stock index gain 1.8 percent.     Warsaw's bluechip index drew extra support from a surge of more than 20 percent by Poland's biggest clothing retailer LPP. Its shares hit 2-month highs after it reported a 20 percent rise in revenue in September on Monday.     Shares in PZU, the region's biggest insurer, jumped almost 5 percent after it said it would pay out at least 50 percent of earnings as dividend in the 2016-2020 period.      Sentiment in regional markets remained underpinned by a rise in September manufacturing activity indices in  Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, shown in figures released on Monday.     But currencies and government bonds were treading water. The forint was flat against the euro, the leu  eased 0.2 percent and the zloty firmed 0.1 percent.     Hungarian bond yields rose 1-2 basis points due to hawkish comments from a Federal Reserve setter, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.     Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said the Fed should not delay in raising interest rates in order to keep up with the economy. A rise in U.S. rates could make Central European debt yields relatively less interesting.     The Czech crown's euro exchange rate implied in six-month forwards was flat at 26.905.     The Czech central bank has been keeping the spot crown rate  on the weaker side of 27 since 2013 and last week shifted the earliest possible end to the policy until the second quarter of next year, while reaffirming it expected to refloat the crown in mid-2017.     Industry Minister Jan Mladek said the bank should ensure it does not shock the economy when it eventually exits the intervention regime next year.

1231,"  * JPMorgan-led rescue plan proving difficult - sources* Funds open to Passera plan but no commitment - sources* No investment to be approved before Dec. 4 vote - source   (Adds details, quotes)By Pamela BarbagliaLONDON, Oct 7 A former Italian minister is preparing an alternative rescue plan for Monte dei Paschi di Siena amid signs that a 5 billion euro ($5.6 billion) recapitalisation arranged by JPMorgan is not getting investor support, three sources said.Corrado Passera, who as well as being a former industry minister served as chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, is working with private equity firms including Warburg Pincus  on a plan that includes a reserved capital increase of 2.0-2.5 billion euros, the sources said.Two of the sources said none of the funds approached by Passera had committed to backing the plan and while they were open to doing a deal, this was subject to due diligence. Another source said no deal was imminent. It is far from certain that Monte dei Paschi will turn to Passera, who was not immediately available for comment, or that his scheme would stand a better chance of success than JPMorgan's, one of the sources said.And a source close to the JPMorgan-led consortium of investment banks said they were pressing ahead with their plan and were confident it would succeed. OLDEST BUT WEAKEST The sources said private equity funds who have been working with Passera trust his ability to turn around the Siena-based bank, the world's oldest, which in July emerged as the weakest lender in the latest round of European stress tests.Monte dei Paschi's board rejected in July a last-minute attempt by Passera to put forward a rescue plan backed by Swiss investment bank UBS, a long-standing adviser to the Tuscan bank. It approved instead the privately-backed rescue arranged by JPMorgan with the help of Mediobanca. However, the deal has since ran into trouble, senior bankers say. A preliminary survey of investors over the summer found scant interest in a third cash call in as many years, while analysts have questioned the feasibility of a capital raising that totals 10 times the bank's current market value.Last month, Monte dei Paschi abruptly replaced chief executive Fabrizio Viola with the head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Italy, Marco Morelli, in the hope of winning investors confidence and is now studying a debt-to-equity conversion to cut the size of the share sale.JPMorgan is also looking for investors to back a reserved share sale but has yet to find any, several sources said.Recent talks with a sovereign wealth fund fell through, one of the sources said, raising fears the bank may need state aid.Most foreign investors are unwilling to commit any cash until a Dec. 4 referendum on constitutional reform that could unseat Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government, bankers say.""No investment committee will ever approve a deal for Monte dei Paschi without knowing the outcome of the Italian referendum,"" an investor close to the bank said.

JPMorgan's after tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. Both revenues and profits topped analysts' estimates.Earnings per share fell to $1.58 from $1.68 a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected $1.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Earnings per share fell to $1.58 from $1.68.The year-earlier net profit was boosted by a tax benefit of $2.2 billion.

1246,"   By Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie  Zhu | HONG KONG  HONG KONG JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would be the first departure by a top-tier global investment bank from China's securities segment.Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute.Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms.Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain.JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing.""China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise,"" the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move.Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive.Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC), the country's top investment bank at the time.""It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table,"" said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. ""There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalizing and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity.""China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory.It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favoring Hong Kong-established banks.HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase.Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy.  Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

1253,"  (Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text)By Liana B. BakerOct 25 It has been six years since Goldman Sachs Group Inc, a perennial No. 1 in the M&A league tables, did not feature as an adviser on the year's biggest deal. But sticking with Rupert Murdoch over Bugs Bunny just cost it this year's biggest deal.Goldman missed out on an advisory role on telecom giant AT&T's deal to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion because of its perceived conflict stemming from advising media mogul Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc two years ago, when it made a failed bid for Time Warner.The media conglomerate's franchises range from CNN and HBO to Harry Potter films, hit TV show ""The Big Bang Theory"" and Bugs Bunny. The code name for Time Warner in deal talks was ""Rabbit,"" perhaps an homage to Warner Bros' carrot-chewing, wise-talking cartoon character.As a result, investment banking rival Morgan Stanley  is now No. 1 in the U.S. merger advisory rankings with $435.3 billion in announced deals, about $435 million ahead of Goldman, which has $434.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.""CEOs value loyalty from investment banks and have long memories,"" said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor. ""This can put banks in an impossible position, because companies often expect them to turn down business now for the uncertain prospect of business later.""To be sure, the year is not yet over, and on a global basis, Goldman remains the undisputed king. The 147-year-old investment bank has ranked No. 1 in the global M&A league tables every year since 1997, with the exception of 2009 and 2010, when it ranked No. 2 behind Morgan Stanley. The last time Goldman missed out on the biggest deal of the year was 2010, on the $27.5 billion acquisition of Mexican telecommunications group Carso Global Telecom by America Movil.But Goldman's absence from the AT&T-Time Warner deal shows that even the most successful investment banks can miss out on mega-deals by virtue of companies showing a preference for advisers that stick with them rather than their competitors.When this year's second-biggest deal was announced last month, Bayer AG's $66 billion acquisition of seeds and agrichemicals group Monsanto Co, Goldman was also absent from the advisers listed.Goldman had won no favor with Monsanto after having helped thwart its hostile bid for Syngenta AG last year by providing advice to the Swiss seeds company, and subsequently helping it sell itself to ChemChina for $43 billion instead.

1254,"   By Liana B. Baker  It has been six years since Goldman Sachs Group Inc, a perennial No. 1 in the M&A league tables, did not feature as an adviser on the year's biggest deal. But sticking with Rupert Murdoch over Bugs Bunny just cost it this year's biggest deal.Goldman missed out on an advisory role on telecom giant AT&T's deal to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion because of its perceived conflict stemming from advising media mogul Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc two years ago, when it made a failed bid for Time Warner.The media conglomerate's franchises range from CNN and HBO to Harry Potter films, hit TV show ""The Big Bang Theory"" and Bugs Bunny. The code name for Time Warner in deal talks was ""Rabbit,"" perhaps an homage to Warner Bros' carrot-chewing, wise-talking cartoon character.As a result, investment banking rival Morgan Stanley is now No. 1 in the U.S. merger advisory rankings with $435.3 billion in announced deals, about $435 million ahead of Goldman, which has $434.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. ""CEOs value loyalty from investment banks and have long memories,"" said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor. ""This can put banks in an impossible position, because companies often expect them to turn down business now for the uncertain prospect of business later.""To be sure, the year is not yet over, and on a global basis, Goldman remains the undisputed king. The 147-year-old investment bank has ranked No. 1 in the global M&A league tables every year since 1997, with the exception of 2009 and 2010, when it ranked No. 2 behind Morgan Stanley.The last time Goldman missed out on the biggest deal of the year was 2010, on the $27.5 billion acquisition of Mexican telecommunications group Carso Global Telecom by America Movil.But Goldman's absence from the AT&T-Time Warner deal shows that even the most successful investment banks can miss out on mega-deals by virtue of companies showing a preference for advisers that stick with them rather than their competitors. When this year's second-biggest deal was announced last month, Bayer AG's $66 billion acquisition of seeds and agrichemicals group Monsanto Co, Goldman was also absent from the advisers listed.Goldman had won no favor with Monsanto after having helped thwart its hostile bid for Syngenta AG last year by providing advice to the Swiss seeds company, and subsequently helping it sell itself to ChemChina for $43 billion instead.The New York-based bank did, however, manage to secure a financing role in Bayer's debt package for the Monsanto acquisition.And Goldman's allegiance to Murdoch has also paid off handsomely over the years. It advised Fox in 2014 on a $9 billion deal to sell European satellite TV firms to British Sky Broadcasting Group and on the corporate split of News Corp and Fox in 2013.

1266,"   By Dan Freed and David Henry  JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want America's most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street.A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is traveling outside the United States, could not be reached.Trump's close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive.A person familiar with Trump's personnel efforts said the transition team's list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump.Trump's controversial rhetoric and behavior during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization.Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry ""got away with murder"" and would not be let off the hook.Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House. At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trump's advisers would get ""the best and brightest"" to run the economy.Hensarling's office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job.“Serving in his Cabinet is not something I’ve indicated an interest in and it’s not something I am pursuing,"" the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis.Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages. A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon ""the worst banker in the United States.""However, Dimon has managed to retain a reputation within the banking industry as a distinguished leader, in part by the way he handled those scandals and the way he talks about JPMorgan's role in society as the largest U.S. bank.For instance, Dimon decided to have JPMorgan make big investments in Detroit, calling it a civic duty to turn around an economically challenged city. His memos, speeches and letters to shareholders are often sprinkled with patriotic language.""America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done,"" the 60-year-old chairman and CEO said in a memo to JPMorgan Chase employees following Tuesday's election. ""No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy."" However, Dimon has said as recently as September that he would not want a role as Treasury Secretary. If he holds to that, it could put him and JPMorgan in an awkward position.Saying ""no"" to a presidential request to join the cabinet is unusual, and the bank would then be overseen by appointees from an administration Dimon rejected.Even so, his associates do not expect Dimon to say ""yes."" Dimon has said his determination to act would make it hard to make political compromises. Talking before an audience in September, he said the only job in government he would want is the one Trump is about to get.""I would love to be president of the United States of America,"" Dimon told the Economic Club of Washington. ""Until Donald Trump got to where he was, they said you'll never see a rich businessman who's never been in politics be president. I clearly was wrong about that.""

1272,"   By Elizabeth Dilts and David Henry   (The Nov.9 2016 story was refiled to correct the number of advisers affiliated with Commonwealth Financial Network to 1,650 from 7,000 in the seventh paragraph)By Elizabeth Dilts and David HenryNEW YORK As Wall Street's wealth management firms scramble to comply with a new U.S. Department of Labor rule, JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Wednesday it will stop offering commissions-paying retirement accounts.In doing so, J.P. Morgan will join Bank of America's Merrill Lynch and other firms that recently adopted the approach.The so-called fiduciary rule, which takes effect in April, is aimed at forcing brokerages to put their clients' interests first by eliminating any conflict of interest created by brokers' commissions.   The rule targets ""transactional"" accounts, which charge clients a commission for every trade, and rather than wade through the complexities of the 1,000-plus page regulation, many firms are just dropping transactional retirement accounts altogether.Starting in April, clients of Chase Wealth Management, Private Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities have two options: they can either chose to pay a financial adviser a flat fee based on how much money they have invested, or they can use an online platform to manage their retirement account themselves.  ""We believe this reflects how our clients are doing business today,"" said Barry Sommers, chief executive of the bank's wealth management business.   Merrill Lynch and Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent brokerage with 1,650 advisers, both announced similar plans last month.The move will only affect a sliver of J.P. Morgan's wealth management clients, which range from mass affluent to ultra high net worth.  Just 5 percent of the $1.1 trillion in client assets managed at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management & Investment Solutions are held in retirement accounts, and only those in commissions-paying accounts will be impacted by the change.

1282,"   By Sumeet Chatterjee, Julie  Zhu and Lisa Jucca | HONG KONG  HONG KONG The direction of the dollar, which has surged since the U.S. presidential election, will determine the outlook for Asian equities in the near to medium term, the head of emerging at JPMorgan (JPM.N) Asset Management said. The dollar rose to a one-year high against a basket of currencies on expectations U.S. interest rates will rise faster than previously anticipated if President-elect Donald Trump cuts taxes and boosts infrastructure spending.""The first thing we need to focus on is has the direction of the dollar changed because of the change in the administration,"" Richard Titherington, who is also head of Asia Pacific Equities team, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit.""Investors had been assuming that the dollar had peaked. If that assumption turns out to be wrong ... that does change the landscape quite dramatically and in general terms you would normally think that a rising dollar is a negative for emerging markets and Asian equities.""MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS ended flat on Wednesday having touched a four-month low touched earlier this week. The index is down more than 4 percent since Nov. 8.Sharp gains in U.S. bond yields have drawn investors to the dollar, and the dollar index is just 0.5 percent away from its highest in more than 13-1/2 years. The strength has fanned fears funds are shifting to the United States from emerging markets. The Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS, on the other hand, weakened to 6.8703 to the dollar, its lowest level since December 2008.There was no investor panic because of the weaker yuan as the depreciation in the currency was backed by a stabilization in the world's second-largest economy, Titherington said at the summit in Hong Kong.""The Chinese authorities have managed to engineer a currency adjustment without creating concerns that there is capital flight going on, which is a positive,"" he said, adding that the yuan would weaken further if the dollar continues to strengthen. Within Asia, Titherington said he was bullish on the long-term prospects for Indian and Vietnamese equity markets.He said, however, that India could see a negative impact in the short term due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's order to withdraw large denomination banknotes from circulation in a shock ""demonetization"" drive to fight tax evasion, corruption and forgery.""Is the sell-off that you've seen in the equities over the last week, is that an opportunity or is it the market telling you this currency reform is going to cause significant problems for a long period of time?,"" he said, referring to the withdrawal of some bank notes. ""I will tend to be optimistic ... certainly the government in India is taking a very big risk which I think is a long-term positive.""Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits (Editing by David Clarke)",2016-11-16,JPM,"Wed Nov 16, 2016 | 6:20am EST",Dollar direction to dictate Asian equities outlook: JPMorgan Asset Management,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-investment-summit-jpmorgan-idUSKBN13B184?type=companyNews

The SEC and Justice Department had been investigating over several years whether some of JPMorgan’s hiring efforts involved bribes, in violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The SEC will receive $130 million of the settlement, with $72 million going to Justice and $61.9 million to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which penalized the bank ""for unsafe and unsound practices.""JPMorgan did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business.JPMorgan is the first major bank to settle a case over the hiring of ""princelings,"" as the offspring and other relatives of top Chinese officials are popularly known. In recent years, several other banks, including HSBC (HSBA.L) and Goldman Sachs [GSGSC.UL], have said their hiring practices in Asia were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities.  The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime to bribe overseas officials to win business, even if the payments are non-monetary. A JPMorgan spokesman said in an email: “The conduct was unacceptable.” The hiring program was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible, the spokesman said.  Authorities said JPMorgan’s Asia unit created an elaborate program, called “Sons and Daughters,” that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires. Those candidates received preferential treatment, bypassing JPMorgan’s normal recruitment practices, the SEC said.   Between 2006 and 2013, JPMorgan hired around 200 interns and full-term employees at the request of its Asia clients, as well as Chinese officials at state-owned companies. Those state-owned companies brought JPMorgan more than $100 million in revenue, the SEC said.For example, in urging the hiring of one candidate, a JPMorgan banker said, “It will strengthen our relationship” with a client and solidify “our position as an advisor to him and the IPOs of his companies (expected to be >$500mm in offering size,” according to SEC’s order. Quid pro quo business arrangements remain an entrenched part of business culture in China that is very hard to avoid, said Alex Bourelly, who leads the SEC enforcement practice at the law firm Baker Botts LLP. Local staff members who have many government contacts know they can be quickly hired elsewhere if they are caught and fired for making improper payments, Bourelly said. “U.S. law has its limits in terms of how it can affect the behavior of people around the world,” he said.

1288,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former JPMorgan Chase & Co executive who spent eight years on the run in Argentina pleaded guilty on Friday to U.S. charges that he embezzled $5.4 million from clients at the bank and at a prior employer, UBS AG.Hernan Arbizu, who became involved in a tax-evasion probe involving JPMorgan, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges including wire fraud and embezzlement. He was extradited in June from Argentina.""I knew what I was doing was wrong,"" he said in court. ""I'm very sorry and am ashamed by my actions.""The 48-year-old citizen of Argentina faces a mandatory-minimum two-year prison sentence and a maximum of 422 years. But under a plea agreement, Arbizu agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, which his lawyer, Guy Lewis, said could help him avoid further prison. What that cooperation entails, Lewis said, ""remains to be seen."" JPMorgan declined to comment on Friday.Arbizu was first indicted in 2008, the same year he was fired by JPMorgan, where he was a vice president in its private banking division. He worked at UBS from 2002 to 2006.While at JPMorgan, Arbizu oversaw more than $200 million of  client assets and was responsible for managing relationships with high-net-worth Argentine customers, according to the bank. Prosecutors said that from March 2007 to April 2008, Arbizu initiated 12 wire transfers from clients at UBS and JPMorgan totaling nearly $5.38 million, about half of which came from a single JPMorgan account.In lawsuits JPMorgan filed against Arbizu in 2008 and 2009, the bank said he wired the $2.8 million to an account at UBS to conceal the millions of dollars that he had previously stolen from one of its customers. JPMorgan said that after it discovered evidence of the wire transfers, Arbizu, then living in Connecticut, fled to Argentina, taking with him confidential data on clients.That data later became the basis of a tax evasion investigation and raid by Argentina authorities of JPMorgan's office in Buenos Aires in 2008 after Arbizu handed over a list of customers.

1291,"   By David Henry | NEW YORK  NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co is once again facing questions about who will succeed its larger-than-life chief executive after Jamie Dimon was courted by the incoming U.S. president for the role of Treasury secretary.Dimon, 60, has been running the largest U.S. bank for more than a decade and has faced questions about his longevity in the role before: when potential successors left, when he allowed an embarrassing $6.2 billion derivatives trading loss and, most recently, when he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014.Although associates have said Dimon is not interested in the Treasury job, the recent invitation from a member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team to apply for the job was a reminder to interested parties, including some investors, that his time at the helm is finite.""He is not going to be CEO forever,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares.Although a sudden departure would not necessarily lead the investor to sell the stock, it would be ""troubling,"" Todd said. ""I would have to gain some comfort with who was taking over that role.""Dimon will not be easy to replace. He has won a higher valuation for JPMorgan stock than rival banks by shepherding it through the financial crisis without any quarterly losses, while earning relatively high returns on equity and explaining the workings of the bank to analysts as though he were a demanding business school professor. He has been quick to point out that the JPMorgan board has a succession plan in place, whether he departs abruptly due to unforeseen circumstances – known colloquially as a ""hit by a truck"" scenario – or whether he takes part in a more gradual transition. The board does not publicize those plans. Doing so could prompt executives who are not the favorite to leave.There are six key members of Dimon's management team who are often mentioned in discussions about succession. They range in age from 46 to 58, with the older executives seen as ""hit by a truck"" contenders, and younger ones thought to be potential CEOs-in-training.Each has some qualities Dimon has identified as necessary for the next CEO – like moving through senior roles in different parts of the company, having experience with the investment bank, or having the temperament to be the public face of JPMorgan – but none clearly has them all. JPMORGAN'S GOT TALENT Gordon Smith, a 58-year-old Briton with computer science training, is chief executive of the consumer bank. He runs nearly half of JPMorgan, including Chase branches, credit cards, mortgages and auto loans.Dimon hired him from American Express Co in 2007. Although Smith has many of the skills needed to be CEO, he is close enough to Dimon's age that insiders see him as an unlikely long-term candidate.Daniel Pinto, 53, who oversees corporate and investment banking, is also on the succession shortlist.Dimon has entrusted Pinto with running the most volatile part of JPMorgan and dealing with the biggest corporate clients. A native of Argentina, Pinto spends much of his time working from JPMorgan's London office. Doug Petno, who runs commercial banking, is another possible contender. With $212 billion in assets, his segment of the company is bigger than all but a handful of competitors. The 51-year-old came up through the ranks as lender and investment banker to the oil and gas industry.Mary Erdoes, 49, who runs asset management, is also said to be in the running. Erdoes keeps a relatively low public profile as she travels the world to cater to the richest clients.Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who is 47, is also floated as a possibility. Lake already has a high profile, because she handles public presentations of the bank's financial results each quarter and has shown she can be as dextrous with numbers as Dimon.But while Lake is known internally for grasping the  details behind summaries she receives from business heads, she has not run any of JPMorgan's units day to day.Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames is the youngest contender, at 46. In his role, he has the advantage of learning all segments of the bank from the inside out.  Dimon turned to Zames in early 2012 to clean up the portfolio of the bad ""London Whale"" derivatives trader that was costly not only in dollars but in reputation. Zames came from fixed-income trading, and has worked through financial crises going back to 1998.'I DON'T WANT TO RETIRE' Dimon has said JPMorgan has a ""deep bench"" of talent, with several people who could take over. But he has been careful not to clearly show favorites.When all goes right with succession plans, companies tend to announce a few months ahead of time that their leaders will be relinquishing the CEO title to a successor but remain on the board as chairman for a smooth transition. During the interim, other executives in the horse race tend to peel off, letting up-and-comers take over their own roles.JPMorgan has resolved nearly all of its major legal investigations. Dimon received a clean bill of health after undergoing cancer treatment. And, apparently, he has no plans to join Trump's cabinet. So unless an unexpected event forces his hand, Dimon may not feel compelled to tell investors who is next.""My retirement date, every time you ask me that, I'm going to say five years,"" Dimon said in response to a question last year.

1298,"  NEW YORK The stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has been climbing so much that ""at a certain price,"" the company may consider issuing a special dividend to distribute excess capital rather than buying back additional stock, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday.Dimon, speaking at an investor conference, said that if the stock is not cheap compared to its intrinsic value, he would generally rather pay out capital to existing shareholders than buy back stock from selling investors.JPMorgan shares traded at $82.66 shortly after Dimon spoke, down 0.6 percent in morning trading. They are up this year by 25 percent, with three-fourths of that gain having come since the U.S. presidential election.The company reported that its tangible book value per share was $51.23 at the end of September. Dimon, who was speaking in a question-and-answer format that touched on a variety of topics, also said that fourth-quarter markets revenue is running higher than a year earlier by ""15 percent-plus.""In the credit card wars being waged by banks, Dimon said JPMorgan plans to introduce more new cards after finding surprisingly strong demand for its Sapphire Reserve premium card this year. He did not say when the new cards will be offered, or how they might differ from the bank's current product line. Dimon passed up the opportunity to make strong arguments for changes in Washington to regulations passed since the financial crisis. He did, however, recommended adjustments in the Dodd-Frank financial reform act to make rules that are more prescriptive and give regulators less discretion to set specific terms. Repealing the so-called Volcker rule against proprietary trading would not materially impact JPMorgan's results, Dimon said.
