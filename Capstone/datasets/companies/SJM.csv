Smucker Co forecast full-year results below analysts' estimates, citing increased competition in its peanut butter business and a shift in consumer preference away from artificially sweetened fruit spreads.Shares of the maker of Jif peanut butter and Folgers coffee fell as much as 8.5 percent on Friday, after the company also reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results.Smucker had signed longer-term peanut purchase contracts, which meant that unlike rivals, the company did not benefit from a drop in prices. Smucker competes with companies such as Hormel Foods Corp , owner of the Skippy peanut butter brand, and ConAgra Foods Inc that owns the Peter Pan brand.Morningstar Inc analyst Ken Perkins said Hormel Foods was putting more energy behind the Skippy brand than Unilever Plc  used to, increasing the level of competition in the peanut butter category.""We anticipate this heightened level of competitive activity will continue through the fourth quarter,"" Smucker's Chief Operating Officer Vincent Byrd said on a conference call.The company also said its fruit spreads business, mainly the Better for You division of sugar-free and low-sugar products, was hurt as consumers moved away from artificially sweetened items.Sales for Smucker's fruit spreads and Jif peanut butter declined 7 percent in the third quarter ended Jan. 31, with volumes falling 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively. ""Clearly, consumers are more focused on health and wellness,"" Perkins said, adding that Smucker would have to adjust its brand positioning because of the shift.Smucker said it now expected revenue to fall by 5 percent in the year ending April, which translates to sales of about $5.60 billion. The company forecast a 2 percent decline in 2014 sales in November.Analysts were expecting full-year revenue of $5.78 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Smucker also cut its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $5.55-$5.60 per share from $5.72-$5.82, below the average analyst estimate of $5.78 per share. Last year, the company reduced list prices for most of its packaged coffee sold in the United States to pass on the benefit of lower commodity costs to customers.Sales from Smucker's U.S. retail coffee business fell 8 percent in the third quarter.

7,"  (Recasts first paragraph to include milestone, adds background)NEW YORK, June 3 J.M. Smucker Co said on Tuesday that it had raised list prices on most of its U.S. packaged coffee, primarily the well-known Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts brands, for the first time since 2011 because of soaring green coffee costs.Smucker increased prices by an average of 9 percent due to rallying bean prices, the company said. Price increases by large U.S. roasters have been largely expected after arabica coffee futures prices jumped nearly 90 percent within three months to a 26-month high in April on concerns that Brazil's worst drought in decades would damage crops in the world's biggest producer. The market has since dropped around 20 percent.The move by Smucker, which is considered a trendsetter, is likely to trigger price hikes by other major U.S. coffee roasters as they seek to protect profits from rising bean prices that took the industry by surprise. The price increase does not include K-Cup packs, Smucker said in a statement. This is Smucker's first price move since February 2013. At that time, the company lowered retail prices on Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts brands by an average of 6 percent, its third straight cut as the futures market made a steady decline.Smucker last raised prices in May 2011 as arabica futures more than doubled to a 34-year high above $3 per lb.

9,"   By Marcy Nicholson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The last time U.S. coffee roaster J.M. Smucker Co raised prices, sales of brands like Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts were booming and single-serving competitors were a newly launched curiosity.Smucker is the first major roaster to bow to the unrelenting cost pressure of a 50 percent surge in arabica futures prices due to a drought. Roasters have resisted raising prices because they face a shrinking market share and the last price hike three years cut deeply into consumption.In the past, price moves by Smucker, seen as an industry trendsetter, have triggered similar adjustments by other U.S. roasters.But still stinging from the consumer backlash in 2011, other coffee firms may be more reluctant than ever before to follow suit.""No one really ever wants to take pricing (action) in a declining volume category,"" said Jonathan Feeney, food and beverage analyst for Athlos Research in Wayne, Pennsylvania.By dipping its toe in the water, Smucker will measure both its customers' willingness to accept higher prices and its rivals' readiness to follow.""Hopefully the private label and other coffee processors follow. If they don't, you'll see a lot less Folgers sold and they'll have to respond,"" he said. CONTRAST TO 2010 Smucker has implemented the price hike four months after futures prices started surging as a drought scorched crops in Brazil, the world's No. 1 producer, reflecting greater caution and concerns about losing sales, experts said.That is in stark contrast to May 2010 when the firm made its first price hike in the early stages of a prolonged futures rally. Over the next 12 months, it raised prices four times by a combined 38 percent.""All of the (roasters) are leery of price raises because they're concerned it will further decline their canned (coffee) sales,"" said Sean Bredt, a vice president at Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee, one of the largest North American private label roasters. The root of the hesitation goes back to 2011 when U.S. retail coffee sales volumes measured in tonnes fell about 2 percent, ending at least three years of growth, as roasters implemented sweeping price hikes, data from beverage industry analyst Euromonitor shows.Smucker's sales volume measured in tonnes fell 9 percent between 2010 and 2013 while rival Kraft Foods Group Inc lost almost 20 percent of its volume over the same period. Roasters operating in higher-end markets have gained momentum, with Starbucks Corp growing its volume by 18 percent since 2010. The data excludes single-serve pod sales.To be sure, Smucker is still by far the largest with almost a quarter of the total retail market, but its share has shrunk from 27 percent four years ago. Kraft's portion has fallen to 10 percent from 14 percent. Contrasting with the tough U.S. market conditions, Smucker and Maxwell House-maker Kraft both raised prices in May for flagship brands in Canada, a smaller and less competitive market. Some increases were as high as 20 percent.Other factors are at play. Some big roasters may be able to hold off increasing prices if they secured more beans than usual when prices fell in 2013. Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain Inc have said they are covered into fiscal 2015.Even so, roast and ground coffee sold in bags and canisters also face a relatively new challenge for shelf space from the popular single-serve sector which is dominated by Green Mountain through its ""K-Cups"" and its growing list of licensing deals with roasters, such as Smucker.During the last rally, Green Mountain made up a tiny portion of retail coffee sales, but last year, it knocked Smucker off the top spot in the U.S. retail market measured by value, Euromonitor data shows.

12,"  NEW YORK Aug 20 U.S. retail coffee profits for J.M. Smucker, the maker of Folgers and the biggest U.S. roaster, fell by 4 percent in its May-July quarter on a combination of pricing and promotions, the company said on Wednesday.""Lower price realization resulted in the decline in net sales for the segment and for the company,"" said Richard Smucker, chief executive of Smucker on a call with analysts to discuss first-quarter 2015 results.Price realization is the combination of list price and promotions.The Orrville, Ohio-based company, which also makes Jiff peanut butter and Smucker's jam, reported net sales of $1.32 billion, down 2 percent from $1.35 billion a year ago, primarily due to the coffee segment's performance. ""Pricing on committed promotional programs, along with continued price investment to remain competitive on shelf, temporarily delayed the impact,"" of a 9 percent price increase, said Vince Byrd, Smucker president and chief operating officer.""We expect full reflection of the price increase in the second quarter."" The weaker coffee profits come as green coffee prices remain highly volatile. An unprecedented drought in top grower Brazil caused arabica futures prices to nearly double within three months to a 26-month high in April. In June, Smucker raised its list prices for most of its U.S. packaged coffee by about 9 percent, triggering other large roasters to make similar moves. Arabica prices are now down around 15 percent from the April high while robusta coffee, a bean that some roasters add to their brewed blends as a lower costing alternative, is down 11 percent from a one-year high reached in March.Smucker's U.S. retail coffee net sales fell by 2 percent to $502.7 million in the quarter ended July 31 while its segment profit fell by 4 percent to $137.6 million. That took place as its U.S. coffee volume rose by 2 percent in the quarter, the ninth straight quarter of year-over-year volume growth, driven by the its flagship Folgers brand, as well as Cafe Bustelo and Dunkin' Donuts, company executives said.Also during the quarter, Smucker discontinued the Life Is Good coffee brand because of low brand awareness in regions other than the U.S. East and West Coasts.

13,"   By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 23 Food manufacturers such as Mondelez International and J.M. Smucker Co.  will face billions of dollars of additional costs this year due to soaring sugar prices, according to estimates from a sugar buyers group.U.S. sugar prices have surged 40 percent since the U.S. sugar industry initiated a trade case with Mexico. That will cost food manufacturers an additional $2.4 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, according to a Thursday report from the Sweetener Users Association.The U.S. Commerce Department in August made a preliminary decision to impose countervailing, or anti-subsidy, duties on sugar from Mexico in response to allegations from the U.S. sugar industry that Mexican mills were dumping cheap, subsidized sugar into the U.S. market.Domestic prices for refined sugar have jumped about 7.6 cents a lb since the cases were filed, translated to an additional $837 million in sugar costs for food manufacturers, said Tom Earley, a food policy consultant at Agralytica in Virginia and author of the report. Industry pressure and tensions have mounted ahead of the Friday deadline for the Department's initial determination on potential dumping duties, which would be added to anti-subsidy duties of up to 17.01 percent.The costs could grow from there, depending on the size of any the antidumping duties, Earley said on a conference call regarding the report. ""We have the decision coming up on dumping duties. Those would clearly push up prices,"" he said.Domestic sugar prices hit multi-year lows last year on surging output in Mexico and the United States. Mexico's sugar mills have had unfettered access to the U.S. market since the 2008 implementation of NAFTA in the sugar market. While the Sweetener Users Association does not identify its members, the trade case has meant a jump in prices and supply uncertainty for sugar buyers that include candy makers like Hershey Co. and Mars Inc.Though data is not yet publicly available, the U.S. Agriculture Department has estimated that Mexican sugar imports plunged to about 28,300 tons in September after the U.S. government began collecting the first round of duties.That was down by two-thirds from the previous month and by more than 80 percent from September 2013.

14,"   By Marcy Nicholson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK J.M. Smucker Co, the maker of Folgers coffee, said on Wednesday it made a ""misstep"" with its most recent price increase, which caused sales volumes to drop sharply as customers delayed purchases and shifted to cheaper private-label brands. ""Clearly, we do feel that it was a bit of a misstep,"" Mark Smucker, president of U.S. Retail Coffee for Smucker, told analysts on a conference call after the company released fiscal 2015 second-quarter earnings.""When you look at how our promo prices moved going into August and September, that significant jump was somewhat unique to what we've done in the past and so the consumer did sort of experience some sticker shock."" In June, Smucker raised list prices on most of its U.S. packaged coffee by roughly 9 percent, primarily on Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts brands, for the first time in three years because a drought in top grower Brazil caused green coffee costs to soar. Kraft Foods Group Inc followed with a 10 percent price hike for Maxwell House and Yuban roast and ground brands. Following price promotions already in place, this equated to a price increase of nearly 30 percent for Folgers in some markets, or an increase of $2 per cannister, a historically steep rise, said Vince Byrd, Smucker's president and chief operating officer.""We believe this resulted in consumers temporarily delaying purchases within the mainstream segment and to a significantly lesser extent substituting private label,"" he said.Byrd cited data from market research firm IRI showing volume in the overall mainstream segment fell 9 percent, with Smucker's brands down 13 percent during the latest 12-week period, whereas private-label rose 3 percent.

15,"  (Corrects job title of Mark Smucker to president of U.S. Retail Coffee from chief executive in paragraph 2)By Marcy NicholsonNEW YORK Nov 19 J.M. Smucker Co, the maker of Folgers coffee, said on Wednesday it made a ""misstep"" with its most recent price increase, which caused sales volumes to drop sharply as customers delayed purchases and shifted to cheaper private-label brands.""Clearly, we do feel that it was a bit of a misstep,"" Mark Smucker, president of U.S. Retail Coffee for Smucker, told analysts on a conference call after the company released fiscal 2015 second-quarter earnings.""When you look at how our promo prices moved going into August and September, that significant jump was somewhat unique to what we've done in the past and so the consumer did sort of experience some sticker shock."" In June, Smucker raised list prices on most of its U.S. packaged coffee by roughly 9 percent, primarily on Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts brands, for the first time in three years because a drought in top grower Brazil caused green coffee costs to soar. Kraft Foods Group Inc followed with a 10 percent price hike for Maxwell House and Yuban roast and ground brands.Following price promotions already in place, this equated to a price increase of nearly 30 percent for Folgers in some markets, or an increase of $2 per cannister, a historically steep rise, said Vince Byrd, Smucker's president and chief operating officer. ""We believe this resulted in consumers temporarily delaying purchases within the mainstream segment and to a significantly lesser extent substituting private label,"" he said.Byrd cited data from market research firm IRI showing volume in the overall mainstream segment fell 9 percent, with Smucker's brands down 13 percent during the latest 12-week period, whereas private-label rose 3 percent.

19,"   By Kevin Allison | CHICAGO  CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - J M Smucker's $5.8 billion purchase of Big Heart Pet Brands may keep investor activists in Kibbles 'n Bits. The $11 billion owner of Folgers coffee, Jif peanut butter and eponymous fruit spreads should gain bargaining power with retailers by bundling human treats with dog food. But the odd combination may elicit a Pavlovian response from uppity shareholders.The transaction is predicated on scale. Acquiring Big Heart's Milk-Bones, Meow Mix, Snausages and other products should allow Smucker to fill more space on grocery shelves and wrangle better terms from merchants. The company promises $200 million of annual cost cuts, explaining the near-5 percent bump in its share price after the deal was announced.The deal also looks good for the sellers. A private equity consortium led by KKR will pocket $1.3 billion of cash and a 14 percent stake in the combined group. The sale price, which includes debt, exceeds the $5.4 billion of enterprise value they paid to take Del Monte, Big Heart's predecessor, private in 2011. Throw in $1.7 billion from the 2013 sale of the group's fruit business, which kept the Del Monte brand, and they doubled their money.CEO Richard Smucker says snacks for furry friends are a good fit with his own company's pantry staples, because ""pets are cherished members of the family."" He may be confident Smucker can repeat the success of 2008's $3 billion acquisition of Folgers coffee from Procter & Gamble, which doubled the firm's size and propelled it to record profits. The risk is that the even larger Big Heart adds hard-to-digest complexity instead. Of course, this is just the latest change of ownership for Big Heart, which started as a business within the old RJR Nabisco conglomerate - itself the target of the KKR-led LBO and breakup immortalized in the 1989 best seller ""Barbarians at the Gate."" If this deal turns out to be a dog, Smucker may also find itself struggling to keep investor activists at bay. CONTEXT NEWS -  Coffee and jam purveyor J M Smucker on Feb. 3 agreed to buy Big Heart Pet Brands for $5.8 billion, including $2.6 billion of debt. Smucker said it expected the deal to lead to $200 million of annual cost savings over three years. - Big Heart is the renamed pet food business of the old Del Monte Foods conglomerate, which was taken over by private equity groups KKR, Vestar Capital Partners, and Centerview Capital for $5.3 billion in 2011.

26,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Anjali Athavaley  Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said on Thursday that its Dunkin' K-Cups will be available online and across retail stores in North America, a move that expands the doughnut chain's brand in the single-serve coffee market amid growing competition.Dunkin' K-Cups are available at present only in Dunkin' Donuts restaurants in the United States. Later this year, through an agreement with J M Smucker Co (SJM.N) and Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O, consumers will be able to buy the product in grocery stores, drugstores and private warehouse stores, as well as on the Dunkin', Smucker and Keurig websites. Dunkin' Brands Chief Executive Nigel Travis said that most K-cup sales are made where consumers buy their groceries. The deal removes the challenge of ""us not being in the places where all the competition is situated,"" he said in an interview. He added that it also places Dunkin' K-Cups in regions where Dunkin' Donuts lacks a significant presence, such as west of the Mississippi River. The move comes at a time when Dunkin', one of the most popular coffee brands in the grocery store, faces increased competition. Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O is launching McDonald's Corp's (MCD.N) McCafe brand ground, whole-bean and single-serve coffees at retail. That brand is performing well so far, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris Growe. Keurig will continue to be exclusive producer of Dunkin' K-Cups. Under the agreement, Smucker will market K-Cup packs to grocery chains, mass merchandisers, club stores, drugstores, dollar stores and home improvement stores. Keurig will market the Dunkin' K-Cup packs to specialty stores and office superstores.Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Dunkin' Brands also said it had reached a profit sharing agreement under which certain franchisees would receive an equal share of profit from the sale of K-Cups and packaged coffee outside its restaurants.Smucker currently makes and distributes Dunkin' Donuts brand bagged coffee. While the launch of the Dunkin' K-cups at retail is expected to help Smucker amid weak sales in its K-cup business, ""we believe the margin on these products will be dilutive to Smucker's existing K-cup and coffee margins"" due to the profit sharing agreement, Growe said. Dunkin' has not specified a retail price for the K-Cups but said they are currently sold in its shops for a suggested retail price of $8.99 a box.Shares of Dunkin' Brands were up 3.6 percent at $48.12 in afternoon.

28,"   By Natalie Harrison  NEW YORK, March 10 (IFR) - Moody's Investors Service downgraded US food manufacturer J. M. Smucker by two notches to Baa2 Tuesday on expectations the company's debt-financed acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands will increase leverage.J.M. Smucker is expected to come to the bond market soon, having mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan to arrange U.S. fixed income investor calls. It agreed to buy Big Heart Pet Brands for US$3.2bn last month. Moody's expects leverage to rise to 4x earnings when the deal closes from around 2.3x now. Smucker plans to fund the acquisition through a recently arranged US$1.75bn five-year bank term loan, while the bonds are expected to refinance a US$3.75bn bridge loan. ""Other key considerations include the recent high earnings volatility in the company's coffee business and significant integration and execution risks related to its entree into the attractive, but highly competitive, pet food industry where Big Heart competes against larger companies and stronger brands in mainstream and specialty pet foods,"" Moody's said.

32,"  (Adds comment throughout)By Marcy NicholsonNEW YORK, July 1 J.M. Smucker Co cut prices for most of its Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts coffee brands sold in the United States by 6 percent, the biggest U.S. roaster said on Wednesday, partially reversing last year's price hikes to woo back customers.The company is the first U.S. roaster to cut prices after a customer backlash following a 9 percent price hike just over a year ago when arabica prices were soaring.Smucker later described the move as a ""misstep"" after sales volumes dropped as customers switched to cheaper brands and delayed purchases.The move by the company, considered an industry trendsetter, is likely to trigger price cuts by other major roasters and follows a prolonged slump in arabica and robusta prices. For Smucker, it also coincides with other product changes aimed at luring customers back. It has cut canister sizes for 15 of its large cans of Folgers roast and ground coffee by roughly 3 ounces, and is rolling out those smaller cans this summer.Wild swings in coffee bean prices and changing consumer buying habits, which are sensitive to prices, have forced roasters to be more creative. But experts questioned whether the latest measures would help Smuckers regain much of the market share it lost over the past year.""Consumers are getting smarter about recognizing price and package size changes, particularly in coffee, where price volatility is more visible,"" Ross Colbert, global strategist for beverages with Rabobank International in New York, said in an email.Relief from the lower prices is largely offset by smaller product sizes. ""This is an attempt to create the illusion of lower prices while not doing so,"" Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors in Florida, said by email.Last year's hike came after a drought in Brazil, the world's biggest producer, caused green coffee costs to soar. Kraft Foods Group Inc followed with a 10 percent price hike for Maxwell House and Yuban roast and ground brands.Wednesday's cut is a fraction of the 25 percent drop in arabica futures prices, typically roasted for brewed coffee, over the past year, and 12 percent drop in robusta , traditionally made into instant coffee but also used as a lower-cost component in roasted blends.Coffee prices have been more volatile than usual since the 2014 drought in Brazil boosted prices on supply concerns. Prices have since fallen.

40,"   By Luc Cohen | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 26 Keurig Green Mountain Inc  plans to import coffee beans into the United States through duty-free sites, an unprecedented move in the coffee industry as the single-serve company aims to cut costs amid falling sales of its pods and brewers.The plan is the latest move by the company to overhaul its coffee-buying strategy after it moved its coffee sourcing operations to Switzerland from Vermont in part to take advantage of an obscure tax exemption that has drawn scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers.Using the strategy in fiscal year 2014 would have saved the company $1.6 million, according to Reuters calculations.In applications to create so-called foreign trade zones (FTZs) submitted to U.S. regulators and seen by Reuters, the company said it intends to use four coffee warehouses in ports in Seattle, Virginia and New Jersey for storing and distributing green coffee beans.The applications were approved by the various ports earlier this year, though they have not yet been activated by Customs and Border Protection, a process that can take several monthsThe ""red tape"" and costs associated with establishing FTZs can be substantial, meaning setting them up is generally worth it only if a company can see a return of 100 percent to 200 percent, according to a Congressional Research Service report.Keurig is the first U.S. coffee company to register a FTZ, which allows companies to import goods into a country without paying duties or passing through customs until the items leave the zone, often after being manufactured into finished goods with lower tariffs than the raw material. While coffee does not incur any tariffs or import duties, Keurig expects to benefit from another perk of FTZs: the ability to pay customs processing fees once per week, rather than on every shipment, a spokeswoman said. Keurig also expects to save on payments to customs brokers.She said the FTZs are a ""strategic investment that will lower product cost as well as generate additional savings through increased logistical efficiencies.""The move comes as the company's share price has tumbled 60 percent this year as sales have suffered. In the third quarter, sales of its pods fell 1 percent and sales of its brewers and accessories fell 26 percent year over year, prompting the company to slash its workforce by 5 percent.Without an FTZ, companies must pay a merchandise processing fee on each shipment equivalent to 0.3464 percent of the value of the goods, though the fee cannot exceed $485. With an FTZ, companies can total the value of all their shipments in a given week and pay a single fee, which is still capped at $485. The spokeswoman declined to comment on Keurig's overall savings.According to a Reuters calculation based on Keurig's fiscal year 2014 results, the company would have saved $1.6 million in merchandise processing fees on the 228 million lbs (103 million kg) of coffee it bought at an average price of $2.22 a lb.That is a fraction of Keurig's $2.9 billion cost of sales over that period. In mid-2014, coffee prices hit a two-year high due to a drought in top-producer Brazil, so savings in future years could be smaller.Futures on ICE Futures U.S. are currently hovering around $1.20 per lb.Euromonitor data show Keurig is the largest U.S. coffee roaster by sales, with more than $2 billion in coffee sales, beating out J M Smucker Co, the maker of Folgers; Starbucks Corp ; and Kraft Heinz Co, maker of Maxwell House.Craig Pool, president of Foreign Trade Zone Corporation consultancy in Mobile, Alabama, said he had completed a FTZ cost-benefit analysis for a coffee importer in the past, but the company decided not to move forward due to market conditions.""At the time, the price of the beans was so inexpensive,"" Pool said.The fact that FTZ use is not widespread for coffee importing is likely due to misconceptions about FTZs, such as the idea that they are not beneficial for duty-free imported products, said Amie Ahanchian, managing director for trade and customs services at consultant and auditor KPMG.""This will likely pave the way for importers of coffee and other duty-free products,"" Ahanchian said. ""Once it is on the radar screens of these other companies, they may examine their supply chains and consider the benefits of an FTZ.""

56,"   By Marcy Nicholson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK When J.M. Smucker Co, the biggest U.S. coffee roaster, changes prices of its popular retail brands, it usually follows big swings up or down in benchmark bean prices.The company appeared to break that tradition on Tuesday when it cut prices for its flagship Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts coffees by 6 percent.While Smucker cited sustained declines in green coffee costs as the reason for the move, it was notable that arabica and robusta prices were almost the same as in July, the last time Smucker lowered retail prices. Back then, prices had slumped 25 percent over a year.Rather than a response to raw material costs, experts said the step was more likely aimed at beating off growing competition from supermarkets, whose lower-priced private label brands have grabbed market share from established household names in recent years.The battle with private label brands like Safeway Select, The Kroger Co's Kroger and Costco's Kirkland Signature has been brewing for years. But cutting prices to win customers when benchmark coffee costs have barely changed suggests the industry is prepared to take potentially riskier steps to boost sales.""Coffee brands are seeking market share versus holding prices,"" said Ross Colbert, executive director, global strategist of Beverages for Rabobank International.""I think Smuckers is responding to increased competitive activity in coffee and looking to regain lost market share.""While Folgers' share of the U.S. coffee market is the largest by far, its portion has fallen for four straight years to 22.5 percent in 2015, Euromonitor International data show.

TOUGH YEARS      Wild swings in coffee bean prices and changing consumer habits in recent years have already forced roasters and retailers, including top names such as Starbucks Corp, to be more creative.When the prices of arabica, beans used mainly in roast and ground brews, almost doubled in 2014 as a devastating drought in top grower Brazil wiped out crops, roasters hiked prices to cover costs and protect margins. Customers switched to cheaper brands and delayed purchases.To win them back, Smucker lowered prices in July and cut its canister sizes, helping to boost sales. In January, arabica prices hit two-year lows, but have recovered to around $1.22 per lb this week, almost level with last July.Similarly, robusta, the cheaper bean traditionally processed into instant coffee but also used in roasted blends to reduce costs, now costs about $1,648 per ton, little changed from July.

59,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  J.M. Smucker Co's (SJM.N) quarterly net sales jumped 25 percent, beating analysts' estimates, as demand rose for its Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN.O) branded coffee and its pet foods.  The company's shares surged as much as 7.2 percent to a record high of $142.27 in late morning trading on Thursday.Smucker's coffee sales in the United States, its biggest market, rose 9 percent in the fourth quarter. Profit in the business surged 39 percent, mainly due to lower green coffee costs and sales of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods.The company said it was facing increasing competition in the K-cups market and was offering promotions to stimulate demand. Smucker will introduce new packaging for its Folgers K-cups, Chief Executive Mark Smucker said on a conference call.""It (K-cups) has become maybe the most promoted category in total coffee..."" said Steve Oakland, the president of Smucker's U.S. food and beverage business, adding that the company was selling K-cups at a dollar less per box. Smucker introduced Dunkin' Donuts K-cup pods in May last year to increase its K-cup offerings, which then yielded higher margins than ground coffee.Smucker, however, said that more promotions on K-cups had brought down margins on these products to below those on ground coffee.  The company said last month that it would cut prices for its packaged coffee by 6 percent, excluding K-cups. Smucker had effected a similar cut in July last year.The maker of Jif peanut butter also plans to shut a coffee plant in Harahan, Louisiana and two leased natural foods plants in California in the next 18 months to cut costs.  Smucker reported net income of $191 million, or $1.61 per share, for the quarter ended April 30, compared with a year-earlier loss.Excluding a tax benefit, Smucker earned $1.44 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales rose to $1.81 billion, topping the average estimate of $1.75 billion. Smucker said its U.S. pet foods business, which includes Meow Mix and Milk-Bone pet foods maker Big Heart Pet Brands, accounted for nearly a third of total sales. Smucker, which acquired Big Heart last year, said it expected its full-year net sales to fall 1 percent due to the sale of its U.S. canned milk business. This implies net sales of $7.73 billion for the year ending April, slightly below the average analyst estimate of $7.74 billion.(This version of the story corrects paragraph 6 to ""at a dollar less per box"" from ""at less than a dollar per box"".)

President and Chief Executive Mark Smucker said the company had major plans for its K-cups, pods that contain roast and ground coffee for a single cup prepared in a specific brewer.""This year, we will invest further in the product line to improve trends, including lower pricing and new packaging that will leverage the iconic Folgers red can brand equity,"" he said.

61,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  J.M. Smucker Co's (SJM.N) quarterly net sales jumped 25 percent, beating analysts' estimates, as demand rose for its Folgers and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN.O) branded coffee and its pet foods.  The company's shares surged as much as 7.2 percent to a record high of $142.27 in late morning trading on Thursday.Smucker's coffee sales in the United States, its biggest market, rose 9 percent in the fourth quarter. Profit in the business surged 39 percent, mainly due to lower green coffee costs and sales of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cup pods.The company said it was facing increasing competition in the K-cups market and was offering promotions to stimulate demand. Smucker will introduce new packaging for its Folgers K-cups, Chief Executive Mark Smucker said on a conference call.""It (K-cups) has become maybe the most promoted category in total coffee..."" said Steve Oakland, the president of Smucker's U.S. food and beverage business, adding that the company was selling K-cups at a dollar less per box. Smucker introduced Dunkin' Donuts K-cup pods in May last year to increase its K-cup offerings, which then yielded higher margins than ground coffee.Smucker, however, said that more promotions on K-cups had brought down margins on these products to below those on ground coffee.  The company said last month that it would cut prices for its packaged coffee by 6 percent, excluding K-cups. Smucker had effected a similar cut in July last year.The maker of Jif peanut butter also plans to shut a coffee plant in Harahan, Louisiana and two leased natural foods plants in California in the next 18 months to cut costs.  Smucker reported net income of $191 million, or $1.61 per share, for the quarter ended April 30, compared with a year-earlier loss.Excluding a tax benefit, Smucker earned $1.44 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales rose to $1.81 billion, topping the average estimate of $1.75 billion. Smucker said its U.S. pet foods business, which includes Meow Mix and Milk-Bone pet foods maker Big Heart Pet Brands, accounted for nearly a third of total sales. Smucker, which acquired Big Heart last year, said it expected its full-year net sales to fall 1 percent due to the sale of its U.S. canned milk business. This implies net sales of $7.73 billion for the year ending April, slightly below the average analyst estimate of $7.74 billion.(This version of the story corrects paragraph 6 to ""at a dollar less per box"" from ""at less than a dollar per box"".)

67,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Folgers coffee-maker J.M. Smucker Co (SJM.N) reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue as it struggled to sell its pet foods such as Kibbles 'n Bits and Meow Mix in an intensely competitive market.Shares of the company, which makes Folgers coffee and Jif peanut butter, fell as much as 9 percent on Tuesday.Smucker bet on the fast-growing pet-food market last year with the $3.2 billion acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands, the third-largest U.S. pet-food maker by sales. The business now accounts for nearly a third of the company's sales.However, the company is facing stiff competition from Mars Petcare and Nestle's (NESN.S) Purina, the two dominant players that are vying for a bigger share of the $29 billion U.S. pet-food pie by using promotions and discounts. Smucker's limited presence in the premium pet-food category has also weighed on its sales as more pet owners spend extra dollars to feed their cats and dogs high quality food that contain organic ingredients or higher protein. Sales of Smucker's pet food fell 6 percent in the quarter ended July 31.      The company is considering options such as acquisitions, licensing or launching one of its existing brands in the mass-premium segment, Barry Dunaway, head of Smucker's pet-food business, said on a conference call.Smucker also said it was giving out bonus bags of Kibbles to arrest sales declines in the brand and plans to introduce new packaging and marketing for it later this year. The company's net income rose to $170 million, or $1.46 per share, in the first quarter, from $136.4 million, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.     Excluding items, the company earned $1.86 per share.    Net sales fell 7 percent to $1.82 billion, down for the first time in six quarters. Analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of $1.74 per share on revenue of $1.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Smucker said it now expected full-year net sales, excluding the impact of the sale of its U.S. canned-milk business, to be flat or fall 1 percent, saying it expects pet-food sales to remain weak. The company had previously forecast sales to rise 1 percent.Smucker's shares were down 8.2 percent at $143.36 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
