4,"   By Robert Cole | LONDON  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - London-listed Rexam  is going out on a limb over sale talks with U.S. rival Ball . Beyond disclosing discussions that may or may not go anywhere, the UK company revealed the deal price under consideration, some 4.3 billion pounds ($6.6 billion). The decision looks brave - or designed to force Ball's hand.Rexam could have simply acknowledged that discussions were taking place, as Ball did. Instead it mentioned a price of 610 pence per share and possible consideration that is two-thirds cash and one-third new Ball stock.As a result, investors seem to think a deal is more likely to be done than not. Rexam's shares rocketed about 90 pence or 20 percent on Thursday, more than halfway to the mooted offer price from their 447.60 pence closing level on Wednesday.Alongside the uncertainty of whether the two companies can agree a deal, there are huge potential antitrust issues. Rexam and Ball are two of the three largest drinks can makers in the world, each with around 20 percent market share according to Reuters. Jefferies analysts reckon that in some markets - including North America, Europe (excluding Russia), and Brazil, the two companies share as much as two-thirds of the business.The fact that Ball is even considering paying a premium approaching 40 percent above Rexam's undisturbed trading price suggests chunky synergies would be in the offing. But huge cost cuts imply heavily overlapping activities. That could be a red flag for competition authorities. The protagonists may think they can find ingenious ways to jump antitrust hurdles while preserving the commercial and operational logic of merging. But watchdogs in different jurisdictions tend to interpret similar data in different ways. Even in a single market, the United States, AT&T a few years back underestimated trustbusters' determination to prevent it taking over T-Mobile US, a rival top-four cellphone carrier.AT&T had to pay the Deutsche Telekom subsidiary a huge break fee. Securing one of those from Ball if a deal founders on antitrust concerns could be one goal of Rexam's bold announcement. Having had their hopes built up, investors in the UK group may extract a penalty of a different sort if the full-on tactics turn sour.  CONTEXT NEWS - U.S. packaging company Ball said on Feb. 5 that it is in talks with UK-based Rexam about a possible takeover.- Rexam said it was ""in discussions with (Ball) which may or may not lead to a formal offer being made."" It said that the proposal ""values Rexam at 610 pence per each Rexam share based on a consideration of approximately two-thirds in cash and one-third in new Ball shares."" That would value Rexam at 4.3 billion pounds ($6.6 billion).- Rexam shares rose 90.4 pence, or 20.2 percent, to 538 pence on Feb. 5. Stock in Colorado based Ball climbed about 9 percent to around $72 a share in afternoon trade in New York.(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

18,"   By Foo Yun Chee  European Union market competition regulators are set to decide by July 20 whether to approve the 4.4 billion-pound ($6.9 billion) merger deal between Ball Corp  and Rexam Plc, the world's two largest makers of drinks cans.The companies sought approval for the deal on Tuesday, according to a filing on the European Commission website.

The European Commission can clear the merger unconditionally in the preliminary review or extend the deadline to consider concessions offered to allay competition concerns. It can also open a full-scale investigation to examine deeper worries. Rexam Chief Executive Graham Chipchase has said that the Rexam board would not have accepted the offer from Ball unless it could see a clear route to get it approved. The company said on Feb. 19 it expected the deal to close in the first half of 2016. However, analysts have said the size of the combined company could force regulators to demand concessions such as asset sales in return for letting the deal through.Rexam makes cans for soft drinks company Coca-Cola Co  and beer producer Anheuser-Busch InBev.

The European Commission, however, fears the deal would push up prices for companies and consumers.The combined company would have 60 percent of the beverage can market in North America, 69 percent in Europe and 74 percent in Brazil, according to Morningstar analysts.Ball is prepared to divest four factories in Germany, three in the UK, one each in Spain, France, the Netherlands and Austria, the sources said on Wednesday. Nine of the plants make cans and two of them can ends. The offer was submitted to the Commission last week. Ball has said it is willing to sell more than $1.58 billion worth of assets to allay regulatory concerns. The company is also in discussions with antitrust authorities in the United States about assets it may have to divest in that country.Ball and Rexam have hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc to find buyers for the assets that they will sell, according to the sources. Goldman has already contacted other companies and private equity firms to solicit interest, even as the final package of assets earmarked for sale has not been finalized, the sources added.In total, the assets for sale could have as much $200 million in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to one of the sources. Ball has said it is willing to sell more than $1.58 billion worth of assets to allay regulatory concerns. Ball, Rexam and Goldman Sachs offered no immediate comment.Rexam's customers include Coca-Cola Co and Anheuser-Busch InBev.

46,"   By Arno Schuetze  Drinks can makers Ball Corp and Rexam Plc have begun the process of selling assets, potentially worth more than $3 billion, to meet antitrust regulations ahead of their planned merger, several people familiar with the matter said.Both companies are expected to meet with representatives of buyout groups Blackstone, Apollo, CVC, Onex and Madison Dearborn, as well as with peers Silgan and Ardagh, before final bids are due in mid-March, the sources said.U.S.-based Ball's planned 4.4-billion-pound ($6.4 bln) takeover of Britain's Rexam will merge the world's two largest beverage can makers by volume - which supply Coca-Cola Co  and Anheuser-Busch InBev - and should improve efficiency and cut costs. However, the deal triggered concerns in the European Commission that it would drive up prices for companies and consumers.Ball said last week that it expects to close the merger in the first half of 2016, after receiving conditional regulatory clearance in Europe. The two companies have offered to sell 12 plants across Europe, 10 of which make cans and two produce can ends. Four of the factories are in Germany and three in Britain. Separately, Ball is selling about eight sites in the United States and several in Brazil, also due to antitrust concerns.Ball and Rexam as well as the potential bidders either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. The assets on the block are expected to post $420 million in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this year and may be valued at up to eight to nine times that in any potential deals, the sources said.Peers trade at an average multiple of nine times their expected core earnings. While strategic players are often able to outbid private equity groups in auction processes due to their ability to reap synergies from a merger, the buyout groups may have an edge in this sale: speed.""The seller needs to have security that the deal goes through smoothly to make the bigger merger work. And companies like Silgan may have antitrust issues of their own, which could delay any deal,"" one of the sources aid.The source added that in Ardagh's case, debt levels may be an issue. The Ireland-based group last year pulled a planned initial public offering of its cans business, which would have reduced its 4.8 billion euros of net debt, and it may now shy away from taking on too much additional leverage to finance another acquisition.

Ball said last week that it expects to close the merger in the first half of 2016, after receiving conditional regulatory clearance in Europe.The two companies have offered to sell 12 plants across Europe, 10 of which make cans and two produce can ends. Four of the factories are in Germany and three in Britain. Separately, Ball is selling about eight sites in the United States and several in Brazil, also due to antitrust concerns.  Ball and Rexam as well as the potential bidders either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.The assets on the block are expected to post $420 million in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization this year and may be valued at up to eight to nine times that in any potential deals, the sources said.Peers trade at an average multiple of nine times their expected core earnings. While strategic players are often able to outbid private equity groups in auction processes due to their ability to reap synergies from a merger, the buyout groups may have an edge in this sale: speed. ""The seller needs to have security that the deal goes through smoothly to make the bigger merger work. And companies like Silgan may have antitrust issues of their own, which could delay any deal,"" one of the sources aid. The source added that in Ardagh's case, debt levels may be an issue. The Ireland-based group last year pulled a planned initial public offering of its cans business, which would have reduced its 4.8 billion euros of net debt, and it may now shy away from taking on too much additional leverage to finance another acquisition.
