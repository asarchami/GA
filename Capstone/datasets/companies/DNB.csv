0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 12 (Fitch) Dun & Bradstreet's (DNB) 'BBB' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) is not affected by the company's acquisition of NetProspex for $125  million net of cash assumed. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release.  Fitch believes that the transaction is in line with the company's strategy to  target acquisitions that improve DNB's operational capabilities and accelerate  revenue growth.  Fitch believes that management is focused on returning DNB to  low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in the next few years, supported by $70  million to $80 million in operational investments in 2014. This investment in  product and services (mostly personnel) will predominately be a recurring  addition to operating expenses. The company has initiated cost reduction actions  designed to offset about half of these investments. This investment initiative  is reflected in Fitch's revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow (FCF) expectations.   The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's belief that the company can successfully  execute its investment strategy and improve operating performance over the next  two to three years.  D&B's LTM September 2014 FCF generation ($189 million after  dividends), strong EBITDA margins (above 30%) and solid coverage metrics  (interest coverage of approximately 12.3x) provide flexibility in the ratings to  endure elevated leverage in the near term. However, there is limited room in the  ratings for the company to fall short of Fitch's expectations.  The acquisition will moderately increase leverage but DNB's credit profile  remains within Fitch's expectation and base case scenario for the current 'BBB'  IDR.  Fitch anticipates DNB's leverage will increase to approximately 3.2x as of  year-end 2014 and that credit protection metrics will remain elevated, relative  to Fitch's target leverage of 3x, due to the incremental business investments  intended to accelerate top-line growth and the company's share repurchase  program.  While expected leverage of 3.2x exceeds Fitch's 3x target for the current  rating, Fitch expects that improved operating performance along with modest debt  reduction will enable D&B to reduce leverage to below 3x by year-end 2015. D&B  has not committed to a leverage target; however, management has stated that it  is committed to an investment grade rating. Fitch expects the company to deploy  cash towards reinvestment, acquisitions, shareholder-friendly actions and  reducing its revolver borrowings ($1 billion share repurchase program was  completed as of August 2014).  Total debt balances as of Sept. 30, 2014 are at  $1.6 billion and Fitch calculates unadjusted gross leverage at approximately  3.1x through the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2014.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A publicly stated financial policy, which may include a commitment to maintain  leverage at or below 2.5x, and traction with the company's turnaround in its  Risk Management Solutions (RMS) business (evidenced by improved revenue and  EBITDA margin performance), could lead to positive rating momentum.  The ratings may be downgraded if the company is unable to demonstrate traction  with its revenue turnaround and/or indications that leverage would be expected  to remain above 3x beyond 2015. Also, a change in financial policy indicating  more aggressive shareholder returns that drove leverage beyond 3x would pressure  the ratings.  Fitch has the following ratings for DNB actions: --IDR at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Bank credit facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'. --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
