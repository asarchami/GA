7,"  SAN FRANCISCO PayPal Holdings Inc said on Tuesday it would expand its One Touch payments product to 13 new markets in Europe and Australia, bringing a simpler check-out to online shoppers and merchants. PayPal, which separated from eBay Inc last month, is a formidable player in the fast-growing payments industry, which has attracted new entrants like Apple Inc. The company said ""millions"" of consumers had already enabled One Touch to make payments on desktops and through mobile apps in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada and that half of the world's top 100 online retailers were already using the program. Existing PayPal users can opt-in to use One Touch once and then no longer be required to re-enter their billing and shipping information into shopping apps or websites that support PayPal in their checkouts. Merchants that already accept PayPal will see One Touch automatically enabled, PayPal said.A smoother shopping experience is crucial to online retailers as they often blame the high rates of unfinished or abandoned online sales on the tiring process of re-entering payment information. PayPal said more than half of e-commerce shopping sessions are taking place on mobile but said that only around 10 to 15 percent of purchases occur on mobile devices. ""If consumers can't check out in one touch or tap and instead have to do data entry on their mobile device they're far less likely to complete the transaction,"" Bill Ready, PayPal's senior vice president, said in an emailed response to Reuters. ""With One Touch, we're bridging that gap and creating better buying experiences for consumers, which in turn means higher conversions for merchants.""PayPal said the One Touch program had led to 50 percent or greater improvement in conversion rates and said it planned to eventually launch One Touch to all markets in which PayPal exists. The company, which has more than 169 million customer accounts worldwide, processed 4 billion payments last year totaling $235 billion.

13,"   By Arathy S Nair  Payment processor PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O), spun off from eBay Inc (EBAY.O) reported quarterly revenue slightly below analysts' expectations as a strong dollar hurt its transaction volumes in China and Europe.Shares of PayPal, which listed for the second time on the Nasdaq in July, fell 5.6 percent in extended trading on Wednesday.PayPal's third-quarter revenue rose about 14 percent to $2.26 billion, nearly half of which came from markets outside the United States. Excluding the impact of a strong dollar, revenue rose 19 percent, but missed the average analyst estimate of $2.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""I think that the foreign exchange impact has been larger than expected,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst James Friedman said.PayPal said it expected the dollar to have a bigger impact on its 2015 revenue than previously anticipated. The company forecast a growth of 15-18 percent in full-year revenue, excluding the impact of a strong dollar. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria also attributed the fall in PayPal's shares to likely high investor expectations after strong results from eBay.PayPal said growth in its international total payment volumes was hurt somewhat because of weakness in China and Europe. ""When Americans buy in China or Europeans buy in the United States, PayPal makes the highest rates. So when the dollar is strong, that weakens demand from Europe and supply from China,"" Luria said. PayPal has also been facing fierce competition from payment processing startups such as Stripe Inc and Square Inc as well as Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Apple Pay in a market it helped create.Square, headed by Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, filed for an initial public offering this month. PayPal's transaction margin fell to 62.3 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from 63.1 percent, a year earlier.  Active accounts increased 10 percent to 173 million, while total payment volume rose 20 percent to $69.74 billion. The company's mobile transactions rose 38 percent to 345 million.PayPal's net income increased 28.6 percent to $301 million, or 25 cents per share.Excluding items, the company earned 31 cents per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of 29 cents.

15,"   By Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 16 Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn swapped his entire equity stake in eBay Inc  for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings Inc in the third quarter, regulatory filings showed on Monday.The filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Icahn sold his stake of 46.3 million shares in eBay and reported the same number of shares in PayPal, which completed its spinoff from eBay in mid-July.Icahn, whose PayPal stake as of Sept. 30 amounted to 3.8 percent of the company, had pushed for eBay to spin off PayPal last year and has board representation at PayPal through Icahn Capital managing director Jonathan Christodoro. Icahn eventually backed off from his push for the spinoff in April of last year. But eBay directors and executives shifted their stance on the split in June of last year after a six-month internal study of the payments landscape. Icahn, who is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management change, also showed that he took a 1.36 million share stake in American International Group Inc  during the third quarter, ahead of publicly pressuring the insurer to split into three companies.In a letter to AIG CEO Peter Hancock in late October, Icahn blasted AIG as ""too big to succeed,"" a riff on the popular ""too big to fail"" phrase that emerged from the financial crisis. The size of Icahn's AIG position had not been previously disclosed, and Icahn may have increased the stake by the time he tweeted that he owned a ""large"" position in the company on Oct. 28.Icahn was not immediately available for comment.

The filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Icahn sold his stake of 46.3 million shares in eBay and reported the same number of shares in PayPal (PYPL.O), which completed its spinoff from eBay in mid-July.Icahn, whose PayPal stake as of Sept. 30 amounted to 3.8 percent of the company, had pushed for eBay to spin off PayPal last year and has board representation at PayPal through Icahn Capital managing director Jonathan Christodoro.  Icahn eventually backed off from his push for the spinoff in April of last year. But eBay directors and executives shifted their stance on the split in June of last year after a six-month internal study of the payments landscape. Icahn, who is known for taking large stakes in companies and pushing for management change, also showed that he took a 1.36 million share stake in American International Group Inc (AIG.N) during the third quarter, ahead of publicly pressuring the insurer to split into three companies.  In a letter to AIG CEO Peter Hancock in late October, Icahn blasted AIG as ""too big to succeed,"" a riff on the popular ""too big to fail"" phrase that emerged from the financial crisis.The size of Icahn's AIG position had not been previously disclosed, and Icahn may have increased the stake by the time he tweeted that he owned a ""large"" position in the company on Oct. 28.   Icahn was not immediately available for comment.

""These programs include taking time to celebrate a birth or adoption, to care for a seriously ill family member or simply to take a couple of days rest when needed,"" she said in a blog post.

36,"   By Swati Pandey and Nathan Lynch | SYDNEY  SYDNEY Digital money transfer companies including PayPal Holdings are rushing to grab a share of Australia's $35 billion remittance market, hoping to plug a vacuum left by the major domestic banks' exit from the space last year.  U.S.-listed PayPal intends to roll out its online remitting platform Xoom into Australia soon, senior executives told Reuters, while U.K.-based WorldRemit in April said it had chosen Australia as its Asia-Pacific base. Australia is a fast-growing market for foreign money transfer operators thanks to a large migrant population with financial links to China, India, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans and the Pacific Islands. One in four Australians has migrated from overseas, government data shows. ""This industry is belatedly moving online. Regulation and technology are driving this change,"" said Ismail Ahmed, founder of WorldRemit, which is also expanding in New Zealand.The entry of global digital payments players comes amid growing concern in Australia that the industry was drifting underground, after the major banks closed the accounts of money transfer businesses due to compliance risks.Accounting for about 80 percent of Australia's banking activity, the country's four major lenders felt particularly exposed to what regulators have identified as a high-risk sector for criminal activity like money laundering and terrorist financing, including transfers to militant groups like Islamic State.But the international scale and reputation of major digital players means they are better placed to manage the regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny than smaller agents who previously dominated the sector, industry players say. LOOKING FOR GROWTH     Ahmed said he was scouting for acquisitions of niche players to further expand in Australia, already WorldRemit's second-biggest market for outbound remittances. New Zealand, with a similar migrant population to Australia's, is World Remit’s fastest-growing country for outbound transfers.PayPal began making significant inroads into Australia after receiving a licence to hold funds on behalf of customers, although it cannot perform traditional banking services. It can also send money to under-developed countries with poor banking and mobile penetration.""In some markets home delivery is important and in those markets we do offer home delivery, where a courier will show up, ring your doorbell and give you an envelope with cash,"" said John Kunze, vice president of PayPal-owned Xoom. While customers can use their bank accounts to transfer money overseas, it can be expensive and time-consuming. Australian banks charge up to A$30 ($22.94) per transfer, compared with A$5-A$8 charged by remitters. The banks' mobile applications are clunky compared with the simple interfaces offered by remittance newcomers like InstaRem or WorldRemit.Xoom's Kunze said that while scale was a big advantage for PayPal, it came with a ""mandate to run compliance, consumer protection and a safe business"". ""So we have to keep moving the ball forward on this as we grow,"" he said.  Global digital players are well aware that any breach of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing rules could undermine their significant investment in the sector. ""Online money transfer businesses have the benefit of being able to track where money has come from and where it is going to,"" Australian Bankers' Association Chief Executive Steven Munchenberg said. ""It is still important, however, that they operate within an appropriate regulatory framework.” ($1 = 1.3079 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Swati Pandey in SYDNEY and Nathan Lynch of Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence; Additional reporting by Charlotte Greenfield in WELLINGTON; Editing by Stephen Coates)",2016-05-02,PYPL,"Mon May 2, 2016 | 7:27pm EDT","As Australian banks snub remitters, digital players emerge",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-australia-remittances-fintech-idUSKCN0XT22W?type=companyNews

Sanchez quickly got over his initial unease of sending money through an unfamiliar company.""If it goes badly, I'll cancel it and try another,"" said Sanchez, a 44-year-old Mexican technical support professional in Oakland.Founded in 2011 and backed by Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos's venture capital arm, Remitly is among a vanguard of financial technology, or fintech, companies targeting what they view as an underserved immigrant market - traditionally disregarded as high-risk and low-margin.The upstart firms - along with expanding digital and mobile options from Western Union Co and MoneyGram International Inc - are helping immigrants deepen their roots in the United States at a time when incendiary anti-immigration rhetoric dominates national politics.Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump recently attacked remittances from illegal immigrants as a form of ""welfare"" for Mexicans. Trump threatened to impound such money transfers unless Mexico agreed to pay up to $10 billion for his proposed wall on the southern U.S. border.Many emerging companies in the fast-growing fintech sector, by contrast, view financial services for immigrants as an untapped source of revenue. They include remittance apps, such as Remitly, TransferWise and Xoom - an early player bought last year by PayPal Holdings Inc for $890 million - along with companies such as Lendup and Oportun, which lend to high-risk borrowers.""We're part of a community of companies that is helping (immigrant) customers understand the landscape of financial services"" in the U.S., said Raul Vazquez, chief executive of Oportun.GLOBAL CASH FLOW It remains unclear whether Trump's campaign attacks represent a real threat to the remittance industry.

The plan has been criticized in part because of the difficulty in differentiating between the transfers of legal and illegal immigrants.""Good luck with that,"" U.S. President Barack Obama quipped, reacting to Trump's proposal at a recent news conference.Trump's campaign did not respond to request for comment from Reuters.Many financial technology companies expect a continuing boom in cross-border transfers and other financial services for U.S. immigrants. According to the World Bank, remittances to Mexico totaled nearly $25 billion in 2015, their highest level since 2008. Globally, nearly $600 billion is transferred each year.The World Bank reported that 700 million people opened bank accounts globally between 2011 and 2014 - making them more likely to use financial technology - and about 2 billion more people remained unbanked, representing huge growth potential. Immigrant communities increasingly access financial services through phones. Thirteen percent of Latinos in the U.S. are dependent on smartphones as their only source of internet access, compared to just 4 percent of white people, according to a 2015 Pew study.Those trends play into the strategy of remittance apps like Remitly and Xoom. Many other financial tech firms are private and not required to share financial results, but some claim fast growth in customers or revenue when releasing selective data.Remitly said it transferred five times the amount of money in the first quarter of 2016 as it did in the same period a year earlier. The company said it recently surpassed $1 billion in annual transfers.Western Union, a $9.36-billion public company, acknowledged new threats in its 2015 annual report.""We are seeing increased competition from, and increased market acceptance of, electronic, mobile, and Internet-based money transfer services,"" the company told investors.In a statement to Reuters, the company said the transfer industry is teeming with new players and that competition had contributed to falling prices. Western Union's digital money transfer sales reached about $300 million in 2015, and the company expects online and mobile transfers to be a ""major driver of overall remittance market growth,"" it said. Arjan Schutte, the CEO of fintech investor Core Innovation Capital, said he'd seen more than 100 different business plans for companies wanting to disrupt Western Union or Moneygram, but that's ""not nearly enough relative to the market opportunity.""ECONOMIES OF SCALE Smaller financial technology companies can be flexible in crafting creative solutions to serve customers on the margins, said Lisa McFarland, an executive vice president at Ingo Money, which charges between 1 and 4 percent to deposit paychecks through a mobile app.McFarland previously worked at Visa Inc setting up prepaid products for the immigrant market.

56,"   By John Ruwitch and Clara Ferreira-Marques | SHANGHAI/HONG KONG  SHANGHAI/HONG KONG Investors gearing up for the initial public offering of Ant Financial, the $60 billion online finance arm spun off by e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA.N), will have to wait until at least late 2017 as the business puts growth first, sources say.Sources with knowledge of the plans said Ant Financial, whose anchor business is Alipay, China's largest online payments service, is focusing on expanding its existing 450 million-strong army of daily users, adding merchants and customers.One of the sources said that, as of last month, Ant had yet to contact Chinese regulators to start the lengthy listing process and join a queue of more than 700 companies waiting to list.An Ant spokeswoman said the group had not set a timetable or location for its listing, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not comment.In addition to online payments, Ant Financial also offers services from wealth management to credit scoring, micro lending and insurance.Alibaba Group set up Alipay in 2004 in the PayPal (PYPL.O) mould, to help Chinese buyers shop online, and later spun it off ahead of its own listing in 2014.At its last fundraising round in April, Ant's valuation topped $60 billion - just short of the market value of Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N). Its listing has been among the most keenly awaited of recent years.It reshuffled top management at the weekend, which Alibaba founder and Chairman Jack Ma said on Tuesday in Bangkok signaled a listing was in prospect at some point.""We will be looking at an IPO in the next few years; we are not yet sure where we will list or when exactly,"" Ma said.The sources, however, said Ant intends to list both in mainland China and Hong Kong.The two applications could be simultaneous, though a shorter waiting time could also mean that Hong Kong-listed H shares could come to market first, the sources said. ""Unicorn"" start-ups - those worth more than $1 billion - are often short on cash, but not Ant Financial. It raised $4.5 billion in a record funding round in April, backed by China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp and a subsidiary of China Construction Bank (0939.HK).It also turns a significant profit.New York-listed Alibaba does not have a direct stake in Ant, due to Beijing's restrictions on foreign companies owning Chinese financial institutions, but it has a 37.5 percent profit-sharing agreement. According to Alibaba filings, Ant paid it $56 million in royalty and software technology service fees in the June quarter.GROWING UP For growth, Ant is concentrating on expanding a user base that already outnumbers the population of Western Europe, growing in China and abroad, where it has focused on partnerships and also wants to capture spending by Chinese tourists when they travel. In 2015, Chinese tourists spent $215 billion overseas, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.Earlier this year, Ant hired Goldman Sachs executive Douglas Feagin to lead the push abroad.None of the sources elaborated on how long the growth plan to boost customer and merchant numbers could take, the possible impact on profits, or whether there were specific targets to hit before the group considers itself ready to list.""This is for long-term growth but will impact short-term financial results,"" one of the sources said of the growth push.The sources said Ant's management wants to ensure an IPO is followed by growth for its shareholders - new and old.Current shareholders include large state-owned institutions: China Life Insurance (601628.SS) (2628.HK), China Post Group -  parent of Postal Savings Bank of China - and a unit of China Development Bank. ""There is no firm plan for next year ... But the company has lots of cash, and (raising funds) won't be the only factor driving the IPO,"" said one of the sources.Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of the group's growth, particularly for its Yu'e Bao money market fund, which will have to maintain attractive rates even as the economy slows.In new markets like India, Ant's partner, payment group PayTM, is also grappling with fickle consumers, while making inroads in a giant and largely untapped market. A key complication for Ant's listing is former parent, Alibaba.Alibaba's current profit-sharing agreement stipulates it could take up to 33 percent of equity in a listing - but that could hit regulatory hurdles designed to keep financial institutions domestically owned.Alibaba, registered in the Cayman Islands and listed in New York, is considered foreign.The sources said discussions to address that issue had begun with regulators.But for now, it's growing so fast that its headquarters in Hangzhou, southwest of Shanghai, is bursting at the seams, with rows of employees tightly packed under banners with kung fu sayings beloved of founder Ma.A new headquarters is due in early 2017.
