0,"  WARSAW Jan 20 Polish utility PGE has agreed financing guarantees of up to 3.1 billion zlotys ($1 billion) with bank PKO BP for investments such as its Opole project, the company said on Monday.PGE, which is Poland's biggest power producer, said in December that it would start work on the 11.6 billion zloty project to build a coal-fired power plant at Opole in February.The project, which is Poland's biggest investment in the coal-based power sector, was the focus of a row between PGE's former chief executive Krzysztof Kilian and Poland's government. Kilian, who resigned last year, opposed the plan to build two 900 megawatt units at Opole, arguing that it was unprofitable because of low power prices. But Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk insisted on the project going ahead to improve the country's energy security.

10,"  (Adds PG&E comment, background)By Barani KrishnanAug 25 A federal nuclear inspector urged U.S. regulators to shut down a California nuclear power plant until tests showed its reactors could withstand shocks from nearby earthquake faults, according to the Associated Press and an environmental group.Michael Peck's call to close the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in San Luis Obispo County was in a report he made to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2013, the AP reported on Monday, a day after a strong earthquake shook California's Napa Valley region.Peck was the lead on-site inspector for five years at Diablo Canyon, which has two reactors designed to produce about 18,000 gigawatts an hour (GWh) of electricity annually, or 7 percent of California's electricity use. It is owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co (PG&E).Peck's report concludes that the nearby Shoreline, Los Osos, and San Luis Bay fault systems are capable of producing ground motions that exceed the plant's safe shutdown precautions, according to the AP, which said it had verified the authenticity of the report.According to Peck's analysis, no one knows whether the facility's key equipment can withstand strong shaking from those faults - the potential for which was realized decades after the facility was built, the AP said, citing the report. Continuing to run the reactors, Peck writes, ""challenges the presumption of nuclear safety,"" the AP reported.Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that wants Diablo Canyon closed, posted what it said was Peck's report on its website on Monday. It did not say how it had obtained it.""The NRC knows that Diablo Canyon's two reactors are the most vulnerable to earthquakes in the United States, but the agency has failed to heed Dr. Peck's repeated warnings,"" Friends of the Earth said. ""Dr. Peck's dissent argues that Diablo Canyon is operating outside the conditions of its license and should be shut down until PG&E can prove that the reactors can withstand potential earthquakes on these faults,"" the group said.Environmental groups in the state claimed victory last year when Edison International announced it would permanently shut its San Onofre nuclear power plant after a radiation leak was discovered in 2012.PG&E spokesman Blair Jones said the Diablo Canyon plant, which has been operating since 1985, was built to withstand the largest potential earthquakes in the region. ""The NRC has exhaustively analyzed this issue, concluding that PG&E's ongoing analysis of nearby faults and our engineering assessments of the facility demonstrate that Diablo Canyon is seismically safe,"" he said.The NRC previously said that Diablo Canyon complies with the agency's operating license, including earthquake safety standards.Peck could not immediately be reached for comment.NRC spokeswoman Lara Uselding could not be reached for comment.Concerns about Diablo Canyon's safety came into focus after a powerful earthquake and tsunami severely damaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011. Diablo Canyon is also located on the California coast where it uses ocean water for cooling.Sunday's earthquake in Northern California injured more than 100 people, damaged historic buildings, set some homes on fire and caused power and water outages Napa Valley, a picturesque region north of San Francisco that is known worldwide for its wines.

13,"  * San Bruno explosion and fire killed 8, injured dozens* Utility still faces trial on federal criminal charges* Company cites numerous safety improvements since blast   (Adds PG&E still faces trial on criminal charges, more than $1 billion in penalties if convicted; adds civil settlements; utility's new safety measures)By Ann SaphirSAN FRANCISCO, April 9 Pacific Gas & Electric Corp must pay a record $1.6 billion in penalties stemming from a natural gas pipeline explosion in 2010 that killed eight people near San Francisco, California's chief utility regulator ordered on Thursday.The penalty levied for the deadly rupture in San Bruno, California, marks the largest ever imposed by the five-member state Public Utilities Commission, dwarfing a $38 million fine against PG&E for a 2008 natural gas explosion near Sacramento, according to the agency.Commission President Michael Picker said the order also ranks as one of the biggest utility sanctions in U.S. history. PG&E Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tony Earley said his company did not expect to appeal.The latest penalties cover nearly 3,800 violations of state and federal laws and regulations cited by two commission administrative law judges regarding PG&E's pipeline network, including the 2010 explosion.The company still faces a trial next year on criminal charges arising from a federal probe of the San Bruno disaster.The penalties include $850 million to pay for improved pipeline infrastructure, a $300 million fine, a $400 million billing credit to PG&E gas customers and $50 million in other remedies to enhance pipeline safety. When added to pipeline improvements previously ordered, total state penalties and remedies will exceed $2.2 billion, the commission said.All penalties must be borne entirely by PG&E shareholders and not passed on to its customers.The explosion on Sept. 9, 2010, in San Bruno, a city just south of San Francisco, leveled an entire neighborhood, killing eight people and injuring 58 others. It renewed concerns about the number of aging gas transmission lines running beneath densely populated areas. The National Transportation Safety Board later blamed PG&E for lax pipeline safety and faulted state regulators for weak oversight.A San Francisco federal grand jury indicted the company in July 2014 on 27 counts of violating the Pipeline Safety Act and one count of obstructing the federal investigation.If convicted of all charges, PG&E could theoretically face maximum fines exceeding $31 billion - or twice the victims' estimated losses of $565 million for each count, prosecutors said.PG&E has pleaded not guilty. It said none of its employees intentionally violated the law. A trial is scheduled to begin next March.The company already has paid at least $70 million to settle civil claims stemming from the explosion.Since San Bruno, the company said it has replaced 800 miles (1,300 km) of old cast-iron transmission line with stronger pipe, installed 200 emergency shut-off valves and new leak-detection technology 1,000 times more sensitive than earlier equipment.

14,"   By Agnieszka Barteczko and Anna Koper | WARSAW, April 14  WARSAW, April 14 Plans to build Poland's first nuclear power plant will be delayed by at least another two years, sources said, after the decision late last year by state-run utility PGE to take on site research itself and cancel a consultancy contract.The project, expected to cost between $10 billion and $15 billion, was first touted in 2009 as part of a drive to find alternatives to coal-fired power. Since then it has been delayed as falling power prices weakened its economic case and Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident hit public support.Now PGE's move last December to scrap a 250 million zloty ($65.87 million) contract with Australia's WorleyParsons , on the grounds that it was taking too long to look into available sites, will push the plant's construction further back, according to two sources with knowledge of the project.""This alone delays the program by at least two years,"" a person familiar with the program told Reuters on condition of anonymity, noting that PGE would now have to conduct all the studies, including those on environment impact, on its own, which could take additional time given its lack of expertise.A second source with knowledge of the plan confirmed there would be a delay of at least two years as a result of cancelling the contract.The project's official deadlines are to have the first unit operating by 2025, delayed from the original plan to be up and running by 2020, and to complete the plant by 2035.But some observers say it looks increasingly unlikely that the plant will be built at all. Poland's Supreme Audit Office said in a report published on Tuesday that there was a high risk of further delays in building the plant or that it might not be developed at all.Wladyslaw Mielczarski, a professor from the Institute of Electric Power Engineering at the technical university of Lodz, in central Poland, said he did not expect the project would be cancelled outright but would be allowed to stall indefinitely.""Poland does not need a nuclear power station,"" he said. ""The nuclear program was the former prime minister (Donald Tusk)'s project. Now there is no one to carry it out.""COST SHARING On top of the consultancy wrangles, there is as yet no decision on how PGE is to bear the cost of the project. It has said only that it plans to find a strategic partner to supply the technology needed to build the nuclear plant and help carry some of the costs. Proceedings aiming at selecting the partner will be launched in the second half of this year.So far PGE has said only it will decide on the plant's site in 2017. It is considering two locations at the Baltic Sea, at Choczewo, and at Zarnowiec, where works on a nuclear power plant were carried out under Communist rule.PGE EJ1, the unit of PGE that is undertaking the project, said it was reviewing what the impact of cancelling the consultancy contract would be on the schedule. It did not confirm a two-year delay.""Only after these analyses and evaluations are completed will the company be able to present changes to the project's schedule,"" the unit's chief executive officer, Jacek Cichosz, told Reuters.Nonetheless, secretary of state in the Economy Ministry Jerzy Pietrewicz said last week that the first phase of program could be still completed by 2025 ""with the full commitment of all participants.""An agreement by three other Polish state-run companies, copper miner KGHM, and utilities Tauron and Enea, to buy 10 percent each in PGE EJ1 should be finalised in the coming weeks, a PGE EJ1 spokeswoman said.

20,"  WARSAW, July 8 Poland's biggest power producer PGE could transfer its telecom arm Exatel to a special fund managed by state investment vehicle PIR to help it raise rescue funds for troubled miner Kompania Weglowa, Puls Biznesu daily said.Kompania Weglowa (KW), which is the European Union's biggest coal miner, is on the brink of bankruptcy due to record low coal prices and high production costs.As part of the government's rescue plan it is seeking investors to inject 1.5 billion zlotys ($391 million) into the company. Around half of that sum is needed by the end of July to keep KW alive. Initially the government expected its four state-run energy companies, some of which are the recipients of KW's coal, to directly buy shares in KW, but all refused.The company and the treasury ministry, which supervises the mining industry, are still looking for solutions. The fastest idea is that a fund managed by PIR, with financial support from some of the state-run companies, would become the major shareholder in KW, sources told Reuters. ""Exatel could be transferred to the Polish companies' investment fund,"" Puls Biznesu quoted its sources as saying. PGE's spokesman declined to comment.

21,"  * PGE, KGHM and Azoty offer to join rescue fund: sources* Their assets to help stave of coal sector bankruptcies* Gov't is pressing firms to join in rescue* But some executives doubt it makes commercial senseBy Agnieszka Barteczko and Adrian KrajewskiWARSAW, July 22 Poland has persuaded at least three major companies to contribute to a bailout of troubled coal miner Kompania Weglowa, despite some executives' misgivings about the commercial logic of getting involved, sources with knowledge of the matter said.After weeks of talks with more than a dozen firms it hoped would take part in the rescue, government officials have received proposals from three: copper miner KGHM, utility PGE and chemicals producer Grupa Azoty , the sources said.""Arms are being twisted,"" said a source close to one of the companies involved.The government, facing a tough re-election battle in October, cannot afford to let Kompania Weglowa go bankrupt because it depends on votes from mining regions, but it is also barred by European Union rules from giving state aid. The solution -- persuading firms to invest in a fund which will become a Kompania Weglowa shareholder -- has raised concerns among some investors that the government is sacrificing free market principles for the sake of political expediency.The three companies preparing to take part in the rescue are state-controlled, but a significant part of their equity is held by private shareholders who want the firms to return profits and dividends.Another state-controlled firm, insurer PZU was asked by the government to contribute, but it declined, according to a source close to the matter.The insurer is in talks to buy banking assets and having exposure to the mining sector -- which is in deep financial trouble with several firms close to bankruptcy -- could affect its ability to make acquisitions.""Higher investment risk in the mining sector is not favourable in bank negotiations,"" the source said. ""There are companies more suited to have miners in their portfolio."" RESCUE FUND Two sources familiar with the negotiations over the bailout said the government was also in talks with the country's No.1 oil refiner, PKN Orlen, about contributing. PKN was not available to comment.KW, which is the EU's No.1 coal miner, and JSW, the bloc's biggest coking coal producer, are both facing insolvency, an outcome which would anger politically-influential mining unions in an election year. To avoid that, Poland's treasury ministry has forged a special fund whose function is in part to help the troubled state-run miners. It will have 6 billion zlotys  ($1.59 billion) worth of assets..The fund is also intended to invest in other sectors, the government has said.State bank BGK and its investment vehicle PIR are to invest 1.5 billion zlotys in the fund by the end of August. The rest is supposed to come from major Polish companies, either in the form of cash or non-cash assets.According to sources close to companies in talks with the government, PGE tentatively offered a combination of cash and its telecom arm Exatel as its contribution to the fund.The sources said KGHM, Europe's No. 2 copper producer, would offer spa resorts in Poland which are controlled by KGHM's investment fund for non-core assets, the sources said. Azoty was also to offer assets.The sources said that the negotiations were still underway and that proposals from the companies could change.PGE and Azoty declined to comment on the issue. A KGHM spokesman said the company was considering transferring some non-production assets to the government-created fund, but did not give the value or say what they were.""KGHM, as a national champion, understands the need to support Polish economic entities on reasonable business terms,"" the spokesman said.

23,"  WARSAW Aug 31 Poland's biggest power producer PGE posted a net loss of 5.06 billion zlotys ($1.34 billion) in the first half of 2015 because of the 8.8 billion zlotys impairment charge it announced last week, the company said late on Monday.In the first half of 2014 the state-run group posted a net profit of 2.8 billion zlotys.Expanding on its Aug. 25 announcement, PGE said the impairment related to its lignite coal-based assets and resulted mainly from an expected fall in wholesale electricity prices, a more restrictive climate policy within the European Union and the group's limited potential to reduce fixed costs. The write-off was the biggest ever by a company on the Polish stock exchange.The firm said in a statement it planned to launch a cost- cutting program and review its investment plans, but did not provide any details. PGE said that Poland's electricity consumption increased by 1.8 percent year on year in the first half of 2015, while average spot power prices fell by 14 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected PGE to post 2.03 billion zlotys net profit in the first half and 936 million zlotys in the second quarter alone.The survey was conducted before PGE flagged the impairment tests and postponed the release of its second quarter results.

24,"  WARSAW, Sept 2 Poland's biggest power firm PGE  may consider selling its telecom business as part of a divestment plan designed to cope with rising CO2 emission costs and tough competition, Puls Biznesu quoted Chief Executive Marek Woszczyk as saying on Wednesday.The state-run group posted a net loss of 5.06 billion zlotys  ($1.3 billion) in the first half of 2015 because of a record 8.8 billion zlotys impairment charge related to its lignite coal assets.The company plans to launch a cost-cutting programme and to review its investment plans. It is also considering divestments, Puls Biznesu said. ""This would apply to the company's non-core assets ... for example the telecom ones,"" the paper quoted Woszczyk as saying. PGE controls telecom operator Exatel, which sources said earlier the power company could transfer to a special state-owned fund FIPP, partly designed to help troubled mining group Kompania Weglowa. Some experts say selling Exatel could be difficult as the telecom operator provides services to government departments, which makes it a strategic asset for the country.PGE previously tried to sell Exatel but the former management board dropped the plan in 2012.

30,"  June 21 California's only functioning nuclear power plant will close by 2025 and be replaced by renewables, energy efficiency and storage under an agreement announced on Tuesday by its owner, PG&E Corp, labor unions and environmental groups.PG&E said it would not seek to relicense the two reactors at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant beyond their current operating licenses, which expire in 2024 and 2025. The company cited California's goal of producing 50 percent of its power from renewables by 2030 and ambitious energy efficiency targets for the move, saying those policies had reduced the need for electricity from Diablo Canyon.The announcement is the latest in a series from nuclear operators moving to shut reactors. U.S. power prices have collapsed due to low gas prices, making it uneconomic to keep running or make needed repairs to the nuclear units . The owners of California's San Onofre nuclear power plant announced its retirement in 2013 following the detection of a leak in a steam generator tube. Replacing Diablo Canyon with renewable power will cost less than relicensing the nuclear plant and operating it through 2044, PG&E said, citing the decline in the cost of renewables.""California's energy landscape is changing dramatically,"" PG&E Chief Executive Tony Earley said in a statement. He added that nuclear power was ""an important bridge strategy to help ensure that power remains affordable and reliable and that we do not increase the use of fossil fuels while supporting California's vision for the future."" PG&E also said it would make a voluntary commitment to source 55 percent of its power supplies from renewables by 2031. Groups that said they support PG&E's plan include the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, Coalition of California Utility Employees, Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California and Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility.There are currently 100 operating reactors in the United States, with a total capacity near 100,000 megawatts, generating about 20 percent of the nation's total power. Nuclear power provided about 8.5 percent of California's power mix in 2014.

31,"  (Corrects paragraph 5 to show letter is from state regulators to PG&E, not from PG&E to regulators)July 8 Northern California power and gas company Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) said on Friday its McDonald Island gas storage facility in San Joaquin County remained out of service after the company detected small methane leaks from some of its wells in June.PG&E discovered the small leaks during an inspection the state required of gas storage operators after the massive leak discovered in October from Southern California Gas' (SoCalGas) Aliso Canyon storage facility in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. That leak, the state's largest ever, was not plugged until February and area homeowners had to relocate.The PG&E Corp unit said it has enough gas in storage elsewhere to meet customer needs while McDonald is closed and hopes to resume withdrawals and injections at the underground field by September, according to local media reports.PG&E said on its website the ""low level emissions"" at McDonald, on a man-made island in an unpopulated area near the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, pose no risk to public safety, the environment or reliability. State and PG&E officials determined the McDonald leaks range between 236 kilograms per hour (kg/hr) to 763 kg/hr, which state regulators said in a June 30 letter to PG&E was ""similar to or only slightly above background levels at natural gas storage facilities.""For comparison, the emissions at Aliso Canyon peaked at over 60,000 kg/hr before that leak was fixed, PG&E said. SoCalGas has said it hopes to have Aliso Canyon, the biggest gas storage facility in California, partially back in service by the end of the summer. SoCalGas is a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy.State agencies have warned the Los Angeles area could suffer gas shortages that could lead to power blackouts on up to 14 days this summer due to the limited availability of Aliso Canyon. McDonald is the second biggest storage facility in the state.PG&E said it has identified 10 wells with detectable methane emissions and isolated two of those from the reservoir as of June 30, according to the letter to state regulators.The state ordered PG&E to test all 87 wells at the facility.Of the three gas storage facilities PG&E owns and operates, McDonald is the largest with a capacity of 82 billion cubic feet. It is capable of providing nearly 25 percent of Northern California's gas on days of high demand, PG&E said.
