3,"  Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world's largest oilfield services company, posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Friday as robust international activity offset stiff competition in North America.Fracking, drilling seismic studies and other lucrative services for oil producers across most of the Middle East, Asia and Latin America helped the company's profit top analysts' estimates for the ninth straight quarter.Intense competition with Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) for work in North America's vast shale fields, though, combined with weak natural gas prices, eroded regional results. Without strong sales from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North American revenue would have dipped.""In the United States, we see no change in fundamentals, with any meaningful recovery in dry gas drilling activity some way out in the future,"" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement.Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers. International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger's 2013 revenue of $45.27 billion.Middle Eastern revenue jumped 5 percent in the quarter, helped by activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but a temporary shutdown of operations in southern Iraq in November, following a protest, slightly dented fourth-quarter results, the company said.Schlumberger suspended activity in Iraq in November after dozens of Shi'ite Muslim workers and tribesmen, accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion, stormed the Schlumberger camp in North Rumaila and wrecked offices. Seasonal slowdowns in North America, the North Sea, Russia and China also weighed on results.The company expects oil producers' exploration and production spending, the lion's share of its business, to increase this year for international markets and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.Barclays (BARC.L) expects oil and gas companies to spend about $723 billion on exploration and production this year, an increase of 6.1 percent from 2013, according to report released last month.Schlumberger's net income rose to $1.66 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the fourth quarter ended December31, from $1.36 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit from continuing operations was $1.35 per share.Revenue rose about 7 percent to $11.91 billion.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue of $12.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

4,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Garima Goel  Oilfield service companies Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) said they expect an improvement in North American margins, driven by a modest pickup in onshore activity and strong deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.Halliburton and Baker Hughes, No. 2 and No. 3 in the industry, have been expanding outside the United States and Canada, where excess capacity and a drop in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas has eaten into margins.Strong activity in international markets, particularly the Middle East and Africa, helped both companies report stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday.Baker Hughes shares rose about 2 percent in morning trade. Shares of Halliburton, which initially rose on the results, fell 3 percent after the company said in a conference call that conditions would remain tough in Latin America.Halliburton said it was targeting an improvement of 200 basis points in North American margins in 2014, while Baker Hughes said it expected margins in the region to recover by at least 105 basis points in the first quarter.Halliburton, which expects 2014 revenue in North America to increase by a mid-single-digit in percentage terms, said the average U.S. land rig count was likely to increase modestly this year.Baker Hughes, which publishes a closely watched tally of active rigs, said it expected the U.S. onshore rig count to be essentially flat this year, but added that the well count would rise by 5 percent due to improved drilling efficiencies.Oilfield service companies are able to secure more business despite no growth in rig count as greater efficiency allows clients to drill more wells with a single rig.Baker Hughes said increased profitability in North America would offset a seasonal decline in its international and industrial businesses in the first quarter.The company said it expected first-quarter earnings to rise ""slightly"" from fourth-quarter adjusted earnings, excluding the impact of disruptions in Iraq.Baker Hughes temporarily suspended operations in southern Iraq in November, following protests over an alleged religious insult by a security adviser working in the area for competitor Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), whose operations were also disrupted. LATIN AMERICA CHALLENGES Halliburton said it expected a seasonal decline in first-quarter revenue in Latin America and that margins there would be more ""severe than normal"" due to higher costs in Brazil and reduced land drilling in Mexico.Falling output from older offshore oil fields in Brazil along with delays in bringing on new areas is weighing on drilling activity in the country.Halliburton expects margins for the Latin American region, which accounted for 13 percent of operating income in the fourth quarter, to stay in the upper single digits until activity begins to recover in the back half of the year.Fourth-quarter operating income from Latin America fell 21 percent, while revenue was flat at $1 billion.""We believe that 2014 will be a very challenging year for Latin America,"" Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Miller said on a conference call with analysts. MIDDLE EAST DRIVES EARNINGS Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes received nearly half of their revenue from outside North America in the fourth quarter.Halliburton forecast double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2014, citing strong international demand.""Halliburton's bullish outlook for 2014 should ease some concerns about the outlook for global E&P (exploration and production) spending in 2014,"" Barclays analysts said in a note to clients.Barclays expects oil and gas companies to spend about $723 billion on exploration and production this year, an increase of 6.1 percent from 2013, according to a report released last month.Baker Hughes said it expected the international rig count to grow by 10 percent this year. Baker Hughes said its revenue from Middle East and Asia Pacific jumped 27 percent in the quarter, while Halliburton's revenue from the same regions climbed 13 percent.Most of their gains in the Middle East are coming from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, which is lining up dozens of rigs this year to make up for supply disruptions in other countries, including Iran, Libya, Nigeria and Yemen.Market leader Schlumberger, which gets almost 70 percent of its revenue from outside North America, posted a better-than-expected profit on Friday thanks to robust drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Baker Hughes said revenue from its operations in Europe, Africa, Russia and the Caspian region combined rose 10 percent in the fourth quarter.

7,"   By Sayantani Ghosh and Ashutosh Pandey  Oilfield services providers Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) each posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, though they said pockets of weakness loom in Brazil, Canada, Russia and other drilling regions.The results highlight a rapidly changing landscape for the oilfield service industry, where companies are competing for a smaller number of new contracts in North American shale fields. At the same time, they are moving into newer, more-lucrative Eastern Hemisphere regions that have higher logistical risks.Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which provide drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys for oil and natural gas companies, have for months been complaining of market weakness in North America.Additionally, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and other large, international oil companies, after a decade of double-digit growth in capital budgets, have begun cutting spending as oil prices stagnate and project costs rise, a bad sign for oilfield service companies.Executives from Schlumberger, the world's No. 1 oilfield services company by revenue, and Baker Hughes told analysts on conference calls they expect results to slightly improve this year in parts of North America but they warned of potential problems in other regions.Schlumberger said deepwater drilling off Brazil should decline 20 percent this year compared with last year and that revenue could drop in Russia due to weakness in the ruble. Both countries are important markets for Schlumberger.""Brazil revenue for us this year is going to be significantly down versus 2013,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on a call with analysts, citing slipping demand and less-lucrative contracts signed last year.Baker Hughes said its revenue this quarter would decline slightly in North America, where it gets half its annual revenue, partly due to a slowdown in Canada.GULF OF MEXICO HOLDS PROMISE  Three years after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, large oil and gas companies are ramping up operations in the Gulf of Mexico, which they expect to yield more than 700,000 barrels per day of crude.""The Gulf of Mexico will play a big role in our North American margin growth,"" Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Martin Craighead said.While Schlumberger's revenue from deepwater drilling in the region fell in the first quarter due to operational delays, it expects the situation to normalize this quarter.""The outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year,"" Kibsgaard said.Baker Hughes, which said it had a good first quarter in the Gulf, expects business in the region to continue to improve and boost margins particularly in the second half of the year. The company's North American revenue rose 12 percent to $3.68 billion in the first quarter. Baker Hughes posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to $2.78 billion from the region.Baker Hughes' shares rose 4.1 percent to $69.05 in afternoon trading.Schlumberger's shares, which hit their highest point in nearly six years on Thursday morning, fell 0.4 percent to $100.53. The stock has risen about 12 percent in the past month, outperforming shares of Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes.In the past few quarters, unusually cold weather in North America and Russia disrupted drilling, hurting oil and gas companies while pushing up natural gas prices in North America and depleted stockpiles to their lowest level since 2003.Kibsgaard said the fundamentals of the global economic recovery were intact despite the harsh winter, slowing growth in China, and problems in Ukraine. Schlumberger, which cut its 2014 capital spending budget by about 3 percent to $3.8 billion, said it expected spending on well-related activity to rise by more than 6 percent this year.WEAK LATAM Schlumberger's first-quarter revenue fell short of analysts' average estimate due to reduced drilling activity and pricing pressure in Latin America.Revenue from the region declined 8 percent to $1.76 billion, the lowest in eight quarters.

10,"   By Sayantani Ghosh and Ashutosh Pandey  Oilfield services companies Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly profits and signaled an improvement in the North American market, driven by increased drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services company, gets a third of its revenue from North America. The region accounts for half of rival Baker Hughes' annual revenue.The companies provide drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys to oil and gas companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).Three years after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, large oil and gas companies are ramping up operations in the Gulf, which is poised to deliver more than 700,000 barrels per day of crude.While Schlumberger's revenue from deepwater drilling in the region fell in the first quarter due to operational delays, the company expects the situation to normalize in the current quarter.""The outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year,"" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with analysts.Baker Hughes, which said it had a good first quarter in the Gulf, expects business to continue to improve in the region and boost margins, particularly in the second half of the year.Barclays analysts were upbeat on both stocks, saying the companies had done well in North America despite a colder-than-usual winter.""The industry bellwether posted a solid earnings number in a tough quarter (and) signaled a 'robust' North American market ...,"" they said in a research note, referring to Schlumberger.The company's North American revenue rose 12 percent to $3.68 billion in the first quarter. Baker Hughes posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to $2.78 billion from the region. Baker Hughes' shares rose as much as 5 percent to $69.43 on the New York Stock Exchange - their highest since August 2011.Schlumberger's shares, which rose less than 1 percent in morning trade to their highest in nearly six years, were marginally down at $100.34 in morning trading.The stock has risen about 12 percent in the past month, outperforming shares of Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes.SPENDING CUTS In the past couple of quarters, colder-than-usual weather in North America and Russia disrupted drilling, hurting oil and gas companies. The cold weather, however, pushed up natural gas prices in North America and depleted stockpiles to their lowest level since 2003, after years of glut that forced many drillers to idle rigs.Kibsgaard said the fundamentals of the global economic recovery were intact despite the harsh winter, slowing growth in China, and problems in Ukraine.""These factors, however, are likely temporary in nature ... but supply and demand is expected to normalize over the coming months,"" he said in a statement.Oilfield services companies are expected to feel the heat as large oil companies, after a decade of double-digit growth, cut spending amid stagnating oil prices and higher project costs.The company has already seen a reduction in spending from integrated oil companies, Kibsgaard said, adding that he expects them to cut spending more on infrastructure and less on well-related projects. Schlumberger, which cut its 2014 capital spending budget by about 3 percent to $3.8 billion, said it expected spending on well-related activity to rise by more than 6 percent this year.WEAK LATAM Schlumberger's first-quarter revenue fell short of the average analyst estimate due to reduced drilling activity and pricing pressure in Latin America.Revenue from the region declined 8 percent to $1.76 billion, the lowest in eight quarters. Latin America accounted for nearly 16 percent of Schlumberger's total sales in the first quarter ended March 31.Schlumberger's profit from continuing operations rose 32.5 percent to $1.59 billion, or $1.21 per share, in the first quarter. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.20 per share.The company's total revenue rose about 6 percent to $11.24 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $11.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company expects deepwater drilling in Brazil to be down more than 20 percent in 2014.Baker Hughes also posted a 10 percent drop in quarterly revenue from Latin America.The company's adjusted profit rose 27 percent to 84 cents per share, while revenue rose nearly 10 percent to $5.73 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 78 cents on revenue of $5.71 billion.(Writing by Sayantani Ghosh in Bangalore; Editing by Joyjeet Das, Kirti Pandey and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",2014-04-17,BHI,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 11:55am EDT","Schlumberger, Baker Hughes results point to improving North America",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-schlumberger-results-idUSBREA3G1K120140417?type=companyNews

12,"  (Adds details, Schlumberger results, share movement)April 17 Baker Hughes Inc, the world's third-largest oilfield services company, posted better-than-expected results as revenue in its core North American business rose nearly 7 percent, sending its shares up about 4 percent in premarket trading.Net income attributable to Baker Hughes rose to $328 million, or 74 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $267 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 84 cents per share.Revenue rose nearly 10 percent to $5.73 billion. Revenue in North America rose to $2.78 billion. Revenue from the Middle East and Asia Pacific jumped 24 percent to $1.11 billion.North America margins improved by 200 basis points on an adjusted profit, despite a drop in well count caused by severe winter weather in the Rockies and northeast United States. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 78 cents on revenue of $5.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Baker Hughes' Latin America revenue fell 10 percent to $530 million.

24,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON  WILLISTON Aug 18 A subsidiary of real estate developer The Prime Group Inc said on Monday it plans to build a $150 million convention center in Williston, North Dakota, aiming to supply a world-class meeting space for the fast-growing oil boom community.The 16-story complex, which wouldn't open until 2016 at the earliest and still needs funding and approval from city officials, would have more than 600,000 square feet of space, including indoor and outdoor exhibition areas, a Ruth's Chris Steak House, retail shops, office space, underground parking and a 300-room hotel.""We really want to connect with the oil industry and ensure their needs are served,"" John Breugelmans, a principle with The Prime Group subsidiary BR Investments LLC, said in a presentation to reporters. ""The oil boom is far from its peak.""Most large-scale meetings and conventions in Williston are now held in small hotels not originally designed for that purpose. For instance, while 110 prospective employers participated in a recent job fair, city officials said they had to turn away more than 100 due to space limitations. Oil companies have sought out facilities for routine workforce training seminars only to be frustrated by the lack of space. Baker Hughes Inc built its own training center since it could not find available space in Williston.The Prime Group expects to spend about $110 million of its own funds on the project and is seeking public financing for the rest, Breugelmans said.The breakdown effectively mirrors the project's scope: Breugelmans' group would pay for one of two buildings on the site, which would contain all facilities except the convention hall. The Prime Group is asking Williston to finance $40 million for the freestanding convention hall itself, which as designed would evoke clusters of North Dakota's shale rock from which more than 1 million barrels of oil are pulled each month.A new convention center could prove popular with the scores of oil and natural gas companies and their suppliers with offices in Williston, considered the de facto capital of the North Dakota oil boom. Breugelmans said he hopes to break ground in early 2015 on the convention center, with construction taking about 15 to 18 months. The project won't take off without public financing though, he said.With roughly $1.05 billion in planned infrastructure projects through 2020, it's unclear how Williston would pay for the project or whether it would prefer to divert funds to other projects, including a proposed new airport.Howard Klug, Williston's newly elected mayor and president of the  Williston Convention and Visitors Bureau, said he supports the concept of a new convention space in the city, but he has not yet decided whether to support Breugelmans' project.Klug has formed a committee to study the idea of a new convention center and potential funding. He expects that study to be done by year's end, but doubts residents would accept a new sales tax to fund the project.

29,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Anannya Pramanick  Oct 21 As fracking accelerates in North American shale fields, oilfield services providers Halliburton Co  and Baker Hughes Inc are stockpiling sand to protect themselves against rising costs and are buying more railcars to transport the haul.Halliburton, the world's largest provider of fracking services, is more than doubling its railcar fleet and capacity for sand terminals - where sand is stored and transferred to truck from rail. It had about 3,500 railcars under management as of June 30.Baker Hughes, the world's No.3 oilfield services provider,  said at the Barclays CEO Energy Power conference last month that it had ""significantly"" increased the number of its railcars and is buying more sand under contract, which helps buffer it against price rises.Companies are pumping in as much as a trainload of frac sand into a single well to coax more oil and gas from shale rocks.But the shale rush, especially in Texas and North Dakota, coupled with a rail jam that began after last year's severe winter has resulted in shortage of sand at drilling sites.""We did experience some disruptions early in the third quarter, where work was delayed because we were waiting on sand deliveries,"" Halliburton's Chief Executive David Lesar said on the company's post-earnings call on Monday.Halliburton has committed about $100 million this year to upgrade its infrastructure to move frac sand. The company signed up 30 additional trucking companies this year to transport sand, Jeffrey Miller, Halliburton's president, said on Monday. It has also opened a center in Houston to monitor supply and track its rail and trucking fleets, he said.Halliburton is also buying more sand under contract, which it said helped shave 15-20 percent off spot sand costs.""Halliburton has probably been the most proactive in establishing a 'just-in-time' inventory system for most of their frac sand products because it is becoming such a logistical game,"" said Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago, who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock. RISING COSTS Halliburton and Baker Hughes are beefing up their transportation networks to also shield themselves from the increase in costs to move sand, which is adding to already high sand prices.Prices for various grades of sand increased by between 5 percent and 20 percent past year, said Taylor Robinson, president of commodity logistics consulting firm PLG Consulting.For example, Robinson said, sand delivered from Illinois to the Eagle Ford shale field in Texas costs $127 per ton on average, with transportation and warehousing accounting for nearly two-thirds of that. ""I think there's going to be a limit to how much of these additional cost escalations our customers are prepared to take, given their free cash flow situation and also given the drop in oil prices,"" Schlumberger Ltd CEO Paal Kibsgaard said during the company's earnings call on Friday.The world's largest oilfield services company said last week that oil and gas spending would increase in 2015 as global oil demand was poised to rise, downplaying fears of an investment slowdown due to weak crude prices.Schlumberger did not respond to emails and calls requesting comment for the story. Baker Hughes declined to comment.Several sand miners are also stepping up investments in their transportation networks, which they use to deliver sand to companies such as Halliburton.U.S. Silica Holdings Inc, which has about 30 transloading terminals for transferring sand from railcars to trucks, plans to invest about $300 million to expand its logistics network by 2020, CEO Bryan Shinn said.U.S. Silica is constructing ""one of the largest transloading facilities in the country"" in the Permian Basin, he said, and expects to add another 15-20 locations in the next few years.

30,"  (Adds analyst comment)By Sam N. AdamsOct 31 Energy companies have reduced the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States to the lowest since August, shifting more rigs in favor of natural gas as crude prices dive, data showed on Friday.The number of rigs drilling for oil fell by 13 to 1,582 in the latest week, the fourth weekly decline in the past six weeks, according to data from oil services firm Baker Hughes  on Friday. Natural gas rigs rose by 14 to 346 rigs, the highest since February, the data show. ""While the oil rig count might be down, we're cruising along at really high numbers,"" said Gene McGillian, a senior analyst at Tradition Energy. ""A decline in the numbers isn't really significant given the number we have operating right now."" Despite the recent declines, the number of rigs seeking oil is up from 1,376 rigs a year ago and hit a high of 1,609 a few weeks ago, the most since at least 1987.""Our sense is we're not going to see those sorts of capital changes immediately unless we see sustained low prices,"" said Teri Viswanath, director of natural gas strategy at BNP Paribas. Oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell as low as $79.55 per barrel earlier Friday, close to the contract's 28-month low of $79.44 hit earlier this week.Horizontal rigs, the type most often used to extract oil or gas from shale, fell by 2 to 1,353.

37,"  The proposed merger of oilfield service companies Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc would create a serious challenger to Schlumberger NV in international markets and cement the two companies' dominance in North America.And that is the problem, according to some analysts.""The proposed merger would be dominant in North America, which could spur protracted (antitrust) scrutiny; and likely elicit howls of protest from customers everywhere, potentially requiring concessions to more than one national anti-trust authority,"" analysts at FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note.Baker Hughes disclosed after the market closed on Thursday that it was in preliminary merger talks with its Houston neighbor.But muted market reaction on Friday highlighted the likelihood that any deal would face an uphill regulatory battle.Baker Hughes' shares were up 0.2 percent in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange while Halliburton's were up 1.4 percent. Schlumberger's stock was up 0.4 percent. A combined Halliburton-Baker Hughes would have combined revenue of about $52 billion, based on 2013 results, outstripping Schlumberger's 2013 revenue of $45.3 billion.The merged company's business in North America would also be about double that of Schlumberger, which gets more than two-thirds of its revenue from international operations.Still, the merged entity's market value of about $70 billion would be far less than Schlumberger's $120 billion. Baker Hughes, whose shares were trading at $58.38 at midday, should be able to command a 25 percent premium to its Wednesday close of $50.98 for an enterprise value of $25.46 billion, Evercore ISI analyst James West said in a note.The proposed deal would give Halliburton, the No. 2 oilfield services provider, the leading market share in oilfield services such as directional drilling, coiled tubing and drill-bits, unseating Schlumberger in all three markets, said West. A deal would not be all bad news for Schlumberger, however. Analysts said that by reducing the number of big players in  the industry to two from three, pricing could stabilize.""Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have been in a knife fight the past few years for international and offshore tenders,"" Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts said.""A combined company could help introduce more discipline to these bid processes and ultimately improve returns/profits for the industry.""  (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr)",2014-11-14,BHI,"Fri Nov 14, 2014 | 2:11pm EST",Proposed merger of oilfield firms poses challenge to Schlumberger,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bakerhughes-halliburton-research-idUSKCN0IY24H20141114?type=companyNews

A stronger dollar and decline in gasoline prices affected a trio of economic reports on Friday as overall retail sales rose more than expected while U.S. import prices fell in September by the most in more than two years.In addition, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment for this month came in at 89.4, the highest since July 2007, buoyed by falling unemployment and gas prices.""It's a consolidating day and everyone is focused on oil, what is oil telling us here?"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. ""Is it going down because of a price war, or is it going down because of the prospects of the global economy slowing even further?""Brent crude was up 2.5 percent at $79.40 a barrel, bouncing from a four-year low, while U.S. crude advanced 1.4 percent to $75.22.While the Dow and S&P have continued to set record highs, recent gains have been modest, with the S&P 500 yet to post a gain of at least 1 percent this month.

The oilfield services company said it was in preliminary merger talks with larger rival Halliburton Co, which was little changed at $53.75.Virgin America Inc, a low-cost airline partly owned by Richard Branson, soared as much as 28 percent in its market debut, underscoring the buoyant mood in an industry that is seeing relief from lower oil prices.

46,"   By Mike Stone and Anna Driver | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 14 Talks that could lead to oilfield services provider Halliburton Co buying rival Baker Hughes Inc may herald increased deal-making in the energy business as companies bet on a protracted drop in oil prices, industry bankers said.Competing service companies including National Oilwell Varco Inc and Weatherford International may also be targets, bankers and lawyers said. In any deal, the incentives will be the same: consolidation would allow them to better weather the downturn and resist pressure from oil producers to slash prices.The Baker Hughes/Halliburton talks have stalled after the companies weren't able to agree on issues including price, people familiar with the matter said Friday.As oil prices fall, oil field service companies get squeezed, one industry lawyer said. That's because when prices fall far enough, it's no longer economical to get oil out of the ground. If it's too expensive to drill, there's no need to pay an oilfield service company. ""The services guys are the last marginal dollar,"" the lawyer said.While services companies are likely to feel the effect of lower oil prices sooner, overleveraged exploration and production companies may also be pushed to do deals over the medium term, bankers said. Such companies could include Apache Corp, Hess Corp, Marathon Oil Corp or Devon Energy Corp, bankers said. Those four exploration companies along with the oil services companies including Baker Hughes, all have market values that range between about $20 billion and $31 billion.In the end, price expectations will decide whether upstream exploration and production companies turn into sellers. If sellers' management believe the oil price will rebound fairly soon, sellers would wait until then, hurting chances for large deals. Brent crude traded at $79.60 a barrel on Friday, down from $115.06 on June 19.Until prices stabilize, exploration and production company deals will likely remain asset-level deals in distressed situations such as Samson Resources' sale of its Bakken assets. ""Certainly there will be instances where you will find more compromised balance sheet operators possibly being more inclined to sell their entire position,"" said Ted Harper, a fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors LLC in Houston.Not all will be targets, he said. Some exploration and production companies will seek to buy at a discount additional potential reserves near where they are already drilling ""to enhance returns from existing production,"" he said.Because exploration and production companies will slow or stop drilling if they are not making money, there is enormous pricing pressure on oil field services providers as oil prices fall. Indeed, the tumbling price may have pushed the companies into a dialog, especially if Halliburton's management believes that oil prices could remain low for some time.While Halliburton ""has first mover advantage"" in its bid to acquire Baker Hughes, ""it's common knowledge that Schlumberger made a run at Baker Hughes years ago to plug a major hole in (well) completions. That hole remains unfilled,"" Bill Herbert, oilfield analyst at energy-focused investment bank Simmons & Co told clients on Friday.""Further, GE is lurking in the shadows as well, manufacturing cultures are comparable,"" said Herbert. General Electric Co. has a large oil and gas business.While another bidder for Baker Hughes may not emerge, oilfield services companies and private equity firms will be looking to buy up any Baker Hughes business units shed to meet antitrust requirements if the Halliburton deal goes through, bankers said.""There is going to be reasonably competitive bidding on the part of the General Electrics, the National Oilwell Varcos and some of the midcap players,"" said Frost's Harper.

50,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Halliburton Co said on Monday it will buy Baker Hughes Inc for about $35 billion in cash and stock, creating an oilfield services behemoth to take on market leader Schlumberger NV as customers curb spending on falling oil prices.Halliburton expressed confidence that the tie up of the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the services industry would clear regulatory hurdles, saying it was prepared to shed assets to mollify antitrust concerns that could arise in Asia, Europe and the Americas.The deal, the second biggest in the U.S. energy sector this year, could create a company with more revenue than  Schlumberger. (link.reuters.com/kav43w)With oil prices down by a third since June, demand for drilling services has slipped and stock prices across the energy sector have suffered. That has stoked chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities companies could take advantage of to weather the downturn.Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said the combined entity would be more resilient and able to offer a wider suite of products globally.""Stronger in any market condition is better,"" he told Reuters. ""We are in a cyclical business.”Halliburton said it was ready to divest businesses that generate revenue of $7.5 billion to satisfy regulators and would pay Baker Hughes $3.5 billion if the deal was not cleared.""At the end of the day, we wouldn't have done this deal if we didn't believe it was achievable from a regulatory standpoint,"" Lesar said on a conference call. Baker Hughes shares were trading well below the offer, suggesting that investors were not so sure of regulatory approvals.But Kurt Hallead, oilfield services analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the risk of the deal failing was low.""I think the assessment on divestitures matches up pretty closely with the work we've done. I don't anticipate there being any roadblocks,"" he said.The transaction would unite the two companies based in Houston and create an entity dominant in U.S. onshore services such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.  While there are at least seven major services where there is an overlap between the two companies, the deal would fill gaps in two product lines in Halliburton's portfolio – product chemicals and pumps that boost output from wells.Baker Hughes shares rose nearly 11 percent to $66.44 each  on Monday, well short of Halliburton's offer of $80.69, based on Friday's close.After a steep run up last week, Halliburton shares were down 8 percent at $50.60. Schlumberger was up 0.6 percent at $95.85.Talks between the two companies started over a month ago and came to a head on Friday when Halliburton threatened to replace Baker Hughes's board after its initial offer was rejected. Baker Hughes shareholders will get 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19 in cash for every share held, and own 36 percent of the combined company.Baker Hughes will get three seats on the combined company's 15-member board.The combined company's 2013 revenue was $51.8 billion on a pro-forma basis, more than Schlumberger's $45.3 billion.But Schlumberger's market capitalization of $122.6 billion is twice as large as the united company.Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch advised Halliburton and Goldman, Sachs & Co advised Baker Hughes.

62,"  (Adds details on past rig counts, prices)Nov 21 Energy companies reduced the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States, while shifting more rigs in favor of natural gas, due to weaker crude prices, data showed on Friday.Energy traders have been watching the rig data closely to see if oil drillers are cutting back on the number of oil rigs due to the crude price drop.Analysts, however, have said there was not yet enough evidence to call recent declines in the number of oil rigs a pattern.The number of rigs drilling for oil declined by four to 1,574 in the week to Nov. 21, after climbing 10 in the prior week, according to data from oil services firm Baker Hughes . Even though the number of oil rigs has declined in six of the last nine weeks, analysts noted the number of rigs now drilling for oil was still much higher than a year ago and recently hit a record high.A year ago, there were 1,387 rigs drilling for oil, while six weeks ago oil rigs reached 1,609, the most since at least 1987 when current data became available. U.S. crude oil futures fell as low as $73.25 per barrel last week, the lowest in four years. On Friday, it was trading just under $76.For more on U.S. fracking firms unfazed by slumping oil prices, see This week, drillers removed most oil rigs from the Niobara in Wyoming and Colorado, Granite Wash in Texas and Oklahoma, Permian in Texas and New Mexico, and Williston in North Dakota and Montana. They, however, added rigs in the Barnett in Texas and Cana Woodford in Oklahoma, according to the data.The number of rigs drilling for gas in the United States, meanwhile, climbed by five this week to 355. That is still down from 369 a year ago and is well below the all-time high of 1,606 set in 2008.Gas futures were more than 3 percent lower on Friday after being on a roller-coaster ride for the past few weeks - up 14 percent two weeks ago, down 9 percent last week and up 8 percent so far this week - due primarily to changes in the 15-day weather forecast, exacerbated by technical trade. {NGA/]Horizontal rigs - the type most often used to extract oil or gas from shale - rose by three to 1,372.

63,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON N.D.  WILLISTON N.D. Halliburton Co's $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes Inc will create an oilfield services powerhouse in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking, according to data seen by Reuters. The deal, announced on Monday, will help Halliburton better compete with global leader Schlumberger NV, as well as smaller peers Calfrac Well Services Ltd, Trican Well Service Ltd and other oilfield services companies in North Dakota, the second-largest oil producer in the United States.  The North Dakota market share projections for the combined company will be of keen interest to competitors and regulators.   The deal faces stiff antitrust hurdles and likely will receive close scrutiny from regulators in the United States and European Union. Halliburton has said it would be willing to shed units that generate revenue of $7.5 billion to ensure the deal closes.Even though oil production in the state's Bakken shale formation has grown exponentially in the past five years, more than 35,000 new wells are expected to come online in the state by 2030, highlighting the ongoing need for the services these companies provide.""We will rule unconventionals now,"" one Halliburton manager in North Dakota told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity.    In the Williston Basin, the oil-rich geologic formation holding much of North Dakota's Bakken and Three Forks shales, the combined company will control 53 percent of the market to line a new well with cement to prevent leaks, according to the data. The step is required by regulators and a key process to safeguard drinking water supplies. The combined company will also control roughly 36 percent of the Williston Basin market for hydraulic fracturing - the process commonly known as 'fracking' where water and sand are blasted into a well at high pressure to extract oil. And roughly 35 percent of the market for directional drilling, the process to drill wells horizontally, will be held by the combined company, according to the data.The Williston Basin market prowess in cementing and directional drilling would eclipse the united company's global share of those markets. Fracking market share in the basin would nearly match the new Halliburton, globally.   UNIFORM PRICING Halliburton is very interested in Baker Hughes' artificial lift division, which makes products that help old wells boost their productivity, as well as its production chemicals unit, according to footnotes accompanying the data.In a statement to Reuters, Halliburton said it is too early to discuss the status of the combined company. ""It is important to remember that until the close of the transaction, Halliburton and Baker Hughes remain separate companies,"" Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said.  It was not immediately clear what Schlumberger's market share is for various products and services in North Dakota, but the Halliburton-Baker Hughes tie-up gives the combined company clear dominance in most oilfield services performed in the state.Schlumberger did not respond to a request for comment. The deal could lead to higher prices for some oil producers. Baker Hughes historically has priced its services below Halliburton, and the deal will allow Halliburton to make pricing more uniform. Continental Resources Inc, for instance, uses a plethora of oilfield service companies for various well completion processes, often choosing the lowest bidder.The deal also gives Halliburton access to Baker Hughes' extensive North Dakota real estate holdings, including a training center it built earlier this year. Halliburton currently trains employees at centers in Oklahoma and Colorado.

66,"  (Adds analyst quote, Permian background)Dec 12 The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 29 this week, the biggest weekly drop in two years, as tumbling crude prices continued to threaten energy company revenues.The oil rig count dropped to 1,546 in the week to Dec. 12, according to data from oil services firm Baker Hughes on Friday.The number of oil rigs has declined in six of the last nine weeks since hitting a record high of 1,609 in mid October, as a nearly 50 percent drop in oil prices since the summer begins to take its toll on drilling projects.Energy traders have been watching rig data to see if the steep price drop has begun to prompt oil drillers to cut back on the number of rigs. Some analysts cautioned about making too much of just one week's drop; the number remains up more than 100 from a year ago, when there were 1,411 rigs seeking oil.Twenty-one of the 29 rigs that were cut were in the Permian Basin, the fastest growing and largest U.S. shale play in West Texas and New Mexico. Analysts said that drilling there is costlier due to the geological complexity of the play, particularly when compared with the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas. Less efficient vertical rigs fell by 24 to a total of 330, the lowest since 1999, according to the Baker Hughes data. The horizontal rig count, most often used to extract oil from shale rock, fell one this week to 1,367. Horizontal rigs peaked at 1,372 in late November.""Vertical rigs are less efficient and more on the margins than horizontal rigs, so it certainly makes economic sense that if indeed this decline was a rapid response to the crude price drop then those are the ones that are going to come off,"" said Kyle Cooper at IAF Advisors, a consultancy, in Houston. U.S. crude oil futures on Friday fell as low as $57.34 per barrel, the lowest in five years.U.S. oil and gas producers are scaling back capital spending plans for 2015.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino and Catherine Ngai in New York; Editing by David Gregorio and Marguerita Choy)",2014-12-12,BHI,"Fri Dec 12, 2014 | 2:57pm EST","UPDATE 2-U.S. oil drillers cut rigs, scaling back in Permian - Baker Hughes",http://www.reuters.com//article/energy-natgas-rigs-idUSL1N0TW1LJ20141212?type=companyNews
67,"  * Cash-rich majors the most likely buyers* M&A flurry expected once oil prices stabiliseBy Ron BoussoLONDON, Dec 19 Large oil companies flush with cash are expected to seize on the recent collapse in oil prices to begin a shopping spree for smaller rivals, focusing on oil producers and explorers in Africa, Asia and the United States.With benchmark Brent crude prices nearly halving over the past six months to $60 a barrel, energy companies have also seen their share prices tumble and are already adjusting the value of their assets and cutting budgets.Repsol's move this week to buy Talisman Energy , Canada's fifth-largest independent oil producer, for $8.3 billion was seen as a harbinger of things to come.Though analysts said the Spanish company moved too early, a flurry of deals is expected to follow.""We believe the current environment will precipitate a wave of M&A activity in the European E&P (exploration and production) sector once the oil price stabilises and begins to firm,"" investment bank BMO Capital Markets said. Companies with strong in-house production in early stages at a relatively low break-even price of $20-$50 a barrel located in a region with low risk and enjoying backing from the local government are the most attractive targets, BMO said.Those include British oil and gas company BG Group, which produces oil and gas in regions including Brazil, East Africa and Australia. Other potential targets are Africa-focused explorers Tullow Oil and Ophir Energy as well as Kosmos Energy.Tullow and Ophir shares have dropped by about 50 percent since June, while BG Group and Kosmos shares have fallen by about 30 percent, against a 26 percent decline in the European 600 oil and gas index.SERVICES SWOOP  Oil services companies are also on buyers' radars.Halliburton Co has already swooped on U.S. peer Baker Hughes Inc in a $35 billion deal, but French seismic surveys company CGG remains a target for buyers after a failed acquisition attempt by Technip.Major national and international oil companies with strong cashflow and the need to expand their own production would benefit most from buying smaller explorers and specific services. Those include ExxonMobil and Indian and Chinese oil companies, BMO's Brendan Warn said. European oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell  have both said in recent weeks that the low oil price presents buying opportunities despite being in the midst of cost-cutting drives.Edmund Shing, portfolio manager at BCS Asset Management, said that the majors could boost profitability by combining operations, using money earmarked for upstream exploration to buy smaller E&P companies to acquire oil reserves on the cheap.Historically, periods of intensive M&A activity have come shortly after oil prices have gained ground following sharp declines, such as in 2008-09, BMO said.""Over the next 60 days or so we will start seeing companies announcing potential asset impairments, potential writedowns and maybe an inability to renegotiate large lines of credit,"" said Dale Nijoka, Ernst & Young's Global Oil and Gas Leader.""E&P independents in some of the emerging markets are going to have to deal with their cost, cashflow and debt issues. They will likely look to find larger companies with balance sheet flexibility to get into the projects with them and get the oil and gas into the market.""In the United States, shale oil producers will opt to shed assets as declining oil prices hit profitability. High-quality assets in the Baaken, Permian and Eagle Ford regions will be the most sought after, according to Bobby Tudor, chief executive of U.S investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.""Buyers can afford to be very picky,"" he said.

74,"  (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)By John KempLONDON Jan 26 The decline in oil drilling that has occurred so far across the United States is probably enough to ensure U.S. production peaks by April or May, though that might not be evident until June or July given delays in publishing production records.If the number of active rigs continues to decline in the next few weeks, which seems likely, it is reasonably likely U.S. oil production will be falling by June or July 2015.In North Dakota, the number of rigs drilling for oil has fallen by almost a quarter in less than four months, according to oil field services company Baker Hughes.Baker Hughes puts the number of active drilling rigs in the state at just 147 last week, down from 189 at the beginning of October, and the lowest number since December 2010.Baker Hughes counts rigs as active only when they are actually drilling - from the time the rig breaks ground and the well is spudded to the time the rig reaches target depth. The company excludes rigs in transit, moving in and rigging up, or engaged in non-drilling activities such as production testing.North Dakota's Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), which uses a slightly broader definition, puts the count higher at 157 but shows a similar decline over the last three months.Moreover, of the 157 rigs included in the department's active list, 27 are recorded working on projects that began in 2014; it remains unclear whether they will be deployed on new wells. Many rigs are being stacked. DMR records shows at least four of the 157 active rigs are due to be stacked once their current well is completed rather move to another job.Rigs are said to be ""cold stacked"" when they are released from contract or stopped and the crew is normally laid off. Warm stacking refers to taking a rig off the market temporarily, in the hope of obtaining a better rate in future, and basic operations and staffing are normally maintained (""And it begins - rig stacking"" Dec 11, 2014).Initially, some drillers appeared to believe that rigs could be warm stacked in the expectation of a quick rebound in prices and drilling activity. But as wellhead prices remain stuck below $50 per barrel, and in some cases below $40, more rigs are being cold stacked. The DMR estimates a fleet of 140-160 active rigs is needed to maintain output and replace declining production from existing wells. Current rig counts suggest North Dakota's oil production will soon stop growing. If rig counts decline much further, output will start to decline by the middle of the year.The same story is playing out across the two other big shale plays, Eagle Ford and Permian Basin, both in Texas.The total number of rigs drilling for oil in the Big Three shale plays dropped to 794 last week, down from 954 at the start of October, according to Baker Hughes.The Big Three shale plays account for around 60 percent of all the oil-directed rigs operating across the United States, but more than 95 percent of all the increase in U.S. oil production since 2009.So these are the plays which matter in terms of rebalancing the oil market, and there are signs the rebalancing is already well underway.

77,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON, N.D.  WILLISTON, N.D. Feb 4 Halliburton, Statoil ASA, Hess Corp and other North Dakota energy companies have decided, for now, not to lay off staff in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, hoping to be prepared for any prolonged rebound in crude prices.Many oil producers and their contractors are trying to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining workforce reserves after a more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices  since last June.The drop has made some oil patch investors anxious that North Dakota could experience a third oil bust after slumps in the 1950s and 1980s. Local business leaders, though, say they're confident the state's economy can abide the slowdown.Indeed, oil prices are nothing if not volatile, up about 19 percent in the past four trading days after plunging for months.Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest North Dakota oil producer, has no plans to lay off any of its 507 employees in the state, spokesman Eric Hagen said. Oilfield service provider Halliburton has told its roughly 1,500 North Dakota employees that job cuts are not coming, for now. The update came in a letter to staff from Brent Eslinger, senior district manager for Halliburton in Williston, considered capital of North Dakota's oil patch.Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael added that the company ""will continue to monitor the business environment"" and cut costs as needed.Hess Corp, the state's third-largest oil producer and one that uses Halliburton to hydraulically fracture wells, has no plans to cut North Dakota staff. ""We're all about lean efficiencies, but there are no plans for layoffs,"" Hess spokesman John Roper said.Other large North Dakota producers, including Oasis Petroleum Inc and Statoil, have said they have no plans to reduce their workforce. EOG Resources Inc hasn't ""announced any layoffs,"" spokeswoman K Leonard said. To be sure, all energy-related companies in North Dakota's oil patch are hunkering down. Many of the state's oil producers, including Hess and Oasis, have cut 2015 capital budgets. Whiting and EOG release spending plans later this month.While there are nearly 800 wells needing to be fracked in North Dakota, oil producers can wait up to a year to do so. Hess, for instance, plans to bring fewer wells online in 2015.Halliburton's announcement last month that it will lay off 1,000 in the eastern hemisphere - as well as similar plans by peers Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes Inc, which Halliburton is buying for roughly $35 billion - sparked concern that the companies would cull large portions of their North Dakota staffs, steps that would have a negative economic ripple effect. Such fears, for now, appear unwarranted.Continental Resources Inc, North Dakota's second-largest oil producer, did not return a call seeking comment on staffing levels. Chief Executive Harold Hamm, though, bragged in a Tuesday press release that Continental's North Dakota acreage continues ""to provide exceptional results.""

78,"  The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 83 this week to 1,140 - the lowest since December 2011 - a survey showed on Friday, a clear sign of the pressure that tumbling crude prices have put on oil producers.That was a ninth straight week of declines, oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc said in its widely followed report.Unlike last Friday, when U.S. oil futures jumped higher in the hour after the Baker Hughes report, ending up over 8 percent on the day, there was a more muted reaction this week with U.S. crude holding earlier gains of about 2 percent at $51.50 per barrel.The rig count is down 29 percent from its October peak, although many analysts expect further reductions as firms slash spending plans.""The count is continuing to fall in direct relation to exploration and production companies' reevaluation of the economics and capex budgets,"" said Kyle Cooper at IAF Advisors, a consultancy in Houston.The number of oil rigs has fallen in 14 of the last 17 weeks since hitting a record high of 1,609 in mid-October. ""The drop was consistent with the recent velocity of rig count declines and is about in line with our expectations,"" said James West, an analyst at Evercore ISI.Since June, global crude benchmarks have had a seven-month slump that slashed prices by nearly 60 percent on a combination of over supplied markets and lackluster demand.  Meanwhile, production has slipped slightly from record highs, falling 36,000 barrels per day to 9.2 million bpd last week, according to government data. Texas, the state with the most rigs, again lost the most this week, shedding 41 to 654, the lowest since 2010, Baker Hughes said. That is down from a reduction of 58 rigs last week.The shale play with the biggest losses was Permian in West Texas and New Mexico, the nation's biggest and fastest growing shale oil play. The Permian lost 37 oil rigs, the biggest weekly decline in data going back to 2011, to 413 rigs, the least since 2011.The count of horizontal rigs, which are most often used to extract oil from shale rock, fell for a 11th straight week, by 80, the biggest weekly loss in data going back to 1991, to 1,088, the least since September 2013.

81,"   By John Kemp | LONDON  LONDON “This is the really crappy part of the job, and this is what I hate about this industry frankly,” the chief executive of oilfield services company Baker Hughes complained as he announced it would lay off 7,000 employees.Baker Hughes is cutting jobs in response to slumping prices and a downturn in drilling activity. But the company's obviously frustrated chief acknowledged that ""this is the industry, and it’s throwing us another one of these downturns, and we’re going to be good stewards of our business and do the right thing.” So the company will cuts costs, he told investors in a conference call on January 20 to discuss the firm’s fourth-quarter earnings and outlook for 2015.More than 100,000 layoffs have been announced across the industry worldwide since prices began to slide last summer, according to a tally kept by Bloomberg.In recent weeks other major service companies have announced job reductions. Halliburton announced it will cut 6,400 jobs (8 percent of its global workforce) while Schlumberger will eliminate 9,000 positions (around 7 percent of its workforce).Precision Drilling, one of the largest rig contractors in North America, has idled more than 50 of the 250 rigs it had working this time last year, leaving more than 1,000 skilled operators out of work, the company said on Thursday.“Industry downturns are difficult for all, but they affect our rig crews more than anybody else,” the company’s chief executive said in a statement.“Precision recruited, trained and developed many excellent crews to support the demands of our customers over the past several years, and unfortunately we now don’t have work for many of these dedicated workers.”HUMAN CAPITAL Tens of thousands more jobs have been cut, through layoffs or retirements, across every part of the industry, ranging from self-employed drilling contractors and well-completion crews to full-service companies, seismic surveyors and of course the oil and gas producers themselves.Oil and gas production is an exceptionally capital-intensive industry. But the sector’s most important and scarce resource is its workforce. The oil industry’s popular image may be a roughneck in soiled overalls drinking in a strip joint, but it has an enormous demand for highly skilled and, during a boom, very well compensated workers. Modern oil and gas production is technically complicated and dangerous work. The days of drilling wildcat wells more or less at random and allowing the well to blow out in a massive gusher are long over.The industry still provides employment for unskilled casual labor. In boom times some of the jobs for truck drivers and other support staff can be exceptionally well paid.But at its core are tens of thousands of petroleum engineers and petroleum geoscientists, as well as tool pushers, drillers, derrickmen and roughnecks on the rigs themselves, who perform specialized functions which demand years of formal education and, most importantly, experience in the field.The challenge is recruiting, training and retaining these workers and maintaining an appropriate long-term labor force profile in an industry stuck with a profound boom-bust cycle and beset by periodic mass layoffs.THE GREAT CREW CHANGE Until recently, the oil industry was preoccupied by a looming shortage of skilled workers -- especially mid-career professionals ready to step into supervisory and senior leadership roles. Schlumberger’s consulting arm, which offers human resources planning advice to third parties, has warned repeatedly about “the looming talent shortage” as a result of what it termed “the great crew change”.Oil and gas companies have lots of experienced workers in their late 40s and 50s, and have recently succeeded in attracting more young graduates. But there is an acute shortage of mid-career professionals aged 35-45, with 10-20 years training and experience.The large number of professionals in their 50s poses a major problem as they reach the age for retirement, while recent graduates are still 10-15 years away from being ready to assume supervisory positions.The industry’s uneven age profile is the legacy of the last downturn during the late 1980s and through the 1990s, when low oil prices and the squeeze on profits resulted in enormous job losses and a virtual freeze on hiring.As a result, the cohort of workers recruited in the mid and late 1990s, who should be moving into supervisory and eventually leadership positions, is unusually small.Back in 2013, Schlumberger predicted the oil and gas industry would have a shortage of around 15,000 experienced petroleum engineers and geoscientists by 2016.The predicted shortfall of experienced petro-technical professionals (PTPs) would approach 20 percent of the total required number. The looming shortage was seen by many as the biggest single threat to increasing oil and gas supplies in the second half of the current decade and into the 2020s.GRADUATE RECRUITS Schlumberger forecast the industry would need to hire 10,000 new petro-technical professionals every year through 2020 to offset retirements and meet the need for expansion.The oil industry spent years working to encourage more college students to specialize in petroleum engineering and related disciplines.Petroleum engineering departments hired extra instructors and increased enrolments. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the number of students enrolled in petroleum engineering programs at U.S. universities increased from a recent low of just 561 in 1997 to 1,301 in 2011 (link.reuters.com/tux93w).Now, of course, the downturn has thrown thousands of oil and gas professionals out of work, and led to pay freezes and cuts in contracting rates.Amid all the headlines about layoffs, falling salaries and a potentially prolonged downturn in oil prices, the industry somehow has to avoid losing current graduates to other sectors and continue encouraging high school students that oil and gas engineering and science is an attractive long-term career.Because if the oil industry cannot maintain an adequate skill base, with the right age structure, skill shortages will re-emerge and set the stage for the next brutal boom-bust cycle.In practice, the industry has never succeeded in balancing long-term personnel planning with the short-term financial imperative to control the wage bill.It may not be any more successful this time around, if the slump in oil prices and drilling continues long enough.And that’s why the chief executive of Baker Hughes could say truthfully mass lay-offs are what he and everyone else “hates” most about the oil and gas industry.

82,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Sam Forgione | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 17 Top U.S. hedge fund management firms, including David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, reduced their stakes in Apple Inc  during the fourth quarter, ahead of the iPhone maker's strong rally in 2015, according to regulatory filings.Apple was a big winner in 2014, with its shares rising nearly 38 percent. The company's stock is up more than 16 percent year to date and reached an intraday record high of $129.45 per share. Last week, its stock market value rose above $700 billion, bigger than Switzerland's gross domestic product.Although Apple is the biggest position in Coatue Management's portfolio, the firm sold 1.7 million shares at the end of the quarter, or more than 15 percent of its stake, leaving it with 8.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.In a filing on Friday, Greenlight said it cut Apple holdings by 6.2 percent to 8.6 million shares during the quarter.Eric Mandelblatt's Soroban Capital Partners sold 4.3 million Apple call options, liquidating the fund's position. And David Tepper's Appaloosa Management hedge fund said it had dissolved its stake in Apple, while Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors sold 808,000 Apple shares to own 383,790 shares at the end of the fourth quarter.Last week, billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said the technology company's shares should be trading at $216 apiece, equivalent to a market capitalization of $1.26 trillion.The actions by Greenlight and Coatue were revealed in quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, known as 13F filings, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They are of great interest to investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward-looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm's stock holdings.The following are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited existing positions in the fourth quarter.ACTAVIS PLC Coatue Management opened a new position, buying 964,155 shares, as drugmaker Actavis won a high-stakes battle to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc.Daniel Loeb's Third Point upped its stake by 20 percent to 3.5 million shares. But Neil Chriss' Hutchin Hill cut its position by 13 percent, selling 17,201 shares to own 28.3 million at the end of the quarter.Omega Advisors upped its stake by 237,100 shares to own 943,572 shares.AGRIUM INC Activist investor ValueAct bought 2.9 million shares of the Canadian fertilizer producer to own 8.2 million at the end of the quarter. AMGEN INC The biotechnology company is being pressured by hedge fund investor Daniel Loeb to break itself apart.Alex Denner, who now runs Sarissa Capital after working for  Carl Icahn, upped his stake by 165 percent to 50.6 million shares.BAKER HUGHES INC Farallon Capital Management bought 3.5 million shares, a new position, of the oilfield services company, which will be bought by rival Halliburton Co.Activist fund ValueAct Capital took an even bigger new position, buying 14.9 million shares. ValueAct also took a 20.9 million-share stake in Halliburton.Omega Advisors took a new stake in Baker Hughes of 65,500 shares and sold its entire 1.9 million-share stake in Halliburton.BANK OF AMERICA CORP John Burbank's Passport Capital, which made money early this year by betting against energy exchange-traded funds, added a position in Bank of America, buying 2.8 million shares. CITIGROUP Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors cut its stake in the bank by 915,200 shares to 4.2 million shares.EBAY INC Jon Jacobson's Highfields Capital upped its stake in online commerce company eBay by 39 percent by adding 1.8 million shares to own 6.5 million at the quarter's end. Third Point bought 5.5 million shares to own 10 million shares, while Omega Advisors raised its stake by 375,200 shares to 3.5 million shares.FACEBOOK INC Tiger Consumer cut its holdings in the online social network operator by 28 percent to 854,980 shares. Aaron Cowen's Suvretta Capital bought 629,600 shares, putting on a new position. GENERAL MOTORS CO Caxton Associates made a new bet, buying 1.2 million shares of the automaker.LIBERTY GLOBAL PLC Coatue raised its stake in the European cable operator by 34 percent, purchasing 1.4 million shares to own 5.6 million shares. Tiger Consumer sold 527,956 shares, giving it 1.5 million shares.NETFLIX INC Coatue cut its position by 13 percent, selling 287,415 shares to own 1.8 million shares. Tiger Consumer, however, opened a new position in the provider of on-demand Internet  streaming services, buying 182,098 shares.TESLA MOTORS INC Highfields Capital took on a new position in the high-end electric car maker, buying 91,296 shares. Tesla shares fell late last year but climbed anew in early 2015.SUNEDISON INC Third Point nearly doubled its stake by buying 5 million shares to own 11.2 million. Omega Advisors increased its stake in the solar power company by 1.2 million shares to 9 million shares.YAHOO INC Passport Capital slashed its position by 81 percent, selling 6 million shares in the search engine company to own 1.4 million at the end of the quarter.ZOETIS INC The animal health company, which made headlines when activist investors William Ackman and Scott Ferguson bought big stakes, also saw new interest from other hedge funds.

February's 18 percent gain was the biggest monthly percentage rise since May 2009.U.S. crude rose $1.59 to settle at $49.76, managing a 3.1 percent February gain. Both Brent and U.S. futures briefly pared gains after Baker Hughes Inc data showed its U.S. oil drilling rig count fell only 33 to 986 this week.U.S. crude gains have been curbed by rising crude oil inventories in the United States, up 8.4 million barrels last week, according to government data.Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Feb. 24, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said Friday. Both contracts have been supported by signs that lower prices are starting to reduce investment in non-OPEC production, even as the U.S. rig count slide slows.Brent's more pronounced February gains have been fueled by disruptions to production and exports from Libya and Iraq.""The main event this week has been the widening of the spread between Brent and WTI (U.S. crude),"" said Ole Hansen, senior commodity strategist at Saxo Bank.The spread between Brent and U.S. crude CL-LCO1=R was as wide as $13 a barrel on Friday, the highest Brent premium since January 2014.

""In our view, today's strength is paper market tightness, unrelated to the physical market,"" Tim Evans, energy futures specialist in New York for Citi Futures said, referring to the general view that there was too much oil in the world.Brent's front-month May contract closed up 89 cents, or 4 percent, at $55.32 a barrel. It rose 1.2 percent on the week.U.S. crude for April settled up $1.76, or 1.6 percent, at $45.72. It gained 2 percent on the week. Brent's premium over U.S. crude CL-LCO1=R narrowed to below $9 a barrel from a high of nearly $11 the previous week. Technical analysts said the spread, one of the biggest volume trades in the oil market, could eventually blow out to above $30.The dollar was lower as a Federal Reserve statement on Wednesday fed the view that the U.S. central bank is in no hurry to raise interest rates.The euro was up more than 1 percent against the dollar as leaders of Greece and Germany struck a conciliatory note over efforts to keep Greece in the euro zone, although Athens was told to adhere to strict aid terms.Oil services firm Baker Hughes reported a new four-year low in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States. Still, this week's rig declines were smaller than drops in the past two weeks, and prices barely budged on the data.

92,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON, N.D., March 27  WILLISTON, N.D., March 27 The tech geeks are coming to the oil industry's rescue.With the price of crude  plumbing lows not seen since 2009, Royal Dutch Shell, Whiting Petroleum Corp and many others are turning to rocket fuel, Big Data, lasers, spectrometers and other new or revamped technologies to do more for less.As North America's oil companies slash spending and lay off workers, established services firms and start-ups are hawking products that better assess oil and gas deposits, help drill fewer but bigger new wells, and boost output from old ones.Baker Hughes Inc saw more client inquiries about products that increase efficiency of existing wells in the first three months this year than in all of the past two years, said HC Freitag, vice president of integrated technology at the oil service giant.""Since the beginning of the year, we've had a dramatically higher number of conversations with customers.""It is too early to judge whether the new tools can produce  gains similar to those of the past six years, when well output kept rising at double-digit rates and the time needed to drill and frack new wells dwindled to about 10 days from 40.But U.S. shale oil producers have a history of repeatedly exceeding expectations with their ability to innovate and lift productivity.Scott Johnson, a petroleum engineering professor at the University of North Dakota, says new technologies do have the potential to help the industry offset the impact of lost jobs and spending cuts.""Companies are often so busy when prices are high, they don't have an opportunity to take a look at new technology,"" said Johnson, who is leading a high-tech analysis of core samples taken from across the state's Bakken shale formation. ""That's why they want the engineers to think out of the box and take new opportunities especially when prices are low.""SILICON VALLEY MEETS NORTH DAKOTA To be sure, oil producers are only beginning to experiment with some of these newer solutions and tech firms that offer them are talking about rapid expansion, but from a low base. For example, privately held GroundMetrics Inc originally used its technology applying electromagnetic sensors to track fluid movements deep underground in geothermal wells and only late last year started marketing it for shale formations.The company, which grew out of U.S. Department of Defense research, has two shale customers now - BP and Statoil  - but expects that number to grow to 12 by the end of this year.GroundMetrics estimates that its cheaper and more efficient alternative to microseismic technology used now in energy exploration will allow oil firms to drill 10 percent fewer wells. That, executives say, could translate into over $20 billion in annual savings for the whole industry if widely applied.""Oil companies drill more wells than they need to,"" said George Eiskamp, the GroundMetrics chief executive. ""We can help reduce the number of wells that are fracked without reducing production, thus cutting costs.""WellDog Inc is another company that is adapting an existing technology for shale oil clients. The privately-held firm was founded to work with coalbed methane producers. It's now started to market its spectroscopy technology to shale clients to help distinguish between cheap reserves of methane and more-lucrative ethane, propane and butane reserves. The technology also helps gauge pressure in oil wells so they can be managed better. Since last year, WellDog has taken on seven U.S. shale companies as customers, including Whiting Petroleum, which operates in Texas, North Dakota and Colorado.WellDog, which said its sales doubled to $18.5 million last year, aims to double or even triple the number of customers this year, expanding at a time when most of the industry is scaling back.""We're hiring,"" said WellDog's executive vice president James Walker.Baker Hughes, which counts Shell as a key client, is heavily marketing well ""rejuvenations,"" using proprietary software and crunching Big Data from thousands of wells to find new ways to coax more oil from existing wells.In some cases, Baker Hughes has been able to double a declining well's output, Freitag said.In Houston, which doubles as the world's energy capital and home to the U.S. space program, there is also occasional crossover between aerospace and energy.Core Laboratories is reporting a surge in demand from the oil industry for its Kodiak Enhanced Perforating system, which uses cartridges filled with a substance used in solid-fuel rockets. Instead of propelling rockets into space, it is used to explode inside a well to help create fracks, says sales executive Mike Peveto.""Now that the price of oil is dropping, there's some people who want to squeeze as much oil as they can out of a well.""

95,"   By Shubhankar Chakravorty  Halliburton Co's (HAL.N) quarterly profit beat analyst expectations by the biggest margin in at least eight quarters as cost cuts helped the oilfield services provider offset a steep fall in drilling in North America, its biggest market.The company's shares rose as much as 4.4 percent to $48.93 on Monday.Revenue fell by 4 percent to $7.05 billion in the first quarter, but beat analysts' average expectation of $6.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, helped by strength in the Middle East and Asia and Latin America.However, revenue and operating profit from all other regions fell.North America, which accounted for more than half the company's first-quarter revenue, ""experienced an unprecedented decline in drilling activity,"" Chief Executive Dave Lesar said in a statement.The average U.S. rig count has fallen about 40 percent since June and was at 1,110 in March, according to a Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) survey. Halliburton also forecast a fall in current-quarter revenue from North America as a 45 percent fall in oil prices since June continues to force drillers to slash spending.The company also forecast a fall in revenue from Latin America, hurt mainly by the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar against the dollar.Halliburton, which has cut more than 9,000 jobs, or over 10 percent of its global headcount in last two quarters, said it would cut capital spending by $500 million, or about 15 percent, to $2.8 billion this year. Industry leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) reported a better-than-expected profit last week and said it was shedding about 15 percent of its workforce, or 20,000 jobs.Baker Hughes, which will report results on Tuesday, had forecast cutting 7,000 jobs to rein in costs.Halliburton agreed to buy Baker Hughes for $35 billion last November, a deal aimed at helping the companies weather the slump in oil and resist pressure from producers to slash prices. Halliburton said earlier this month that it would sell three businesses to help get regulatory clearance for the deal.The company is likely to make additional divestitures to ensure the deal goes through, Chief Integration Officer Mark McCollum said on Monday.Excluding $1.21 billion in charges related to asset writedowns and other items, Halliburton earned 49 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 37 cents.The company's shares were up 3.5 percent at $48.53 in morning trading.

The data came on the heels of a top government think tank's forecast that China's economic growth could slow further to 6.8 percent in the second quarter.""The Chinese data is weaker but it seems the oil market has had a limited reaction. What the market really wants to see is supply being cut to match the demand level,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets.Oil supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which produces about 40 percent of oil supplies, climbed 0.2 percent to a more than two-year high in April, a Reuters survey showed.Brent June crude futures rose 11 cents to $66.57 a barrel by 0711 GMT, after hitting a 2015 peak of $66.93 on April 30.

WTI hit its highest this year at $59.90 on May 1.Brent crude has recovered by more than 40 percent from its more than six-year low of $45.19 a barrel in January, as geopolitical tension in the Middle East, declining U.S. rig counts and a weaker dollar provided support.Both Brent and U.S. crudes posted their biggest monthly price rise in nearly six years in April. But the U.S. oil rig count is beginning to decline more slowly, after falling for a record 21 straight weeks to its lowest level since September 2010, in a possible sign that the collapse in drilling could be coming to an end.Shale oil drillers in the U.S. have begun moving rigs to more productive areas of the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in an attempt to increase productivity, analysts at Goldman Sachs said.The dollar index, which measures the US dollar's strength against a basket of currencies, held steady at around 95.28 on Monday, close to Friday's settlement, mirroring the  similarly calm oil markets.Morgan Stanley analysts said it viewed the greenback's pullback as a ""tactical correction"".

The number of rigs drilling for oil fell by 11 this week to 668 - the smallest drop since early April - after declining 24 and 31 in the prior two weeks, Baker Hughes said.With the oil rig decline this week, the number of active rigs has fallen to the fewest since September 2010, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1987. Since the number of oil rigs peaked at 1,609 in October, producers have reacted quickly to the steep drop in prices since the summer by cutting spending, eliminating jobs and idling more than half of the country's rigs.The U.S. oil rig count is nearing a pivotal level experts say is helping to bolster prices and trim production, and will eventually coax oil companies back to the well pad in coming months. Several oil drillers have said they would boost production this year if oil prices keep rising, including EOG Resources Inc , Concho Resources Inc and Devon Energy Corp.U.S. crude futures rose to over $62 a barrel this week, the highest this year, helped by a weaker dollar and bets a supply glut would ease as the falling rig count reduces oil output. That is a 48 percent rebound from the $42 six-year low set in March on oversupply concerns and lackluster demand.Texas, the state with the most rigs, lost one to 378, the least since 2009, but that was the smallest rig decline since November.

In a sign that the market was responding to those price gains, rigs for drilling oil in the voluminous Permian shale basin rose last week for the first time this year after months of cutbacks.Still, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects output from the fastest-growing U.S. shale plays to drop 71,000 barrels per day in June to 4.97 million bpd.""It's pretty choppy as people try to figure out a clearer supply-demand situation,"" said Gene McGillian, senior analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.While he was not a believer of the recent market runup, McGillian said there were no signs the rally was over and ""we could ultimately be setting ourselves up for an even sharper decline later"". U.S. crude futures settled down 14 cents at $59.25 a barrel.Brent crude futures, the more globally referenced benchmark for oil, fell 48 cents to end at $64.91.The dollar rebounded, weighing further on commodities such as oil that are priced in the currency. But the impact of the stronger dollar was cushioned somewhat by China's third rate cut in six months, which raised hopes the world's No. 1 energy consumer will absorb some of the excessive supplies.Last week, hedge funds and other big speculators raised bets for a seventh consecutive week that crude prices will rise, exchange data showed.But analysts raised concerns over a growing disconnect between the futures market, which has gained more than 40 percent since its January low, and a growing physical supply glut.Rising supplies, more activity on the shale side and potentially higher OPEC output were all weighing on the outlook for oil, analysts at Morgan Stanley said.""We have growing concerns about crude fundamentals in the second half of 2015 and 2016,"" the Wall Street bank said in a note to clients.Oil's recent rally also appeared technically exhausted, chartists said on Friday, noting that Brent's halted advance after it had hit 2015 highs last week.Investors will be looking at Wednesday's monthly report from the International Energy Agency to see if falling oil prices have boosted global demand for oil.

It was the 24th straight weekly decline, bringing the total down to 659, the lowest since August 2010.In the latest week, drillers added three oil rigs in the Niobrara basin in Wyoming and Colorado and two in the Eagle Ford  in South Texas, according to the closely followed report. That brought the total number of active rigs up to 22 in the Niobrara and 89 in the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford is the nation's second biggest shale oil field, while the Niobrara is the fourth largest.The Permian basin in western Texas and eastern New Mexico, the biggest and fastest growing U.S. shale oil play, lost one oil rig to 232, the lowest since at least 2011, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 2011. Three other shale formations also lost one rig each this week. The U.S. rig count will be a factor that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries looks at when it meets in Vienna on June 5. OPEC has kept production high in a bid to maintain market share. The group's largest producer, Saudi Arabia, boosted production to a record 10.3 million barrels per day in April.Analysts expect OPEC to maintain production levels. Goldman Sachs said a rise in U.S. oil production could send prices spiraling back down to $45 a barrel later this year. U.S. crude prices, which were higher than $107 a barrel last June, collapsed 60 percent to a six-year low near $42 in March.U.S. producers responded to the slide by slashing spending, eliminating thousands of jobs and idling more than half of the country's rigs. Still, efficiency gains and completion of previously drilled wells have kept U.S. oil production steady at near 9.4 million barrels per day since early March, its highest level since the early 1970s, according to government data.The number of U.S. oil rigs peaked at 1,609 in October.

Worries that fewer U.S. oil rigs were being idled after a broad rebound in crude prices since early April further weighed on sentiment.U.S. crude was down 95 cents at $59.77 a barrel by 11:45 a.m. EDT (1545 GMT). But for the week, it was expected to rise slightly, gaining for a 10th straight week.North Sea Brent oil, a more widely referenced benchmark, fell $1.10 to $65.44. Brent was headed for a 2 percent drop on the week. The dollar rose to a two-week high ahead of the holiday weekend after a U.S. inflation report indicated underlying price pressures that could prompt an interest rate hike later in the year.A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities less affordable to holders of the euro and other currencies.

109,"  * EIA sees flat production to 2019, then declines* Some analysts expect continued output growth* Number of rigs in Marcellus has dropped -Baker HughesBy Scott DiSavinoMay 28 Natural gas production in the Marcellus shale, which has grown over the past decade from next to nothing to the source of about a fifth of U.S. output, may decline for the first time if prices in the basin remain low for much longer, according to federal government data.Such a reduction may be worrisome since the United States is counting on the Marcellus to continue producing vast amounts of cheap gas needed to meet growing demand from industrial customers and power generators, and to enable the country to transition into a net gas exporter by 2017.The U.S. Energy Information Administration says production in the fast-growing field in Pennsylvania and West Virginia is set to remain flat for the next few years before beginning a very slow decline primarily because of depressed gas prices.Recent data supports signs of a slowdown. The number of rigs in the area has dwindled in recent months to its lowest since 2011, and drillers including Chesapeake Energy Corp and Cabot Oil & Gas Corp have temporarily shut in some production due to weak regional prices.Those low prices are threatening the basin with its first annual decline in output since producers started using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to develop the formation. But many private analysts say output from the Marcellus will continue to grow over the next several years as demand for gas increases and pipeline companies complete more projects to transport the fuel out of the region, boosting local prices that have fallen to their lowest in at least 14 years.""We see some slow growth in the Marcellus each year out to 2020"" because of new pipelines, said Keith Barnett, who heads fundamental analysis at Asset Risk Management LLC in Houston.The EIA expects output to remain flat through 2018 before declining about 1 percent a year from 2019 to 2025, according to its 2015 Annual Energy Outlook.""Relatively low gas prices, combined with low oil prices, have slowed drilling in the Marcellus so production from new wells is only offsetting the decline in old wells,"" said EIA lead upstream analyst Dana Van Wagener.The EIA forecast prices in parts of the Marcellus would remain below $2 through 2016 and not exceed $4 until 2020. ""Many of the non-core areas of the Marcellus need prices to be sustained near $5 or above to be economic to develop,"" Van Wagener said, noting that price level would probably not be realized until around 2025.WEAK PRICES The sheer size of the Marcellus makes its continued growth vital to the expected expansion of the U.S. gas market. The basin produces twice as much gas as the nation's second-biggest shale oil and gas play, the Eagle Ford in South Texas. But clearly the latest slump in prices is taking a toll.Prices this year at Dominion South E-DOMSP-IDX, an important Marcellus hub in southwestern Pennsylvania, have averaged $1.88 per million British thermal units on the IntercontinentalExchange, the lowest on record, according to Reuters data back to 2001.An inability to move all the gas out of the Marcellus region has depressed prices there compared with the Gulf Coast benchmark, the Henry Hub GT-HH-IDX in Louisiana, making it less attractive for local producers to drill more.Energy companies have cut the number of rigs in the Marcellus to 66 from 81 a year earlier, according to data from oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc.Production in the eastern United States, which includes the Marcellus and neighboring Utica shale in Ohio, was averaging 19.6 billion cubic feet per day so far in May, down from a record average high of 20 bcfd in December, according to data from Thomson Reuters Analytics.""Some production declines this year are maintenance-related and should come back quickly, while others are economic,"" said Charles Nevle, vice president of energy data provider PointLogic in Houston.But with reserves estimated at 64.9 trillion cubic feet - one-fifth of the U.S. total - there is little doubt that Marcellus will remain a workhorse.""We are seeing declines so far this year in Marcellus production, but don't believe this is going to last,"" Nevle said.

Oil drillers added rigs in Texas's Permian and three other U.S. shale basins, data showed on Friday, the strongest sign yet that higher crude prices are coaxing producers back to the well pad after a six-month slump in activity.     Overall, however, U.S. drillers reduced the number of active rigs by four this week, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc  said. It was the 26th straight weekly decline, bringing the total down to 642, the lowest since August 2010. Producers have shifted rigs to the most productive formations amid the price rout.     As widely expected, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday kept its 30 million barrel per day crude production target for its 12 members unchanged in an effort to defend the group's market share.      The market had been braced for the producer group's decision, which pairs with the slowly declining rig count in recent weeks to boost supply to a market that is already awash in oil.         In the latest week, drillers added one oil rig in the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the biggest and fastest growing U.S. shale oil basin. That brought the total there up to 232 active rigs, the same as two weeks ago.     With some OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia and Iraq pumping oil at record or near record levels, the group is trying to keep crude prices low enough to support global oil demand growth while retaining market share by driving out more expensive producers.     Since the number of oil rigs peaked at 1,609 in October, U.S. drillers have eliminated thousands of jobs and idled more than half of the country's active rigs as U.S. crude futures collapsed 60 percent from over $107 a barrel last June to a six-year low near $42 in March on oversupply concerns.     But U.S. energy companies, including EOG Resources Inc  and Pioneer Natural Resources Co, have started to return to the well pad as prices rebounded to over $60 earlier in May. Prices so far this week have averaged about $59 a barrel.

112,"   By Scott DiSavino  A slowdown in U.S. oil drilling trudged along in its seventh month as more rigs were pulled than in the previous week, denying the market a sign that producers have started ramping up production.Energy firms pulled another seven rigs from U.S. oil fields this week, the most since late May, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday in its closely followed report.That was the 27th straight weekly decline, bringing the total rig count down to 635, the lowest since August 2010.Drillers this week added a rig in just one basin, the Granite Wash located in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma.

Pulling crude futures off highs was the latest data on the U.S. oil rig count from Baker Hughes. The firm said the number of rigs drilling for oil rose by 12 this week, the first rise since December.Oil was lifted early when tame U.S. jobs and economic data signalled the Federal Reserve might be less hasty to raise interest rates and as a surge in gasoline futures drove expectations for more crude demand.But with the Greek debt crisis unresolved and Iran nuclear talks ongoing, coupled with Friday's Fourth of July holiday making for a longer-than-usual weekend, some caution prevailed, limiting the rally. ""The momentum for crude is being washed out by the rig count number showing the first rise this year, after the weaker-than-expected jobs report had pushed crude up on the expectation that maybe the Federal Reserve would delay raising interest rates,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.The dollar slipped against the euro after U.S. jobs growth slowed in June and factory orders fell in May, tempering expectations for a September interest rate hike. A softer dollar makes oil, denominated in the greenback, more affordable to users of the euro. Brent crude rose 6 cents to settle at $62.07 a barrel, after trading from $61.90 to $63.20. Prices turned lower in post-settlement trading. Brent fell 2.5 percent on Wednesday.U.S. crude dipped 3 cents to settle at $56.93, trading from $56.65 to $57.95. It tumbled 4 percent in the previous session, the most since April, after a surprise inventory build last week.RBOB gasoline futures settled 1.3 percent higher ahead of expected holiday demand in the United States. Ultra-low sulfur diesel managed a slight gain at settlement, but turned lower in post-settlement trading.Refining margins, or cracks, for both gasoline and diesel rose too, pulling along crude prices on expectations of more U.S. summer driving demand.""RBOB is very strong this morning. Brent and WTI are going for the ride,"" said Scott Shelton, a commodities specialist in Durham, North Carolina, for broker ICAP.

Experts had expected the rig count to bottom out soon and then rise later in the year.""We believe about 100 rigs could be added to the U.S. rig count between now and year-end,"" analysts at Evercore ISI, a banking advisory firm, said in a report this week, noting ""The bottom is passing and the upturn is arriving."" U.S. crude futures pared Thursday's gains by about 50 cents after Baker Hughes released the rig count, leaving the contract up about 0.3 percent on the day.That followed a $2.50 loss on Wednesday due to an unexpected build in U.S. crude stocks that added to the global supply glut. For the past two months since the start of May, prices have averaged around $60 a barrel.Keeping prices near $60 is important because that is the price at which many U.S. drillers said they would return to the well pad. ""We believe that should (U.S. crude) prices remain near $60 a barrel, U.S. producers will ramp up activity given improved returns with costs down nearly 30 percent,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs, a bank, said in a report.Last year, U.S. crude prices fell from around $107 in June 2014 to near $42 in March on oversupply concerns as producers in the United States, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and elsewhere pulled near record amounts of oil out of the ground despite lackluster world demand.In response to that 60 percent price collapse, U.S. drillers eliminated thousands of jobs and idled more than half of the record high 1,609 oil rigs that were active in October.Despite the cuts, U.S. crude production averaged 9.6 million barrels per day, its highest level since the early 1970s, for a sixth week in a row, according to government data.

The company said in April that it would sell three of its drilling businesses. The cash-and-stock deal, announced in November, will create an oilfield services provider with higher revenue than market leader Schlumberger NV (SLB.N).The review date has been extended to the later of Nov. 25 or 90 days after Halliburton and Baker Hughes achieve ""substantial compliance"" with the department's second request, they said.  The transaction, which was expected to close in the second half, is now expected to close by Dec. 1. Halliburton shares closed at $41.33 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Baker Hughes shares ended at $59.71.

127,"  (Adds basin details)By Scott DiSavinoJuly 10 U.S. energy firms added five oil rigs this week, the second week of increases in a row, despite a 19 percent collapse in U.S. crude prices from a recent high, data showed on Friday, a sign drillers were ready to return to the well pad.The gains came after 29 consecutive weeks of declines, bringing the total rig count up to 645, the most since late May, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report.Drillers added oil rigs in two of the four major U.S. shale oil basins - eight rigs in the Permian in West Texas and eastern New Mexico and one in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming - and cut five rigs each in the other two basins - the Eagle Ford in South Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana. U.S. crude oil futures were close to entering a bear market earlier this week when prices fell to as low as $50.58 a barrel from a recent high over $62 in early May.Analysts said prices this week collapsed in part due to oversupply concerns with U.S. energy firms starting to drill again, a falling Chinese stock market, failing talks between Greece and its euro zone creditors, and worries over the status of negotiations between Iran and world nuclear powers. On Friday, crude futures traded between $52 and $54 a barrel in see-saw trade as the market reacted to news of a stock exchange rally in China, new proposals by the Greek government to end the stand-off with European creditors, and as talks with Iran missed another deadline.Those bullish market events were offset on Friday by the International Energy Agency's bearish call that the market bottom may still be ahead for oil as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the United States and others continue producing crude at near record levels despite lackluster world demand. U.S. crude futures fell 60 percent from over $107 in June 2014 to near $42 in March due to those same oversupply worries and uninspiring demand growth.In response to that price collapse, U.S. drillers eliminated thousands of jobs and idled 60 percent of the record high 1,609 oil rigs active in October.Despite the cuts, U.S. crude production has averaged 9.6 million barrels per day for a seventh consecutive week, its highest level since the early 1970s, according to government data.

131,"   By Jarrett Renshaw  The resurgence in drilling seen earlier this month seemed to fizzle this week as U.S. energy firms cut seven oil rigs, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc data showed on Friday.The decline came as U.S. crude oil prices have fallen nearly 15 percent this month in the biggest slump since December.That was the 30th weekly oil rig decline in the past 31 weeks, bringing the total down to 638, the lowest since the last week in June, said Baker Hughes in its closely followed report.""The rig count is a bullish element and might help keep U.S. crude above $50 (a barrel) and we might see some short covering rallies,"" said Dan Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.U.S. crude futures briefly turned higher after the report then fell back to $50.47 a barrel, down 44 cents on the day, at 1:22 p.m. EDT. Brent crude was down 14 cents at $56.78, having held its small gains after the report, then retreating and seesawing near unchanged. U.S. crude futures continued to decline this week, falling about 4.2 percent as prices continued to recede from a recent high over $62 in early May.Production declines in the largest U.S. shale plays were set to deepen in August, the Energy Information Administration said earlier this week in its drilling productivity report. While the EIA expected declines from the Bakken and Eagle Ford, it forecast production growth from the Permian month-on-month of some 5,000 barrels per day.This week, drilling in the Eagle Ford fell by four rigs, the Bakken cut two rigs and the Permian Basin added two rigs, Baker Hughes reported. The drop in rig counts comes as Iran has started to ship oil to Asia that it had been storing offshore for months after Tehran and other world powers reached an agreement about the nation’s nuclear program, clearing the way for an easing of international sanctions. There is a sense that the declines in rigs have bottomed out and that companies will return to the oil patch.

134,"  (Adds comments on Halliburton and Baker Hughes merger)July 17 Schlumberger Ltd, the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider, expects little improvement in pricing levels in the near future as customers continue to keep a tight lid on budgets, it said on a conference call on Friday.The company on Thursday reported a quarterly profit well ahead of expectations as it managed to cut cost of revenue by more than a fifth, softening  the impact of reduced global drilling activity.Schlumberger, which provides drilling technology and equipment to oil and gas companies, expects exploration and production investment in North America to fall by more than 35 percent versus its forecast, in April, of a 30 percent drop.Here is a selection of comments from chief executive Paal Kibsgaard from Friday's conference call:""The dramatic reduction in activity in US land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels, in particular for pressure pumping."" ""There's going to be a further impact of pricing in the second half of the year. We haven't seen the full impact of that.""""There will be little to no improvement in pricing levels in North America and hence the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future.""""On the supply side of the oil market, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high cost producers is still playing out with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show."" ""We do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016, both for exploration and development related activity.""""We are prepared to carry slightly more cost into Q3 and this is not a significant part. Now, I can't say 100 percent certain that (growth is) going to come in Q4 or Q1, but what we're saying is that we believe we are getting close to bottom."" On offshore projects: ""Going forward in terms of sanctioning new projects, I think it's going to be very important for the industry to be able to ... come up with technical solutions and field development plans that significantly reduces cost per barrel.""""We have fully exited Iran. When the sanctions are lifted and when it is permissible, we will evaluate going back in.""On Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc  merger: ""It's a bit difficult for me to say what the impact is.

135,"   By Robert Gibbons | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil futures fell on Monday and U.S. crude slipped below $50 a barrel intraday as ample supply, the prospect of more Iranian crude for export and a strengthening dollar combined to pressure prices.U.S. refined-products futures also oscillated. An increasing supply of refined products, especially diesel fuel being offered by Saudi Arabia, helped push U.S. ultra-low diesel futures to multi-month lows intraday, adding to bearish concerns about prices in the oil futures complex.Brent September crude fell 45 cents to settle at $56.65 a barrel, having traded between $56.33 and $57.44.U.S. August crude, set to expire on Tuesday, fell 74 cents to settle at $50.15, having fallen to $49.85, its first time below $50 since April.""The dollar moved up again and the market focus is back on supply and the prospect for more Iranian exports after last week's agreement with the West over Iran's nuclear program,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. The seesawing dollar rose early to three-month highs on expectations of rising U.S. interest rates, sending gold prices to their lowest in five years and helping pressure copper prices to near two-week lows. A stronger dollar makes crude more expensive for investors using other currencies and rising U.S. interest rates are expected to curb liquidity, possibly adding to price pressures on crude oil.Limiting crude futures' losses were a drop in Saudi crude exports in May and last week's industry data showing a lower U.S. oil rig count.  U.S. drillers cut seven oil rigs last week following two weeks of increases, a report by oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday.However, as refineries around the world operate at near-maximum levels to benefit from strong profit margins, there are signs a glut in the crude oil market may be expanding to refined products.    ""The big fall in U.S. rig counts since last September has not had a negative impact on domestic production and the reduction in Saudi crude oil exports is due to domestic refinery demand as the kingdom is turning into a significant product exporter,"" analysts at PVM wrote.Refined product inventories at Europe's Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage hub rose to a record last week. Strong increases in refinery operations in recent months are set to slow in the second half of this year, reducing demand for crude oil, Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said.

Market leader Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes have touted refracking, the practice of fracking existing wells, as means for oil producers to save money.

The rig count data arrived a day after U.S. crude fell into bear market territory, as a drop of 21 percent from its June 10 close at $61.43 a barrel indicated the market's prevailing negative sentiment.China's factory sector contracted in July by the most in 15 months, a preliminary private survey showed. The weaker-than-expected result followed a stock market slide that began in June.Brent September crude fell 65 cents to settle at $54.62 a barrel, the lowest close since March 19 and off 4.3 percent for the week. The $54.30 session low was the lowest front-month price since April 2.U.S. September crude fell 31 cents to end at $48.14, its lowest settlement since March 31 and down 5.5 percent for the week. The session low of $47.72 was the lowest intraday price since April 1. ""Crude was already lower on concerns about the global economy and the rig count added to the negativity,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.The world's top oil companies are set to report second-quarter earnings showing another drop in profits that could force more spending cuts, according to analysts.The dollar's strength also applied pressure, as a stronger U.S. dollar makes greenback-denominated oil more expensive for consumers using other currencies. Brent and U.S. crude have so far clocked double-digit losses in July. With U.S. crude off 19 percent, it could challenge December's 19.4 percent drop, which was the biggest monthly slump since the financial crisis in 2008.Money managers cut their net long futures and options positions in the week to July 21, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.Demand for gasoline has been strong, keeping refineries churning at high utilization rates, but August U.S. RBOB gasoline futures settled below its 200-day moving average of $1.8514 a gallon on Friday.""This looks like profit-taking as the end of the U.S. driving season gets closer,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.The 5 percent weekly drop was gasoline's biggest since mid-March and the sixth consecutive weekly slide, most since the seven weeks ending Jan. 9.U.S. ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) futures also fell a sixth straight week.

The rig increase shows that energy firms have followed up on their plans to drill more when U.S. crude prices were averaging $60 a barrel in May and June.U.S. crude oil futures this week, however, entered a bear market with prices down to about $48 a barrel from a recent high over $61 in late June.

150,"   By Barani Krishnan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Crude oil futures hit four-month lows on Monday after a steep drop in China's stock markets sparked concern about the economic health of the world's biggest energy consumer, while evidence of a growing crude glut mounted.Oil was also pressured by a sharp increase in U.S. drilling activity with data on Friday showing producers added 21 rigs last week, the most in over a year, suggesting a ramp up in output as crude futures recovered from six-year lows seen in the first quarter.        A weaker dollar .DXY on Monday cushioned some of oil's losses as crude and other commodities denominated in the greenback saw higher demand from users of the euro EUR=. [FRX/]    Chinese stocks tumbled more than 8 percent in Asian trading, the biggest one-day drop in eight years, driving European equities markets to a two-week low.Brent crude oil LCOc1 settled down $1.15, or 2 percent, at $53.47 a barrel. In post-settlement, it fell to as low as $52.90, its lowest since mid-March. U.S. crude CLc1 closed down 75 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $47.39. It fell below $47 post-settlement, the lowest since late March.""The combination of the Chinese stock market rout and creeping crude glut is weighing on oil,"" said Carl Larry, director of business Development for oil and gas at Frost & Sullivan.""That said, Brent's still seeing support above $50 and U.S. crude is staying above $45. There's a lot of hedging going on at those levels."" Technical analysts, however, said U.S. crude could lose another $15 or more, falling below the lows of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, if the dollar started rallying again on talk of a U.S. rate hike while the oversupply in oil persists.Major oil producers in the Middle East Gulf, competing for market share, were pumping 2-3 percent more than needed, analysts say. Exports from Iraq's southern oilfields were on track for a  monthly record, having topped 3 million barrels per day so far this month.Hedge funds and other money managers slashed their net long positions in Brent for the first time in four weeks in the week to July 21, data showed.""In the next couple of months, even if the global oversupply and seasonal weakness are becoming priced in, it is difficult to see where any price uplift will come from,"" said Societe Generale oil analyst Michael Wittner.

151,"  Job cuts at oilfield service providers Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) have turned out to be steeper than expected as crude prices hold below $50 levels, a 40 percent drop from June last year.Halliburton Co (HAL.N), which is buying Baker Hughes in a $35 billion deal, is slashing 14,000 jobs. Baker Hughes plans to cut about 13,000 jobs worldwide.Halliburton said in April it would cut 9,000 jobs, while Baker Hughes said it planned to reduce 10,500 jobs.Demand for oilfield services has been hit as oil producers have trimmed their budgets and lowered the number of rigs they planned to deploy this year.Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, said earlier in July that the company expects little improvement in pricing levels in the near future.  Houston-based Schlumberger said in April that it would cut 11,000 jobs, bringing the total job cuts announced this year to 20,000, or about 15 percent of its workforce.Oil producers have also cut thousands of jobs.  Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) said on July 30 it would cut 6,500 jobs this year, or about 7 percent of its global workforce.Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on July 28 it would lay off 1,500 employees, or about 2 percent of its global workforce.

Heavy hedging activity in gasoline and diesel  futures ahead of front-month contract expiration dominated play on the petroleum complex, diverting some attention from crude.Oil prices fell for a fifth straight week.U.S. crude settled down $1.40, or almost 3 percent, at $47.32 a barrel. It slid more than 2 percent on the week.

It lost 5 percent on the week and 18 percent on the month.The sell-off continued in post-settlement, with both U.S. crude and Brent down more than 3 percent.July's oil-price drop was spurred by a stock market tumble in top energy consumer China and growing global oversupply. A Reuters survey on Friday showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which includes Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East producers, pumped over 32 million barrels per day in July, up 140,000 bpd from June.Commerzbank's head of commodities research Eugen Weinberg said OPEC had to cut production to avoid even lower prices, expressing hope for ""a stricter quota discipline at its December meeting"".Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note Brent could be at a discount to the benchmark U.S. light crude, West Texas Intermediate, by spring next year, if U.S. gasoline demand remained on a tear. Brent is now at nearly a $5 premium to WTI.""The European refining system is not geared towards gasoline and neither are medium sour barrels,"" it said.

157,"   By John Kemp | LONDON  LONDON The biggest losers from the current price war between OPEC and the shale producers seem set to be producers outside the Middle East and North America caught in the cross-fire.Expensive production from the North Sea, Canada’s oil sands, offshore megaprojects, weaker African and Latin American members of OPEC, and frontier exploration areas around the world are all being squeezed hard by the price slump.According to oilfield services company Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil outside North America has fallen by over 200, or about 19 percent, since July 2014 (link.reuters.com/ser35w).Rig counts have fallen in every region, with 28 fewer active rigs in Europe, 47 fewer in the Middle East, 33 in Africa, 66 in Latin America and 34 in Asia Pacific.Proportionately, the hardest hit regions have been Europe and Africa, where more than 30 percent of rigs operating in the middle of last year have since been idled.But the slowdown is broad-based, with big downturns in countries as far apart as Mexico, India, Turkey, Brazil, Iraq, Colombia and Ecuador.Major drilling contractors including Transocean, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have all reported a sharp drop in international business.Schlumberger told investors in July it expects exploration and production spending outside North America to fall by 15 percent in 2015.The company’s second-quarter revenues fell 5 percent compared with the first three months of the year as a result of customer budget cuts and the need to reduce contract prices to retain business. With major international oil companies including Chevron and Shell announcing further cuts in their capital budgets, the downturn will persist throughout the rest of 2015 and likely well into 2016.“Looking ahead to the second half of 2015, we expect ... unfavorable market dynamics to persist,” Baker Hughes warned its shareholders last month.“In North America, we don’t anticipate activity to increase while commodity prices remain depressed ... Internationally, rig counts are projected to continue to decline led by many onshore and shallow water markets,” the company admitted.NON-OPEC, NON-SHALE  Slumping oil prices and a fight for market share are often portrayed as a straight fight between OPEC (especially Saudi Arabia and its close allies in the Gulf) and the North American shale drillers.But the biggest losers, who will bear much of the adjustment to a new market balance, are likely to come from the rest of the world.Shale has been disruptive precisely because it has emerged in the middle of the cost curve, more expensive than giant fields in the Gulf, but cheaper than megaprojects, and directly competing with the North Sea and Canada.Production from the mature shale plays of North Dakota and Texas is also more predictable and lower risk than some frontier exploration areas and aging provinces like the North Sea.Market rebalancing is therefore likely to leave both the Middle East Gulf producers and North American shale drillers with unchanged or even enhanced market shares. Production slowdowns will have to come elsewhere, where risk-adjusted returns are poorer and investment requirements are higher.The process appears to be well underway. The International Energy Agency predicts non-OPEC oil supply will be flat in 2016, after growing 2.4 million bpd in 2014 and 1.0 million bpd in 2015.Most of the initial slowdown will come from a plateauing of shale production after huge gains of more than 1 million bpd in both 2013 and 2014.But in the medium term, non-OPEC non-shale output looks set to be squeezed hard by the investment downturn. With international marker Brent back down to just $50 per barrel, from over $100 at this point last year, many non-shale, non-Gulf projects are under even greater threat than before.Saudi Arabia appears to be calculating low prices will encourage enough demand growth while restraining non-OPEC non-shale production, enabling the market to absorb resumed Iranian exports in 2016 without having to cut Saudi Arabia’s own production.That’s a high-risk strategy, but the downturn in international drilling and sharp cuts in exploration and production budgets suggest it might just pay off.

A higher U.S. oil rig count for a second straight week added to the market's downside Friday despite a weaker dollar, which would normally support commodities.Heavy hedging activity in gasoline and diesel  futures ahead of front-month contract expiration dominated play on the petroleum complex, diverting some attention from crude.Oil prices fell for a fifth straight week.U.S. crude settled down $1.40, or almost 3 percent, at $47.12 a barrel. It slid more than 2 percent on the week. Through July, U.S. crude was down 21 percent, its largest monthly decline since October 2008, when oil had an epic collapse at the outbreak of the financial crisis.Brent settled down $1.10, or 2 percent, at $52.21 a barrel. It lost 5 percent on the week and 18 percent on the month.The sell-off continued in post-settlement, with both U.S. crude and Brent down more than 3 percent. July's oil-price drop was spurred by a stock market tumble in top energy consumer China and growing global oversupply.A Reuters survey on Friday showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which includes Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East producers, pumped over 32 million barrels per day in July, up 140,000 bpd from June.Commerzbank's head of commodities research Eugen Weinberg said OPEC had to cut production to avoid even lower prices, expressing hope for ""a stricter quota discipline at its December meeting"".Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note Brent could be at a discount to the benchmark U.S. light crude, West Texas Intermediate, by spring next year, if U.S. gasoline demand remained on a tear. Brent is now at nearly a $5 premium to WTI.""The European refining system is not geared towards gasoline and neither are medium sour barrels,"" it said. ""As such, WTI may have to temporarily trade above Brent and Dubai next spring to ensure there is enough gasoline to go around.""Industry firm Baker Hughes, meanwhile, said U.S. drillers added five oil rigs this week on top of 21 last week.Higher rig counts worry the market as they indicate more output.

""Producers don't seem to want to blink,"" said Gene McGillian, senior analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, commenting on the North Dakota data.Producers in the United States added two oil rigs this week, a fourth straight week with additions, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said.U.S. crude bounced early off a fresh 2015 low and then received a lift from data showing U.S. producer prices rose for a third straight month in July.U.S. September crude settled at $42.50 a barrel, up 27 cents, and continued to seesaw in post-settlement trade. It reached $42.96 after falling to $41.35, the lowest front-month price since March 2009, and finished off more than 3 percent for the week. Expiring Brent September crude fell 19 cents to settle at $49.03, but gained nearly 1 percent for the week, snapping a string of six weekly losses. Brent prices are well above the 2015 low of $45.19 from January, despite its recent slide.Brent October crude also fell.Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Aug. 11 to the lowest level since 2010, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said. U.S. crude futures were pressured this week as refinery outages dampened demand and bulging inventories amplified concerns about a global supply glut.The largest of the affected refineries, BP's  413,500-barrels-per-day (bpd) Whiting, Indiana, facility shut two-thirds of its capacity for repairs that could last a month or more.Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said he did not expect an accelerated drop in prices, but rather ""a slow grind lower"" as long as the Whiting refinery was out of service.The U.S. refinery problems come as the seasonal autumn refinery maintenance approaches at the end of the summer driving season.Brent felt pressure from weak economic growth data from Europe and both crude contracts have been weighed down by concerns about No. 2 oil consumer China's sputtering growth.Goldman Sachs said a weaker Chinese currency was putting downward pressure on all commodity markets, signalling a turn for the worse for global economic conditions.

166,"   By Natalie Harrison  NEW YORK, Aug 14 (IFR) - The US high-grade bond market has kept up a blistering pace of issuance this year, but the abundant supply has pushed spreads wider - and now bankers are putting the brakes on supply.Heightened volatility this week forced issuers to cram the week's US$25bn of supply into just two days, and market participants now expect just US$5bn-$10bn more for the month.That would mean an August tally of around US$50bn - well shy of the US$65bn-$75bn that had been expected, meaning August could be the first month in quite a while that falls short of expected volumes.""The biggest challenge for high-grade corporates has been supply,"" Rick Rezek, a senior portfolio manager at Schroders, told IFR.""New issuance activity has been exceptionally heavy, and the market has had to reprice spreads wider to clear the supply.""According to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, high-grade bond spreads hit their widest average in more than two years this week at 164bp over Treasuries.Yields on the 10-year Treasury were back above 2.2% on Friday, and borrowers that did brave the primary market this week had to pay elevated concessions.""The new issues performed well, but arguably that's because they left a lot on the table,"" said one syndicate banker. ""Investors definitely want more juice. Concessions are now closer to 15bp, whereas they had been dipping back to high single digits the week before last.""WARNING SIGN? Yet bankers point out that there is still a significant build-up of deals waiting to get done, many of them centering around M&A activity. One put the M&A pipeline alone at about US$100bn, noting the deals that still need to be financed include Teva Pharmaceutical's acquisition of Allergan's pharma business and Halliburton's purchase of Baker Hughes.In the current climate, the cost of financing them is likely to become significantly more expensive - especially as the Fed readies a rates hike.""Valuations are reasonably attractive, but if supply continues to be heavy, spreads could go even wider,"" said Rezek.And investors clearly believe that high-grade bonds have lost some of their lustre. Outflows from the investment-grade asset class picked up last week to US$1.848bn, according to Lipper - the biggest outflow in a week since June 2013.""The key reason for this weakness is that our market has transitioned from too much money chasing too few bonds to too many bonds chasing too little money,"" Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a client note on Friday.""That shift is motivated by the impending Fed rate hiking cycle as issuance, M&A and other shareholder-friendly activity has been accelerated, while at the same time demand has declined.""He said the credit market was pricing in risks that the equity market hasn't caught up on yet, and noted that there is currently 10.26bp of credit spread per point of equity volatility.That is the highest level since the financial crisis, Mikkelsen said, and was last seen on March 6, 2008, ten days before Bear Stearns was forced to sell itself to JP Morgan for $2 per share.""Recall that - unlike the credit market - the equity market well into 2008 was very complacent about the subprime crisis that led to a full blown financial crisis,"" he said.""While we are not predicting another financial crisis, it is important to keep highlighting to investors across asset classes that conditions in the high grade credit market are currently very unusual.""

167,"  (Adds rig count by basin in paragraph 6)By Scott DiSavinoAug 14 U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a fourth straight week, according to data that highlights how a period of stable prices earlier this summer lulled some drillers into stepping up spending just before a second oil market slump.Reflecting plans announced in May and June, when U.S. crude futures averaged $60 a barrel, drillers added two oil rigs in the week ended Aug. 14, bringing the total count up to 672, the highest since early May, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report. They may now regret those moves as U.S. crude has tumbled nearly $20 a barrel to reach a new 6-1/2-year low under $42, prompting a new round of spending and job cuts across the beleaguered global oil industry.Many forecasters including Australian bank Macquarie expect the rig count to resume drifting lower through the second half of the year as weaker prices bite. While the number of rigs is still 58 percent lower than it was at its peak last October, the slight rebound over the past month suggests U.S. oil production may be slightly higher than earlier expected, although the effect will take time to see. It can take up to six months for a new well to begin pumping crude.Drillers added oil rigs in two of the four major U.S. shale oil basins, with five in the Eagle Ford in South Texas and one in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming. They removed two rigs in the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana, while the number of rigs in the Permian in West Texas and eastern New Mexico held steady. U.S. crude oil prices were on track for a seventh straight weekly loss, the longest losing steak since January, on continued oversupply worries from mostly U.S. and OPEC producers and slumping demand from China and much of the rest of the world.The last time oil prices collapsed, from around $107 a barrel in June 2014 to under $44 in January, energy firms slashed spending, cut thousands of jobs and idled around 60 percent of the record high 1,609 oil rigs that were active in October.Production has started to show signs of decline. U.S. crude output dipped to 9.4 million barrels per day last week from 9.5 million bpd in the prior week, according to government data. That is down from average production from mid May to late June of 9.6 million bpd, the most since the early 1970s.

Many forecasters including Australian bank Macquarie expect the rig count to resume drifting lower through the second half of the year as weaker prices bite.While the number of rigs is still 58 percent lower than it was at its peak last October, the slight rebound over the past month suggests U.S. oil production may be slightly higher than earlier expected, although the effect will take time to see. It can take up to six months for a new well to begin pumping crude. ""Recent rig additions were most likely based on decisions taken when (U.S. crude prices) rallied in May-June, and more importantly when Calendar 2016 and 2017 pricing allowed for hedging at $65 a barrel,"" analysts at CIBC, a bank, said in a note this week, noting a number of producers have indicated that $65 is level where they would consider adding rigs.""Both the spot price and hedging opportunity are long gone now though which makes us question the longevity of rig additions,"" CIBC said. U.S. crude oil prices were on track for a seventh straight weekly loss, the longest losing steak since January, on continued oversupply worries from mostly U.S. and OPEC producers and slumping demand from China and much of the rest of the world.The last time oil prices collapsed, from around $107 a barrel in June 2014 to under $44 in January, energy firms slashed spending, cut thousands of jobs and idled around 60 percent of the record high 1,609 oil rigs that were active in October.Production has started to show signs of decline. U.S. crude output dipped to 9.4 million barrels per day last week from 9.5 million bpd in the prior week, according to government data. That is down from average production from mid May to late June of 9.6 million bpd, the most since the early 1970s.

Crude futures posted stronger gains for the week. Optimism in recent days about lower stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for U.S. crude overshadowed data on inventory builds in U.S. gasoline.Still, some traders and analysts expressed doubt that oil would continue trading higher in the coming weeks due to mixed outlooks for supply and demand and for the global economy.""I'm predicting a return to the low $40 levels or even below by next month,"" said Tariq Zahir, a trader in crude oil spreads at Tyche Advisors in Laurel Hollow, New York. ""As U.S. refinery maintenance kicks into full gear, we're going to start seeing inventory builds instead of draws,"" Zahir said.Brent, the global benchmark for oil, settled up 43 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $48.60 a barrel. It rose almost $1 at the session high, riding the coattails of the U.S. equities rally, then turned negative for a good part of the day before rebounding.U.S. crude settled up 79 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $45.70. For the week, both Brent and U.S. crude were up about 2 percent.The latest weekly reading on the U.S. oil rig count from industry firm Baker Hughes showed a drop of four, the smallest decline in four weeks. A lower rig count is usually a bullish signal for oil as it suggests lower production in the future.""We've had these rig declines for a while,"" said Jamie Brunn, managing director at Forecast Trading Group in Suffern, New York. ""They've only been mildly supportive to the market, and the impact gets smaller as the number dwindles.""Oil prices have swung wildly over the past month, moving as much as 8 percent in either direction, as signs of record pumping by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries offset expectations for lower U.S. production.A weakening economy in China, the engine of commodities demand for more than a decade, also curbed bullish sentiment from steady U.S. growth and the rebound in Wall Street stocks. Adding to trader caution are concerns that U.S. interest rates are set to rise by year-end.

Over the past eight weeks, drillers cut a total of 81 rigs, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc  said in its closely followed report.The reduction this week was the lowest since drillers started cutting rigs at the start of September after adding 47 rigs over the summer. Drillers decided to add the rigs over the summer during the spring when crude prices averaged $60 a barrel in May and June. U.S. oil futures this week however have lost over 5 percent to average $45 a barrel, sliding for a second straight week, on continuing oversupply concerns even as China's latest interest rate cut raised hopes for stronger demand from the world's top energy consumer.The total count this week is less than half the 1,595 oil rigs in the same week a year ago. Since hitting an all-time high of 1,609 in October 2014, weekly rig count reductions have averaged 19. With natural gas rigs up one to 193 this week, the total oil and gas rig count held at a 13-year low, according to Baker Hughes. The rig count is one of several indicators traders look at in trying to figure out whether production will rise or fall over the next several months. Other factors include how fast energy firms complete previously drilled but unfinished wells and rising well efficiency and productivity.Despite the overall decline in oil rigs, drillers added rigs in two of the four major U.S. shale oil basins this week. They added three in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming and one in the Eagle Ford in South Texas, but removed three in the Permian in West Texas and eastern New Mexico. There were no changes in the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana.On a weekly basis, the amount of U.S. oil pulled out of the ground has remained about 9.1 million bpd since the start of September, according to EIA's weekly field production report, well below the 9.6 million-barrel per day peak seen in April.

197,"  (Adds global context)MELBOURNE Oct 23 Australia's antitrust regulator raised concerns on Friday about Halliburton Co's  proposed $35 billion buyout of rival Baker Hughes Inc , in another setback for a deal that has already hit competition snarls in the United States.Delaying its final ruling for a third time, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commision (ACCC) said joining the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield services firms to eclipse the current No. 1, Schlumberger NV, ""may create conditions that would facilitate coordinated behaviour in the market"".""The ACCC is concerned that the acquisition would result in the merged entity being one of only a small number of suppliers that could service the relevant markets,"" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement, which described the companies as ""close competitors across a broad range of oilfield goods and services in Australia"". ""The ACCC is particularly concerned in relation to the supply of complex or high-risk projects, such as off-shore drilling projects,"" Sims added.The regulator will give a final ruling on Dec. 17, but the remarks signal the hurdles the companies face as they try to push through a deal first announced 11 months ago as a way to cut costs amid an oil price downturn. The two firms have already committed to selling businesses to appease U.S. authorities, but the ACCC's Sims noted that authorities in Europe, India and China are also looking at the deal. The deal originally had a deadline of Dec. 16, but the two companies, which both provide services, technology and systems to the oil and gas industry globally, have more recently said it may not close until 2016.The ACCC initially said it expected to give a decision by July 9 but postponed that twice to collect extra information from both companies. The regulator said it has requested more information by a deadline of Nov. 12.The ACCC on Thursday also postponed a final decision on Royal Dutch Shell's $70 billion takeover of BG Group  by a week, its second delay for a ruling on that deal, amid a flurry of M&A activity in the global energy sector that ias increased its workload.

It rose 3 percent on the week and 2 percent for October. U.S. crude futures rose by 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.56, gaining 3 percent on the week and 4 percent on the month.Oil prices had trended higher since Wednesday's 6 percent rally, sparked by a smaller-than-anticipated build in U.S. crude and sharper-than-expected falls in gasoline and diesel stockpiles.U.S. oil drillers removed 16 rigs in the week ended Oct. 30, bringing the total rig count down to 578, the least since June 2010, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report. The drop was a sign that low prices were continuing to keep drillers away from the well pad, signaling lower production over the next several months.But while U.S. output is declining, global supplies of crude and refined oil products continue to grow, testing storage capacity and hammering oil company results.This is prompting oil bears to argue that price rallies such as Wednesday's cannot be sustained. ""Looking at the bigger picture, there is still lots of oil in the United States,"" PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said. ""We should see a softer market in the coming days.""Others are not so sure.""Although providing fundamental rationale for a 6 percent single day advance remains challenging, we are conceding to a significant improvement in the short term chart picture and a need to lift pricing in order to attract fresh selling,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch & Associates, an oil consultancy in Chicago.A Reuters survey was supportive to the market, showing that Saudi Arabia and Iraq pumped less oil in October than African nations in OPEC, pushing the producer group's output down from near record highs.Chinese government data also showed the country was doubling crude oil import quotas for 2016.(Additional reporting by Libby George in London and Aaron Sheldrick in Tokyo; Editing by David Evans, Marguerita Choy and Frances Kerry)",2015-10-30,BHI,"Fri Oct 30, 2015 | 4:18pm EDT",UPDATE 7-Oil rises on U.S. rig count; market also up on week and month,http://www.reuters.com//article/global-oil-idUSL3N12U1X420151030?type=companyNews

208,"  Nov 20 U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for an 11th week in the last 12 this week, data showed on Friday, a sign drillers were still waiting for higher prices before returning to the well pad en masse.Drillers removed 10 oil rigs in the week ended Nov. 20, bringing the total rig count down to 564, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report.That is about a third of the 1,574 oil rigs operating in same week a year ago. After cutting 103 oil rigs over the past two months, drillers added two rigs last week.U.S. oil futures averaged $41 a barrel so far this week, down from $43 last week, as crude inventories rose for the eighth consecutive week and were inching closer to record highs.Crude oil futures on Friday fell below $40 for a third day in a row to the lowest level since August as the pressure of a persistent supply glut limited optimism for a price recovery. The strength of the U.S. dollar, near seven-month highs, has a negative impact on crude prices, making oil and other commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies, analysts said.Energy traders noted the rate of weekly oil rig reductions since the start of September, about nine on average, was much lower than the 18 rigs cut on average since the number of rigs peaked at 1,609 in October 2014, due in part to expectations of slightly higher prices in the future. U.S. crude futures for next year were trading around $45 a barrel, the same as last week, according to the full year 2016 calendar strip on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Higher prices encourage drillers to add rigs. The most recent time crude prices were much higher than now was in May and June, when U.S. futures averaged $60 a barrel. In response to those higher prices, drillers added 47 rigs over the summer.The rig count is one of several indicators traders look at to predict whether production will rise or fall in future months. Other factors include how fast energy firms complete previously drilled but unfinished wells and increases in well efficiency and productivity.U.S. oil production eased to 9.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in August from 9.4 million bpd in July, according to the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) 914 production report.On a weekly basis, U.S. oil output remained at 9.2 million bpd for a third week in a row after holding at 9.1 million bpd for eight consecutive weeks since the start of September, according to EIA's weekly field production report.

Since the end of the summer, drillers have cut 130 oil rigs. U.S. crude futures fell as low as $35.35 a barrel on Friday, its lowest level since February 2009, after the International Energy agency (IEA) warned global oversupply could worsen in the new year.Energy traders noted the rate of weekly oil rig reductions since the start of September, about nine on average, was much lower than the 18 rigs cut on average since the rig count peaked at 1,609 in October 2014, due in part to expectations of slightly higher prices in the future.

Bearish sentiment driven by oversupply has rattled the market and was set to lead prices to a third straight weekly drop, the longest losing streak in four months.      ""We need to see an some declines in production before the rig count can really increase,"" Ritterbusch said.     U.S. oil production held at 9.4 million barrels per day in September, the same as August, according to federal energy data.       The rig count increase this week, however, showed that at least some drillers were willing to start drilling again even with U.S. oil prices trading below $40 a barrel, in hopes of higher prices in the future.     U.S. crude futures for next year were trading around $40 a barrel, down from $42 last week, according to the full year 2016 calendar strip on the New York Mercantile Exchange.     Higher prices encourage drillers to add rigs. The most recent period crude prices were much higher than now was in May and June, when U.S. futures averaged $60 a barrel.     In response to those higher prices, drillers added 47 rigs over the summer.     This week rigs were added in three of the four major U.S. shale oil basins. Drillers added 5 rigs in the Permian in West Texas and eastern New Mexico; two in the Eagle Ford in South Texas and one in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming. The number of rigs in the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana remained the same.

241,"  (Adds quote)     Jan 8 U.S. oil drillers began the year by slashing the number of rigs to the lowest in over five years, data showed on Friday, with analysts saying further reductions are almost certain as producers respond to a deepening oil price rout.     Drillers cut 20 oil rigs in the week ended Jan. 8, the third-largest one-week decline since May, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report. The reductions occurred across every major shale patch, from the Permian to the Bakken. RIG-OL-USA-BHI      The remaining 516 rigs were the fewest since April 2010, according to the data, but few expect the slump to end there. Oil prices have dropped more than $10 a barrel over the past two months, about half of that in the past week. Lower prices are likely to be reflected in more idled rigs over the coming month or two.     ""So long as the price for oil stays low, the rig count will continue to decline,"" said Arthur Gelber, founder and president of energy consulting and advisory firm Gelber and Associates in Houston.     U.S. oil futures on Friday failed to draw any support from the sharp fall in rigs, settling at $33.16 a barrel, the lowest since Feb. 2004. Investors remain worried about a persistent global glut and a bleak demand outlook.     U.S. crude futures dropped 30 percent last year.     The rig count decline was the seventh reduction in the past eight weeks and brings the total rig count down to about a third of the 1,421 oil rigs operating in same week a year ago.     In 2015, drillers idled a total of 963 oil rigs, the first annual cut since 2002 and the biggest annual decline since at least 1988, according to Baker Hughes.     Over the prior five years (2010-2014), producers added on average 216 oil rigs per year. In 2015, however, they cut on average 18 oil rigs per week.     U.S. crude futures were trading at higher levels around $38 a barrel for the rest of 2016 and $43 for 2017. Some analysts said this could entice producers to return to drilling later this year.     One of the biggest U.S. independent drillers, Pioneer Natural Resources Co, said this week its preliminary 2016 production growth forecast was 10 percent to 15 percent compared with 2015.     Pioneer said it still forecasts compound annual production growth of 15 plus percent over 2016 through 2018, assuming the addition of two rigs to three rigs per year during 2017 and 2018.     This week, drillers cut four oil rigs in the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana, bringing the total to 49, the lowest rig count in the basin since at least 2009.     U.S. natural gas rigs RIG-GS-USA-BHI, meanwhile, fell by 14 this week, knocking the overall oil and gas rig count to 664, the lowest since August 1999.

242,"  (Corrects milestone in paragraph 11 to 2003, from 2013)* Oil producers not responsive to current prices -Goldman Sachs* ABN Amro cuts 2016 Brent and WTI forecasts by $10-$15* Investors taking protection against $25 a barrel prices* US oil rig count lowest since 2010 as drillers step up cutsBy Barani KrishnanNEW YORK, Jan 8 Oil fell for a fifth straight day on Friday, losing 10 percent on the week, and Goldman Sachs said more losses were needed to force producers to cut supplies adequately to balance the glut and bleak demand outlook in the market.Futures of global oil benchmark Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude seesawed through the day, settling slightly lower after stock prices on Wall Street gave up their earlier strength. The two benchmarks hit 12-year lows earlier in the week after China's stock market crash roiled global markets.Since the selloff in oil began 18 months ago, traders and investors have wondered how long and deep the slide would go as prices fell from above $100 a barrel to below $40, and looked poised to break below $30 next. Goldman, which has said oil could hit $20, said in a note on Friday the market needs to see sustained low prices through the first quarter ""so producers will move budgets down to reflect $40 a barrel oil for 2016.""The note, based on interactions between oil producing companies and investors at a Goldman conference in Miami this week, concluded that producers were not ready to slash output at current prices.""Instead, producers spoke largely of their agility to spend within cash flow and ... ramp up when needed,"" the Wall Street bank said. ""This hurt sentiment as investors came away concerned that companies were not being responsive enough.""The glut has persisted despite a drop in U.S. oil drilling rigs last year - the first annual cut since 2002 and the biggest decline since at least 1988, according to Baker Hughes. In the first week of 2016, however, energy firms stepped up the rate of idling rigs and the U.S. oil rig count dropped to a five-year low.Brent settled 20 cents lower at $33.55 a barrel. It hit a session low of $32.78, after sliding on Thursday to $32.16, the lowest since April 2004.For the week, Brent fell 10 percent, just behind the 11 percent drop in the opening week of 2015, which was a record loss for oil in the first full trading week of any year.WTI ended 11 cents lower at $33.16. It fell to $32.64 earlier in the day, after falling to $32.10 on Thursday, its lowest since December 2003. ""The sentiment is still extremely negative and short positions are still at excessive levels,"" Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. ""That makes it also hard to pinpoint the timing of the expected recovery.""ABN Amro cut its 2016 Brent and WTI price forecast to $50 per barrel from its prior view of $65 and $60, respectively.U.S. stock indexes  bounced in and out of positive territory in choppy trading.""In my view, crude is still just a number on screen with little implications for most of the people and computers that are actively trading,"" said Scott Shelton, energy broker and commodities specialist at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina.""It will keep going down until the equity world stops selling off.""The options market indicates concerns oil prices can fall further. Some investors are acquiring put options giving them the right to sell at $25 a barrel, anticipating that Brent will fall below that, and the costs of those options are soaring.Over the past year, the world has been producing 1.5 million barrels per day more oil than it consumes. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency expect global demand growth to slow in 2016 to around 1.20-1.25 million bpd from a very high 1.8 million bpd in 2015.

243,"  Jan 8 U.S. energy firms this week cut oil rigs for a seventh week in eight, data showed on Friday, increasing the rate of declines as crude prices tumbled to near 12-year lows after one of the worst years in almost 30 years for the rig market.     Drillers removed 20 oil rigs in the week ended Jan. 8, bringing the total rig count down to 516, the least since April 2010, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report.     That decrease brings the total rig count down to about a third of the 1,421 oil rigs operating in same week a year ago.     In 2015, Baker Hughes said drillers idled a total of 963 oil rigs, the first annual cut since 2002 and the biggest cut in a year since at least 1988. Over the prior five years (2010-2014), producers added on average 216 oil rigs per year.      Crude futures were trading near 12-year lows on persistent global oversupply worries and a bleak demand outlook.      U.S. crude futures were trading around $33 a barrel on Friday, putting the contract on track to lose about 10 percent this week after crude stocks at Cushing, the U.S. storage hub in Oklahoma, climbed to record highs this week due to over production and weak heating demand during earlier in the winter.     Last week, U.S. crude averaged $37 a barrel.     U.S. crude futures were trading around $38 a barrel for the rest of 2016 and $43 for 2017, which some analysts have said could entice producers to return to drilling later this year.     One of the biggest U.S. independent drillers Pioneer Natural Resources Co said this week its preliminary 2016 production growth forecast was 10 percent to 15 percent compared with 2015.     Pioneer said it continues to forecast compound annual production growth of 15 plus percent over the 2016 through 2018 period, assuming the addition of two rigs to three rigs per year during 2017 and 2018.     The last time drillers returned to the well pad en masse was in May and June, when U.S. futures averaged $60 a barrel. In response to those higher prices, drillers added 47 rigs last summer.     The rig count is one of several indicators traders look to when forecasting whether production will rise or fall in the future. Other indicators include productivity gains and the completion of previously drilled wells.

257,"  Jan 29 U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for the sixth straight week, data showed on Friday, and were expected to shed more in coming weeks with three major U.S. shale oil companies slashing their spending plans after crude prices hit 12-year lows.     Drillers removed 12 oil rigs in the week ended Jan. 29, bringing the rig count down to 498, the least since March 2010, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report.     That compares with 1,223 oil rigs in same week a year ago. In 2015, drillers cut on average 18 rigs per week for a total of 963 oil rigs for the year, the biggest annual decline since at least 1988.     U.S. crude futures were trading around $33 a barrel on Friday, heading for a weekly gain with the front-month contract up about 25 percent over the 12-year low plumbed last week, on prospects that a deal between major exporters to cut production could help reduce one of the worst gluts in history.       Analysts forecast production will suffer as energy firms reduce capital spending plans for 2016 and cut the number of rigs drilling for oil due to the collapse in crude prices.     Three major U.S. shale oil companies this week slashed their 2016 capital spending plans more than expected in a bid to survive $30 a barrel oil prices, with one of them, Continental Resources, saying prices would need to rise to $37 just to turn a profit.      Looking forward, U.S. futures were fetching $38 on average for the rest of 2016 and nearly $43 for 2017 .     The capex cuts by Hess Corp, Continental and Noble Energy ranged from 40 percent to 66 percent, marking the second straight year of pullbacks by a trio of companies normally seen as among the most resilient shale oil producers.       Baker Hughes, meanwhile, said this week that its North American revenues declined 17 percent compared with the prior quarter as the collapse in crude prices reduced customer demand for its rigs, among other things.      Baker Hughes forecast worldwide rig activity could fall by as much 30 percent in 2016 as customers continue to reduce spending in the current weak price environment.      Analysts at Goldman Sachs said production in 2016 would decline by about 345,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the current rig count assuming no well deferrals, which is a bigger cut than its estimate last week for a decline of 330,000 bpd.     U.S. crude oil production averaged about 9.4 million bpd in 2015 and was forecast to average 8.7 million bpd in 2016 and 8.5 million bpd in 2017, according to the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration's Short-Term Energy Outlook.

259,"  Feb 19 The number of oil rigs in the United fell for a ninth straight week to the lowest level since December 2009, data showed on Friday, as energy firms continued to cut spending amid the collapse in crude prices.     Drillers cut 26 rigs in the week ended Feb. 19, bringing the total rig oil count to 413, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report.     The number of oil rigs in operation were less than a third of the 1,536 in service during the same week a year ago.     Oil has shed 70 percent from highs above $100 a barrel in a selloff that has seen little pause over the past 20 months, forcing a collapse in the rig count as well. Since last Friday though, some traders believed the market had seen a bottom on talk that OPEC was on a plan to reign in production.     This week, Saudi Arabia, the lynchpin of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Qatar and Venezuela, and non-OPEC member Russia, proposed to freeze output at January's highs.     Iran, the main stumbling block to any production control due to its zeal to recapture market share lost to sanctions, welcomed the plan without commitment. Iraq was also non-committal.       Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note on Friday that if a Saudi-Russia plan to freeze at January's highs worked and gasoline fuel prices remained affordable, crude prices could recover to around $47 a barrel by June.      On a broader scale, some analysts forecast the rig count will decline in coming months before recovering later this year in tandem with an expected rise in crude prices.     Front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures  were trading around $29 a barrel.     Looking forward, crude futures were fetching about $35 for the balance of 2016 and just around $40 for 2017 .     U.S. shale producers, for the first time in months, were placing new hedges to lock in 2017 prices at around $45 a barrel, prompting price recovery at the back end of the U.S. crude futures curve.

270,"  (Adds natural gas rig count)     April 1 The number of rigs drilling for oil and natural gas in the United States fell for the 15th straight week to the lowest level since at least 1940, data showed on Friday, as the energy price rout takes its toll on shale producers' financing and their ability to drill new wells.     Drillers cut 14 oil and gas rigs in the week to April 1, bringing the total rig count down to 450, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report.     That compares with 1,028 oil and gas rigs operating in the same week a year ago. In 2015, drillers cut on average 22 oil and gas rigs per week for a total of 1,142 for the year, the biggest annual decline since at least 1988.     Oil rigs alone RIG-OL-USA-BHI fell 10 to 362, the lowest level since November 2009, while gas rigs RIG-GS-USA-BHI declined by four to 88, the least since at least 1987, according to the data going back that far.     Energy firms have sharply reduced oil and gas drilling since the selloff in crude markets began in mid-2014, forcing more than 50 U.S. producers to file for bankruptcy protection since the start of 2015.         But a Reuters analysis found that bankruptcies so far are having little effect on U.S. oil production as distressed drillers tend to keep their wells gushing as they have figured out how to get more out of each well.      What bankrupt and financially stretched producers are unable to do is drill new wells and since output from shale wells can fall as much as 70 percent during their first year, a sustained lull in drilling would gradually erode U.S. production.     U.S. crude production is expected to decrease about 7 percent from 9.4 million barrels per day in 2015, the highest level since 1972, to 8.7 million bpd in 2016 and 8.2 million bpd in 2017, according to the latest federal estimates.      Many analysts think the combined oil and gas rig count will rise later this year with signs prices may have bottomed since U.S. crude futures hit a near 13-year low of $26.05 a barrel in February and U.S. gas futures fell to a near 18-year low of $1.611 per million British thermal units in March.

274,"   By Michael Flaherty and Swetha Gopinath  The U.S. Department of Justice said on Monday it had sued activist investor ValueAct Capital for violating pre-merger notification requirements related to oilfield service provider Halliburton Co's deal to buy rival Baker Hughes Inc.The lawsuit said ValueAct used its access to senior Halliburton and Baker Hughes executives to formulate the merger and other strategies, and also said a civil penalty of ""at least $19 million"" was appropriate.The Department of Justice (DOJ) said in its lawsuit that ValueAct violated premerger notification requirements, as outlined in the Hart Scott Rodino Act, which provides the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice with information about large mergers and acquisitions before they occur. Halliburton is awaiting regulatory approval for the acquisition, which was worth $35 billion when it was announced in November 2014. The value of the deal has since fallen by nearly half, hit by the plunge in oil prices.ValueAct said in a statement it will fight the allegations. ""We fundamentally disagree with the Department of Justice's allegations in this case,"" the San Francisco-based hedge fund said in an emailed statement.ValueAct said having a relationship with a company's management, conducting due diligence and engaging with other stock owners are basic principles of shareholder rights. In November 2014, Halliburton announced it would buy oil and gas services rival Baker Hughes in a cash and stock deal worth $34.6 billion at the time. The deal was supposed to close in the second half of last year but has been hit with anti-trust delays.ValueAct, a shareholder in Halliburton since 2012, disclosed last January that it bought a stake in Baker Hughes, saying at the time that its belief in the deal was underpinned by the drop in oil prices.The two holdings together comprise nearly 10 percent of ValueAct's total portfolio, as of Dec. 31 of last year, and lost a combined $656 million in paper value during 2015, Reuters previously reported.",2016-04-04,BHI,"Mon Apr 4, 2016 | 3:27pm EDT",U.S. sues ValueAct over Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal disclosures,http://www.reuters.com//article/bakerhughes-ma-halliburton-valueact-idUSL2N1771E1?type=companyNews

278,"   By Diane Bartz and Terry Wade | WASHINGTON/HOUSTON  WASHINGTON/HOUSTON The U.S. government filed a lawsuit on Wednesday to stop  Halliburton Co (HAL.N) from buying Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), arguing the combination of the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies would lead to higher prices in the sector.The move, which comes after months of talks on divestitures of some overlapping businesses, significantly cuts the chances of the deal going through, although Halliburton said it would ""vigorously contest"" the lawsuit. The Justice Department said the merger, valued at $35 billion when it was first announced in November 2014, would leave only two dominant suppliers in 20 business lines in the global well drilling and oil construction services industry, with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) being one of the two.In 11 of those lines, ranging from offshore well cementing to onshore fracking plugs, a combined Halliburton-Baker Hughes would have more than 50 percent of the market and in two cases more than 80 percent of the market.""The proposed deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes would eliminate vital competition, skew energy markets and harm American consumers,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Our action makes clear that the Justice Department is committed to vigorously enforcing our antitrust laws.""The Justice Department said that Halliburton had offered divestitures aimed at saving the deal but that these were inadequate. ""I have seen a lot of problematic mergers in my time. But I have never seen one that poses so many antitrust problems in so many markets,"" said Bill Baer, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, in a conference call with reporters. Halliburton disagreed. ""The companies believe that the DOJ (Justice Department) has reached the wrong conclusion in its assessment of the transaction and that its action is counterproductive, especially in the context of the challenges the U.S. and global energy industry are currently experiencing,"" the company said in a statement.The companies also face difficulties with European antitrust regulators, which last month halted scrutiny of the deal for a second time, saying the companies had yet to provide an important piece of information.Halliburton shares were up 6.9 percent on Wednesday at $36.76 while Baker Hughes shares were up 8 percent at $42.65.Based on Halliburton's latest share price, the deal would be worth $26 billion. The company's shares have tumbled more than 35 percent over the past two years as a slumping oil price has hurt its customers.  WALL STREET REACTS  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings.    Despite that, Wall Street analysts generally agreed Halliburton would be in better shape than Baker Hughes if the deal fell through. ""Halliburton would be just fine if the deal didn't go through, even with the breakup fee,"" said Rob Desai, an analyst with Edward Jones. Halliburton's profit margins would improve on a standalone basis because it had kept a relatively high cost structure and was holding off on deeper cutbacks until after the deal closed, analysts said. Without the distractions of integration work, it could also be more agile, they said.    Evercore ISI's James West said Halliburton's stock price could improve to $42 a share, or $45 excluding the breakup fee, which is worth $2.65 a share.Baker Hughes, as the acquisition target, was seen as facing greater difficulties if the deal does not go ahead.""Given the employee turnover, the cannibalization of its equipment at the onset of the downturn, and the general disorder within the company, we believe standalone-Baker Hughes' revenue growth and margin improvement would lag its peers,"" West said in a note.

282,"  April 8 U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for a third week in a row to the lowest level since November 2009, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said Friday, as energy firms keep slashing spending despite a roughly 50 percent jump in crude futures since hitting a near 13-year low in February.     Drillers cut 8 oil rigs in the week to April 8, bringing the total rig count down to 354, Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report. RIG-OL-USA-BHI     The number of U.S. oil rigs currently operating compares with the 760 rigs operating in the same week a year ago. In 2015, drillers cut on average 18 oil rigs per week for a total of 963 for the year, the biggest annual decline since at least 1988 amid the biggest rout in crude prices in a generation.     Before this week, drillers cut on average 13 oil rigs per week for a total of 174 so far this year.      Energy firms have sharply reduced oil and natural gas drilling since the selloff in crude markets began in mid-2014. U.S. crude futures collapsed from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to a near 13-year low around $26 in February.     U.S. drilling services company Patterson-UTI Energy Inc  said it had 64 drilling rigs in operation in March, compared with 142 during the same month in 2015.      Despite the challenges energy firms are facing, the U.S. Justice Department this week filed a lawsuit to stop Halliburton Co from buying Baker Hughes, arguing the combination of the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies would hurt competition in the sector.      But with U.S. crude futures trading around $40 a barrel, up about 50 percent since hitting the February low, some analysts think the rig count will rise later this year and next year as prices increase.     Looking forward, U.S. crude futures were fetching around $42 a barrel for the balance of 2016 and about $44 for calendar 2017.

285,"   By Michael Flaherty and Ross Kerber | NEW YORK/BOSTON  NEW YORK/BOSTON The U.S. government's lawsuit against ValueAct Capital targets one activist investor but could call into question routine practices across the $16 trillion mutual fund industry, according to attorneys and industry representatives.The U.S. Department of Justice last week alleged that the hedge fund improperly classified two company investments as passive - and therefore exempt from disclosure requirements - while taking an activist role with executives. ValueAct disputes the claim.Some communications the government cites as evidence are similar to discussions that are increasingly common between traditional, buy-and-hold funds and companies in their portfolios.The case comes as active and passive investors work more together to pressure management at underperforming companies. Activists court passive shareholders before launching such a campaign, and passive investors recruit activists to agitate, several activist managers told Reuters. Traditional funds may need to reassess their compliance with disclosure laws, according to a memo to clients from Davis Polk, a New York law firm with expertise in financial services.""Such an institution will have to examine whether it can claim to have a truly 'passive' intent,"" said the memo, issued in response to the ValueAct case.Those firms could include, for instance, T. Rowe Price Group (TROW.O), BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group. Spokespeople at those companies declined to comment, and representatives of seven additional fund firms contacted by Reuters declined to comment or said executives were unavailable. The Justice Department also declined to comment.An industry trade group said the case could restrain shareholders from addressing important issues with corporate executives and board directors.""The DOJ case could have a chilling effect on dialogues between companies and their shareholders,"" said Amy Borrus, deputy director at the Council of Institutional Investors, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit whose members include pensions, endowments and major mutual funds.For a graphic showing the increase in company shareholder communication programs, see tmsnrt.rs/25PYHpm Competition for better returns has led some big mutual fund firms to take a more active role, weighing in on issues such as CEO pay and corporate governance. Vanguard Chairman and CEO William McNabb, in a speech last June in New York, described how the firm increasingly addresses matters of concern with companies in its portfolio.""We’ve become more targeted in whom we mailed letters to and more prescriptive in our language,"" McNabb said.For example, Vanguard sent out 500 letters in March 2015 to independent chairs and lead directors outlining six principles of corporate governance, McNabb said.SIX WORDS At the heart of the ValueAct case are six words in a 40-year-old law that requires disclosure of certain investments to assist the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in antitrust review of mergers. The intent is to prevent investors from secretly buying up stakes to agitate for industry consolidation. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act requires all buyers of voting securities worth more than $76.3 million to notify the government, unless they were bought ""solely for the purpose of investment.""The government alleges ValueAct failed to disclose a $2.5 billion position in two companies that planned to merge - oilfield services peers Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Industries Inc. (BHI.N)ValueAct is fighting the case and has said that its outreach to the companies was standard shareholder input and not active investing. The firm declined to comment for this story.Among the evidence asserted by the government is a December 2014 meeting with the Baker Hughes chief financial officer, where ValueAct’s chief executive discussed gaps in the company's North American margins and other underperforming areas. The government also cited a ValueAct email sent to Halliburton’s CEO in July 2015 to schedule a meeting about executive compensation.Davis Polk points out in its client memo that it’s common for investors with stakes deemed passive to discuss those topics with corporate management. ""It does seem to be ... a typical subject of discussion,"" wrote the firm, which represents Baker Hughes in the merger.BLURRED BOUNDARIES John Briggs, an antitrust attorney with the law firm Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider LLP, called the case a one-off enforcement effort against ValueAct that does not necessarily signal a broader crackdown or a change in legal interpretation.But Briggs agreed that the case highlights the blurring boundaries between activist and traditional fund managers. A ValueAct win could further cloud the issue, while a government victory could prompt major investors to dial back pressure on companies.A managing director at a large asset manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he and his colleagues routinely discuss business improvement and executive compensation with company executives, believing such topics do not cross legal lines. The ValueAct case could change that interpretation, the manager said.The lawsuit could take months or years to resolve. Any resulting limits on fund managers could clash with a separate effort led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the early 1990s encouraging more dialogue between investors and public corporations.""The idea was that you want to free up those conversations, since more conversations allow more accountability,"" said University of Delaware finance professor Charles Elson, who follows corporate governance.

289,"  Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) has entered the auction for assets that oilfield service providers Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) aim to divest to secure antitrust approval for their merger, a person familiar with the matter said.Carlyle, a Washington-based private equity firm, is competing against General Electric Co (GE.N), which was already in discussions to buy many of the assets, the person said on Thursday, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.Halliburton and Carlyle declined to comment, while Baker Hughes and General Electric did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Earlier on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal, citing sources, reported that Carlyle was in serious talks to buy assets worth more than $7 billion from Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes shares were up 5.5 percent on the news to $43.55, while Halliburton shares were down slightly in Thursday afternoon trading in New York at $38.19.Halliburton and Baker Hughes are under new pressure to divest assets after the U.S. government filed a lawsuit last week to stop their deal, arguing the combination of the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies would lead to higher prices in the sector. The two companies had initially announced they would divest their drill bits and directional drilling businesses as part of their merger.  Last September, the two added several businesses to the list, which in total would amount to $5.2 billion of 2013 revenue. The additional divestitures included Halliburton's expandable line hangers business, Baker Hughes' core completions business, Baker Hughes' sand control business in the Gulf of Mexico, and Baker Hughes' offshore cementing business in Australia, Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, Norway and the UK.

291,"  (Adds total natural gas and oil rig count)     April 15 U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for a fourth week in a row to the lowest level since November 2009, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday, as energy firms keep slashing spending despite a more than 50 percent jump in crude futures since hitting a near 13-year low in February.     Drillers cut 3 oil rigs in the week to April 15, bringing the total rig count down to 351, Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report. RIG-OL-USA-BHI     The number of U.S. oil rigs operating compares with the 734 rigs operating in the same week a year ago. In 2015, drillers cut on average 18 oil rigs per week for a total of 963 for the year, the biggest annual decline since at least 1988 amid the deepest rout in crude prices in a generation.     Before this week, drillers cut on average 13 oil rigs per week for a total of 182 so far this year.     Energy firms have sharply reduced oil and natural gas drilling since the selloff in crude markets began in mid-2014. U.S. crude futures collapsed from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to around $26 in February.     But with U.S. crude futures this week trading around $40 a barrel, up over 50 percent from the February low on talk of a possible OPEC production freeze, some analysts think the rig count will bottom soon and rise later this year and next as prices increase.      U.S. crude futures were fetching around $43 a barrel for the balance of 2016 and about $45 for calendar 2017 .     U.S. oil and gas exploration and production firm Pioneer Natural Resources Co, the most active oil producer in the Permian basin in Texas with 12 rigs in the play, this week said it will add 5 to 10 rigs if oil prices return to $50 a barrel, which it expects by the end of 2016 or early 2017.       Analysts at Cowen & Co, a U.S. financial services firm, this week estimated the number of active U.S. gas and oil rigs would slide from an average 559 in the first quarter to 411 in the second quarter and 401 in the third quarter before rising to 415 in the fourth quarter.

The world's No. 1 oilfield services provider said its first quarter revenue decrease was one of the steepest quarterly declines for the company since this downturn started driven in part by a drop in activity, persistent pricing pressure, project delays, job cancellations and activity disruptions.         U.S. crude futures this week were heading for a third week of gains, trading around $43 a barrel, as market sentiment turned more upbeat despite the persistent oversupply.

U.S. crude futures fell from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to a near 13-year low around $26 in February.     U.S. crude futures, however, have spiked nearly 80 percent in the past two months and hit 2016 highs of just under $46 on Friday as market sentiment turned more upbeat despite the persistent oversupply.      U.S. crude futures were above $47 a barrel for the balance of 2016 and about $49 for calendar 2017.      Baker Hughes said at its quarterly earnings release on Wednesday that it expected the U.S. rig count to start stabilizing in the second half of the year, although it did not expect any meaningful hike in oil drilling activity.     Whiting Petroleum Corp's Chief Executive Jim Volkers said the firm would like oil prices to stay at or above $50 for at least 90 days before deciding to reduce drilled-but-uncompleted well count in Colorado.      The world's No. 1 oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV  also said it will remain cautious in adding capacity even after energy firms show signs of recovery since it believes the industry will continue cutting costs through the coming quarter.      The rig count is one of several indicators of future oil and gas production. Other indicators include drillers ability to get more out of each well and the completion of drilled but uncompleted wells.

Lynch said last month that the number of big and complex deals being proposed made it ""a unique moment in antitrust enforcement."" The collapse of Halliburton's acquisition of Baker Hughes comes as both companies struggle to cope with the impact that lower energy prices are having on their clients. Last week, Baker Hughes reported a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss and warned that the rig count globally would drop steadily through the end of the year because of fewer new projects.Halliburton said last month it cut more than 6,000 jobs in the first quarter as revenue slumped 40.4 percent and it took a $2.1 billion restructuring charge mainly for severance costs and asset write-offs.

312,"   By Mike Stone  Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE.N) is taking steps that may enable it to renegotiate its $20 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Williams Companies Inc (WMB.N), according to people familiar with the matter.Dallas billionaire Kelcy Warren, the chief executive of Energy Transfer, set his sights on Williams last year to transform his empire into one of the biggest pipeline networks in the world. However, a prolonged drop in oil and gas prices has made the deal less economically attractive.Energy Transfer and Williams are in talks to reduce the number of days specified for completing some of the deal's administrative requirements, the people said.This would give them time to engage in renegotiation of terms ahead of a June 28 deadline for the deal to close, the people added.There is no certainty that such renegotiation talks will occur, let alone be successful, the people cautioned.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Energy Transfer and Williams declined to comment.Another marquee deal that suffered as result of lower energy prices, U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Inc's (HAL.N) $28 billion acquisition of peer Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), was pulled on Sunday after it faced objections from antitrust watchdogs.  The latest development comes after Energy Transfer said in April its lawyers may not be able to deliver an important tax opinion for its takeover of Williams, throwing the agreed acquisition into doubt. Since the takeover was announced in September 2015, Energy Transfer launched a controversial offering of preferred shares to its top shareholders, for which it is currently being sued by Williams. Energy Transfer has also fired its chief financial officer and slashed projections for cost savings from the Williams deal. Energy Transfer said last March it expected the base case for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from commercial synergies from the deal to be about $170 million a year by 2020, compared with previous forecasts of more than $2 billion when the deal was unveiled. The size of the deal has also shrunk to about $20 billion from an original $37.7 billion. In another sign of the deal's troubles, Williams has yet to schedule a vote for its shareholders to approve the transaction with Energy Transfer. Another administrative hurdle is managing how Williams shareholders will be paid for their shares once they elect to receive cash or stock. Energy Transfer would need to take on a heavy debt load to fund the $6 billion cash portion of the deal under the existing terms. Williams said in its lawsuit last month that Energy Transfer has looked into how it might be able to walk away from the merger even though the terms do not allow that.

313,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  Baker Hughes Inc sought to reassure investors on Monday by announcing a $2.5 billion plan to buy back stock and pay down debt, using the breakup fee it will receive following the collapse of its long-stalled takeover by fellow oilfield services provider Halliburton Inc. Now each company must map out a strategy to thrive on its own. Both had hoped the merger would help them weather the worst oil price crash in a generation, which has caused hundreds of thousands of layoffs across the industry.Wall Street analysts said Halliburton should be in better shape than Baker Hughes but praised Baker Hughes' plan to cut annual costs by some $500 million in an oversupplied market while repurchasing shares.""(This) equates to meaningful upside potential to earnings estimates in 2016 and 2017"" for Baker Hughes, UBS analyst Angeline Sedita said in a note to clients.Baker Hughes said proceeds from a $3.5 billion breakup fee from Halliburton would fund a $1.5 billion share buyback and the repayment of $1 billion of debt.Shares of Halliburton rose 2.6 percent to $42.36 on Monday, while Baker Hughes fell 2.8 percent to $47.04.    Baker Hughes has faced employee turnover and cutbacks ever since Halliburton announced plans 18 months ago to buy it in a deal first valued at $35 billion. Regulators in the United States and overseas frowned upon the transaction, calling it a threat to competition and innovation. That led both sides to scrap the agreement on Sunday.The U.S. Justice Department had filed a lawsuit last month to stop the deal, saying it would leave only two dominant oilfield services companies, the merged Halliburton-Baker Hughes entity and global market leader Schlumberger Ltd. Baker Hughes, which is developing products that lower costs and maximize production for oil and gas producers, also said on Monday it planned to refinance a $2.5 billion credit facility, which expires in September.The company said an initial phase of cost-cutting should result in $500 million of annualized savings by the end of 2016.In a separate regulatory filing on Monday, Baker Hughes said it had cut 2,000 more jobs in the first quarter, adding to worldwide reductions of 18,000 last year. The company had about 43,000 employees as of Dec. 31. (1.usa.gov/23iDCjh) Baker Hughes said on Wednesday that it recorded after-tax ""merger-retained"" costs of $110 million in the first quarter, leading to a bigger net loss for the period.The Houston-based company also said then that it was limiting its exposure to the unprofitable onshore pressure pumping business in North America.Halliburton, which will release its first-quarter results on Tuesday, said on April 22 that revenue for the period slumped 40 percent.Shares of Baker Hughes have fallen 25 percent since the merger deal was announced in November 2014. Halliburton stock declined more than 19 percent in that time.

319,"  (Recasts, adds quote)     By Scott DiSavino     May 20 U.S. energy firms this week kept the number of rigs drilling for oil unchanged for the first time this year as crude futures trade near a seven-month high, indicating that a near two-year slump in the rig count could be ending as forecast by several analysts.     Drillers kept the number of rigs RIG-OL-USA-BHI at 318 in the week to May 20, holding at the lowest level since October 2009, energy services company Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report on Friday.      Drillers added only one rig so far this year during the week of March 18.      However, the pace of cuts has slowed.      So far this year, the cuts averaged 11 oil rigs per week for a total of 218. In 2015, they cut on average 18 oil rigs per week for a total of 963 for the year, the biggest annual decline since at least 1988.         ""We continue to believe that the U.S. rig count bottoms in the second quarter, in part due to the recent stabilization in oil prices,"" analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, said in a note this week.     The rig count has slumped since hitting a peak of 1,609 in October 2014 during the biggest rout in crude prices in a generation.     U.S. crude futures fell from over $107 a barrel mid-2014 to a near 13-year low around $26 in February.     But with U.S. crude futures settling over $48 a barrel much of this week on production worries in Nigeria and Venezuela, most analysts expect the number of rigs to stop falling soon before edging up later this year with prices expected to rise in coming months.       U.S. crude futures were fetching over $49 for the balance of 2016 and under $51 for calendar 2017.     U.S. investment banking advisory Evercore ISI said it expects drilling to pick up in the next quarter based in part on the number of drilling permits.     U.S. land permits totaled 2,099 in April, up a solid 15 percent from March, but down 33 percent year-on-year, Evercore said.     Evercore expects to exit the second quarter with about 376 total rigs, before rising to an average of 401 rigs in the third quarter.

327,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices dipped on Friday on concerns about the U.S. economy, but Brent crude held close to $50 a barrel in choppy trading with support from a weaker dollar and relief that most OPEC members do not plan to flood the market with excess crude.Weaker-than-expected U.S. non-farm payroll data sent the dollar index to its lowest since mid-May, which also supported crude prices. A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.But the numbers were negative for the U.S. economy which could limit energy demand, leading to the ""push-pull"" in the oil market, traders and brokers said.The weak data raises concerns about U.S. gasoline demand this summer driving season, said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho in New York.Brent crude futures LCOc1 dipped 8 cents to $49.96 per barrel by 12:21 p.m. ET. Brent's price still remained almost double January lows, on track for its eighth weekly gain in nine weeks.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 17 cents at $49, on track for its first weekly decline in four weeks.Oil prices have rallied from this winter's lows due largely to supply disruptions, particularly in Nigeria, Venezuela, Libya and Canada. On Friday, militants in the restive Niger Delta region that produces more than half of Nigeria's oil claimed three new attacks on oil infrastructure, promising to bring the country's oil production to ""zero.""Still, news that ExxonMobil lifted its force majeure on exports of Nigeria's Qua Iboe crude oil, looked likely to bring barrels back to the market. ""If you're starting to see some of those barrels coming back, well, that's happening ahead of schedule, in my opinion,"" Yawger said.    The tone of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting in Vienna on Thursday supported prices ""from the perspective that none of the major players (except Iran) indicated that they would be further flooding the market with oil anytime soon,"" said Energy Management Institute analyst Dominick Chirichella. Oil prices also drew support from further signs of falling U.S. shale output, with Thursday's data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing a further decline in production last week. [EIA/S]Still, analysts have said it would take more time for the oil market to rebalance fully.Oil fundamentals should shift into a supply deficit in the third quarter, and very large accumulated oil inventories should take more than a year to ""normalize,"" Credit Suisse wrote in a note on Friday.

Analysts and producers have said U.S. crude prices over $50 would trigger a return to the well pad after a near two-year slump in drilling.       Drillers added three oil rigs in the week to June 10, bringing the total rig count up to 328, compared with 635 a year ago, Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report. RIG-OL-USA-BHI     Before this week, drillers have added rigs in only two weeks so far this year, cutting on average 10 oil rigs per week for a total of 211.     That compares with cuts of 18 rigs per week on average in 2015 for a total decline of 963, the biggest annual decline since at least 1988 amid the biggest rout in crude prices in a generation.     The rig count has dropped since hitting a peak of 1,609 in October 2014 as U.S. crude futures fell from over $107 a barrel mid-2014 to a near 13-year low around $26 in February.     Since then, crude futures have almost doubled, breaking through $51 this week as U.S. inventories declined and on supply worries in Nigeria.      On Friday, however, futures were under pressure, falling nearly 3 percent to around $49.15, amid another rise in the rig count and as a strong dollar weighs on demand.      ""Barring another commodity price collapse, we do believe the bottom is in for the rig count. We expect rig counts to remain choppy for the remainder of the summer with potential increases later in the third quarter to early fourth quarter,"" analysts at U.S. financial service firm Cowen & Co said in a note this week.     Cowen forecast the total oil and natural gas land rig count would increase by about 315 rigs to 697 rigs by the fourth quarter of 2017. While that is less than the 400-rig increase expected by some other firms, Cowen said oil prices would have to rise to around $63 a barrel to cause drillers to add that many rigs.     That is much higher than current crude futures, which are fetching nearly $51 for the balance of 2016 and over $52 for calendar 2017.     ""There are some signs that rigs may be returning in the best acreage, namely the best counties in the Permian Basin,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a report.

Drillers added 14 oil rigs in the week to July 22, bringing the total rig count up to 371, compared with 659 a year ago, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said. RIG-OL-USA-BHI          Since early June when U.S. crude prices settled over $50 a barrel, drillers have added 55 oil rigs.

That increased drilling should stop the decline in production in a few months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook.     ""Higher and more stable crude oil prices are contributing to increased drilling in the United States, which may slow the pace of production declines,"" the EIA said.

In 2015, production averaged 9.4 million bpd.     ""While declines from existing wells are expected to result in a net decrease in production, increased drilling and higher well productivity are expected to soften the decline.""     While U.S. crude futures have dropped back from $50 since late June on renewed oversupply concerns to about $44 on Friday, analysts and companies continue to forecast the rig count will increase during the second half of 2016 and into 2017 and 2018 when prices are expected to rise.

A stronger dollar typically makes oil and other commodities denominated in the greenback less affordable to holders of the euro and other currencies, reducing demand for them.Oil, which fell nearly 2 percent earlier in the session, pared losses as the dollar wound back gains. Investors who made money earlier this week being bearish when U.S. crude fell below $40 the first time since April also cashed out of short positions, helping prices recover, traders said.""There are still many out there who fear a further oil price rebound at this point, and that's probably what sparked the late short-covering,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago.Some dispute that, saying oil is headed lower again. Hedge funds, some of the biggest bulls in oil, were holding the least number of positive bets on U.S. crude since February, data on Friday showed. ""The reality is we just have too much oil supply out there to continue supporting prices at these levels,"" said Phil Davis, trader at PSW Investments in San Diego.""We might hold above $40 next week, but I doubt we will be trading at $42 when the new WTI front-month comes into play.""The September front-month contract in WTI, or U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, settled down 13 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $41.80 per barrel, after falling nearly 2 percent earlier. The October contract, which will become the front-month starting on Aug 23, settled at $42.57. Brent crude's front-month settled down just 2 cents at $44.27 per barrel. Earlier in the session, it fell to $43.51.For the week though, Brent rose more than 4 percent while WTI was marginally lower, helped by a near 6 percent rally over the past two sessions.Rebalancing the oil market has proved a long and frustrating process as oil-exporting countries hard hit by the 2014-15 price slump were themselves some of the fastest-growing oil consumers.WTI timespreads weakened earlier this week, with the December contract for 2016 versus 2017 CLZ6-Z7 reaching a discount of more than $4 a barrel, its widest in nearly 8 months. That indicated eroding demand for oil slated for nearer-term delivery.U.S. oil rigs, meanwhile, rose for a sixth straight week this week, industry data showed, signaling more output.In oil market news, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told Reuters there were no discussions about possible coordination with OPEC on oil output after a failed attempt to jointly maintain production levels earlier this year.

The U.S. oil rig count rose by one to reach 407 for the week ended Sept. 2, compared with 662 a year ago, data from oil services company Baker Hughes Inc showed on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI      The rig count was unchanged last week. Prior to that, it grew for eight straight weeks, rising by 76 since the week ended July 1, for the most number of rig additions n a row since April 2014.      ""We could have a higher count for another week or so, given the lag between oil price moves and the industry's reaction,"" said Jim Williams, analyst at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas.     ""But a lower rig count is also likely once we get to late September and beyond, and once it becomes clear that OPEC measures to jawbone the market won't last.""     The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East crude exporters, will meet non-OPEC producers led by Russia at informal talks in Algeria between Sept. 26 and 28 to discuss a freeze output.     If that fails, OPEC is expected to continue trying to prop up the market going into its policy meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.     On Friday, U.S.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI)crude futures  rose 3 percent, hovering above $44 a barrel, helped by a weaker dollar and comments by Russia supporting a production freeze.      Despite rebounding this year, oil trades at less than half of mid-2014 peaks above $100 a barrel. WTI is also about $6 a below the 2016 peak of $51.67 hit in June, a level that began bringing drillers steadily back to the well pad.     Few analysts believe OPEC will be successful in making price gains last, especially when the biggest crude exporters such as Saudi Arabia and Iran are pumping all they could in a fight to raise market share.     They think prices will come under pressure from renewed worries over an oil glut.     U.S. government data on Wednesday showed a 2.3 million-barrel build in crude inventories in the last week, more than double what the market had expected.       The rig count is one of several indicators of future oil and gas production. Other indicators include drillers ability to get more out of each well and the completion of drilled but uncompleted wells or DUCs.

While U.S. oil futures for the balance of 2016 are only fetching around $44 per barrel, calendars 2017  and 2018 are trading near $48 and $50, respectively.

361,"   By Barani Krishnan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil fell about 1 percent on Friday as players took profits on a rally over the past week that propelled prices nearly 15 percent to four-month highs on hopes of OPEC crude output cuts.Also weighing on the market was the steady rise in U.S. oil drilling as crude trades at or near $50 a barrel. A closely watched report by oil services provider Baker Hughes showed U.S. drillers adding rigs in 14 of the past 15 weeks. [RIG/U]Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 58 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $51.93 a barrel. Earlier in the day, it hit $52.84 cents, three cents short of a one-year high.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled down 63 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $49.81. OPEC is ""back in business,"" determining oil prices, and only a ""brave person"" would bet against the cartel, an avowed oil bull, Andy Hall, said in a letter seen by Reuters to investors in his $2.5 billion hedge fund Astenbeck. Despite Friday's drop, Brent and WTI remain up more than 10 percent since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries wrong-footed many market participants eight days ago with its first production cut plan in eight years. For the week, Brent ended up 6 percent while WTI rose 3 percent.But with prices appearing to have gained too much, too soon - the Relative Strength Index for Brent and WTI was at 69 on Thursday, just below the overbought level of 70 - there was  pressure to liquidate. On Friday, Brent's RSI fell to 67 while WTI dropped below 58.""This is certainly not a one-way trade and we're seeing the other side acting now,"" said Tariq Zahir at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. ""As much as the world wants to believe OPEC will cut some output, there are doubts what real good it will do to the oversupply,"" Zahir said.Since OPEC proposed a production cut plan on Sept. 28 that it said will be formalized at its policy meeting in Vienna in November, it has embarked on an unusual flurry of meetings to nail down details. Next week, the group meets with Russia for informal talks in Istanbul to get non-members to contribute to cuts. OPEC hopes to bring its own output down to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day, reducing about 700,000 bpd from a global glut estimated by analysts at 1.0 million to 1.5 million bpd.But the group's tendency to often max out production makes the market wary.

363,"   By Ethan Lou | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices fell slightly on Friday as traders balanced a stronger dollar and another increase in the U.S. oil rig count against expectations that more OPEC talk of output cuts will keep crude above $50 per barrel.The dollar .DXY posted its best weekly performance in more than seven months against a basket of currencies, weighing on prices of greenback-denominated commodities, including crude oil. [FRX/]A closely watched report by oil services provider Baker Hughes, meanwhile, showed U.S. drillers added four rigs in the week to Oct. 14. It was the 16th week in a row that oil drillers had gone without making cuts, indicating more production to come. [RIG/U]Despite that, oil prices fell just slightly.Brent LCOc1, the London-traded crude benchmark, settled down 8 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $51.95 a barrel. For the week, it closed flat. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended down 9 cents at $50.35. It rose about 1 percent on the week.""There's no big news to drive the market,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Chicago brokerage Price Futures Group.He described the oil rig count rise of four as ""anti-climatic."" Most analysts have said rigs need to rise by at least 10 in a week to have a sustained bearish impact on prices. For now, many think that prices could continue rising in the near term on expectations related to output cuts proposed by OPEC.Oil prices have trended higher since Sept. 27, with Brent gaining about 13 percent and hitting one year highs above $53, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced its first planned output cut in eight years. OPEC plans to rein in a global supply glut that forced crude to crash from mid-2014 highs above $100 and has asked other major producers, including Russia, to join in cutting output. [OPEC/M]""Between now and November, what OPEC will be trying to do is a lot of jawboning to move prices higher and the market is likely to respond,"" said Jim Williams at consultancy WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas.In Thursday's trade, both Brent and WTI rose, continuing their recent upward momentum, despite the U.S. government reporting the first domestic crude inventory build in six weeks. Market participants had focused then on larger-than-expected drawdowns in diesel, gasoline and other fuel stockpiles reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

364,"   By Ethan Lou | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices settled down on Monday, weighed by oversupply concerns, with a spike in trade volume driving U.S prices below $50, but losses were limited amid a projected drop in American shale output. Trades in U.S. crude futures contracts soared to 12,932 barrels during the minute of 9:35 a.m. EDT (1335 GMT), the highest since Oct. 13, as traders sold off contracts ahead of their Oct. 20 expiry date.Prices rose slightly in the afternoon, as U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed shale oil production was expected to fall by 30,000 barrels per day (bdp) in November.International benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 fell 43 cents, or 0.8 percent, from the last settlement to close at $51.52 per barrel, after hitting a session low of $51.16 a barrel.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) closed at $49.94 per barrel, down 41 cents, or 0.8 percent, after hitting a session low of $49.47.Analysts said traders had accumulated a high number of long positions, and were looking to sell ahead of their contracts' expiry date as the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission limits the number they can hold.  ""There was a huge net speculative long position,"" said Kyle Cooper, analyst at ION Energy in Houston. ""You do have to get out of positions.""Data from energy monitoring service Genscape showed a draw in crude stockpiles at the storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.  But traders said WTI was still under pressure from a report on Friday by oil services provider Baker Hughes, which showed U.S. drillers added four rigs in the week to Oct. 14. [RIG/U]     Donald Morton, who runs an energy-trading desk at Herbert J. Sims & Co in Fairfield, Connecticut, said the projected decline in U.S. shale production bumped the market only slightly. ""It wasn't a game changer for the day,"" he said. ""We rallied 25 cents a barrel, only to give it back for the most part.""Analysts said that while the market was supported by expectations that members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would take action to support prices late next month, oversupply continued to weigh.  OPEC agreed in September to cut supply to between 32.5 million and 33.0 million bpd, and expects to finalize the details of the deal at its meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.OPEC pumped a record 33.6 million bpd of crude oil in September, with some members signaling they plan further increases.

It was the 16th week in a row that oil drillers had gone without making cuts, indicating more production to come.International benchmark Brent crude oil futures were also down, shedding 20 cents from their last settlement to $51.75 per barrel.

Despite Monday's falls, analysts said that traders were cautious about driving the market much further down, largely because of a plan by OPEC to cut output in an initiative to rein in a global production overhang, which currently sees around half a million barrels of crude pumped every day in excess of demand.OPEC is scheduled to meet on November 30 to discuss a production cut. The producer cartel hopes non-OPEC members, particularly Russia, will join a potential cut.""With (non-OPEC member) Russia expressing an interest to join the agreement, investors are reluctant to get too bearish,"" ANZ bank said on Monday.(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Michael Perry)",2016-10-17,BHI,"Sun Oct 16, 2016 | 8:35pm EDT",Oil prices fall on latest rise in U.S. drilling,http://www.reuters.com//article/global-oil-idUSL4N1CN03V?type=companyNews
366,"  The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States this week rose by the most in two months, extending its second-best streak of no cuts into a 17th straight week, with analysts expecting more additions as crude prices hold over $50 a barrel.Drillers added 11 oil rigs in the week to Oct. 21, bringing the total count up to 443, the most since February, but still below the 594 rigs seen a year ago, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc on Friday.That 17-week streak of not cutting rigs matched a stretch in 2010, making it the second-longest run since 1987, following 19 weeks in 2011.The Baker Hughes oil rig count plunged from a record of 1,609 in October 2014 to a six-year low of 316 in May after crude prices collapsed from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to near $26 in February 2016 due to a global oil glut.But after U.S. crude briefly climbed over $50 a barrel in May and June, drillers have added 127 oil rigs. Analysts said prices over $50 were high enough to prompt energy firms to return to the well pad. About two-thirds of the rigs added since May, or 75, were in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, bringing the total there up to 212, the most since November 2015.U.S. crude futures continued to trade over $50 a barrel for much of this week, spurred by continued talk of an OPEC production cut and a surprisingly large drop in U.S. inventories for the sixth week out of seven. [O/R]That put the front-month on track to rise for a fifth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March, gaining about 18 percent during that time. With oil prices expected to continue rising in 2017 and 2018 amid a forecast tightening of the supply-demand balance, analysts said energy firms will boost spending on drilling.Futures were trading above $53 a barrel for calendar 2017 and around $55 for calendar 2018. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast total oil and natural gas rigs would average 500 in 2016, 666 in 2017 and 876 in 2018.That compares with an average of 978 oil and gas rigs active in 2015 and 486 so far this year, according to Baker Hughes data.

379,"  U.S. oil drillers cut rigs this week for the first time since June, ending a 17-week recovery in the rig count, even as crude prices mostly held over $50 a barrel this month, the key level analysts said should lead to more drilling.Drillers cut 2 oil rigs in the week to Oct. 28, bringing the total down to 441, compared with 578 rigs a year ago, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday.That ended the longest streak of not cutting oil rigs since 2011 started after crude briefly climbed over $50 a barrel in May and June and held at that level for most of October. During those 17 weeks, drillers added 113 rigs.Despite the overall decline, drillers added five oil rigs in the Bakken shale in North Dakota, the biggest weekly increase in the region since August 2014, bringing the total there to 35, the most since February.The U.S. oil rig count plunged from a record 1,609 in October 2014 to a six-year low of 316 in May after crude collapsed from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to near $26 in February 2016 due to a global oil glut. U.S. crude futures traded around $50 a barrel for much of this week, but slipped below that level and were set to decline for the first week in six on doubts about whether global producers will agree on an output cut big enough to curb a glut that has weighed on the market for two years. [O/R]But with oil prices still expected to rise in 2017 and 2018 with a projected tightening of the supply-demand balance, analysts forecast energy firms will follow through on plans to boost spending on new drilling in coming years.Futures were trading near $52 a barrel for calendar 2017 and near $54 for calendar 2018. Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said this week in a note that its capital expenditure tracking showed nine exploration and production (E&P) companies, including Cabot Oil and Gas Corp and Devon Energy Corp, planned to increase spending by an average of 42 percent in 2017 over 2016.Cowen said that forecast 2017 increase followed an estimated 43 percent decline in 2016 spending below 2015 levels for the 65 E&P companies it tracks. Since most wells produce both oil and natural gas, Cowen forecast increased spending in 2017 would boost average oil and gas rig counts to 634 in 2017 and 732 in 2018 from 514 in 2016.That compares with an average of 978 oil and gas rigs active in 2015, according to Baker Hughes data.

383,"   By Rob Cox | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric is taking its motto ""imagination at work"" to heart. The deal it has just cooked up with Baker Hughes, an oilfield-services rival, sets an intriguing precedent for the $267 billion industrial behemoth. The finances of the arrangement may stack up for shareholders, too. But what could set this transaction apart is GE's implicit recognition that the sum of its many parts may be more valuable than the whole.In merging its oil and gas unit with $27 billion Baker Hughes, GE accomplishes a few worthy objectives. It expands its footprint in an industry still coping with the ructions of the oil-patch bust and the prospect of relatively low energy prices for years to come. The new Baker Hughes should rank as one of the top three providers of services to wildcatters. By crunching the division led by Lorenzo Simonelli into Baker Hughes, GE ring-fences its exposure to this volatile business while nabbing a 62.5 percent interest in the public rump. By GE's own arithmetic, the deal's $1.6 billion of promised synergies - a quarter of them from enhanced revenue - are worth $14 billion today. GE's share would come to $8.75 billion, covering the $7.4 billion it's paying as a dividend to Baker Hughes owners. Maintaining its oil and gas business as a publicly traded company also provides an acquisition currency to pursue other transactions in the sector, though executives said reaping synergies remains the first order of business. GE also has the option of spinning out the entire business to its own shareholders. The deal also creates a transparent mechanism for valuing a key part of GE's portfolio. That represents a break from the existing GE order. The conglomerate run by Jeff Immelt was swift to enumerate the benefits that will accrue from the new Baker Hughes' association with the parent - including what it calls the GE Store and its industrial internet platform, Predix. If the oil and gas business can be more efficiently separated, though, why not other businesses like power, renewable energy, aviation, healthcare or transportation?There may be specific reasons why Baker Hughes makes more sense as a controlled subsidiary, such as tax issues or the volatility of the business. But it creates a precedent that imaginative shareholders will industriously apply to other parts of the GE empire.",2016-10-31,BHI,"Mon Oct 31, 2016 | 5:20pm EDT",GE suggests bold new thinking with Baker Hughes,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-baker-hughes-m-a-breakingviews-idUSKBN12V1WE?type=companyNews

""This is a good deal for all of the investors,"" said Lorenzo Simonelli, head of GE's oil and gas business who will lead the new entity, to be called ""Baker Hughes, a GE company.""GE is already the world's largest oilfield equipment maker, supplying blowout preventers, pumps and compressors used in exploration and production. GE also has invested heavily in large data processing services just as the oil industry eyes its potential to boost oil recovery.Baker Hughes, by contrast, is seen as one of the world leaders in horizontal drilling, chemicals used to frack and other services key to oil production.The new company will vault Baker Hughes's market share ahead of rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N), which tried and failed to buy Baker until the deal collapsed last May, and also compete heavily with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), the world's largest oilfield service provider, for customers.Simonelli called Baker CEO Martin Craighead after the Halliburton deal collapsed, seeking some kind of business combination, with negotiations evolving over time to Monday's announcement.""Neither Lorenzo (Simonelli) or I needed to do this. We both followed our fiduciary responsibility,"" Craighead said in an interview.        GE will own 62.5 percent of the new publicly-traded company. The deal is expected to close in mid-2017.GE will have to pay $1.3 billion to Baker Hughes if the deal does collapse in what would be yet another windfall for Baker Hughes after Halliburton was forced to pay it $3.5 billion earlier this year when those companies' merger collapsed. For graphic on GE and Baker Huges merger click tmsnrt.rs/2e5Y3xa""We don't anticipate anything like what we've encountered before happening again,"" Craighead said, stressing he expects the GE tie-up to be blessed by regulators.GE and Baker Hughes will reach out to the Justice Department and European antitrust enforcers on Monday, according to a source close to the company. GE will argue to antitrust enforcers - who stopped the deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes just months ago - that their deal is complementary, and that they are committed to any remedy needed to win approval, the source said.A small part of GE's business is selling equipment to Baker Hughes' competitors and it will continue those sales, the source said.All of GE's oil and gas business, which generated roughly 14 percent of GE's revenue last year, will go into the new company, leaving no energy units behind in its former parent, Simonelli said. The ""best performers"" from the existing GE and Baker Hughes will form new management teams, he added, declining to comment on potential layoffs. Analysts said there was little overlap between the businesses that would worry regulators.""I don't see any overlaps, significant overlaps,"" said Tom Seng, a veteran of the energy business who teaches at the University of Tulsa. OIL NEAR $50 The deal comes at a time when North American oil and gas producers are putting rigs back to work after a near-freeze in activity caused by a slump in oil prices that began mid-2014.But the deal is predicated on a forecast for oil prices to rise to $60 per barrel by 2019, GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told investors Monday. ""This is a very compelling time for the deal,"" Immelt said, noting he expects $1.6 billion in annual cost savings by 2020.Global oil prices LCOc1 have risen by a third this year to near $50 a barrel.Craighead, who will become vice chairman of the new company, echoed Immelt's confidence.""We see growth under any market environment,"" Craighead said in an interview. ""Our customers continue to spend massive amounts of money.""The industrywide push for pumping more oil and natural gas at cheaper costs should only accelerate that trend, he said. Activist investor Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management owns about 0.8 percent of GE as of June 30, told CNBC the new company would be able to go ""nose-to-nose"" with Schlumberger.Shareholders of Baker Hughes, which had a market value of about $26 billion as of Friday, will get a special one-time cash dividend from GE of $17.50 per share - or $7.4 billion - after the deal closes. The new company, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will have dual headquarters in Houston and London.

[O/R] But with oil prices still expected to rise in 2017 and 2018 with a projected tightening of the supply-demand balance, analysts continued to expect energy firms to follow through on previously announced plans to boost spending on new drilling in coming years.Futures were trading near $47 a barrel for calendar 2017 and near $50 for calendar 2018. Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said this week in a note that its capital expenditure tracking showed 17 exploration and production (E&P) companies, including ConocoPhillips and Concho Resources Inc, planned to increase spending by an average of 33 percent in 2017 over 2016.Cowen said that forecast 2017 increase followed an estimated 48 percent decline in 2016 and a 35 percent decline in 2015 for the 65 E&P companies it tracks.

398,"   By Ethan Lou | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices settled higher on Friday, closing out a strong week that saw crude buoyed by growing expectations that OPEC will find a way to cap production at the end of the month.For the week, Brent and U.S. crude both rose roughly 5 percent, their first weekly gains in about a month.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is moving closer to finalizing its first deal since 2008 to limit output, with most members prepared to offer Iran flexibility on production volumes, ministers and sources said.Iran has been the main stumbling block for capping production. While it has not yet responded to the proposal, the flexibility shown by others suggests OPEC members may be coming nearer to consensus as the Nov. 30 meeting approaches.Brent notched a daily rise of 37 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $46.86 per barrel. Brent also had its first weekly increase in five weeks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 27 cents, or 0.6 percent, for the day, at $45.69 a barrel. It posted its first weekly increase in four.Crude has been moving up and down based on statements by OPEC members ahead of its Nov. 30 meeting, said James L. Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. ""It kind of depends on which side of the bed the OPEC ministers wake up,"" he said of oil prices. ""People keep digesting and re-digesting the news."" Williams said prices could fall below $40 if OPEC does not reach a deal on Nov. 30. Stephen Brennock of oil brokerage PVM said there were still obstacles for OPEC to overcome.

399,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices fell slightly on Wednesday amid investor doubts that OPEC will agree to a production cut large enough to make a significant dent in the global glut of crude as U.S. drilling rises. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will meet next week on Nov. 30 in Vienna to decide on the details of an agreement to cut output that the group has been trying to hammer out since September.Oil prices fluctuated throughout the day, starting lower in the morning and later briefly turning positive after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly fell 1.3 million barrels last week after three straight weeks of builds. [EIA/S] Reports that U.S. drillers added rigs this week tempered the gains ahead of the settlement. [RIG/U]In the U.S. market, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 settled down 7 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $47.96 a barrel. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled down 17 cents, or 0.35 percent at $48.95 a barrel.   Calendar spreads, the difference in price between one month and the next in the futures market, showed little signs that traders are pricing in a big change in market fundamentals.    The front to second-month WTI calendar spread CLc1-CLc2 traded at its widest level in seven months on Tuesday, although it narrowed slightly on Wednesday. The one to six-month spread CLc1-CLc6 traded at one of the widest levels since August.The WTI cash roll, which allows physical traders to roll long positions forward, traded down to negative $1.80 a barrel on Tuesday, the weakest since March.All are indications that traders expect little change in oversupply in the market in the near term. ""Looking at the forward curve, the spread has gotten substantially weaker on the WTI side ... so that's bearish and pressures the front of the curve,"" said Tariq Zahir, an analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. ""There's going to be some cut, but is Saudi Arabia really going to take the lion's share of the cut?"" Doubts remain over whether the group will agree to a proposed cut of 4 percent to 4.5 percent that has been discussed. That would imply a supply cut of more than 1.2 million barrels per day, according to Reuters calculations. Iraq has been one of the more reluctant members to agree to a cut, but Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters on Wednesday in Baghdad that they were willing to lower their output. Separately, non-OPEC member Russia has said it would cut production, but domestic oil companies have not worked out details, muddying the outlook for cutting output.U.S. oil drillers added rigs this week, as shale producers boost spending to capture forecast higher crude prices in coming months. The increase thus far in November is the largest since July. Drillers added three oil rigs in the week to Nov. 23, bringing the total count up to 474, the most since January, but still below the 555 rigs seen a year ago, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N).
