3,"  * Spot prices at highest point since 2008* Output down by as much as 2.2 bcfd* California says feels shortages* Noble gets cold weather boost in IsraelHOUSTON, Feb 6 Unusually frigid weather was blamed for slipping output of natural gas in the United States on Thursday as California warned of short supplies and No. 2 U.S. producer Chesapeake Energy Corp said foul weather hurt its operations.The comments from Chesapeake Chief Executive Doug Lawler came as spot prices for natural gas, widely used to fuel power plants, spiked to the highest levels since 2008.Freezing temperatures across the country this winter have pushed demand to all-time highs and filled the pipeline system to capacity, and at the same time prompted a number of companies to say foul weather has snarled production.The Independent System Operator in California issued a conservation alert saying ""a shortage of natural gas triggered by extreme cold weather in much of the United States and Canada is impacting fuel supplies to Southern CA power plants and reducing electricity generation."" California is facing a severe drought which could affect hydropower. Estimated U.S. natural gas output is running about 0.8 billion cubic feet per day (bfcd) lower than the 30-day moving average and is off 1.5 bcfd from the start of this year when temperatures were more moderate, according to Thomson Reuters Analytics - which sees current U.S. pure dry gas production of 65.2 bcfd.Bentek Energy, an energy analytics firm, said U.S. production fell to 64.5 bcfd on Thursday, down some 2.2 bcfd from normal levels because of freeze-offs. Cold weather can cause wells to malfunction and contribute to ice storms that make transport difficult. Bentek said basins in the Southeast and midcontinent were contributing to the most significant impacts, down 1.4 bcfd.Chesapeake's average daily oil and gas output in December was well below its expectations due to ""weather challenges"" that continued into January and February, Lawler told analysts on a conference call on Thursday.Fourth-quarter and first-quarter production will be affected by the icy conditions that hampered some of the company's operations, but output should ""ramp up"" on a sequential basis in the second quarter, Lawler said. On Tuesday, Chuck Meloy, an executive at Anadarko Petroleum Corp, said on a conference call the company's operations in Colorado were finally returning to normal.""The Wattenberg field has suffered through the floods and the polar vortex and I'm sure the locusts are coming,"" he joked. ""But ... our production is coming back.""Gas for Friday delivery at Henry Hub, the benchmark supply point in Louisiana, traded as high as $9 per million British thermal units early Thursday, its highest level since August 2008, traders said. Futures prices were up more than 1 percent on Thursday after rising more than 7 percent earlier in the day.They pared gains when U.S. Energy Information Agency data showed an estimated natural gas draw through Jan. 31 of 262 billion cubic feet, lower than the 270 bcf forecasted by analysts.In Israel, Noble Energy Inc said cold weather affected results in the fourth quarter, but in a different way than its peers.A rare December snowstorm in Israel, where the company has begun supplying natural gas for heating and electricity generation, sharply boosted demand.The jump artificially inflated the company's production compared with year-ago figures. The company also forecast first-quarter production that will effectively be below fourth-quarter numbers due to the temporary spike in Israeli demand.Executives said they expect production to slowly increase this year, and told investors they do not expect a similar jump in sales this year.""The first quarter is really right on track with where we expected and right on track to deliver the growth rate that we've laid out this year,"" Chief Executive Charles Davidson said on a conference call with investors.",2014-02-06,CHK,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 5:39pm EST","UPDATE 2-Freezes hit U.S. natural gas output, California supply",http://www.reuters.com//article/energy-natgas-weather-idUSL2N0LB1I420140206?type=companyNews
4,"   By Anna Driver and Swetha Gopinath  Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) on Thursday cut its capital budget for the year by more than a fifth as Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler focuses on drilling in U.S. shale basins with the highest returns, but the company's oil production outlook disappointed and the stock fell more than 7 percent.Analysts at energy-focused investment bank Simmons & Co in Houston said the company's forecast for oil growth of 1 percent to 5 percent, a figure that does not adjust for 2013 asset sales, fell short of their expectations for growth of 12 percent.The Oklahoma City-based company said it would spend between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion this year, about 20 percent less than its 2013 capital expenditure estimate of $6.9 billion.Lawler, who replaced Chesapeake's co-founder and former CEO Aubrey McClendon in June, has pledged to cut costs and debt while increasing oil and gas production in the company's most profitable fields. The company has undergone a restructuring under Lawler that included the elimination of 10 percent of its workforce.""We are going to be a low-cost producer, and we are going to be efficient in our investment,"" Lawler told investors on a conference call.He said the company is still very focused on growing its liquids output, but will not drill for oil in places where returns are not good. About 35 percent of Chesapeake's 2014 budget is earmarked for drilling in the Eagle Ford shale field. Including capitalized interest, Chesapeake still faces a gap between operating cash flow and capital expenditures of $1 billion this year. Asset sales are planned, but the company declined to provide any additional details.Chesapeake was targeting more than $4 billion from asset sales in 2013. On an absolute basis, Chesapeake is targeting 2014 production growth of 2 percent to 4 percent, it said on Thursday.Adjusting for 2013 asset sales, the company said it expected overall production growth to rise 8 percent to 10 percent this year. Oil output is forecast to rise 8 percent to 12 percent, natural gas liquids production to increase 44 percent to 49 percent and natural gas output to climb 4 percent to 6 percent.MORE RIGS IN THE HAYNESVILLE SHALE  A rise in natural gas and natural gas liquids output from Chesapeake's operations in the central United States, the Utica shale in Ohio and Marcellus shale in the U.S. Northeast is also expected to contribute to production growth in 2014.Chesapeake also said it has been adding rigs in the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana, a move that puzzled some analysts who contend that natural gas prices are not high enough to drill profitable dry gas wells.Drilling for dry gas, which does not contain high amounts of liquids such as propane and butane that can be stripped out and sold at a premium, has slowed dramatically in formations like the Haynesville and Barnett Shale in Texas due to low prices. Still, Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso told investors that the company's Haynesville wells were ""highly economic.""""We are pleased to be in a position to return some activity to the Haynesville in 2014,"" he said.As a result of cost-cutting initiatives, Chesapeake expects production expenses to fall by about 10 percent to $4.25 to $4.75 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) in 2014.The company expects general and administrative expenses to slide 25 percent this year.After tumbling 7.4 percent to a session low of $24.27, Chesapeake's stock trimmed losses to trade down $1.71 at $24.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting By Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Marguerita Choy and Jan Paschal)",2014-02-06,CHK,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 12:55pm EST","Chesapeake to spend less in 2014, targets higher output",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-chesapeake-capex-idUSBREA151DP20140206?type=companyNews

But the former boss retains financial ties to the second-largest U.S. natural gas company, and he is using them to try to change company plans.A firm run by McClendon is attempting to force Chesapeake to drill 12 multi-million dollar wells in Louisiana's Haynesville Shale at a time when Chesapeake is trying to rein in spending and cut debt to focus on other shales, according to a lawyer for Chesapeake.As a legacy of his tenure as a Chesapeake founder, McClendon has personal stakes of 2.5 percent in nearly all of the tens of thousands of wells the company developed. He is also entitled to a slice of new ones, and he has asked Louisiana regulators to order Chesapeake to follow his drilling plan, saying more natural gas production on the land would benefit the state and landowners.The move is a sign that the interests of both sides are diverging, but existing contracts mean the two sides will likely be partners for years to come.REGULATORY SPAT McClendon's Larchmont Resources LLC, which holds his Chesapeake well stakes, has petitioned regulators from Louisiana's Office of Conservation to rule a dozen new natural gas wells are needed in two fields where Chesapeake has already drilled four. The Office of Conservation oversees the state's hydrocarbon industry.At an often heated hearing on Larchmont's application in January, Larchmont's and Chesapeake's lawyers squared off arguing their case before a panel of regulators.David Ogwyn, a lawyer who represented McClendon's firm, argued at the hearing that more wells were needed on Chesapeake's acreage to recover the maximum amount of natural gas in the reservoir.""Chesapeake is seeking to use their designation as operator as a shield,"" to stall development and ""hold hostage the minerals of the state,"" Ogwyn said.Chesapeake counters that it, as the majority partner and operator, would normally call the shots on drilling.A minority stakeholder like McClendon shouldn't be able to force Chesapeake ""to drill wells it doesn't want to drill,"" Randy Songy, a lawyer representing Chesapeake, told the Baton Rouge hearing.""We hope this is the first and last of these wasteful hearings,"" Songy said. Patrick Courreges, a spokesman for Louisiana's Office of Conservation said the request by McClendon may be without precedent. The agency said it is considering whether the minority owner even has the standing to make its request.The Office of Conservation is charged with regulating the production of oil and gas, permitting wells and their spacing, and encouraging development.John-Mark Beaver, a McClendon representative, told regulators that Larchmont is prepared to spend $10 billion drilling shale wells in Louisiana over the next 10 years.He did not say if McClendon had raised any of those funds, but he reminded the commissioner that McClendon ""discovered"" the Haynesville while at Chesapeake, spearheading the first large-scale development in the area.Beaver declined to comment on the specifics of Larchmont's plans after the hearing.Two landowners who spoke to the panel supported McClendon.""I want to see this acreage developed,"" Ray Lasseigne, who owns mineral rights on the disputed acreage, told regulators. If the commissioner handling the case rules in favor of McClendon's firm, lawyers and people familiar with the case said, Chesapeake likely will drill the wells, given the regulator's expansive authority. Decisions are usually handed down within 30 days of a hearing.WHY RUSH? Chesapeake is undergoing a rigorous belt-tightening following years of hefty spending by McClendon, who acquired millions of acres in North American shale basins, purchases that helped swell the company's debt as high as $14 billion in 2008.Drilling a Haynesville well typically costs around $8 million to $10 million, according to analysts, so a dozen new wells could cost an additional $120 million.While opposing McClendon at the hearing, Chesapeake on February 6 it said it would drill in the Haynesville this year, spending about 10 percent there of its roughly $5 billion drilling budget. It is not clear that the increase has anything to do with McClendon's push and neither side would comment.Chesapeake's plan to put more rigs in the Haynesville took analysts by surprise because the company operates in other fields, including the oil-producing Eagle Ford in Texas, that bring better returns. ""I don't know why anyone would aggressively go after Haynesville production right now outside of core drilling areas,"" Mark Hanson, oil and gas company analyst with Morningstar in Chicago.A spokesman for McClendon declined to comment. Many gas wells drilled in Louisiana would currently be unprofitable because most lack lucrative liquids, like oil, but natural gas futures have rallied more than 40 percent so far this year as cold weather saps supplies. That has prompted bullish talk in the sector.HE'LL BE AROUND McClendon became a towering figure in the U.S. energy industry before over-spending caused capital shortfalls at Chesapeake. The company is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, after Reuters reported in April 2012 that McClendon arranged for more than $1 billion in loans to finance his share of drilling costs from firms that were also lenders to Chesapeake.Chesapeake's board cleared McClendon of any intentional wrongdoing last year, however, and McClendon retains substantial respect among a large swath of the industry and investors.Since leaving the company he founded, McClendon, 54, started his own oil and gas firm and has already raised about $4 billion for drilling in the United States.The plan that gave McClendon stakes in Chesapeake wells, called the Founders Well Participation Program, is slated to end for new wells on June 30 of this year.Even after the program ends, though, McClendon will remain ""one of the company's largest joint interest owners,"" according to an SEC filing. By contract his stakes guarantee him quarterly updates from Chesapeake on operations.And while McClendon's firms will pay $50,000 monthly for some services beginning in July, Chesapeake will also extend a $50,000 per month credit ""to reduce the marketing fees billed by the company or its affiliates,"" according to the agreement.The conclusion, said one Chesapeake investor who asked to remain anonymous, is that McClendon will have a business relationship with Chesapeake for years to come.""They are going to have him around for the next 30 years if the wells keep producing,"" the person said.(Reporting By Anna Driver; Editing by Terry Wade and Peter Henderson)",2014-02-25,CHK,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 8:51am EST",Chesapeake's ex-CEO McClendon tries to force new drilling,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-chesapeake-mcclendon-insight-idUSBREA1O0PS20140225?type=companyNews

The cleanup operation has been seen by analysts as a distraction from the company's ability to increase oil and natural gas production.Chesapeake's stock fell as much as 8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.Trying to calm concerns, Doug Lawler, who became CEO last June, promised that most of the charges were behind the company.""We believe that most of the charges related to our organizational restructuring are in the rear view mirror and we look forward to reporting fewer adjustments to earnings going forward,"" he told analysts on a conference call.The company is negotiating a civil settlement with Michigan officials to try to end a criminal investigation into whether it colluded to keep oil and gas lease prices artificially low in the state.

17,"   By Joshua Schneyer and Anna Driver | NEW YORK/HOUSTON  NEW YORK/HOUSTON Encana Corp and Chesapeake Energy Corp are negotiating civil settlements with the state of Michigan to try to end its criminal investigation into whether the energy companies colluded to keep oil and gas lease prices artificially low in the state.Encana is hopeful that a settlement will be finalized within a few weeks, said Gregory Curtner, a lawyer representing Encana in a separate civil antitrust lawsuit, during a February 14 court hearing.""I can fill you in on the status of the Michigan Attorney General investigation because I'm handling that,"" Curtner told Michigan Western District Magistrate Judge Joseph Scoville.""We are at a stage, as is Chesapeake, of hopefully reaching a civil resolution which will close the criminal investigation,"" he said, according to a transcript of the hearing. The comments had not been previously reported.Encana and Chesapeake have been the subject of state and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust probes since 2012, when Reuters published an investigation showing the companies' executives exchanged emails to discuss how they could cooperate to suppress lease prices in the state. (r.reuters.com/deg27v)Encana and Chesapeake have denied any collusion.The potential terms of the settlements remain unclear. Encana and Chesapeake declined to comment. Curtner, a Michigan-based partner at law firm Schiff Hardin, did not respond to requests for comment.Legal experts said the oil and gas companies may be required to pay fines to settle the probe, though the size of any monetary penalties remain unclear.One potential benchmark: in April 2013, a federal judge approved a Justice Department settlement which levied $550,000 in fines against two drilling companies - Gunnison Energy and SG Interests - related to a 2005 agreement not to bid against each other for natural gas leases on federal land in Colorado. The companies paid another $451,000 in fines to settle violations of the federal False Claims Act.""There could be a civil fine,"" said Harry First, an antitrust expert and law professor at New York University. Depending on the terms, a deal that ends Michigan's criminal probe might be considered a victory for the companies, he said. ""If the defendants have reason to believe the state may have a strong criminal case soon, they would be inclined to come to a settlement to avoid that,"" said First, a former antitrust chief at the Office of New York's Attorney General.Joy Yearout, a spokeswoman for Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, said the investigation is ongoing and declined to offer more details.Calgary-based Encana and Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake were the top lease-buyers in Michigan's Collingwood Shale during a speculative land boom in 2010.After a land lease frenzy pushed Michigan prices as high as $3,000 per acre in mid-2010, the executives discussed proposals to divide bidding responsibilities for nine private landowners and counties in Michigan, according to emails reviewed by Reuters.In emails, then Chesapeake CEO Aubrey McClendon and other high-ranking Chesapeake and Encana executives discussed how to keep lease prices from rising by avoiding ""bidding each other up."" Michigan land lease prices fell sharply following the email exchanges, Reuters found. The boards of both Chesapeake and Encana have conducted internal investigations and said they found no wrongdoing. In earlier statements, the companies have acknowledged holding talks about forming a joint venture in Michigan during 2010, but said no agreement was ever reached.LOOMING DEADLINE Michigan's Attorney General wants to resolve the matter before a four-year criminal statute of limitations deadline expires this spring or summer, Curtner said at the February 14 hearing.""I think we are close to a deal, but we don't have a deal yet,"" Curtner told Scoville. He said he was negotiating the terms with an Assistant Attorney General in Michigan.At least two large Michigan landowners are suing Encana, alleging that its collusion with Chesapeake led them to lose money in their attempts in 2010 to lease land to the companies. Curtner's briefing to Judge Scoville came during a hearing in one of the civil cases. In that case, McClendon and three other Chesapeake and Encana executives asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during depositions, citing Michigan's ongoing criminal investigations, according to court documents and sources familiar with the matter.Encana and Chesapeake may still face risks from a federal investigation into their land leasing activities.""The Antitrust Division's investigation into the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the purchase and lease of oil and gas properties is still open,"" Washington-based Department of Justice spokeswoman Gina Talamona said last Friday.Michigan began its antitrust probe in 2012. Last November, Chesapeake said in a regulatory filing that it had received a new subpoena from Michigan, which is also investigating whether the company violated the state's criminal solicitation law.Market allocation agreements between competitors are illegal under the Federal Sherman Antitrust Act and state laws. In criminal solicitation, a person engages another to commit a crime. A conviction can occur even if the crime never took place if the intent was demonstrated.Four years ago, Northern Michigan became a hot energy prospect after new drilling suggested its Collingwood Shale held big oil and gas reserves, prompting Encana and Chesapeake to snap up acreage.In one email from June 2010, reviewed by Reuters, McClendon wrote to a Chesapeake Vice President that it was time to ""smoke a peace pipe"" with Encana ""if we are bidding each other up."" The Chesapeake VP responded that he had contacted Encana ""to discuss how they want to handle the entities we are both working to avoid us bidding each other up in the interim."" McClendon replied: ""Thanks.""In other emails later that year, the companies' executives discussed a proposal for each to bid for leases in separate Michigan counties at an upcoming state land auction.McClendon, who departed Chesapeake last April and now runs a new company, American Energy Partners, declined requests for comment.(Reporting by Joshua Schneyer in New York and Anna Driver in Houston; Editing by Terry Wade and Tiffany Wu)",2014-02-26,CHK,"Wed Feb 26, 2014 | 8:56am EST","Exclusive: Chesapeake, Encana near settlements on Michigan collusion probe",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-encana-chesapeake-idUSBREA1P0TJ20140226?type=companyNews

28,"  By Joshua Schneyer, Brian Grow and Anna DriverMarch 5 Oil and gas giants Chesapeake Energy  and Encana Corp were charged on Wednesday with colluding to keep oil and gas lease prices artificially low in Michigan, state Attorney General Bill Schuette said.The criminal charges follow a lengthy investigation by Schuette's office into whether the firms -- the biggest land leasers during a speculative oil and gas leasing boom in Michigan's Collingwood Shale region during 2010 -- colluded to keep prices from rising as they acquired land leases from landowners.Michigan began looking into the companies' activities in 2012 after a Reuters investigation found that executives from the two firms discussed proposals to divide bidding responsibilities in the state for nine private landowners and counties in Michigan.""I will aggressively prosecute any company who conspires to break the law,"" Schuette said in a statement.The companies are being charged with one count each of antitrust violations ""relating to a contract or conspiracy in restraint of commerce,"" and one count each of attempted antitrust violations.Under Michigan law, an antitrust violation is considered a misdemeanor, which carries penalties that can include fines and prison terms of up to two years for individuals, and up to a $1 million fine for a corporation.Encana and Chesapeake still face a separate, federal antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice.""This action has no merit and we will vigorously contest it,"" said Chesapeake spokesman Gordon Pennoyer. Encana denies the charges and will ""vigorously defend"" them, company spokesman Jay Averill said in a statement.The boards of both Chesapeake and Encana previously conducted internal investigations and said they found no collusion. The companies have acknowledged holding talks about forming a joint venture in Michigan during 2010, but said no agreement was ever reached.""No agreement was reached and no violation of antitrust law occurred,"" Averill added.In emails reviewed by Reuters in its investigation, then Chesapeake CEO Aubrey McClendon and other high-ranking Chesapeake and Encana executives discussed in 2010 how to keep lease prices on both state and private lands from rising by avoiding ""bidding each other up.""(r.reuters.com/deg27v) The discussions occurred after a land lease frenzy pushed Michigan prices on private lands as high as $3,000 per acre in mid-2010. Lease prices subsequently fell sharply in the state later that year.After prices rose sharply amid intense bidding at a Michigan state land auction in May 2010, ""Chesapeake and Encana agreed not to bid against each other in future lease auctions,"" the Michigan Attorney General alleges in its complaint, reviewed by Reuters. A subsequent state auction in October 2010 ""raised just $10 million on the lease of 273,000 acres, or less than $40 per acre -- over $1,000 per acre less than the May 2010 prices,"" the complaint says.Documents reviewed by Reuters, and first reported in June 2012, show that former Chesapeake CEO McClendon and Jeff Wojahn, the former president of Encana's U.S. unit, were aware of the proposed auction bidding strategy. ""Understand our teams are working on a cooperative approach to state leasing, that's good I think. Anything else out there encouraging to talk about?"" McClendon wrote in an email to Wojahn on October 17, 2010.That chain of internal communications between Chesapeake and Encana executives could help Michigan's case, one legal expert said.""I think the Michigan Attorney General has a strong hand in this case. They have strong evidence and some strong documents,"" said Darren Bush, a former antitrust attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice and a professor of antitrust law at the University of Houston. A spokesman for McClendon declined comment. McClendon left Chesapeake last April and now runs a new company, American Energy Partners.Market allocation agreements between competitors are illegal under the Federal Sherman Antitrust Act and Michigan's Antitrust Reform Act.Encana and Chesapeake executives had been hoping for a civil resolution in Michigan.As recently as Feb. 14, an attorney representing Encana Corp told a judge in a civil antitrust-related case in Michigan that both Encana and Chesapeake were working toward a settlement with the state attorney general that could end his office's criminal investigation into the firms.The U.S. Department of Justice has been looking into the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the purchase and lease of oil and gas properties in Michigan and elsewhere. That investigation is ongoing, the DOJ told Reuters last month.""Michigan is out in front, but the big question now is what the DOJ will do,"" said Harry First, an antitrust law professor at New York University. ""That inquiry could be more serious in terms of fines, and what happens in Michigan could affect the companies' ability to defend against a federal case.""DOJ spokeswoman Gina Talamona declined comment.Chesapeake and Encana are expected to be arraigned on March 19 in a Michigan state court in Cheboygan County, the Attorney General's office said.",2014-03-06,CHK,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 8:43pm EST","UPDATE 1-Chesapeake, Encana face criminal antitrust charges in Michigan",http://www.reuters.com//article/michigan-oil-charges-idUSL1N0M306T20140306?type=companyNews

(r.reuters.com/ker67v)Chesapeake Energy, which will not retain any ownership interest in the new company, has been aggressively trying to repair its balance sheet and cut high spending programs put in place by its co-founder and former CEO, Aubrey McClendon.McClendon left the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer following a tumultuous year which included a liquidity crunch caused by heavy spending on oil and gas properties, a governance crisis and civil and criminal investigations.Doug Lawler, who replaced McClendon in June, said Chesapeake Energy would cut spending by 20 percent in 2014 and sell assets to plug a $1 billion gap between operating cash flow and capital expenditure.Last month, Chesapeake Energy announced the sale of its natural gas compression units and said it was pursuing alternatives for the oilfield services division, including an outright sale or a spin-off. The division, Chesapeake Oilfield, provides equipment to U.S. land-based exploration and production companies, including Chesapeake Energy. It offers services such as drilling, hydraulic fracturing, oilfield rentals and rig relocation.Chesapeake Oilfield reported a loss of $19.7 million in 2013, compared with a profit of $69.6 million a year earlier as margins were hurt due to a rise in operating costs caused by lower utilization rates and pricing pressures. Revenue at the division rose 16 percent to about $2.2 billion in 2013, and accounted for 5 percent of Chesapeake Energy's total revenue of $17.51 billion.Chesapeake Oilfield has been lowering its dependence on its parent company, with both the number of rigs contracted by, and drilling revenue attributable to, Chesapeake Energy falling in the year ended December 31, 2013.Once it is spun off, Chesapeake Oilfield will be named Seventy Seven Energy Inc and will apply to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""SSE"". Chesapeake Oilfield, which has total long-term liabilities of $1.06 billion, did not give the stock distribution ratio for the spin-off, nor say when the spin off would be completed.Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake Energy said it has retained Morgan Stanley & Co.

Michigan's attorney general alleges that Chesapeake conspired with Encana to keep land lease prices artificially low in the state.At the hearing, in a state court in Cheboygan, Encana pleaded no contest to a state charge it attempted to commit antitrust violations during a land leasing spree in 2010 in which it and Chesapeake were the biggest lease buyers. Both companies faced criminal charges of antitrust violations and attempted antitrust violations.The court took Encana's plea under advisement and agreed to dismiss charges against the driller if it fulfilled terms of itscivil settlement over the next 11 months, Encana spokesman Jay Averill said in an emailed statement.As part of Encana's settlement, the company also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in Michigan who are still pursuing a criminal case against Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake.Michigan's charges against the companies, announced by Attorney General Bill Schuette in March, allege they collaborated to ""avoid bidding wars against each other"" in a state land lease auction and in negotiations to acquire leases from private landowners.

37,"   By Brian Grow  May 5 Michigan state prosecutors plan to call a former Encana Corp.  executive to testify on behalf of the state, at a multi-day hearing in their criminal antitrust case against oil and gas companies Chesapeake Energy Corp.  and Encana Corp. that begins Monday.Kurt Froistad, a former land acquisition specialist at Canadian energy giant Encana's U.S. unit until August 2011, was involved in decisions about how to lease land in Michigan during a prospective oil and gas boom there in 2010.He exchanged emails with a counterpart at Chesapeake about dividing up bidding responsibilities between the two companies in nine Michigan counties ahead of an October 2010 state land auction, according to documents previously reported by Reuters.In March, Michigan's attorney general, Bill Schuette, alleged Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake, the second-largest natural gas producer in the United States, and Encana, based in Calgary, colluded to keep oil and gas lease prices artificially low in Michigan during an oil and gas rush in its Collingwood Shale region in 2010.The companies were charged with one count each of antitrust violations ""relating to a contract or conspiracy in restraint of commerce,"" and one count each of attempted antitrust violations.At Monday's probable cause hearing in Michigan district court in Cheboygan, state prosecutors will present evidence supporting the charges. If the court finds sufficient probable cause, the case will move to trial.Chesapeake and Encana both plead not guilty in March and said they would fight the claims. The boards of both companies previously conducted internal investigations and said they found no collusion. The companies have acknowledged holding talks about forming a joint venture in Michigan during 2010, but said no agreement was ever reached.Michigan's criminal investigation began in 2012 after a Reuters report found that top executives from Chesapeake and Encana discussed dividing up bidding responsibilities involving nine private landowners and nine counties in the state. Chesapeake and Encana were the biggest leasers of land during Michigan's short-lived leasing boom in 2010. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PROBE Michigan's Attorney General is pursuing a criminal trial against the companies even as the U.S. Department of Justice has concluded its own probe into whether Chesapeake and Encana colluded in Michigan, without bringing any charges against the firms.On April 30, the companies said they had received closure letters from the Department of Justice ending its investigation of possible antitrust violations related to their land-leasing activities in Michigan. The Justice Department's probe is not completely closed, however.On May 1, Gina Talamona, a spokesperson for the Justice Department's antitrust division said in an emailed statement to Reuters that ""while part of the Antitrust Division's investigation into the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the purchase and lease of oil and gas properties in Michigan has closed, other aspects of the investigation remain open.""She clarified that the ""other aspects"" of Justice's investigation relate to oil and gas leasing activities in states other than Michigan. She did not respond to requests for comment on whether Chesapeake or Encana remain subjects of the investigation, nor which states are involved.A Chesapeake spokesman declined to comment. Jay Averill, an Encana spokesman said, ""We can't provide comment because we are not aware of any ongoing investigation at this time."" In Michigan, the state's antitrust charges against Chesapeake and Encana came nearly two years after Reuters reported on a series of email exchanges between top executives of the companies about land leasing in the state. No current or former executives at either company have been charged by the state.In one email, dated June 16, 2010, former Chesapeake chief executive Aubrey K. McClendon told a Chesapeake deputy that it was time ""to smoke a peace pipe"" with Encana ""if we are bidding each other up."" The Chesapeake vice president responded that he had contacted Encana ""to discuss how they want to handle the entities we are both working to avoid us bidding each other up in the interim.""In addition to former Encana executive Froistad, Michigan state prosecutors plan to call at least nine other witnesses, according to a list provided by the attorney general's office. They include state officials, antitrust experts, and representatives of private Michigan landowners who sought to lease their acreage for oil and gas production during 2010.One aspect of Michigan prosecutor's antitrust claims relate to an alleged bidding strategy that Chesapeake and Encana executives - with the involvement of Froistad --- developed ahead of an auction of state land on October 26, 2010.Bidding at the state's May 2010 auction had been vigorous and contested. That helped the state raise a record $178 million from the sale of more than 118,000 acres, according to a review of state auction data by Reuters. At that auction, 83 percent of the more than 1,200 winning bids had competitive offers.Five months later, at the October auction, the bidding and the results proved remarkably different and far less lucrative. It raised just $9.7 million from the leasing of about 274,000 acres - more than twice the acreage sold in May but almost $170 million less in revenue.Froistad now works as Vice President of Land for Forge Energy LLC in San Antonio, Texas. He said he was ""unable to talk"" when contacted on Sunday.The probable cause hearing in the Michigan antitrust case is expected to last through Thursday, May 8.

Landowners were previously told the mortgages were not a problem, the state alleged.""I will defend and protect the taxpayers of Michigan in the face of fraudulent business practices,"" Schuette said in a press release.Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake said it will fight the charges. ""We believe this action has no merit and we will vigorously contest these baseless allegations,"" said Gordon Pennoyer, a Chesapeake spokesman.

Settlement terms remain confidential, she said.

The companies were charged with one count each of antitrust violations and one count each of attempted antitrust violations. Michigan added a second antitrust violation against Chesapeake in May. Those charges followed a 2012 Reuters report on the two companies negotiations.On May 5, Encana agreed to pay Michigan $5 million in a civil settlement that could clear the company of criminal antitrust charges stemming from its role in the 2010 land leasing spree.Encana pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor state charge that it attempted to commit antitrust violations.

Landowners were previously told the mortgages were not a problem, the state alleged. ""I will defend and protect the taxpayers of Michigan in the face of fraudulent business practices,"" Michigan Attorney General Bill Shuette said in a press release. ""Scamming hardworking Michigan citizens is not how we do business in this state.""A Chesapeake spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A felony complaint filed by the Attorney General charges Chesapeake with one count of ""conducting a criminal enterprise,"" punishable by up to a $100,000 fine, and eight counts of ""false pretenses,"" punishable by a $10,000 fine each or three times the value of money or property involved, whichever is greater. Schuette alleged that, as a result of leasing the oil and gas rights on Michigan landowners' properties then cancelling the deals, ""Chesapeake therefore obtained uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land.""Chesapeake allegedly signed lease with as many as 800 Michigan landowners, but only honored 30 leases, the state alleged.Chesapeake is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges in Michigan state court in Cheboygan on June 25.

Chesapeake had been criticized for McClendon's heavy spending and a governance crisis.Preliminary results from the company's annual meeting, which was webcast, showed that 98 percent of Chesapeake's shareholders who voted backed measures to increase the size of the company's board of directors and to allow individuals or groups owning 3  percent or more of the company's shares to nominate directors.Investors also voted by a 95 percent margin in favor of Chesapeake's pay packages for executives.

For example capital expenditures soared above $13 billion under McClendon as he snapped up millions of acres to drill, but this year Chesapeake said it expects to spend little more than $5 billion.Shares of Chesapeake, which is based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, are trading around a three-year high.

63,"  A judge in Michigan has ruled that Oklahoma-based Chesapeake Energy Corp must face a criminal trial on a charge of bid-rigging with competitor Encana Corp at a 2010 state land lease auction, citing evidence of a conspiracy between the companies that drove state lease prices down sharply.The ruling, issued on Wednesday by Judge Maria Barton of Michigan’s Cheboygan County District Court, dismissed two other criminal charges brought against Chesapeake by the office of Michigan’s Attorney General. The other charges alleged that the company struck a deal with Encana to avoid competing for land leases from private landowners in Michigan, and had attempted antitrust violations against those landowners. “The direct and circumstantial evidence established that the parties did in fact strike an agreement to bid-rig the State sale,” Barton’s ruling says. It cites evidence including an email sent by Encana USA Chief Executive Officer Jeff Wojahn to a landman bidding on Encana’s behalf on the morning of the October, 2010 auction. The email makes reference to a lease area on offer, stating that “This is a Chesapeake area and we will not be bidding.”      Michigan's criminal investigation began in 2012 after a Reuters report found that top executives from Chesapeake and Encana discussed dividing up bidding responsibilities involving nine private landowners and nine counties in the state.

72,"   By Joshua Schneyer  Natural gas and oil producer Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) must face trial on charges of felony racketeering and using false pretenses related to its land-leasing practices, a state judge has ruled.Cheboygan District Court Judge Maria Barton ruled on Monday that Oklahoma-based Chesapeake go to trial on one charge of racketeering and 20 counts of using false pretenses to allegedly defraud private landowners in the state during an oil and gas leasing boom in 2010. Barton ruled after a hearing last month. No trial date has been set.State Attorney General Bill Schuette brought the charges against Chesapeake in June, alleging the company directed its leasing agents to lock up land positions in the state by offering signing bonuses to private landowners.Later, when Chesapeake's competitors in the region slowed down their leasing, Chesapeake's agents allegedly canceled the deals, claiming that mortgages on the properties were grounds for not honoring the deals after earlier assurances that would not be an issue. As a result, Chesapeake obtained ""uncompensated land options from these landowners by false pretenses, and prevented competitors from leasing the land,"" the state charged.   In a statement, Chesapeake said it believes the charges are without merit and expects to prevail at trial.  ""We continue to believe the Attorney General is attempting to criminalize basic contract disputes,"" said company spokesman Gordon Pennoyer. ""Chesapeake remains focused on moving past these legacy issues from 2010 and executing our business strategies to drive profitable growth."" The criminal charges against Chesapeake followed a 2011 investigation by Reuters into the company's land-leasing tactics during a speculative leasing boom in the northern part of the state during 2010, including its use of a shell company to cancel land deals with more than 800 private landowners. Chesapeake, which was then led by Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon who later left the company amid allegations of mismanagement, has denied wrongdoing. Schuette's office said the racketeering charge is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000. The 20 counts of using false pretenses are punishable by fines of $10,000 for each count, or triple the value of the money or property involved, whichever is greater. Chesapeake will also go on trial in Michigan on antitrust charges for its alleged role in bid-rigging at a state land auction in 2010, following an earlier ruling by Barton in July.  In that case, Chesapeake is charged with colluding with a competitor, Encana Corp (ECA.TO), to suppress land lease values in the state in 2010. Michigan officials began looking into their activities in 2012 after a Reuters investigation found that executives from the two companies discussed proposals to divide bidding responsibilities in a state land auction and in deals with several private landowners. Chesapeake has denied any wrongdoing. Encana reached a settlement with Schuette's office earlier this year related to the antitrust charges.

Shares were little changed in post-market trading after closing at $31.97. Chesapeake shares, on the other hand, gained as much as 18 percent during regular trading.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Ryan Oatman said that according to his calculations Southwestern would pay $9,625 per acre for the assets.The deal is positive for Chesapeake and other Utica and Marcellus shale players as it marks the first time the brokerage has seen a company pay more than $5,000 per acre for assets in the area, Oatman added. Southwestern Chief Executive Steven Mueller, however, said on a conference call that the deal was based more on the potential of the assets, and he expected it to contribute significantly to cash flow in a few years.The company, which already has assets in Fayetteville shale and northeastern Pennsylvania Marcellus, will add 256 operated and producing horizontal wells and 179 non-operated horizontal wells. It plans to deploy four to six rigs in 2015 for the new assets and increase that number to 11 rigs by 2017. The average net daily production from the wells was about 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent in September, consisting of 184 million cubic feet of gas, 20,000 barrels of natural gas liquids and 5,000 barrels of condensate, Chesapeake said.Chesapeake, the second-largest U.S. producer of natural gas, has been selling assets to reduce debt and improve profitability after Aubrey McClendon was forced out as CEO in April last year over spending.Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake said the deal would not impact its growth profile and that it expected its 2015 production outlook to remain at 7-10 percent growth adjusted for asset sales.Southwestern said it would fund the transaction with its existing revolving credit facility and a $5 billion loan from Bank of America.

80,"  (Adds quotes, analyst comment, share price)By Anna DriverNov 5 Chesapeake Energy Corp, the second-largest U.S. producer of natural gas, on Wednesday reported a bigger-than-expected 8 percent increase in third-quarter profit on higher output from lower-cost shale wells in Texas, Louisiana and Ohio.Shares of Chesapeake rose 6.3 percent to $22.64 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.The results show Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler's efforts to attack a bloated cost structure and improve capital efficiency are working so far. Lawler was named CEO in June 2013 after the ouster of Aubrey McClendon. ""The company's focus on expense reduction was evident both quantitatively and qualitatively, with the company announcing sharply lower well costs across all core operating areas,"" Sterne Agee analyst Tim Rezvan said in a note to clients.Profit rose to $169 million, or 26 cents per share, from $156 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding costs to redeem preferred shares and other one-time items, earnings were 38 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 33 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Oil and gas output, adjusted for asset sales, averaged 726,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 11 percent from a year earlier.Analysts at energy-focused investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt had estimated Chesapeake's third-quarter production at 704,000 boepd and characterized the results as a ""strong beat"" in a note to clients. Even though output was higher, Chesapeake managed to drive down wells costs. For example in the Eagle Ford, they fell to an average of $6 million from $6.9 million.""We are gaining significant momentum in all of our operating areas where we continue to create more value with less capital,"" Lawler told investors on a conference call, adding that Chesapeake is now a more profitable and less complex company.The Oklahoma City company said it still expected to spend $5 billion to $5.4 billion this year. It plans to release the 2015  budget early next year.As of Wednesday, Chesapeake shares are down about 12 percent year to date.

90,"   By Brian Grow | OKLAHOMA CITY  OKLAHOMA CITY Chesapeake Energy Corp filed suit Tuesday alleging its founder and former chief executive, Aubrey K. McClendon, stole confidential company data during his last months on the job in order to launch his new oil and gas empire.McClendon, 55, ""misappropriated highly sensitive trade secrets from Chesapeake"" and ""subsequently used these trade secrets for the benefit of"" a company he founded in 2013, American Energy Partners LP, according to the civil complaint filed by Chesapeake in Oklahoma County District Court.In the suit, Chesapeake claims that McClendon asked his assistant to print maps and data about unleased acreage and that McClendon also sent himself blind copies of the same documents at a personal email address during his last months at the company. The company says it discovered McClendon's actions through a forensic analysis of his Chesapeake email account.Chesapeake alleges the information was used by McClendon and American Energy Partners to acquire drilling rights on land in the Utica Shale formation in four separate transactions.In a statement, McClendon characterized the lawsuit as baseless and said his severance agreement with the company included ""the right to own and use this information."" He said he intended to vigorously contest the lawsuit.The suit represents the latest drama in the very public falling out between McClendon and Chesapeake, the company he co-founded in 1989 and built into the second largest natural gas producer in the United States. During his tenure at Chesapeake, McClendon was hailed as a visionary who helped pioneer the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. In 2012, a series of Reuters investigations found that McClendon had taken but not publicly disclosed $1.55 billion in personal loans from a major financier of the company. He helped run a hedge fund to personally trade oil and gas. And emails reviewed by the news agency showed McClendon collaborated with a rival firm in a bid to suppress land prices in a prospective oil and gas play in Michigan.Although an internal investigation of his activities found no ""intentional"" wrongdoing, McClendon agreed to step down as CEO on Jan. 29, 2013.""Approximately thirty-six hours after the announcement of his departure,"" Chesapeake alleges in its complaint, McClendon began to take confidential company information.Among the documents were ""open acreage reports"" about the Utica Shale formation, an oil and gas play in Ohio, Chesapeake alleges. The reports, which Chesapeake claims were confidential and expensive to compile, contain information about unleased land that the company was ""pursuing and seeking to acquire,"" the suit contends. As part of his employment agreement, McClendon was allowed to invest in each of Chesapeake's wells. When he left the company, McClendon retained those stakes, which were characterized as ""jointly owned interests,"" and his separation agreement spells out information to which he is entitled.Chesapeake alleges that McClendon strayed far beyond the bounds of the agreement. ""Open acreage which has not even been acquired is, by definition, not 'jointly owned',"" according to Chesapeake's complaint. The company contends McClendon had no right to take that information""We believe that pursuing these legacy claims is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,"" Chesapeake spokesman Gordon Pennoyer said in a statement. According to the suit, McClendon ""used and disclosed Chesapeake's trade secret and confidential information"" to solicit investors for his new endeavor even as he served as a Chesapeake director and CEO in February and March 2013. ""These investors knew or should have known that McClendon owed a duty to Chesapeake to maintain the secrecy of the information,"" the lawsuit claims.Seven months after McClendon left Chesapeake, a Utica-focused affiliate of his American Energy Partners issued an announcement: the unit had raised $1.7 billion in equity and debt commitments from investment firms. The money would be used to acquire 110,000 acres in the Utica and launch drilling operations, according to a company news release.McClendon's backers include Energy & Minerals Group, a Houston-based investment firm run by John Raymond, which has invested more than $3 billion. EMG and other investors could now become entangled in the litigation. Raymond could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.In addition to American Energy Partners, three affiliates and McClendon Energy Operating, Chesapeake's complaint names ""John Doe Investors 1-20"" as defendants. McClendon is not named as a defendant in the complaint because resolution of disputes between him and Chesapeake requires arbitration, according to his separation agreement.Chesapeake is seeking an unspecified amount of damages for alleged violations of the Oklahoma Uniform Trade Secrets Act and other state statutes. Chesapeake also is asking the Oklahoma County court to force McClendon's company to place ""all income earned from their Utica Shale play acquisitions"" in a trust. Chesapeake contends that any income earned by American Energy Partners resulted from ""the use of Chesapeake property and the usurpation of Chesapeake's corporate opportunities.""In a statement on Tuesday afternoon responding to Chesapeake's lawsuit, American Energy-Utica and Energy & Minerals Group, the largest equity investor in AEU, said in a statement, ""The allegations in the Chesapeake lawsuit against AEU are meritless."" All the information used by AEU to buy assets, the statement said, was either publicly available, provided by the sellers of the assets, or independently developed by EMG or a petroleum engineering firm it had hired.

McClendon, stole confidential company data during his last months on the job in order to launch his new oil and gas empire.McClendon, 55, ""misappropriated highly sensitive trade secrets from Chesapeake"" and ""subsequently used these trade secrets for the benefit of"" a company he founded in 2013, American Energy Partners LP, according to the civil complaint filed by Chesapeake in Oklahoma County District Court.In the suit, Chesapeake claims that McClendon asked his assistant to print maps and data about unleased acreage and that McClendon also sent himself blind copies of the same documents at a personal email address during his last months at the company. The company says it discovered McClendon's actions through a forensic analysis of his Chesapeake email account.Chesapeake alleges the information was used by McClendon and American Energy Partners to acquire drilling rights on land in the Utica Shale formation in four separate transactions.In a statement, McClendon characterized the lawsuit as baseless and said his severance agreement with the company included ""the right to own and use this information."" He said he intended to vigorously contest the lawsuit.The suit represents the latest drama in the very public falling out between McClendon and Chesapeake, the company he co-founded in 1989 and built into the second largest natural gas producer in the United States. During his tenure at Chesapeake, McClendon was hailed as a visionary who helped pioneer the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. In 2012, a series of Reuters investigations found that McClendon had taken but not publicly disclosed $1.55 billion in personal loans from a major financier of the company. He helped run a hedge fund to personally trade oil and gas. And emails reviewed by the news agency showed McClendon collaborated with a rival firm in a bid to suppress land prices in a prospective oil and gas play in Michigan.Although an internal investigation of his activities found no ""intentional"" wrongdoing, McClendon agreed to step down as CEO on Jan. 29, 2013.""Approximately thirty-six hours after the announcement of his departure,"" Chesapeake alleges in its complaint, McClendon began to take confidential company information. Among the documents were ""open acreage reports"" about the Utica Shale formation, an oil and gas play in Ohio, Chesapeake alleges. The reports, which Chesapeake claims were confidential and expensive to compile, contain information about unleased land that the company was ""pursuing and seeking to acquire,"" the suit contends.As part of his employment agreement, McClendon was allowed to invest in each of Chesapeake's wells. When he left the company, McClendon retained those stakes, which were characterized as ""jointly owned interests,"" and his separation agreement spells out information to which he is entitled.Chesapeake alleges that McClendon strayed far beyond the bounds of the agreement. ""Open acreage which has not even been acquired is, by definition, not 'jointly owned',"" according to Chesapeake's complaint. The company contends McClendon had no right to take that information""We believe that pursuing these legacy claims is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,"" Chesapeake spokesman Gordon Pennoyer said in a statement. According to the suit, McClendon ""used and disclosed Chesapeake's trade secret and confidential information"" to solicit investors for his new endeavor even as he served as a Chesapeake director and CEO in February and March 2013. ""These investors knew or should have known that McClendon owed a duty to Chesapeake to maintain the secrecy of the information,"" the lawsuit claims.Seven months after McClendon left Chesapeake, a Utica-focused affiliate of his American Energy Partners issued an announcement: the unit had raised $1.7 billion in equity and debt commitments from investment firms. The money would be used to acquire 110,000 acres in the Utica and launch drilling operations, according to a company news release.McClendon's backers include Energy & Minerals Group, a Houston-based investment firm run by John Raymond, which has invested more than $3 billion. EMG and other investors could now become entangled in the litigation. Raymond could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.In addition to American Energy Partners, three affiliates and McClendon Energy Operating, Chesapeake's complaint names ""John Doe Investors 1-20"" as defendants. McClendon is not named as a defendant in the complaint because resolution of disputes between him and Chesapeake requires arbitration, according to his separation agreement.Chesapeake is seeking an unspecified amount of damages for alleged violations of the Oklahoma Uniform Trade Secrets Act and other state statutes. Chesapeake also is asking the Oklahoma County court to force McClendon's company to place ""all income earned from their Utica Shale play acquisitions"" in a trust. Chesapeake contends that any income earned by American Energy Partners resulted from ""the use of Chesapeake property and the usurpation of Chesapeake's corporate opportunities.""In a statement on Tuesday afternoon responding to Chesapeake's lawsuit, American Energy-Utica and Energy & Minerals Group, the largest equity investor in AEU, said in a statement, ""The allegations in the Chesapeake lawsuit against AEU are meritless."" All the information used by AEU to buy assets, the statement said, was either publicly available, provided by the sellers of the assets, or independently developed by EMG or a petroleum engineering firm it had hired.

93,"   By Anna Driver  Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) on Wednesday said it would slash its 2015 spending and rig count in response to low crude oil prices that also pushed its fourth-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations.Shares of Chesapeake fell more than 11 percent, hurt by the earnings miss and a disappointing production outlook, analysts said. Crude prices have slumped more than 50 percent since June as the global oil market remains oversupplied in a time of waning demand. Exploration and production companies have responded by cutting their budgets to conserve cash.Chesapeake forecast total capital expenditures of $4 billion to $4.5 billion this year, down from $6.7 billion in 2014.The smaller budget translates into slower output growth. Oil and gas production for the year is forecast to rise 3 percent to 5 percent. In 2014, it increased 9 percent to an average of 706,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. Analysts at CapitalOne Southcoast characterized the quarter as soft and told clients that Chesapeake's ""weaker-than-expected liquids pricing plus 2015 guidance for production"" would probably drive Wall Street estimates lower.The average price Chesapeake received in the quarter fell far short of Wall Street forecasts.Sterne Agee said Chesapeake's average oil price of $76.40 per barrel was 6 percent below the brokerage's estimate, and the company's natural gas liquids price of $13.11 missed its forecast by 28 percent.

98,"   By Anna Driver and Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON/WILLISTON, N.D.  HOUSTON/WILLISTON, N.D. With the prospect of another plunge in crude prices CLc1LCOc1 looming after two months of stability, U.S. shale oil producers may face another round of spending cuts to conserve cash and survive the downturn.A deeper retrenchment would have far-reaching effects.Additional cutbacks would further gut the already-hemorrhaging oilfield services industry and may heighten expectations for a steeper drop in U.S. crude output later this year.They would also reinforce the United States' emerging role as the world's ""swing producer,"" with dozens of independent companies that can quickly ramp up production in good times and dial it back in a downturn.  ""If I were an oil company today, I would talk about one thing: how far can you cut costs,"" said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer in New York. ""They cannot control anything else."" Gheit said he expected a new wave of capital budget cuts starting in May, when much of the energy industry reports quarterly results.U.S. oil companies have slashed spending 20 to 60 percent since the price of oil fell by half from June to January, and oilfield services firms shed more than 30,000 jobs, according to Reuters compilations of public disclosures.  Debt rating agency Moody's estimates that about a fifth of the North American exploration and production companies it follows will slash budgets by more than 60 percent this year while more than half will cut spending by at least 40 percent. After a pause brought a sense of relief, the price slide has resumed. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has fallen 12 percent in a week to $42 on concerns about lingering global oversupply. Citibank and Goldman Sachs have said oil could tumble to $30 or even $20.One Houston banker said acquisition chatter has picked up in the past two weeks but that no company wanted to be the first to seek buyers given potential investors and sellers remain wide apart on valuations.    Companies have made clear they will not hesitate to trim more to avoid credit rating downgrades and further stock sell offs.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Graphic: shale stocks and oil prices: link.reuters.com/bux53w)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>""We don’t see value in chasing growth in this environment,"" Al Walker, chief executive of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), a top shale company, said this month. Oil firms slashed tens of billions of dollars from their capital budgets between November and February. Many have cut costs already twice and could do it again after first-quarter earnings in May, though ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has already announced cuts on Tuesday. Conoco said it expected to spend about $11.5 billion per year over the next three years, down from a prior forecast of $16 billion.   Oil producers can save money by shrinking their rig fleets and delaying so-called completions, which include fracking, of wells to bring them online, which accounts for 60 to 70 percent of a well's total cost.Anadarko expects to end this year with 420 to 440 uncompleted wells, while EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N), often considered the strongest U.S. shale oil company, expects to have 285, with postponed completions saving it about $500 million.OUTPUT DIP? The U.S. land rig count has already fallen some 43 percent from its 2014 high of 1,876 in November to 1,069 last week, according to Baker Hughes. More declines are likely. That trend, along with deferred completions, has some executives predicting national crude output will drop earlier than official forecasts.  The Energy Information Administration (EIA) latest forecast from March 10 sees U.S. output peaking in May at 9.46 million barrels per day (bpd) and then dipping to 9.41 million in June.  But in a sign the drop could come sooner, the agency now expects output in two of the biggest U.S. fields, the Eagle Ford shale in Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota, to fall in April, for the first time since it began tracking drilling in those oilfields in 2013. Still, those initial declines, projected at around 18,000 bpd, would make only a small dent in global oversupply estimated at about 1 million bpd. Some analysts say that as soon as prices inch up companies may quickly bring their backlog of wells online, limiting any possible price gains.In the Bakken, for example, there are 800 uncompleted wells, state officials said last week.  The tally is growing as producers wait to see if low prices trigger a roughly $5 billion North Dakota production tax break in June, said Lynn Helms, the state's top oil regulator.  While oil producers brace for more cuts, they have not given up hopes for a rebound and assure investors they will be ready to tap uncompleted wells and boost the number of rigs they operate. “First, our overarching goal this year is to prepare for oil price recovery,"" Bill Thomas, EOG’s chief executive officer, told investors while discussing the company’s fourth-quarter earnings. ""We would be ready to respond swiftly when oil prices improve.""

100,"   By Brian Grow and Joshua Schneyer  Energy & Minerals Group, a major investor in new oil and gas ventures launched by former Chesapeake Energy Corp CEO Aubrey McClendon, said on Tuesday it has settled a lawsuit alleging the oil executive stole his former employer's trade secrets.Houston-based EMG, a private investment firm, had originally defended McClendon and called Chesapeake's claims ""meritless.""The settlement could raise questions about whether EMG, which has invested more than $3 billion in ventures formed by McClendon since 2013, may be separating itself from McClendon, a successful oil and gas executive who co-founded Chesapeake in 1989. He resigned from the company in 2013 following a corporate governance crisis.He then formed American Energy Partners (AEP), a new venture whose financial backers have included EMG.Chesapeake in February sued AEP and affiliates, American Energy-Utica, and unnamed investors, alleging McClendon stole trade secrets from his former company and that the defendants used them to raise new funds and buy oil and gas land leases.In its claim filed in Oklahoma County District Court, Chesapeake alleged that before McClendon left the company, he ""misappropriated highly sensitive trade secrets” and used them to recruit investors and buy land leases for AEP.Chesapeake alleges the information was used to acquire drilling rights on land in the Utica Shale formation.AEP and McClendon have denied Chesapeake's charges. They contend that McClendon’s separation agreements from his former company allowed him access to an array of Chesapeake's oil and gas leasing information. EMG said on Tuesday it reached an agreement with Chesapeake to remove AEU and unnamed investors from the lawsuit filed by Chesapeake. AEU is an oil and gas venture focused on the Utica shale play. Although it is affiliated with McClendon, AEU is controlled by EMG, which is led by John Raymond.Chesapeake will drop all claims against AEU and the unnamed investors in exchange for approximately 6,000 acres of oil and gas leases in the northern Harrison County region of the Utica shale play in Ohio, and up to $25 million in cash, EMG said.A series of Reuters stories in 2012 examined how McClendon had entwined his personal finances with those of Chesapeake. Following a liquidity crunch and a shakeup in its board, McClendon departed Chesapeake in April 2013.Chesapeake’s lawsuit against AEP, where McClendon is CEO, and several other entities linked to him will continue. McClendon is no longer an officer of AEU, EMG said. ""Although Mr. McClendon is a director and the single largest non-institutional shareholder in AEU, he did not approve the settlement and neither he nor AELP were advised of the negotiated terms of this settlement,"" said AEP in an emailed statement.EMG and AEU had earlier called Chesapeake’s lawsuit “meritless,” and said their Utica leasing did not rely on Chesapeake trade secrets. EMG also said that AEU should not have been included in Chesapeake’s lawsuit.The full terms of the settlement remain confidential.EMG likely considered the allegations serious enough to settle out of court and separately from McClendon, said one independent expert.  “Nobody settles a lawsuit by paying $25 million and signing over 6,000 acres of valuable oil and gas leases unless they are at least a little bit troubled by what they have learned,” said Erik Gordon, clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.Chesapeake declined comment. EMG declined further comment. AEP and McClendon want the legal dispute resolved through arbitration and say that is required under the terms of McClendon's separation agreements with Chesapeake. Chesapeake shares were up 3.4 percent at $15.27 on Tuesday afternoon.

108,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. federal judge on Friday ordered Chesapeake Energy Corp to pay $379.7 million to bond investors, after the natural gas company waited too long to tell them of its plan to redeem their $1.3 billion of bonds six years early.U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan agreed with bond trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp that holders of Chesapeake's 6.775 notes maturing in 2019 were entitled to a special ""make-whole"" price because of the early redemption.The payout is more than triple the roughly $100 million that Chesapeake hoped to distribute in ""restitutionary"" damages.It originally argued that its March 15, 2013 redemption notice entitled it to redeem the notes at face value, but a federal appeals court in November said that notice came one month late.Bank of New York Mellon acted on behalf of a variety of hedge funds and other bondholders such as Ares Management LLC, Aurelius Capital Management LP, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP and Taconic Capital Advisors LP. ""We are pleased with the court's decision vindicating the noteholders' interests,"" bank spokesman Kevin Heine said.Chesapeake spokesman Gordon Pennoyer declined to comment.Shares of Chesapeake closed down 31 cents, or 2.7 percent, at $11.37 in Friday trading. The redemption was intended to help Chesapeake reduce a debt burden that the Oklahoma City-based company had accumulated under former Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon, and offset natural gas prices that had fallen to a decade low.But Engelmayer, whose original ruling in Chesapeake's favor was reversed by the appeals court, said investors were entitled to hold Chesapeake to its obligations under the bond indenture, rather than accept lesser sums. ""Investors who decided to buy (or hold) the 2019 notes were beneficiaries of a contract,"" he wrote. ""The interest in respecting investors' legitimate expectations therefore supports a payout keyed to the indenture's treatment of redemptions after March 15, 2013.""The notes were redeemed in May 2013 as part of a refinancing, and Chesapeake recorded a $33 million loss at the time.The case is Chesapeake Energy Corp v.

Omega has lost 11 percent this month and Glenview is down 5.5 percent.Still, ""we are not getting a signal from the corporate sector or our analysts that there has been any deterioration in outlook,"" said Steven Einhorn, a partner at Omega Advisors, who said his firm believes stocks will rebound.While that view may not be shared by investors whose fortunes depend on such things as the price of oil or the health of the Chinese economy, most hedge fund managers contacted by Reuters remain upbeat about prospects for U.S. stocks even after the Dow tumbled 3.6 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500 index  dropped 3.9 percent in a single day. For the year, the Dow is down almost 11 percent and the S&P 500 has lost 8 percent.Helping accelerate the recent slide, many hedge funds' in-house risk managers have been ordering traders to sell to curb losses during the turbulence. And analysts at Bank of America estimate that hedge funds specializing in stock investments have recently cut their net long exposure to 35 percent from 39 percent.For some, the selling frenzy indicates how at least part of the investing public is inclined to panic, said David Tawil, who runs Maglan Capital, a hedge fund with about $75 million in assets under management.""This is like a runaway train and it speaks volumes to the temperament of today's market participants,"" Tawil said. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Gundlach, co-founder of DoubleLine Capital, one of the most successful fixed-income fund companies, warned that the sell-off may not be over.""The market is wounded and it takes time for people to get around to feeling good again,"" Gundlach said in a telephone interview with Reuters. ""You don't correct all of this in three days.""Hedge funds' month end performance numbers are expected in about a week and so far, investors in these funds have shown little taste for racing for the exits. At the same time, managers are not going out of their way to soothe frayed nerves with special calls or intra-month reports.

128,"   By Jennifer Ablan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Billionaire investor activist Carl Icahn ramped up criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve, warning about the unintended consequences of ultra low interest rates on the economy and financial markets. ""They don't understand the treacherous path they are going down,"" Icahn said in an interview with Reuters, in which he also declared his support for Donald Trump as a candidate to be the next U.S. president. (tinyurl.com/njyy2cf)""God knows where this is going. It's very dangerous and could be disastrous,"" said Icahn, who has been a consistent critic of the Fed for keeping its benchmark interest rate close to zero since late 2008.The Fed's loose monetary policies have pulled the U.S. economy out of crisis but the cheap credit has also fueled a corporate debt binge and a quest for yield among ordinary investors, who are buying riskier assets such as junk bonds to get a better return.Icahn, a Wall Street veteran who made his fortune buying stakes in companies such as RJR Nabisco, Texaco, Phillips Petroleum, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp, Netflix Inc, Apple and eBay Inc and pushing their management to change their strategy, said that he is hedged against the possibility of a market meltdown.""I got a huge hedge on against my long positions. So if you say, I am short, yeah, I am short big but then again, I am long bigger,"" Icahn said, acknowledging that he is a big beneficiary of the Fed's policies even as he criticizes them.Icahn, 79, has a big bet on shares in Apple Inc, which have posted returns of about 12 percent over the last year, but also has holdings in energy companies such as Chesapeake Energy Corp and Cheniere Energy Inc, which are down 71 percent and 41 percent, respectively. 'DANGER AHEAD' Icahn said he felt compelled to raise red flags about the state of the financial markets because he believes if more big investors had warned about subprime mortgage market in 2007, the United States might have avoided the crisis that strangled the economy the following year.In a video entitled ""Danger Ahead"" and released on Tuesday, Icahn said the Fed's rate policy had enabled U.S. chief executives - many of whom he describes as ""nice but mediocre guys"" – to pursue ""financial engineering"" that he said has exacerbated an already wide gap between rich and poor in America. (reut.rs/1L0VNEJ) Icahn, who slammed money managers who benefit from the so-called ""carried interest"" loophole under which their earnings are taxed as capital gains rather than ordinary wage income, also endorsed Donald Trump's presidential bid.Trump unveiled a tax plan on Monday that he said would eliminate the loophole.""Those guys who run these companies are borrowing money very cheaply, leveraging up their companies, using it to do two things … They are going in and they are buying back stock or even worse, making stupid takeovers,"" said Icahn, adding some recent acquisitions have been done at a too high a price.""We've been on the boards of a lot of companies in a minority position to convince the boards to stop doing these takeovers and stop purchasing these companies. This is not to say that mergers shouldn't be done."" Icahn himself has been criticized in some quarters for pursing financial engineering by pushing Apple to boost share buybacks, although the activist has argued that with some $200 billion of cash on hand, the technology giant can easily afford to boost shareholder returns. Icahn said he is particularly worried about ordinary investors buying debt sold by highly leveraged companies. This debt, often referred to as ""junk bonds,"" offers a greater return but also a higher risk of default.Much of this debt is bought via exchange-traded funds, a popular vehicle for trading baskets of bonds and stocks.Icahn said retail investors had a false sense of security about how easy it would be to sell their holdings of such debt if the market turns.""It's like a movie theater and somebody yells fire. There is only one little exit door,"" he said. ""The exit door is fine when things are OK but when they yell fire, they can't get through the exit door … and there's nobody to buy those junk bonds.""

139,"   By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Stone  Chesapeake Energy, the No. 2 U.S. natural gas producer, said on Monday it had no plans to file for bankruptcy, after sources told Reuters the company had asked its longtime counsel to look at restructuring options.Chesapeake's shares were halted after plunging more than 50 percent but later pared some losses, as it said advisers Kirkland & Ellis had been providing counsel since 2010 and will continue to help the company strengthen its balance sheet.Trade publication Debtwire had reported the engagement of Kirkland & Ellis on Friday evening, prompting Chesapeake's shares to drop early on Monday to $1.50 on fears it might soon make one of the biggest bankruptcy filings of the current crash in oil and natural gas prices.The company, seeking to downplay those worries, said it ""currently has no plans to pursue bankruptcy and is aggressively seeking to maximize value for all shareholders.""With more than $10 billion in bonds, the oil and gas producer's balance sheet is under pressure and its equity market capitalization is around just $1.2 billion.In addition to its debt, filings show Chesapeake has commitments to pay about $2 billion a year for space on pipelines run by several companies, including Williams Companies Inc, whose shares fell 35 percent on Monday, in part on its exposure to Chesapeake. Chesapeake had cash on hand of about $1.8 billion on Sept. 30, according to public filings. That is plenty to pay $500 million in debt due in March, though at least another $1.3 billion will come due through 2018.Once a Wall Street darling that in many ways symbolized the U.S. fracking revolution, Chesapeake has struggled since a governance crisis prompted the departure of its founder and former Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon in 2013. Prominent Chesapeake shareholders include Carl Icahn.With oil and gas prices down 70 percent since 2014 and many new wells money losers, analysts say companies like Chesapeake are in ""zombie mode"" - slowly burning through cash and unable to invest in growth in a meaningful way. Tim Rezvan, an energy analyst at Stern Agee, said in a note to clients about Chesapeake that it was ""hard to justify any equity value until liquidity questions get answered.""CNBC, citing sources, said Chesapeake hopes to sell assets or tender bonds.    The Oklahoma City-based company recently completed a debt exchange, converting $3.8 billion of unsecured debt into new second-lien notes, but the new bonds dropped on the secondary market. A limited number of holders of debt with near-term maturities participated in the exchange.  Chesapeake has suspended its dividend to preserve cash, cut about 15 percent of its workforce and written down the value of some oil and gas assets. Standard & Poor's downgraded Chesapeake to CCC+ last month.In the third quarter of 2015, it reported a loss of $4.69 billion, compared with a profit of $169 million the same quarter the year before.    About 40 energy companies entered bankruptcy in 2015 and more are expected in the next few months.

147,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Private equity fund Energy & Minerals Group told investors on Wednesday it will stop entering new deals with Aubrey McClendon, the former chief executive officer of Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N), a day after the U.S. government charged him with breaking antitrust laws.In a letter to investors seen by Reuters, EMG's Managing Partner John Raymond said his fund would ""cease any and all new business activities"" with McClendon, a legend in the U.S. energy industry.The comments mark another reversal of fortune for McClendon, removing EMG as one of his main sources of capital to find and develop land in Ohio, Pennsylvania and other shale-rich states, as well as overseas. The U.S. Justice Department charged McClendon on Tuesday with rigging bids for oil and gas acreage. McClendon has denied the charges and was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. Houston-based EMG, which has invested some $3 billion in ventures with McClendon since he left Chesapeake in 2013 after investors questioned his leadership, said the allegations will not affect any of its portfolio companies. But the indictment could signal that prosecutors are ready to apply stricter scrutiny to an industry that has seen few legal challenges in recent years to the way land lease agreements are negotiated with private landowners for thousands of parcels of minerals across the United States. ""These are serious allegations that have been made against McClendon (and could have equally serious implications across the industry) and EMG takes this matter very seriously,"" Raymond wrote.The fund, which manages about $17 billion in assets, is planning to launch several energy companies it co-founded with McClendon's American Energy Partners by the end of March. ""It is purely a coincidence that these charges have been brought at the same time as these business arrangements were already being finalized,"" Raymond wrote in the letter.    Raymond stressed in the letter that the charges against McClendon ""have nothing to do with EMG or any EMG portfolio company."" As of Feb. 26, McClendon is no longer CEO or a board member of any EMG portfolio company, Raymond added.",2016-03-02,CHK,"Wed Mar 2, 2016 | 3:02pm EST",Exclusive: Texas fund EMG halts new deals with indicted McClendon,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-chesapeake-enrgy-mcclendon-emg-idUSKCN0W425D?type=companyNews
148,"   By Brian Grow and Diane Bartz | ATLANTA/WASHINGTON  ATLANTA/WASHINGTON Aubrey McClendon, former chief executive officer of Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) and a legend in the U.S. energy industry, was charged on Tuesday with conspiring to rig bids to buy oil and natural gas leases in Oklahoma, the Justice Department said.    The indictment follows a nearly four-year federal antitrust probe that began after a 2012 Reuters investigation found that Chesapeake had discussed with a rival how to suppress land lease prices in Michigan during a shale-drilling boom. Although the Michigan case was subsequently closed, investigators uncovered evidence of alleged bid-rigging in Oklahoma. (reut.rs/1TPxUVy)In addition to the federal probe, the Michigan attorney general brought criminal charges against Chesapeake, which the company settled in 2015 by agreeing to pay $25 million into a compensation fund for land owners.The Justice Department indictment paves the way for what may be one of the highest-profile criminal antitrust cases against a well-known U.S. CEO in decades, and could thrust McClendon, a controversial figure whose aggressive leasing tactics are legendary in the energy industry, into the highest-stakes legal battle of a decades-long career.    Oklahoma-based McClendon is a shale drilling evangelist who was once among the highest paid U.S. CEOs. He co-founded Chesapeake with fellow Oklahoma oilman Tom Ward in 1989. In 2013, McClendon stepped down from the helm of Chesapeake amid a liquidity crunch and corporate governance concerns. Ward left Chesapeake in 2006 and founded competitor SandRidge Energy Inc SDOC.PK the same year.    McClendon, who is now with American Energy Partners (AEP), was charged with one count of conspiracy to rig bids, a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Justice Department said.    ""The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,"" McClendon said in statement. ""I have been singled out as the only person in the oil and gas industry in over 110 years since the Sherman Act became law to have been accused of this crime in relation to joint bidding on leasehold."" Chesapeake itself is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, the company said.""Chesapeake has been actively cooperating for some time with a criminal antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice regarding past land leasing practices,"" said Chesapeake Energy spokesman Gordon Pennoyer. ""Chesapeake does not expect to face criminal prosecution or fines relating to this matter.""Chesapeake shares declined 3.6 percent in after-hours trading to $2.66     The seven-page indictment alleges that McClendon set up a conspiracy of two energy companies which agreed not to bid against each other in purchasing oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma from 2007 to 2012. The indictment did not name either company.The indictment comes at a time when energy executives across America are already facing considerable distress. Oil and gas companies like Chesapeake, SandRidge, and McClendon’s new venture AEP, have struggled as the price of oil plummeted by 70 percent since late 2014. Both Chesapeake and SandRidge, once storied firms in Oklahoma’s oil industry, have recently engaged restructuring experts as they scramble to pay off billions in debt and avoid potential bankruptcy. Chesapeake's stock price has tumbled more than 80 percent in the last year. SandRidge was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in January, and closed Tuesday at 4 cents per share.Much of the companies' debt was accrued in the period from 2007 through 2012 when McClendon was allegedly engaged in an antitrust conspiracy, a time when Chesapeake was snapping up millions of acres of land leases nationwide to expand its shale drilling.  McClendon has also been embroiled in a lawsuit with Chesapeake which alleged that he took sensitive company data from his former company to build his new business.The Justice Department said that McClendon's indictment was the first case in an ongoing federal antitrust investigation into price fixing, bid rigging and other anti-competitive conduct in the oil and natural gas industry.    “His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land. Executives who abuse their positions as leaders of major corporations to organize criminal activity must be held accountable for their actions,” said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer, head of Justice Department's Antitrust Division.Chesapeake, SandRidge, and McClendon had previously disclosed in securities filings that they were being investigated by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.

He was 56.McClendon was alone in his 2013 Chevy Tahoe when it sped into an embankment along a remote two-lane road in Oklahoma City, where it burst into flames, a police spokesman said. The cause of death will be determined later by a medical examiner, the spokesman said.The crash occurred less than 24 hours after the U.S. Department of Justice announced that McClendon had been indicted for allegedly colluding to rig bids for oil and gas acreage while he was at Chesapeake. He had denied the charges.At a press briefing in Oklahoma City, Captain Paco Balderrama said McClendon was traveling at “well above” the 40 mile per hour speed limit before he ""pretty much drove straight into the wall."" He was not wearing a seat belt.“There was plenty of opportunity for him to correct or get back on the roadway and that didn't occur,"" Balderrama said.Industry executives and state officials remembered McClendon as a ""visionary"" who ushered in a new era of U.S. energy abundance by pursuing the hydraulic fracturing technology that would unlock decades' worth of domestic natural gas and oil resources.Over more than two decades, he built Chesapeake from a small wildcatter into one of the world's biggest natural gas producers before resigning in 2013, after a corporate governance crisis and investor concerns over his heavy spendingIt may take one to two weeks to complete an investigation into the accident, which occurred about 8 miles (13 km) from offices of American Energy Partners, the company that McClendon founded shortly after leaving Chesapeake. ""Aubrey's tremendous leadership, vision and passion for the energy industry had an impact on the community, the country and the world. We are tremendously proud of his legacy,"" American Energy Partners said in a statement.Tuesday's indictment followed a nearly four-year federal antitrust probe that began after a 2012 Reuters investigation found that Chesapeake had discussed with a rival how to suppress land lease prices in Michigan during a shale-drilling boom. Although the Michigan case was subsequently closed, investigators uncovered evidence of alleged bid-rigging in Oklahoma. (reut.rs/1TPxUVy)REVERED FOR HELPING OKLAHOMA  A native of Oklahoma, McClendon attended Duke University before starting Chesapeake in 1989 with his friend Tom Ward. Ward, who later broke away to launch his own company, SandRidge Energy Inc, called McClendon's death ""not only a heartbreaking day for me but a sad day for all of Oklahoma."" McClendon was known for his high tolerance for risk and debt and for his lavish lifestyle, which included the purchase of high-end homes, antique boats and an extensive wine cellar. (reut.rs/1QUfnHp)On his watch, Chesapeake leased a fleet of planes that shuttled executives to oil and gas fields - and the McClendon family to far-off holiday destinations. Closer to home, McClendon was revered for helping to bolster the Oklahoma economy and revitalize its biggest city, including landing the Oklahoma City Thunder, a National Basketball Association franchise in which he had a minority stake.""I think in situations like this the best thing you can do is just pray, pray for the family and pray for the people involved,"" Thunder coach Billy Donovan told reporters at a game on Wednesday in Los Angeles. Governor Mary Fallin called McClendon “a visionary who raised the profile of Oklahoma.” McClendon was one of the foremost leaders of a U.S. energy boom that lifted output to the highest levels in years, reduced reliance on foreign oil and mobilized new pools of investment capital for wildcat drillers.""I’ve known Aubrey McClendon for nearly 25 years. He was a major player in leading the stunning energy renaissance in America,"" Texas energy investor T. Boone Pickens said in a statement. ""He was charismatic and a true American entrepreneur. No individual is without flaws, but his impact on American energy will be long-lasting.” Chesapeake, which had recently sued McClendon's AEP on accusations of stealing trade secrets, offered condolences.""Chesapeake is deeply saddened by the news that we have heard today and our thoughts and prayers are with the McClendon family during this difficult time,” the company said in a statement.McClendon is survived by his wife, Katie, and their three children, Jack, Callie and Will.

He invested in restaurants and brought the National Basketball Association's Thunder franchise to Oklahoma City from Seattle, where the team was known as the Supersonics.""Aubrey loved the phrase 'onward and upward' and that epitomizes what has happened to Oklahoma City.

""(This) is a special opportunity to recognize a special individual, a fallen athlete and someone who has made a tremendous impact on our city,"" he added.McClendon was not without controversy. He was known for lavish spending and making risky bets worth billions of dollars on vast tracts of land that could potentially be drilled for oil and natural gas. In 2013, he was ousted from Chesapeake, the company he co-founded at age 29 and turned into the No. 2 U.S. natural gas producer, after a corporate governance crisis and revelations that he had personal stakes in wells owned by Chesapeake. McClendon soon bounced back and raised billions of dollars by setting up a new company, American Energy Partners. But there were nagging legal woes. The day before his Chevy Tahoe slammed into a cement wall in an accident police are still investigating, McClendon was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on allegations of  violating antitrust rules by rigging bids for land. He denied the charges. On Thursday, a makeshift shrine of flowers, wooden crosses, and an oil driller's hard hat formed near the site of the car crash that killed McClendon, 56, on Wednesday. Julie Havers, who attended the memorial on Saturday, said McClendon will be remembered by locals for the lives he changed.    ""It was a very touching tribute to Aubrey.

155,"  NEW YORK Chesapeake Energy Corp(CHK.N), an oil and gas company struggling in the commodities rout, is considering swapping out some of its existing debt for new 1.5 lien debt, according to CapitalStructure, a provider of news and analysis on the sub-investment grade space, citing sources close to the situation.Depending on credit agreements, companies can generally wedge 1.5 lien debt in between their first and second liens.Chesapeake has not made any decisions on the swap yet, and the timing is uncertain, according to CapitalStructure, citing one of the sources. The swap is attractive, however, based on Chesapeake bonds' current pricing, CapitalStructure said, citing one of its sources. The company's bond maturing in 2017 were trading at around 70 cents on the dollar on Thursday, and its bonds maturing in 2018 at around 50 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data. Those levels are considered depressed.  A Chesapeake spokesperson did not immediately return requests for comment. The company has said it has no plans to file for bankruptcy.Chesapeake completed another bond swap last year, when it offered debtholders secured bonds paying 8 percent interest for unsecured bonds maturing between 2017 and 2023.  That offer was considered a failure because holders of debt maturing in the near term did not widely participate in the deal. At least 10 upstream oil and gas companies similar to Chesapeake completed bond swaps last year as they tried to reduce their debt burdens and costs as oil prices plunged. Several have been canceled this year.

They later traded at $5.97, up 5.7 percent.The company, which has more than $9 billion in debt, said it would sell about 42,000 net acres in Oklahoma's STACK field, with current production of 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Low natural gas and oil prices have hit the heavily leveraged company, which plans to sell assets worth an additional $500 million to $1 billion this year.""We anticipate subsequent divestitures during the second and third quarters,"" Chief Executive Doug Lawler said in a statement. The company on Thursday lowered its forecast for 2016 production costs to $3.40-$3.60 per barrel of oil equivalent from $3.60-$3.80 per boe.Chesapeake said in February that it tapped legal counsel Kirkland & Ellis for advice as it seeks to strengthen its balance sheet to manage debt maturing in the next 18 to 24 months. It said it had no plans for bankruptcy as some in the market have speculated. ""We continue to look at all of our options, including the use of additional secured debt, private transactions with bondholders and other types of exchange offers and open market purchases,"" said CFO Nick Dell'Osso.The company's net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to $964 million in the three months ended March 31, from $3.78 billion a year earlier. The year-earlier period included one-time items of $3.8 billion. First-quarter revenue fell 39 percent on the year to $1.9 billion as gas prices tumbled. Excluding an $853 million impairment charge, the loss in the latest quarter was 10 cents per share, in line with analysts' average estimate.Revenue slumped 39 percent to $1.95 billion, widely missing analysts' expectations of $2.55 billion.

The partial termination means the company will be required to vest at 100 percent all terminated participants, Chesapeake said Tuesday in the 401(k) plan's annual report. It was unclear how much the vesting would cost the company. Chesapeake was not immediately available for comment. Nearly 8,000 participants in Chesapeake's 401(k) are exposed to the company's reversal of fortune. They held 35 percent of the plan’s $615 million in assets in company stock at the end of 2014. While that exposure has declined, it has been a painful unwinding as employees sells Chesapeake shares in a falling market. The retirement plan had a total investment loss of $170.3 million in 2015, as net assets fell 23 percent to $483 million, according to the annual report. The plan's performance was hurt by heavy exposure to Chesapeake's stock, a top investment holding by participants. The stock is down 78 percent since the end of 2014 as the second-largest natural gas producer in the United States grapples with low energy prices and a heavy debt load.At the end of 2015, the Chesapeake retirement plan had $50 million, or 11 percent, of its total investments in shares of Chesapeake. The plan held $388 million in Chesapeake stock at the beginning of 2014. Participants in the plan bought $28 million in Chesapeake shares during 2015.

199,"   By Arathy S Nair  Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) said on Tuesday that two directors, including a representative of activist investor Carl Icahn, resigned on Monday, a week after Icahn more than halved his stake in the natural gas producer.Chesapeake said the resignations of Icahn representative Vincent Intrieri, along with John Lipinski, board members since June 2012 and June 2014 respectively, were not due to any disagreements. (bit.ly/2cSkDJK)However, the No. 2 U.S. natural gas producer did not specify why the two had stepped down. Chesapeake, Icahn, Intrieri and Lipinski were not immediately available for comment.Icahn said last week that Chesapeake's management had done ""an admirable job"" over the last few years and that he had reduced his stake in the company – by 51.6 percent to 4.55 percent – for tax-planning purposes. (bit.ly/2cSkpT7)Chesapeake shares were down 9 percent at $6.02 in early afternoon trading, amid a broader decline by energy company stocks due to a sharp drop in crude oil prices.Investors could be thinking that the resignations indicate that Icahn believes the stock cannot rise further or that he had a disagreement with the company, said James Sullivan, an analyst with Alembic Global Advisors.""But he is out of it and ... people pile in when he piles in, people pile out when he piles out,"" Sullivan said. Up to Monday's close, Chesapeake's stock had dropped 55 percent since May 2012, when Icahn revealed a stake in the company and campaigned to replace at least four directors. The stock had lost 2.8 percent since he cut his stake last week, but had gained about 47 percent since the start of the year.PRESSURE SINCE 2012 Chesapeake said in August it had reduced debt by more than $1 billion this year and had undertaken a couple of debt-for-equity swaps to reduce interest payments and a crippling debt  taken on to fund shale development. The company raised its 2016 asset sales target and production forecast last month. Intrieri, who has served as senior executive of Icahn Capital LP, had been on Chesapeake's board since June 2012, when   Chesapeake was under intense pressure from investors to improve its corporate governance.Reuters reported in 2012 that then-Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon had taken out more than $1 billion in loans using his personal stakes in thousands of company wells as collateral.Icahn said then that the board had failed ""in a dramatic fashion"" in its oversight of management and its earlier promises to act in a more financially responsible way had proven hollow. Bowing to pressure, Chesapeake named four new independent directors – Intrieri as well as three proposed by Southeastern Asset Management, its largest shareholder at the time.Icahn also has a history with Lipinski. He said in 2012 that Lipinski, then CEO of CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), was more interested in empire building than in increasing shareholder value.Since then, the relationship has improved, with Icahn asking shareholders to vote Lipinski to Transocean Ltd's (RIGN.S) board. Icahn did not nominate Lipinski to Chesapeake's board.McClendon, a brash risk-taker who helped transform the U.S. energy industry with shale gas, died when his car slammed into an overpass in March, a day after he was charged with breaking federal antitrust laws.Chesapeake also said on Tuesday it had received bids totaling $933.3 million on the expiration of its offers to buy up to $800 million of non-convertible senior notes.

212,"  U.S. natural gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) reported a surprise adjusted profit, helped by lower expenses, and said it expects to exit the next two years at higher production rates.Shares of Chesapeake, which also kept its 2017 budget nearly unchanged, rose as much as 9 percent to $5.80 on Thursday.Decreased costs for oilfield services and more efficient drilling processes are helping oil producers extract more barrels of oil, without having to spend more.Chesapeake said on Thursday it would exit the fourth quarter of 2017 with a 7 percent rise in total production from the end of the current quarter. Chesapeake said oil production would grow by about 10 percent over the same period.Between the end of 2017 and 2018, the company expects output to climb 15 percent, with a 20 percent jump in oil production.Barclays analysts said Chesapeake's forecasts suggest that the brokerage may need to raise its 2018 average oil production expectation by 25-30 percent.Chesapeake - which has been trying to reduce its crippling debt load of nearly $9 billion - said it planned to sell more assets this year, including about 126,000 net acres in the Haynesville Shale field in Louisiana. The company will sell the acreage in two packages, and has received bids for the first, which holds net production of about 30 million cubic feet of gas per day, Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso said on a post-earnings call.A near 60 percent drop in oil prices since mid-2014 has depleted cash balances at most oil companies, forcing them to sell assets and clamp down on spending.Chesapeake added just $2 million to its 2017 budget and now expects to spend $1.82 billion-$2.62 billion.     The company's fourth-quarter oil output estimate of 90,000-95,000 barrels per day (bpd) beat Wall Street expectation of 88,0000 bpd. However, the mid-point of total fourth-quarter production forecast of 550,000-570,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) came in below analysts' expectation of 569,000 boe/d. Net loss attributable to the company's shareholders fell nearly 75 percent to $1.20 billion from a year earlier, when the company wrote down the value of some assets by $5.42 billion. Adjusted profit was 9 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Total operating expenses slumped nearly 63 percent, compensating for a 32.6 percent fall in revenue.Chesapeake's shares pared some gains to trade up 2.4 percent at $5.4. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had gained 18 percent this year.

217,"  Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N), the second largest U.S. producer of natural gas, said on Monday that it would sell a part of its acreage in the Haynesville Shale area for $450 million to a private company, which Reuters sources revealed as Indigo Minerals LLC, a competing natural gas producer.Indigo Minerals LLC, the 10th largest U.S. producer of natural gas, is using an affiliate called Indigo Haynesville LLC for the acquisition, one of the sources said. Chesapeake shares were up 4.6 percent at $7.56 in midafternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Chesapeake said in a news release that the asset, located in northern Louisiana, includes about 78,000 net acres, 40,000 of which is core acreage. The sale also includes 250 wells with a current net production of about 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake also said that, including this transaction, it has reached about $2 billion in gross proceeds from divestitures either signed or closed in 2016, excluding certain volumetric production payment repurchase transactions.Indigo Minerals declined to comment. A spokesman for Chesapeake did not immediately return requests for comment. The company, which has been trying to reduce a crippling debt load of nearly $9 billion, expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2017.Chesapeake earlier in November said it planned to sell about 126,000 net acres in the Haynesville Shale field in Louisiana. The company said on Monday it was still marketing another 50,000 net acres in that field. Indigo acquired producing properties and undeveloped acreage in the Haynesville and the Cotton Valley shale play in a separate deal announced earlier this year. The company raised $375 million in equity capital in April.
