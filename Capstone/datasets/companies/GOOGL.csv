7,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO The personal data gathering abilities of Google, Facebook and other tech companies has sparked growing unease among Americans, with a majority worried that Internet companies are encroaching too much upon their lives, a new poll showed.Google and Facebook generally topped lists of Americans' concerns about the ability to track physical locations and monitor spending habits and personal communications, according to a poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos from March 11 to March 26.The survey highlights a growing ambivalence towards Internet companies whose popular online services, such as social networking, e-commerce and search, have blossomed into some of the world's largest businesses.Now, as the boundaries between Web products and real world services begin to blur, many of the top Internet companies are racing to put their stamp on everything from home appliances to drones and automobiles.With billions of dollars in cash, high stock prices, and an appetite for more user data, Google, Facebook, Amazon and others are acquiring a diverse set of companies and launching ambitious technology projects.But their grand ambitions are inciting concern, according to the poll of nearly 5,000 Americans. Of 4,781 respondents, 51 percent replied ""yes"" when asked if those three companies, plus Apple, Microsoft and Twitter, were pushing too far and expanding into too many areas of people's lives.This poll measures accuracy using a credibility interval and is accurate to plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.""It's very accurate to say that many people have love-hate relationships with some of their technology providers,"" said Nuala O'Connor, the President of the Center for Democracy and Technology, an Internet public policy group which has received funding from companies including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.""As technology moves forward, as new technologies are in use and in people's lives, they should question ‘Is this a fair deal between me and the device?'""Fears about the expanding abilities of tech companies crystallized when Google acknowledged in 2010 that its fleet of StreetView cars, which criss-cross the globe taking panoramic photos for Google's online mapping service, had inadvertently collected emails and other personal information transmitted over unencrypted home wireless networks. Yet many Americans remain ignorant of the extent to which Internet companies are trying to extend their reach.Google is one of the most aggressively ambitious, investing in the connected home through its $3.2 billion acquisition of smart thermostat maker Nest. Google is also investing in self-driving cars, augmented-reality glasses, robots and drones.Almost a third of Americans say they know nothing about plans by Google and its rivals to get into real-world products such as phones, cars and appliances. Still, roughly two thirds of respondents are already worried about what Internet companies will do with the personal information they collect, or how securely they store the data.""We're getting to a point in society where basically everything's going to be tracked,"" said Richard Armitage, a 46-year-old budget analyst in Colorado who participated in the survey. ""They have access to so much data that they could use inappropriately in my opinion.""Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook had no immediate comment. Amazon and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. But all have said protecting customers' privacy is a top priority, or published strict policies restricting the use of personal data if needed. For instance, storing select data can make online searches and services more reliable.EMBRACING THE REAL WORLD Public sensitivity about privacy was heightened by revelations of U.S. surveillance activities by the National Security Agency, as leaked by former spy contractor Edward Snowden, said Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who recently wrote a paper about the legal and social implications of robotics.Those concerns will become even more pressing as Internet companies expand the scope of their activities, said Marc Rotenberg, director of EPIC, a privacy advocacy group.""The links between the online world and the offline world are growing tighter,"" he said. ""It's no longer unplugging your laptop and walking away and rejoining the physical world, because the online world is now following you,"" he said, citing examples like Google's acquisition of home appliance maker Nest. Google has said it will not combine user data from Nest products with the data it collects about it users of its other online services, but some privacy advocates remain concerned.New wearable devices, like fitness bracelets and smartwatches that monitor heart rates and other biological information, will increasingly allow companies to collect biological data, said Jonathan Zittrain, the director of Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society.""The whole can become more than a sum of parts,"" when it comes to personal information, said Zittrain. ""Little bits of innocuous data...can add up to very revealing, and sometimes intensely private, insights,"" about people, he said.As Internet companies expand their scope of activities, they may not be able to count on the same level of public goodwill they enjoyed as smaller companies. Twenty-seven percent of the survey respondents said they did not think Google adhered to the ""Don't Be Evil"" slogan that has long been its unofficial motto.Of the respondents to the survey, 42 percent said they had negative feelings about Internet companies developing drones which both Amazon and Facebook have said they are investigating, while 29 percent felt negatively about robots, which Google thrust to the forefront with its acquisition of Boston Dynamics.Only 13 percent of respondents indicated negative feelings about Internet companies offering home appliances however.""It happens to be that there's a constellation of technologies that are next, that are new, that are transforming, and they are unsettling,"" Calo said.(Corrects dateline)(Editing by Edwin Chan)",2014-04-04,GOOGL,"Fri Apr 4, 2014 | 5:16pm EDT",Internet companies' growing ambitions spook 51 percent of Americans: Reuters/Ipsos poll,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-internet-ambitions-idUSBREA331R520140404?type=companyNews

10,"  (Repeats story published on Sunday, with no changes)* Mobile payments market seen growing threefold by 2017* Retailers spend $150 bln a year on card-based payments* Opportunity to monetise data on consumer behaviour* Mobile payments can cut retailers' costs, boost service-study* Starbucks payment/reward app already has 10 million usersBy Emma ThomassonBERLIN, April 6 Big retailers are muscling in on the likes of Visa, MasterCard and Google  in a fiercely competitive and growing mobile payment market that promises to cut transaction costs and increase customer loyalty.Stores such as British supermarket Tesco and France's Auchan hope their ""digital wallets"" - apps which allow users to pay with their smartphones rather than cash or cards - will also give them more comprehensive data about customers' shopping habits than ever before so they can target advertising.They are joining a crowded market - banks, card companies and tech firms like Google and Apple are all entering the mobile payment business, each hoping their app will become the industry standard. eBay's PayPal, well established in e-commerce, is also experimenting with the technology.Retailers hope to attract customers to their own services by giving discounts and rewards to those using them, while also linking payments automatically to loyalty schemes and offering features like saved shopping lists.The global market for mobile payments is forecast to grow about threefold by 2017 to some $721 billion worth of transactions, with more than 450 million users, according to research firm Gartner.The growth could benefit retailers as the competition from a host of payment providers should help drive down the fees stores pay to have transactions processed - a service currently dominated by banks and card firms Visa and MasterCard.""We view merchants as overall beneficiaries of the trend toward mobile payments,"" said Morgan Stanley, which estimated retailers in developed countries spent up to $150 billion in 2012 to accept card payments.""Expected returns should justify any incremental investments required in enabling mobile payments technology,"" it said in a report in January. However, it is still unclear how the retail mobile payment market will develop, with card companies and banks seen retaining a leading role in processing payments even if physical cards become obsolete.Retailers' apps might struggle to take off as customers are unlikely to be willing to use a variety of services for different stores, but the success of Starbucks Corp in combining mobile payments with promotions shows big players can succeed.U.S. RETAILERS Starbucks, the world's biggest coffee chain, launched its mobile payment and rewards app in 2011. It already has 10 million users and the firm said this month it is looking for ways to expand the programme beyond its own network.""The mobile payments platform has given us a higher degree of frequency and higher degree of loyalty and the question is how can we leverage that beyond our stores,"" Starbucks Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Schultz told CNBC television.An alternative path is also being explored in the United States, where dozens of top retailers including Wal-Mart , Target and Best Buy have announced plans to set up a joint digital wallet service - the Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX - though no launch date has been set. Meanwhile, an attempt to create a mobile payment app universally accepted by retailers has recently launched in Germany. Yapital, owned by e-commerce firm Otto, has gone live in thousands of stores and also allows users to pay online and make peer-to-peer transfers.Yapital Chairman Nils Winkler expects just a few players to survive of the 200 initiatives now clamouring for attention in Europe, with apps tied to retailers more likely to win out than those being developed by telecom and card firms.""The biggest success in this field will be retail-based. PayPal is a good example that has grown tremendously based on the retail success of eBay,"" he said.""CLEAR BUSINESS CASE"" Tesco, the world's third-largest retailer which pioneered the tracking of customer behaviour with its Clubcard loyalty card two decades ago, will launch its digital wallet this year, as it also starts offering current accounts.That is part of the British supermarket chain's eventual plan to use smartphones - and its own-brand Hudl tablet computers - to allow customers to navigate stores with their devices and scan products to buy them as they shop. Sophie Albizua, co-founder of UK-based retail consultancy eNova Partnership, said her clients were ready to invest in overhauling outdated till systems to enable mobile payments.

Baker | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Comcast Corp sought to rebut critics of its planned $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc, arguing that newcomers like Google Inc and Apple Inc would ensure competition in both Internet and video markets.In a 175-page filing with the Federal Communications Commission that kicks off the FCC's review of the deal, Comcast argues that combined with Time Warner Cable, it will compete with an ""array of sophisticated companies with national or even global footprints"" such as Google, Netflix Inc or Verizon that have gained ground against Comcast.""In the evolving video marketplace in which these companies have thrived, there is no reason why a cable company should be limited in evolving as well,"" Comcast's filing said.""Over the last few years, our competitors have evolved into being much larger companies by revenue, by cash flow and or by customers than we are to all have a larger geographic scope than we have,"" Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen told reporters after the filing was made public on Tuesday.If approved by the Justice Department and the FCC, the merger would result in a company that would serve just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market, after Comcast's plan to divest 3 million subscribers.The merged provider would also serve between 20 percent and 40 percent of U.S. broadband subscribers, depending on whether wireless broadband offered by telecom companies is included, Comcast said.Opponents have raised concerns that the sheer size of the merged company would give it too much control over what Americans can watch on television and do online as Comcast boosts its power as a buyer of web and pay-TV content. ""The great equalizer is that for many of those companies, they don't own the network in the high-speed video marketplace,"" said Chris Lewis, vice president for government affairs at consumer interest group Public Knowledge, referring to Google, Apple, Netflix and other content providers Comcast cited as its growing competitors.Cohen and Time Warner Cable's finance chief Arthur Minson are expected to hear about these concerns when they testify at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.A Reuters/Ipsos online poll last month found a majority of Americans skeptical about the proposed merger, with 52 percent of the 1,368 surveyed people saying that mergers such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal result in less competition and are bad for consumers. Comcast shares on Tuesday traded at their lowest level since the Time Warner deal was announced in February, a four-month low of $48.24 per share, and were 0.3 percent lower in the session.BROADBAND COMPETITION Since announcing its bid, Comcast has underscored that the merger combines two companies that do not directly compete in any markets, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider. It has argued that Time Warner Cable's customers would see a boost in quality of their services and the speed of their Internet.However, while lack of direct competition does away with major antitrust concerns that could trigger a block from the Justice Department, the FCC gets much broader leeway in examining whether the deal is in the public interest. Cohen said in more than 98 percent of the broadband markets served by Comcast and Time Warner Cable, customers have another Internet service choice offered by a top-ten telecom provider, delivered through fiber or new-generation DSL, plus newer entrants such as Google Fiber.Comcast also made the case that its sales of service including broadband to small and large businesses could present companies with an alternative to telecom providers such as Verizon and AT&T.The company also reaffirmed its commitment to so-called network neutrality rules, which ban Internet providers from slowing down or blocking access to content online, and that have been struck down by a court as formal FCC rules in January.Comcast, thanks to a condition placed on its 2011 merger with NBC Universal, is now the only company bound to uphold net neutrality for the next five years and has promised to apply it post-merger when it becomes larger.The FCC is now reviewing how to rewrite the net neutrality and the treatment of web traffic, including the fees content companies pay Internet service providers in so-called interconnection deals, is likely to be part of the agency's review of the merger.(Editing by Andrew Hay, Bernard Orr)",2014-04-08,GOOGL,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 5:37pm EDT",Comcast defends Time Warner Cable deal as U.S. review kicks off,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-comcast-timewarnercable-fcc-idUSBREA3717820140408?type=companyNews

In contrast to the sink-or-swim style of Apple's and Google's app stores, Amazon promised to promote his game actively if he brought it to its platform, he said.""With Amazon, it feels a lot more intimate and personal,"" said the founder of eight-month startup Playir. ""With Apple, you get feedback, but it's a more formal Q&A.

27,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO A resounding shot across the bow has been fired at the tech sector in recent weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is down nearly 5 percent in April through Friday's close and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is off 21 percent from its record closing high on February 25. Many of the sector's flagships and newcomers have been in the crosshairs.The latest tech stock falterings could be a sign of trouble ahead.To get a clearer idea of what's roiling the tech sector, you have to look at trends within various parts of it.One item to look at is data storage, which is offered by Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc and has been the object of a price war of late. While falling prices in this sub-sector are great for customers, they will eat into profits for competing companies.Brian Bolan, a portfolio manager and equity strategist for Zacks Investments in Chicago, surmises that the storage price war is partially responsible for the delay of initial public offerings of companies like Dropbox and Boxee.Tech companies' valuations, particularly those that are barely profitable, may be the object of inflated expectations of future business and earnings because they often engender irrational exuberance. Witness the dot-com bubble of more than a decade ago.Today's valuations may not wreck as much havoc if they end up having a correction, according to a recent Citi Private Bank bulletin, which notes that current tech ""speculative growth expectations are a far less profound influence on the overall U.S. stock market than was the case in 1999-2000."" That doesn't mean that the next few months won't be rocky for tech shares and the market in general. The year started with a broad-based selloff, and the current bull market may be long in the tooth in its fifth year.""Valuations become more reasonable before investors do,"" Bolan adds, ""But volatility is definitely something you're going to see.""CUT RISK Although diversification is usually a good idea in any sector, it won't guarantee you protection from tech's always-skittish volatility. One way to cut the risk of the sector is to invest in a broad-based index fund. Although you won't avoid a widespread selloff, there may be safety in numbers as most index funds give more weight to the older, more established dividend-paying companies with consistent earnings.The Vanguard Information Technology ETF , for example, owns cash-rich Apple Inc, Google and Microsoft Corp in addition to older stalwarts like International Business Machines Corp and Intel Corp. The fund is up nearly 22 percent for the year through April 11. It charges 0.14 percent in annual management expenses.Another option is the iShares Technology ETF , which is up 3 percent year to date and has gained about 22 percent for the prior 12 months through April 11, but charges more than the Vanguard fund at 0.46 percent in annual expenses. The fund's weighting in the top tech stocks is slightly different than Vanguard's, with more than one-third of its holdings in Apple, Google and Microsoft. If you want to stay in tech stocks, to ratchet down exposure to the biggest names in this rambunctious sector, you should consider an equal-weighted fund that doesn't concentrate its holdings in the most popular stocks, such as the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal-Weighted Technology ETF, which is up 26 percent for the 12 months through April 11. The fund holds less than 2 percent (each) in stocks like First Solar Inc , Seagate Technology and Teradata Corp.While pundits have mixed opinions on whether the latest tech troubles will spill over into the broader stock market, it's likely that there's more volatility ahead and it will become even more difficult to tell when it's a good time to buy.While tech stocks benefited from the broad-based gains of the larger U.S. stock market last year, they won't be immune from a wider selloff. They still make sense long-term in an information/technology intensive economy, although short-term they will always be volatile.

32,"  * China GDP grows 7.4 pct, slightly ahead of forecasts     * European shares rebound, Wall Street rallies, Yahoo shines     * Oil rises close to $110 on mounting Ukraine tension   (Adds close of U.S. markets, Google, IBM results)     By Herbert Lash     NEW YORK, April 16 Global equity markets advanced broadly on Wednesday after China reported growth that beat expectations, providing relief to investors worried about the Chinese economy, while the dollar eased on the growing view the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates lower than normal for a few years.     Fed Chair Janet Yellen told the Economic Club of New York that the U.S. economy appeared to be slowly moving toward full employment, but that it would need help from the central bank for some time to come.      Yellen said that achieving the Fed's economic goals ""will likely require low real interest rates for some time,"" a policy view she said was shared broadly across many advanced economies.     Wall Street rallied for a third straight day, and the three major stock gauges climbed 1 percent or more.     China's economy grew 7.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, topping forecasts of 7.3 percent. There had been speculation that growth would be closer to 7 percent after a string of recent soft numbers.         Relief rippled through Asian markets, then spread to Europe and Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei ended up 3 percent, its biggest gain since February.      MSCI's all-country world index rose 1.02 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares closed up 1.2 percent at 1,322.51 points. Yet many traders pegged the gain as a technical rebound after a 1 percent decline in the previous session.      Earlier this month, the European index hit a near six-year high, a rally that has been halted by worries over the crisis in Ukraine as well as worries about China, the world's second biggest economy.     ""There is a lot of concern about Chinese growth this year, so there is some relief in the GDP number,"" said Jim Russell, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati. ""We think that is influencing the market today.""     On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 162.29 points, or 1 percent, to 16,424.85. The S&P 500  gained 19.33 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,862.31, and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.064 points, or 1.29 percent, to 4,086.225.     Yahoo was the leading percentage gainer on the S&P 500 as investors focused on the company's 24 percent stake in Chinese internet company Alibaba Group Holding Inc IPO-ALIB.N, which reported a surge in quarterly revenue growth in the last quarter of 2013. Yahoo shares jumped 6.26 percent to $36.35.        Google Inc , after the market close, reported its Internet business revenue grew 19 percent in the first quarter, falling short of Wall Street targets as the price of its online ads continued to decline.     Shares of Google were down 5.8 percent at $524.40 in after-hours trading.      International Business Machines Corp reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as weakness in its storage and server businesses continued to offset gains in its software services. IBM shares fell about 4 percent to $188.40 in after-hours trade.     In U.S. economic news, industrial production rose at a faster-than-expected clip in March, the latest sign the economy was gaining momentum.      Groundbreaking for new homes also increased but remained well below the post-recession peak hit in November, signaling the drag the housing market is placing on the economy.     The euro rose 0.01 percent to $1.3813. There were also more bond gains for former trouble spots Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece.      The 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped 1/32 of a point in price, boosting its yield to 2.6337 percent, as the growth in China reduced demand for safe-haven government bonds.           But mounting risks in Ukraine after Russia declared the country to be on the brink of civil war and Kiev said an ""anti-terrorist operation"" against pro-Moscow separatists was under way helped drive up oil prices.      Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebels staged rival shows of force in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, though hopes remained that talks in Switzerland on Thursday between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union could cool the situation.     Global oil prices rose close to $110 a barrel but gave up some gains after an unexpectedly large build in crude stocks in the United States, the world's largest consumer of oil.      Brent crude for June delivery rose by a dollar earlier in the session but pared gains to settle up 24 cents at $109.60 a barrel.      U.S. crude for May delivery also rose more than $1 before paring gains immediately after closely watched data form the U.S. Energy Information Administration was released. U.S. crude settled 1 cent higher at $103.76 a barrel.     Crude oil stocks rose 10 million barrels to 394 million barrels in the week ending April 11, according to the EIA data, far more than the 2.3 million-barrel build expected by analysts.

Chief Executive Peter Terium, tasked with finding a new strategy for Germany's second-largest utility by market value, signalled that the worst was behind the company.""We do not expect the dramatic trends of recent years to continue to quite the same extent,"" Terium said at RWE's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.""Based on what we know now, we expect our net income to largely stabilise, although at a lower level than in previous years,"" he said.RWE shares were up 0.8 percent in afternoon trading. The expansion most notably of solar power has hit utilities across Europe, flooding a market already suffering from overcapacity and forcing energy firms to tap new growth areas, including helping clients save energy rather than use more.Highlighting the need to foster ties with household clients, RWE said it had entered into cooperation with a maker of smart thermostats and smoke alarms, Nest Labs Inc, which was taken over by Google  for $3.2 billion earlier this year. Terium said RWE's British unit npower was the only utility in the UK to sell Nest's Learning Thermostat, which tracks household energy usage and employs the data to automatically set temperatures, helping to cut heating bills by up to one fifth.""We are confident that the thermostat is the right product not only for the UK but also for our other markets in Europe,"" Terium said, without disclosing further details on the cooperation deal.Npower is one of the big six suppliers in Britain, where it has about 3.6 million customers.RWE is also banking on being refunded nuclear fuel tax payments it has made in the past, taking heart from a preliminary decision by a Hamburg court this week that said utilities should be reimbursed.RWE has so far paid about 900 million euros in such taxes.Terium said the levy would continue to affect it until Germany's Federal Constitutional Court or the European Court of Justice rule on the matter, something he does not expect to happen this year.

Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region expanded in April at a faster clip than anticipated. Blended earnings per share growth on S&P 500 components rose to 1.7 percent from Wednesday's 0.6 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed, indicating most companies that reported in the past 24 hours exceeded expectations.The technology sector capped gains on the S&P, with Google  shares down 3.4 percent at $544.36 and IBM off 3.9 percent at $188.76 after both reported underwhelming earnings late Wednesday. Their results raised questions about those of other tech-sector companies.""The market is digesting the sharp move we've seen this week and doing its best to ignore the results from IBM and Google, which didn't look great,"" said Steve Sosnick, equity risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.""I'm mostly focused on bank earnings, which have been OK for the most part, and there haven't been many outliers, which is a good thing."" He said moves should be taken with a grain of salt as many desks are short-handed ahead of the long weekend. U.S. markets will be closed for Good Friday.Shares of Morgan Stanley, rose 3.5 percent to $30.94 after it reported a rise in first-quarter earnings, while Goldman Sachs edged up 0.7 percent to $158.36 after the bank reported an 11 percent drop in profits but beat expectations.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.03 points or 0.07 percent, to 16,412.82, the S&P 500 gained 0.57 points or 0.03 percent, to 1,862.88 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 6.304 points or 0.15 percent, to 4,092.529.If indexes hold their gains, the Dow and S&P will post their largest weekly gains this year.

44,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed  Google Inc's disappointing first-quarter results left Wall Street unfazed about the internet giant's ability to come to grips with the shift to the fast-growing mobile advertising market.Google shares were down about 3 percent in early trading on Thursday, and at least 12 brokerages cut their target price on the stock. But most analysts kept a ""buy"" rating or equivalent on the company's shares.""Despite an expectations-miss quarter, Google remains one of the best-positioned stocks for many of the secular growth drivers in the Internet space,"" RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney, who kept his ""outperform"" rating on the stock, said in a note to clients.Of the 46 analysts covering Google, 35 have a ""buy"" or equivalent rating on the stock. Nobody has a ""sell"".Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc are revamping their products and advertising business to try to take advantage of a global shift to mobile phones and tablets.For investors in Google, accustomed to the company enjoying one of the highest ad margins in the business, mobile ads have translated to a steep drop in ad rates. Advertising rates on mobile phones are typically cheaper than traditional online ads because of their smaller screens. But mobile advertising continues to make up a bigger slice of the revenue of Internet companies.Google company reported a 26 percent increase in paid clicks volumes but the average cost-per-click declined 9 percent.""Google remains a core internet holding and we reiterate our ""overweight"" rating,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note titled ""Keep calm and search on"". Analysts highlighted core revenue growth from Google websites and YouTube, higher contribution from rest-of-world revenue, strong sales of digital apps and content in Google's Play Store and Chromecast TV dongles.Many also expect Google's Enhanced Campaigns advertisement program and other ad products to improve monetization from mobile and noted management's view that location and other data would help mobile pricing over time.""We continue to recommend GOOGL due to the strength of the core search business, continued product innovation, and improving monetization, which should allow GOOGL to take a growing share of the desktop and mobile online ad markets,"" Susquehanna analyst Brian Nowak said. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster also remained upbeat.""We continue to view Google as the best long term large cap story in our coverage space given the company's focus on innovation,"" he said.However, Goldman Sachs, which has a ""neutral"" rating on Google's shares, said it expected the stock to remain range-bound in the near-term as the market waits for mobile cost-per-click rates to improve.Google shares were trading at $545.22 shortly after the opening on the Nasdaq after closing at $563.90 on Wednesday.(Additional reporting by Soham Chatterjee; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Ted Kerr)",2014-04-17,GOOGL,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 11:55am EDT","Google still a top pick for Wall Street, despite mobile ad challenges",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-google-mobile-idUSBREA3G0XL20140417?type=companyNews
45,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON One of the biotechnology sector's worst two-week declines in the past decade has clobbered one of Fidelity Investments' hottest funds.The $9.4 billion Fidelity Select Biotechnology Fund plunged 11.75 percent during the first 14 days of April. That put the fund near the bottom among nearly 3,800 U.S. mutual funds tracked by Lipper Inc. Only six funds performed worse, but they had less than $100 million in assets each.It's a jarring reversal of fortune for Fidelity portfolio manager Rajiv Kaul, whose three-year return has averaged 31 percent, beating his benchmark by a whopping 21 percentage points over that time.Kaul has built up an outsize bet on Gilead Sciences Inc over the past two years. It is the fund's largest holding at 13 percent of assets, but it is down 9 percent in the past month amid a backlash over the high cost of its $84,000 hepatitis C drug. Kaul was not available to comment.U.S. biotech funds fell an average of 7.25 percent during the first half of April. In comparison, that sector's returns have been better nearly 99 percent of the time on a rolling two-week basis during the past decade, said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Lipper Americas Research.Biotech's swift downturn was part of a broader sell off of Internet and software stocks that hobbled some of the U.S. mutual fund industry's best stock pickers. Gold funds beat all comers as the $1.3 billion First Eagle Gold Fund led with a nearly 5 percent gain in the first half of April, according to Lipper.Fidelity portfolio manager Will Danoff, who runs the behemoth $109 billion Contrafund, also got walloped in recent weeks probably because he had loaded up on shares of Netflix Inc and Workday Inc over the past year. Contrafund had holdings in these companies at the end of February, and gave no indication of any major changes in his portfolio, according to portfolio commentary released on Wednesday by Fidelity.Contrafund is down 4 percent over the past two weeks. But Danoff, who has a strong long-term record, has had far worse moments as a portfolio manager.During a two-week stretch in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, Contrafund tanked, declining 23 percent, Tjornehoj said. Danoff, who was not available to comment, has beaten 94 percent of his peers over the past decade.He had more than doubled his bet on NetFlix since June, holding 1.1 million shares at the end of February, according to the latest available fund disclosures. But Netflix shares are off about 23 percent in the past month. His largest holdings included recent losers like Google Inc, Facebook Inc, Biogen Idec Inc and Amazon.com Inc. On Thursday morning, Google's shares declined after reporting disappointing first-quarter results. Workday, a darling of the software as a service movement, also likely hurt Danoff and a number of other mid-cap and large-cap managers. Its shares are down 22 percent in the past month, after more than doubling in the 10 months to February. Danoff more than doubled his stake in Workday over a recent eight-month period, fund disclosures show. At the end of February, Contrafund owned about 7 percent of Workday's outstanding shares.The stock market's two-week revolt against momentum stocks has knocked 2.3 percent off the value of the average U.S. mutual fund, sparing only a handful of money managers who favored gold and emerging markets over cloud software and biotech.""We've seen a collapse in the dream stocks,"" said AllianceBernstein's Gerry Paul, who directly manages $13 billion as chief investment officer of U.S. value funds. To be sure, some of these stocks are coming down from lofty highs - having recorded big gains for their owners last year - and will remain staples in mutual fund portfolios.Among the worst performers, the $527 million Buffalo Emerging Opportunities Fund was down 10 percent during the first two weeks in April after putting up 42 percent average annual gains since the stock market's nadir in March 2009. It is the worst performing small-cap fund with at least $500 million in assets, according to Lipper. The average small-cap fund fell 4.35 percent in the two weeks, according to Lipper.Two of portfolio manager John Bichelmeyer's largest additions to the fund last year, manufacturing software and consulting firm PDF Solutions Inc and cloud software company Proofpoint Inc, continued to sour in April. Proofpoint is down 34 percent in the past month. Bichelmeyer did not return messages seeking comment.Meanwhile, some managers have found an easier way to sleep.They prefer companies with free cash flow yields that top 10 percent. Technology behemoth Hewlett-Packard Co and video games retailer GameStop Corp, for example, meet that criteria and their shares have climbed 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the past month.The $2.5 billion Cullen High Dividend Equity Fund was off only 0.36 percent in the first two weeks of April. That put it at the top of the heap among large cap funds with at least $500 million in assets, Lipper said. Portfolio manager James Cullen has been rewarded for avoiding tech's high flyers.AllianceBernstein's Paul said investors are no longer willing to pay what he called a scarcity premium for companies such as Netflix, Amazon and Facebook. These stocks thrived because they had the ability to grow without the assistance of an economy fueled by the Federal Reserve's easy money policy. But now - as the Fed begins to reduce its stimulus - investors see growth elsewhere and at cheaper values.(Additional reporting by Svea Herbst, Ross Kerber and David Randall; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Martin Howell)",2014-04-17,GOOGL,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 10:27am EDT",Fidelity biotech fund among worst performers in April sell-off,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-funds-stocks-analysis-idUSBREA3G1BS20140417?type=companyNews

47,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, April 21 If you're ecology minded, the news hasn't been all that green of late, with ice caps and glaciers melting and storms becoming more destructive. But there is a huge silver lining for long-term investors in environmentally-friendly companies and technologies.To stave off a nearly 5-degree global temperature increase by 2100, nations must cut their global greenhouse emissions by up to 70 percent by the middle of this century, according to a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.There's little consensus among developed and emerging nations on how to effectively deal with climate change and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases, but there is agreement on one aspect of this global threat: Trillions of needed dollars will continue to pour into renewable and clean sources of energy, transportation, building and manufacturing.Although investors have typically focused on a small group of ""clean tech"" funds and stocks, you can cast a wider net to capture the upside of this influx of investment. Nearly every company in the S&P 500 Index has some involvement in ""greening"" their operations from recycling to creating their own sources of clean energy.Take wind power. The retailer Ikea recently announced it was buying a wind farm in Illinois. Microsoft Corp is purchasing a Texas wind facility. Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc are also investing in the technology. On the solar power front, solar panel prices have plummeted and there are a host of collateral technologies such as battery storage, energy management systems and co-generation that deserve attention.One of the oldest and most diversified mutual funds in this sector is the New Alternatives Fund Inc, which is up 35 percent for the last 12 months through April 17 and up 8 percent year to date, compared to just under one percent for the MSCI EAFE index. The fund is expensive to own, though, charging a 1.1 percent annual management fee and 4.75-percent initial sales charge.The New Alternatives portfolio samples several companies from the clean tech sector, holding industry leaders like Vestas Wind Systems A/S, Johnson Controls Inc and American Water Works Co. A less-costly fund to own is the PowerShares Cleantech ETF , which holds ABB Ltd, Corning Inc and Siemens AG, companies with several stakes in broad-based energy businesses. The fund charges 0.67 percent annually for management expenses. It's up 33 percent for the 12 months through April 17.LANDSCAPE FOR GREEN POWER  What will make alternative energy profitable is what experts called clean ""distributed"" power, that is, electricity that's not generated by old-line utilities on the grid using coal or nuclear energy. When clean energy becomes competitive with fossil fuels, that's when it makes economic sense, which has been increasingly the case.Falling costs of alternative energy products in recent year are enhancing the potential of clean energy technologies and displacing ""dirty"" power plants.According to a recent report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company on solar energy, the drop in price residential consumers pay in the United States to install rooftop solar systems means ""These cost reductions will put solar within striking distance, in economic terms, of new construction for traditional power-generation technologies, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy.""The outlook for solar energy also applies in a general sense to wind and other clean-energy technologies. As costs of running a coal-fired or nuclear plant continue to rise, alternative energy prices keep falling, making them competitive on a mass scale.As one of the smallest sub-sectors in the overall economy, though, clean energy has been volatile. And price wars in solar cells have turned leading solar companies valuations into roller coasters. First Solar Inc's stock price, for example, was in negative territory from 2009 through 2012, then skyrocketed 77 percent last year. The company is up 27 percent year-to-date through April 17.Take heed: Even investing through a diversified index fund like the PowerShares ETF is going to be rocky. The fund has a five-year volatility measure of nearly 22, compared to about 16 for an MSCI World stock index.  It also lost half of its value in 2008. If you're going to invest in this sector, stay away from concentrating your holdings in single stocks. While the climate for these stocks looks good at the moment - and will certainly pay dividends over time - the short-term outlook could change rapidly.

53,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO, April 22  SAN FRANCISCO, April 22 Google Inc  will allow marketers to run online ads that send consumers to a page directly inside a mobile app, furthering the Internet company's effort to extend its multibillion-dollar advertising business to smartphones.The new advertising feature helps Google bridge the gap between the traditional public Web pages that have long underpinned its search business and the increasing number of standalone, mobile apps popular with consumers. Mobile apps, which are dedicated to everything from restaurant reviews to online games, have typically been walled off and difficult for Google to integrate into its search engine results. Last year Google began to offer so-called ""deep linking"" capabilities with a limited number of participating mobile apps.A smartphone user searching for Thai restaurants in San Francisco, for example, might see a link that opens up a page inside the OpenTable restaurant reservation app. With Tuesday's move, marketers will be able to provide the same direct pathway into their apps from the search ads and display ads that they run on Google websites. That will help companies boost the amount of time that consumers spend using their mobile apps, Google said. The new feature, which Google said will be available in the next few months, will initially appear only on smartphones that run on Google's Android software.Google, the world's No. 1 Internet search engine, generates the vast majority of its revenue from advertising. But its ad rates, like those of other Internet companies, have been under pressure as more consumers access its online services on small-screened mobile devices, where advertising rates are lower than on PCs.

54,"  * RWE struck deal with Google's Nest last week* Banks on energy efficiency products for end-clients* Sees high investor demand for wind power projectsBy Christoph Steitz and Tom KäckenhoffESSEN, Germany, April 23 German utility RWE  plans to sell more energy saving products, its head of strategy said, as it strives to offset some of the losses made by its power plants across Europe.European utilities are facing weak energy demand, as well as an uncontrolled expansion of solar and wind power, which is replacing gas and coal-fired plants and pushing many of them into the red.Sector players, including RWE and smaller German peer EnBW , are now looking to make money by helping customers to save energy instead of selling them more. RWE is banking on energy management services to corporate and retail clients, including so-called ""smart"" products which sell for at least 200 euros ($280) each and let customers control washing machines, lights and heaters via mobile devices.Last week, RWE struck an agreement with Nest Labs Inc - a maker of smart thermostats and smoke alarms that was acquired by Google earlier this year - to exclusively sell Nest's Learning Thermostat in the UK.The device tracks household energy usage and employs the data to automatically set temperatures, helping to cut heating bills by up to one-fifth.""We can very well imagine entering further cooperations in this area,"" said Thomas Birr, head of strategy at RWE, Germany's second-largest utility after E.ON. Birr, RWE's strategy head since 2009, is tasked with finding new business opportunities for the company, which is under pressure from falling earnings and 30.7 billion euros ($42.4 billion) in net debt.RWE is also selling Philips' Hue wireless lighting system as part of its smart home offering. While not spelling out concrete earnings targets, RWE has suggested the market for new business areas, including energy services and smart home products, could rise to about 50 billion euros in revenues by the end of the decade.Birr also said there was interest among investors to enter renewable projects, notably onshore and offshore wind projects - another area where RWE is looking to expand.""There is investment pressure on international investors and pension funds that are willing to invest in the energy sector,"" Birr said, adding RWE was working on several offshore projects.Offshore wind parks are attractive assets for utilities due to their size, but high investment costs mean cash-strapped energy firms need to tow in investors to finance these projects, usually worth at least 1 billion euros.Birr said RWE might help realise renewable projects in the Gulf region at some point in the future, adding it would offer know-how, but not build its own power plants there.($1 = 0.7248 Euros)   (Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-04-23,GOOGL,"Wed Apr 23, 2014 | 9:33am EDT",RWE eyes bigger role in energy saving business,http://www.reuters.com//article/rwe-strategy-idUSL6N0NE2H920140423?type=companyNews
55,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Four major tech companies including Apple and Google have agreed to pay a total of $324 million to settle a lawsuit accusing them of conspiring to hold down salaries in Silicon Valley, sources familiar with the deal said, just weeks before a high profile trial had been scheduled to begin.Tech workers filed a class action lawsuit against Apple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Inc and Adobe Systems Inc in 2011, alleging they conspired to refrain from soliciting one another's employees in order to avert a salary war. They planned to ask for $3 billion in damages at trial, according to court filings. That could have tripled to $9 billion under antitrust law.The case has been closely watched due to the potentially high damages award and the opportunity to peek into the world of Silicon Valley's elite. The case was based largely on emails in which Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and some of their Silicon Valley rivals hatched plans to avoid poaching each other's prized engineers.In one email exchange after a Google recruiter solicited an Apple employee, Schmidt told Jobs that the recruiter would be fired, court documents show. Jobs then forwarded Schmidt's note to a top Apple human resources executive with a smiley face.Another exchange shows Google's human resources director asking Schmidt about sharing its no-cold call agreements with competitors. Schmidt, now the company's executive chairman, advised discretion.""Schmidt responded that he preferred it be shared 'verbally, since I don't want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later?'"" he said, according to a court filing. The HR director agreed.The companies had acknowledged entering into some no-hire agreements but disputed the allegation that they had conspired to drive down wages. Moreover, they argued that the employees should not be allowed to sue as a group. Rich Gray, a Silicon Valley antitrust expert in private practice, said the companies had an incentive to avoid trial because their executives' emails would make them look extremely unsympathetic to a jury. However, the plaintiff attorneys risked an appeals court saying the engineers could not sue as a group at all.""An appellate court could say, 'Hey we just don't buy that,'"" Gray said.Trial had been scheduled to begin at the end of May on behalf of roughly 64,000 workers. Spokespeople for Apple, Google and Intel declined to comment. An Adobe representative said that the company denies it engaged in any wrongdoing, but settled ""in order to avoid the uncertainties, cost and distraction of litigation.""

62,"  (Adds comments from Google and Linux Foundation officials)By Jim FinkleBOSTON, April 24 The world's biggest technology companies are donating millions of dollars to fund improvements in open source programs like OpenSSL, the software whose ""Heartbleed"" bug has sent the computer industry into turmoil.Amazon.com Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Facebook Inc, Google Inc, IBM, Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp are among a dozen companies that have agreed to be founding members of a group known as Core Infrastructure Initiative. Each will donate $300,000 to the venture, which is recruiting more backers among technology companies as well as the financial services sector.Other early supporters are Dell, Fujitsu Ltd NetApp Inc, Rackspace Hosting Inc and VMware Inc .The industry is stepping up after the group of developers who volunteer to maintain OpenSSL revealed that they received donations averaging about $2,000 a year to support the project, whose code is used to secure two-thirds of the world's websites and is incorporated into products from many of the world's most profitable technology companies. ""I think we get complacent as an industry when we see something as working well or working 'well enough.' We sort of see it as a 'maintenance job,'"" said Chris DiBona, director of open source and engineering with Google. ""We have to be a bit more vigilant.""The Heartbleed bug has likely cost businesses tens of millions of dollars in lost productivity as they have had to update systems with safe versions of OpenSSL, according to security experts. Also, it has already resulted in at least one major cyber attack: the theft of data from Canada's tax authority.The non-profit Linux Foundation, which promotes development of the open source Linux operating system, organized the group, whose formation it announced on Thursday. It will support development of OpenSSL as well as other pieces of open source software that make up critical parts of the world's technology infrastructure, but whose programmers do not necessarily have adequate funding to support their work, said Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation.Heartbleed is a major bug in OpenSSL encryption software that is widely used to secure websites and technology products including mobile phones, data center software and telecommunications equipment. It makes systems vulnerable to data theft by hackers who can attack them without leaving a trace.Open source software refers to programs developed by groups of developers spread across the globe, who seek community involvement to improve the code. Companies are typically free to incorporate such code in their products without paying any fees to volunteer developers who maintain the code. Some types of open-source software, such as Linux and the MySQL database, have versions that are sold by companies such as Red Hat Inc and Oracle Corp, which offer premium services such as updates and help-desk support.The Core Infrastructure Initiative expects to offer one or more of the small crew of OpenSSL developers full-time jobs working on the project through fellowships, Zemlin said in an interview.It will also identify other projects like OpenSSL that it believes are equally critical to the infrastructure of the Internet and merit support.Eben Moglen, a Columbia Law School professor and attorney who represents many open-source software projects, said he believes there are six to 10 such open-source software.""The process of keeping software secure is constant. It never stops,"" said Moglen, whose clients include the group of OpenSSL developers.

64,"   By Diane Bartz and Dan Levine | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court on Friday revived patent claims Apple made against Google's Motorola Mobility unit that had been dismissed shortly before trial, giving the iPhone maker another chance to seek a sales ban against its smartphone competitor.The appeals court also revived a patent claim Motorola Mobility had made against Apple but ruled Motorola could not seek a sales ban of its own.Apple and companies that make phones using Google's Android software have filed dozens of such lawsuits against each other around the world to protect their technology. Apple, in particular, argues that Android phones that use Google software copy its iPhones.In litigation between technology companies that boast multi-billion dollar margins, court-ordered sales bans are seen as a far more serious threat than monetary damages. Despite years of court challenges to Android, Apple has not been able to win a crippling injunction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had been hearing two cases - one in which Apple accused Motorola Mobility, which has since been bought by Google, of infringing its patents. Motorola, in turn, accused Apple of infringing three patents, including one that is essential to ensuring smartphones are interoperable.The cases were consolidated at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Richard Posner, who took the case, dismissed it in 2012 before trial, saying that neither company had sufficient evidence to prove its case.The appeals court considered six patents in the two cases - three belonging to Apple and three to Motorola Mobility. The two companies had appealed a variety of issues, ranging from the definitions of some patents to whether money damages were sufficient for infringement or if sales bans should be put on infringing products. Posner had ruled an injunction barring the sale of Motorola phones would harm consumers. He also had ruled that even if infringement occurred, Apple could not sue because it could not prove it had been hurt by the infringement. But the appeals court decided Posner defined one of Apple's patents too narrowly and ordered him to reconsider Apple's request for an injunction.The appeals court affirmed the lower court's decisions on two Motorola Mobility patents. But, as in the case of the Apple patent, it disagreed with the lower court's decision that Motorola Mobility would be entitled to no damages even if infringement was proven on a third patent. The appeals court said, however, that Motorola Mobility cannot request an injunction for infringement of that patent, the appeals court said. Since the appeal began, Google announced that it was selling Motorola Mobility's handset business to Lenovo but would keep the vast majority of the patents.

65,"  (Adds details on decision, background on dispute)By Diane Bartz and Dan LevineWASHINGTON, April 25 A U.S. appeals court on Friday revived patent claims Apple made against Google's Motorola Mobility unit that had been dismissed shortly before trial, giving the iPhone maker another chance to seek a sales ban against its smartphone competitor.The appeals court also revived a patent claim Motorola Mobility had made against Apple but ruled Motorola could not seek a sales ban of its own.Apple and companies that make phones using Google's Android software have filed dozens of such lawsuits against each other around the world to protect their technology. Apple, in particular, argues that Android phones that use Google software copy its iPhones. In litigation between technology companies that boast multi-billion dollar margins, court-ordered sales bans are seen as a far more serious threat than monetary damages. Despite years of court challenges to Android, Apple has not been able to win a crippling injunction.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had been hearing two cases - one in which Apple accused Motorola Mobility, which has since been bought by Google, of infringing its patents. Motorola, in turn, accused Apple of infringing three patents, including one that is essential to ensuring smartphones are interoperable.The cases were consolidated at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Richard Posner, who took the case, dismissed it in 2012 before trial, saying that neither company had sufficient evidence to prove its case. The appeals court considered six patents in the two cases - three belonging to Apple and three to Motorola Mobility. The two companies had appealed a variety of issues, ranging from the definitions of some patents to whether money damages were sufficient for infringement or if sales bans should be put on  infringing products.Posner had ruled an injunction barring the sale of Motorola phones would harm consumers. He also had ruled that even if infringement occurred, Apple could not sue because it could not prove it had been hurt by the infringement. But the appeals court decided Posner defined one of Apple's patents too narrowly and ordered him to reconsider Apple's request for an injunction. The appeals court affirmed the lower court's decisions on two Motorola Mobility patents. But, as in the case of the Apple patent, it disagreed with the lower court's decision that Motorola Mobility would be entitled to no damages even if infringement was proven on a third patent. The appeals court said, however, that Motorola Mobility cannot request an injunction for infringement of that patent, the appeals court said.Since the appeal began, Google announced that it was selling Motorola Mobility's handset business to Lenovo but would keep the vast majority of the patents. It is unclear if Lenovo will assume liability in the patent fights.Apple and Google both declined to comment.The case is at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and is Apple Inc. V. Motorola Mobility. It is case number 2012-1528, -1549.

67,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Four major tech companies including Apple and Google have agreed to pay a total of $324 million to settle a lawsuit accusing them of conspiring to hold down salaries in Silicon Valley, sources familiar with the deal said, just weeks before a high profile trial had been scheduled to begin.Tech workers filed a class action lawsuit against Apple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Inc and Adobe Systems Inc in 2011, alleging they conspired to refrain from soliciting one another's employees in order to avert a salary war. They planned to ask for $3 billion in damages at trial, according to court filings. That could have tripled to $9 billion under antitrust law.The case has been closely watched due to the potentially high damages award and the opportunity to peek into the world of Silicon Valley's elite. The case was based largely on emails in which Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and some of their Silicon Valley rivals hatched plans to avoid poaching each other's prized engineers.In one email exchange after a Google recruiter solicited an Apple employee, Schmidt told Jobs that the recruiter would be fired, court documents show. Jobs then forwarded Schmidt's note to a top Apple human resources executive with a smiley face.Another exchange shows Google's human resources director asking Schmidt about sharing its no-cold call agreements with competitors. Schmidt, now the company's executive chairman, advised discretion.""Schmidt responded that he preferred it be shared 'verbally, since I don't want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later?'"" he said, according to a court filing. The HR director agreed.The companies had acknowledged entering into some no-hire agreements but disputed the allegation that they had conspired to drive down wages. Moreover, they argued that the employees should not be allowed to sue as a group. Rich Gray, a Silicon Valley antitrust expert in private practice, said the companies had an incentive to avoid trial because their executives' emails would make them look extremely unsympathetic to a jury. However, the plaintiff attorneys risked an appeals court saying the engineers could not sue as a group at all.""An appellate court could say, 'Hey we just don't buy that,'"" Gray said.Trial had been scheduled to begin at the end of May on behalf of roughly 64,000 workers. Spokespeople for Apple, Google and Intel declined to comment. An Adobe representative said that the company denies it engaged in any wrongdoing, but settled ""in order to avoid the uncertainties, cost and distraction of litigation."" An attorney for the plaintiffs, Kelly Dermody of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, in a statement called the deal ""an excellent resolution.""Corporate defendants in antitrust cases often agree among themselves what portion each will contribute towards a settlement, said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. One likely formula would be to divide the damages based on how many employees each company has in the class, he said.Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel in 2010 settled a U.S. Department of Justice probe by agreeing not to enter into such no-hire deals in the future. The four companies had since been fighting the civil antitrust class action.Walt Disney Co's Pixar and Lucasfilm units and Intuit Inc had already agreed to a settlement, with Disney paying about $9 million and Intuit paying $11 million. Any settlement must be approved by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. A hearing on final approval of the Intuit and Disney deals is scheduled for next week.The plaintiffs and the companies will disclose principal terms of the settlement by May 27, according to the court filing on Thursday, though it is unclear whether that will spell out what each company will pay.Some Silicon Valley companies refused to enter into no-hire agreements. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, for instance, rebuffed an entreaty from Google in 2008 that they refrain from poaching each other's employees.Additionally, Apple's Jobs threatened Palm with a patent lawsuit if Palm didn't agree to stop soliciting Apple employees. However, then Palm Chief Executive Edward Colligan told Jobs that the plan was ""likely illegal,"" and that Palm was not ""intimidated"" by the threat.The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, 11-cv-2509.(Reporting by Dan Levine, editing by Peter Henderson)",2014-04-25,GOOGL,"Thu Apr 24, 2014 | 9:49pm EDT","Exclusive: Apple, Google to pay $324 million to settle conspiracy lawsuit",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-apple-google-lawsuit-exclusive-idUSBREA3N28Z20140425?type=companyNews

70,"  (Adds additional quotes from lawyers)By Dan LevineSAN JOSE, Calif., April 29 Apple has vastly exaggerated the importance of its patented iPhone features, a Samsung attorney said on Tuesday as the two companies delivered closing arguments to jurors after a month-long trial over mobile technology.Apple, however, argued that the South Korean company could not have competed in the smartphone market without unfairly copying its flagship product. The two tech leaders also sparred over how Google's work on the software used in Samsung phones affects Apple's patent claims.Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  have been litigating around the world for three years. Jurors awarded the iPhone maker about $930 million after a 2012 trial in San Jose, California, but Apple failed to persuade U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh to issue a permanent injunction against the sale of Samsung phones.The current case involves five Apple patents that were not in the 2012 trial and which cover iPhone features like slide to unlock and search technology. Apple is again seeking to ban sales of several Samsung phones, including the Galaxy S III, as well as roughly $2 billion in damages.Samsung also claims Apple violated two patents on streaming video. It is seeking to ban the iPhone 5, and asserted a $6 million damages claim. In court on Tuesday, Samsung attorney William Price said some of Apple's patented technology in the case was never even incorporated into the iPhone. That undermines Cupertino, California-based Apple's claim for billions in damages.Another Samsung attorney, John Quinn, suggested that Apple devised its $2 billion request to artificially inflate the value of the technology in the case and confuse the jury.""They'll be dancing in the streets in Cupertino if you give them 100 million,"" Quinn said.But Apple attorney Harold McElhinny said Samsung's copying of Apple technology has greatly harmed the iPhone maker and turned the smartphone market into a two horse race. ""Unlike in fairly tales, we know that Samsung's illegal strategy has been wildly successful,"" McElhinny said.Additionally, Apple attorney William Lee said Samsung's low damages request on its own patents was meant to cheapen intellectual property in general. Samsung paid its expert witnesses about $5 million in fees in order to seek $6 million in damages, Lee said.""Does that make sense?"" Lee said. ""Only in one circumstance: if you're trying to devalue patents, all patents."" Samsung's phones run on the Android mobile operating system developed by Google Inc. Google is not a defendant in the case, but during the trial Samsung pointed out that some of the features Apple claims to own were actually invented by Google. Samsung called a handful of Google executives to testify on its behalf.McElhinny said the fact that Google developed Android is irrelevant to Apple's ability to collect damages from Samsung. Google agreed to reimburse Samsung for some of those costs, he said.""At the end of the day Google will not be an issue for you,"" McElhinny said.However, Samsung's Quinn said Apple sued Samsung because the iPhone maker did not want to fight Google, another iconic Silicon Valley company, ""in our backyard.""The jury began deliberating on Tuesday and a verdict could be reached at any time. If either company proves patent infringement, they could then ask Koh to order a sales ban.The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is Apple Inc vs Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 12-630.

Microsoft on Monday raised its OneDrive for Business storage to 1TB per user from 25GB.Microsoft's pitch to be the one-stop destination for companies looking to buy technology runs against efforts by smaller rivals such as Box and Dropbox that offer one or two specialized services.Microsoft did not name its rivals but made a reference to them in the headline of its blog post titled ""Thinking outside the box."" (link.reuters.com/byj88v)Dropbox spokeswoman declined to comment on the Microsoft move. Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie fired back in a blog post, criticizing Microsoft for keeping its storage software ""closed"" and making it difficult for users to move their data between different services. ""By keeping Office 365 users on the closed OneDrive ""island,"" Microsoft is stranding hundreds of millions of users and customers that have chosen Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and others,"" Levie wrote in response to Microsoft's move. (r.reuters.com/pyj88v)Online document-sharing company Dropbox is a Silicon Valley startup that has proved a hit with consumers and boasts more than 200 million users six years after it was started. It has undergone tremendous growth amid the meteoric rise of cloud, which is expected to continue booming alongside mobile computing. While Dropbox won plaudits for its ease-of-use and gained traction among individual users, Levie focused Box in recent years toward catering to corporate customers who demanded greater levels of administrative control and security.Both companies are expected to go public in the coming months. Cloud services have become increasingly popular among both cash-strapped tech startups and larger companies, which rely on computers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc  and Google Inc instead of buying the equipment themselves.Investors are excited about Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella's focus on mobile and cloud computing, designed to take Microsoft beyond its traditional PC-based Windows business.Microsoft, which reported results Thursday, saw Nadella's emphasis on cloud computing help its server software business in the third quarter, while a softer-than-expected decline in PC sales limited damage to the bottom line.

72,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Facebook introduced new features on Wednesday that let users limit how much personal information they share with third-party mobile apps, a move meant to quell privacy concerns as the social network seeks to become a top entry port to the Internet.In recent years, Facebook Inc has successfully encouraged a growing number of third-party app makers to allow users to log in with their Facebook identity rather than, say, by entering an email address or creating a dedicated account.The result has been an influx of valuable data for the world's No. 1 social network, but concerns have also mounted about third-party developers gaining access to private information.Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said at Facebook's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday that a new version of Facebook's log-in tool, called ""log in anonymously,"" would let users control what information they allow third-party apps to see. He told developers the tool would let users feel more comfortable about logging into apps using Facebook.""By giving people more power and control, they're going to trust all the apps that we build more, and over time use them more. And that's positive for everyone,"" said Zuckerberg.The revamped log-in screen will let users select which personal information stored on the social network, such as an email address, birthday or items that they have ""liked"" on Facebook, can be accessed by any particular app. The user's names and gender will remain visible to the app.On Wednesday, the social network also rolled out a new service to distribute ads across a network of mobile applications, opening the door to a new source of revenue.The service, which has been in the works on for some time, allows mobile-app makers to insert various ads within their software, with Facebook sharing advertising dollars with the developers. ""This is really the first time that we're going to help you monetize in a serious way on mobile,"" Zuckerberg said.Facebook faces tough competition in the active mobile ad network market. Google Inc's AdMob service already allows advertisers to distribute ads to mobile apps, while Twitter Inc said on Tuesday that its MoPub ad network can reach 1 billion mobile users.Twitter's MoPub, which serves as an advertising management tool for app publishers, will allow mobile apps to feature ads for the Facebook audience as well as other networks, the two companies said. Facebook began testing a mobile ad network with a limited number of advertisers and mobile app publishers in January. It plans to expand the number of app makers that can use the service, although it did not provide a time frame for when the system will become broadly available.The new mobile ad system, dubbed the Facebook Audience Network, will leverage Facebook's more than 1 million advertisers and its own ability to target users based on their traits.Facebook generates the bulk of its revenue from ads that appear on its own Web pages and within its own mobile app. By distributing ads across a constellation of independent mobile apps, Facebook effectively expands its advertising space, opening the door to more revenue.To get access to the extra ad space, ad networks typically share the revenue with their partners. Facebook will share most of the ad revenue with apps makers, as is standard in the industry, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Andre Grenon)",2014-04-30,GOOGL,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 7:02pm EDT",Facebook lets users limit data shared with apps,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-facebook-mobile-advertising-idUSBREA3T0ZV20140430?type=companyNews
73,"   By Jason Bush | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Fortune has smiled on judo coach Arkady Rotenberg, bringing his businesses Google-like growth and a key role in staging the Winter Olympics. It has now brought down on him the wrath of the United States government.Rotenberg says his success has nothing to do with personal favors from his childhood sparring partner, Vladimir Putin, and has denounced this week's Ukraine-linked sanctions on his companies as an affront to the spirit of free enterprise.Following personal U.S. visa bans and asset freezes imposed on Rotenberg and his younger brother Boris last month, the new measures against pipeline construction firm Stroygazmontazh (SGM) and banks SMP and Investcapitalbank have, if nothing else, thrust the media-shy sportsman into the spotlight.SGM, 51-percent owned by Arkady Rotenberg, 62, saw revenues grow by a factor of nearly 50 after its creation in 2008 from several units sold by Gazprom. In four years, working for the state-run energy giant and others, it had laid 11,600 km (7,200 miles) of pipeline - enough to reach all the way from his and Putin's native St. Petersburg to the Pacific. And back.SMP, in which he and his brother each have a 38-percent stake, has also done well. With assets of 208 billion rubles ($5.8 billion) and about 100 branches it stands only 35th on a ranking by Interfax. But with assets growing 52 percent in the year, it is one of the fastest growing banks in Russia.In a rare interview in 2012, he told Forbes, which puts his current wealth at $4 billion, that Putin did him no favors in securing public contracts: ""Vladimir Vladimirovich doesn't protect me,"" he said.But there were other benefits, he added: ""If people didn't give me all this publicity, calling me a 'Friend of Putin', then my business would be worse. And so it's growing well"".

He founded a judo club there and made Putin honorary president in 1998, two years before the former KGB agent took over in the Kremlin.Rotenberg's enterprises have now made him the 27th richest man in Russia, according to Forbes, which estimates his firms won $28 billion in state contracts over the past five years.For Putin's critics, that personal tale of good fortune, however, is symbolic of ""crony capitalism"" that they say has been the hallmark of Putin's 14-year rule. ""This is privileged insider business,"" said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.SGM says on its Web site that it implements ""the most important strategic projects"" of state-controlled Gazprom. These include the Southern Corridor, a network of pipelines that will supply gas to Gazprom's flagship South Stream pipeline to southern Europe. According to the Ruslana database, and confirmed by SGM, the group's revenues have been growing by $2-3 billion a year - reaching $10.7 billion in 2012, up from $235 million in 2008. Assets grew to $5.3 billion from $370 million over the period.An SGM spokesman said U.S. sanctions would not have a great impact as it mainly operates in Russia but that they would hurt some U.S. firms that supply it with construction equipment.SMP said that the sanctions had hurt the bank's operations but were not causing direct losses. It said it was fulfilling all its obligations to clients and had no liquidity problems.Another of Arkady Rotenberg's interests, Mostotrest, which calls itself Russia's biggest builder of transport infrastructure, has also grown strongly on the back of state contracts but has avoided the U.S. Treasury sanctions.It is 38.6-percent owned by a firm controlled by Rotenberg and his son Igor and saw 2013 revenues rise 24 percent to 117 billion rubles ($3.3 billion) with another three times that much in outstanding orders. Heavily involved in the Sochi Games and also building a $3.4-billion motorway from Moscow to St. Petersburg, 92 percent of its orders are from public entities.""It is the contractor of choice,"" said Kevin Whyte, analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow.

75,"  SAN FRANCISCO, April 30 Facebook Inc  rolled out a new service that it envisions will distribute ads across a network of mobile applications, opening the door to a new source of revenue for the Internet social network.The service, which the world's No. 1 social network has been working on for some time, allows mobile-app makers to insert various types of ads within their software, with Facebook sharing advertising dollars with the developers.""This is really the first time that we're going to help you monetize in a serious way on mobile,"" Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said at the company's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.Facebook also described new features that make it easier for users to limit how much personal information they share with third-party mobile apps, and that let users log into social apps without providing their identity. A revamped Facebook log-in screen for independent mobile apps will let users select which bits of personal information stored on the social network, such as their email address, birthday and items that they've ""liked"" on Facebook, can be accessed by any particular app.Facebook will face tough competition in the mobile ad network market. Google's AdMob service already allows advertisers to distribute ads to mobile apps, while Twitter  said on Tuesday its MoPub ad network can reach 1 billion mobile users. Facebook began testing a mobile ad network with a limited number of advertisers and mobile app publishers in January. It will be expanding the number of app makers that can use the service, though the company did not provide a time frame for when it will become broadly available. The new mobile ad network, dubbed the Facebook Audience Network, will leverage Facebook's more than 1 million advertisers and its own ability to target users based on their various traits.Facebook generates the bulk of its revenue from ads that appear on its own Web pages and within its own mobile app. By distributing ads across a constellation of independent mobile apps, Facebook effectively expands its available advertising space, opening the door to more revenue.To get access to the extra ad space, ad networks typically share a portion of the ad revenue with their partners.   Facebook will share most of the ad revenue with apps makers, as is standard within the industry, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

76,"  (Repeats story filed on Wednesday, no change in text)* Sanctioned businessman is Putin's childhood judo partner* Arkady Rotenberg says friendship incidental to success* U.S. Treasury cites vast wealth accumulated under Putin* State contracts, ""Putin's pet projects"" fuel firms' growthBy Jason BushMOSCOW, April 30 Fortune has smiled on judo coach Arkady Rotenberg, bringing his businesses Google-like growth and a key role in staging the Winter Olympics. It has now brought down on him the wrath of the United States government.Rotenberg says his success has nothing to do with personal favours from his childhood sparring partner, Vladimir Putin, and has denounced this week's Ukraine-linked sanctions on his companies as an affront to the spirit of free enterprise.Following personal U.S. visa bans and asset freezes imposed on Rotenberg and his younger brother Boris last month, the new measures against pipeline construction firm Stroygazmontazh (SGM) and banks SMP and Investcapitalbank have, if nothing else, thrust the media-shy sportsman into the spotlight.SGM, 51-percent owned by Arkady Rotenberg, 62, saw revenues grow by a factor of nearly 50 after its creation in 2008 from several units sold by Gazprom. In four years, working for the state-run energy giant and others, it had laid 11,600 km (7,200 miles) of pipeline - enough to reach all the way from his and Putin's native St. Petersburg to the Pacific. And back. SMP, in which he and his brother each have a 38-percent stake, has also done well. With assets of 208 billion roubles ($5.8 billion) and about 100 branches it stands only 35th on a ranking by Interfax. But with assets growing 52 percent in the year, it is one of the fastest growing banks in Russia.In a rare interview in 2012, he told Forbes, which puts his current wealth at $4 billion, that Putin did him no favours in securing public contracts: ""Vladimir Vladimirovich doesn't protect me,"" he said.But there were other benefits, he added: ""If people didn't give me all this publicity, calling me a 'Friend of Putin', then my business would be worse. And so it's growing well"".The U.S. Treasury noted: ""Both brothers have amassed enormous amounts of wealth during the years of Putin's rule.""It estimated the Rotenbergs' personal wealth grew by $2.5 billion in just the last two years and that Arkady Rotenberg's firms had secured $7 billion of contracts for the Winter Olympics Russia hosted at Sochi in February, part of what the Treasury called the brothers' ""support to Putin's pet projects"". A spokesman for the Rotenbergs and SGM called the sanctions ""illegitimate, because they undermine the very spirit of free enterprise and business"".CRONY CAPITALISM Arkady Rotenberg first sparred with Putin in their home city, then known as Leningrad, in the 1960s. He founded a judo club there and made Putin honorary president in 1998, two years before the former KGB agent took over in the Kremlin. Rotenberg's enterprises have now made him the 27th richest man in Russia, according to Forbes, which estimates his firms won $28 billion in state contracts over the past five years.For Putin's critics, that personal tale of good fortune, however, is symbolic of ""crony capitalism"" that they say has been the hallmark of Putin's 14-year rule. ""This is privileged insider business,"" said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.SGM says on its Web site that it implements ""the most important strategic projects"" of state-controlled Gazprom . These include the Southern Corridor, a network of pipelines that will supply gas to Gazprom's flagship South Stream pipeline to southern Europe.According to the Ruslana database, and confirmed by SGM, the group's revenues have been growing by $2-3 billion a year - reaching $10.7 billion in 2012, up from $235 million in 2008.

77,"  * First-quarter adjusted EPS $0.61 vs est $0.54* Total revenue up 30 pct* M&A and other advisory fees double   (Updates share price, adds Breakingviews link)May 1 Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd more than doubled its adjusted quarterly profit as its merger advisory revenue soared in a thriving M&A market.Lazard's financial advisory revenue soared 64 percent to $275.5 million in the first quarter ended March 31, driven by a doubling of M&A and other advisory fees.Worldwide deal making has totaled $1.1 trillion so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, helped by a flurry of deals in the healthcare and media sectors. This is just the third time that M&A volume has crossed the $1 trillion dollar in the same period since 1980. Lazard advised Shire Plc on its $4.2 billion buy of ViroPharma Inc and Google Inc on its $3.2 billion acquisition of Nest Labs, among others in the first quarter.""Financial Advisory activity increased as our public, private and sovereign clients sought trusted advice on complex assignments,"" Lazard Chief Executive Kenneth Jacobs said in a statement on Thursday. Lazard's profit rose to $81.3 million, or 61 cents per share, on an adjusted basis in the three months ended March 31, from $37.2 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 54 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue grew 30 percent to $549.4 million, above the average analysts estimate of $514.8 million. Lazard has been diversifying its business to rely less on merger advisory revenue, which tends to be volatile, by expanding its asset-management unit.That business did well last quarter as a rise in stock prices boosted fees. Asset-management revenue rose 9 percent to $262.3 million.Average assets under management rose to $186 billion in the first-quarter from $171 billion.Lazard said fourth-quarter compensation costs fell to 58.8 percent of operating revenue in the quarter from 60 percent last year - within its goal of a ""mid-to-high"" 50 percent range.Lazard shares rose 5 percent to $49.43 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has risen 3 percent since it reported fourth-quarter results in February.

78,"   By Mary Papenfuss | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Activists have sued the city and county of San Francisco over a pilot program giving shuttles run by Google and other private companies access to municipal bus stops, claiming it favors higher-paid technology workers over low-income residents.The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court on Thursday, marks the latest sign of tensions in the Bay Area over the growing income divide, which has been widened by the latest tech industry boom.Late last year, protesters began to block the commuter buses that ferry employees from San Francisco to the offices of tech companies, including Facebook, Google and Yahoo, south of the city, which they say symbolize the rift being created by abundant tech money.Under the 18-month pilot program the unmarked, WiFi-equipped buses use San Francisco Municipal transit system stops for a fee of $1 per stop per day and are viewed by many as a symbol of the industry's disconnect from a broader community left behind by the tech boom. The lawsuit, filed by a coalition of transit and housing activists and a labor union, argues that in addition to displacing lower-income workers, the buses will increase pollution, boost risks to pedestrians and bicyclists and interfere with public transit.""It's a good thing to transport employees to work on buses, but there is an impact,"" said Oakland attorney Richard Drury, who's representing the plaintiffs. ""We want the city to analyze what that is and mitigate the harm as much as possible.""

88,"   By Jennifer Saba, Kate Holton and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON The collapse of the $35 billion merger of New York-based Omnicom with France's Publicis is likely to lead the world's biggest ad agencies to think small as they try to counter the challenge from internet giants like Google.Since announcing their merger last July, executives from the two firms touted the creation of the world's biggest ad agency as the best way to gain scale and capital to compete on price and invest in technology as clients squeeze the agencies on cost.One of the prime motivations for the deal was the competition coming from a host of rivals ranging from Google and Facebook, software companies Oracle and Salesforce and consulting firms Accenture and IBM, which are siphoning off business that traditionally belonged to ad firms.After this week's break-up, which was due in large part to a clash of cultures and egos, the two firms need to rethink their approach. Bankers and industry executives say buying smaller ad technology companies may be their best bet to capture the billions of dollars flowing toward digital advertising.""You have two massive organizations that singularly focused their future on a combination of scale to deliver better costs and that is not going to happen now,"" said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, a firm that sells TV advertising. He pointed to recent deals by Google and AOL focused on small ad technology companies that provide analytics.Greater scale was supposed to give the new Omnicom-Publicis group better bargaining power in buying space for ads on TV, the internet, and print at a time when many global brands are looking to cut costs on advertising.That rationale was never completely clear, one major Omnicom client told Reuters. And with the promised increase in scale no longer an option, the two firms have to explain to their clients what they can offer instead.NEED FOR INSIGHT One thing they need to provide is greater insight on what works and how cost effective ads are, especially in digital advertising, ad executives and analysts say.Consumers now interact with media in a host of different ways, from the traditional sources of TV, radio, billboards and newspapers, to the different offerings online and on mobile including basic portals and social networks.That has forced ad agencies and clients to change how they value the influence of an ad. A consumer seeing a traditional TV commercial may then go online to search for a deal before eventually buying the product in a store some time later, having been reminded of it by a nearby billboard. With so many moving parts, the ad agencies have turned to data analytics to better understand and predict the behavior of consumers.It is the need for such insight that has put them on a collision course with the big internet and software companies.But Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at Pivotal, believes there is room for both to operate within the industry.""Marketing services and technology are becoming increasingly interchangeable,"" he said adding there is still room for growth since more services are needed given the fragmented media landscape.Jeff Lanctot, president and CEO of Mixpo, a company that helps companies create video ads, said the need for scale had actually decreased in recent years as digital advertising - which accounts for nearly a quarter of global marketing spend - used real-time auctions to buy media space.""Buying power has been the real pitch from the holding companies,"" he said. ""I think what is the better approach is to get much more aggressive in technology acquisitions."" SMALL BITES Two relatively small deals announced in the last week could be a sign of things to come.AOL, which has been investing in automated exchanges where machines buy and sell digital advertising, said this week it would pay $101 million to buy Convertro Inc, a platform that helps advertisers manage spending budgets across different media.On the same day Google announced it was acquiring Adometry, which offers the ability to understand the influence that different marketing tools have on consumer decisions.One sector banker pointed to providers of retargeting - which shows ads of a certain brand to consumers who have already visited that brand's site - and data analytics for advertisers as Publicis' best bet to rebound.He named Next Performance in France, Struq in the UK and myThings in Israel as the most promising sector players under the 100 million euro revenue threshold. ""These companies are getting a lot of attention. The industry will now prioritize smaller deals that bring real strategic value to investors,"" a sector adviser said.Publicly traded marketing analytics providers such as France's Criteo, which uses tracking technology to target ads at consumers surfing the web, and Rocket Fuel, which applies big data analysis to digital advertising, are seen as other promising takeover candidates for the big groups.WPP'S DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS One of the most prolific acquirer of digital groups is Martin Sorrell's WPP, which will now retain its position as the world's largest ad group.Uncharacteristically left on the sidelines last year, Sorrell wasted little time when the deal was announced in telling both his and his rivals' clients why it was doomed to fail. Having handled 46 billion pounds of billings in 2013, WPP, he said, offered scale and insight at the same time.Omnicom's CEO, John Wren, told investors on Friday that Omnicom was still in the market for acquisitions but stressed those would be small bites.His counterpart at Publicis, Maurice Levy, demurred on other big acquisitions on Friday during a call with investors.Shares in both IPG, the world's fourth largest ad group behind WPP, Omnicom and Publicis, and France's Havas, the fifth largest player, rose on Friday on hopes they too could be involved in some form of consolidation.Japan's Dentsu Inc is also seen as playing a role.Several agency CEOs and analysts said while they expected consolidation to happen, because the industry would forever be under pressure from clients to cut costs, following the Publicis-Omnicom debacle, small may be the order of the day.(Reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York, Kate Holton and Pamela Barbaglia in London; Editing by Frances Kerry)",2014-05-11,GOOGL,"Sun May 11, 2014 | 9:58am EDT","As big ad deal falls apart, firms start thinking small",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-omnicom-group-publicis-groupe-next-an-idUSBREA4A05520140511?type=companyNews

He was asked by Google to speak to reporters on Tuesday's ruling, but has no formal relationship with the company.

97,"  * Google offers to display rival links prominently* Concession would be valid in Europe for five yearsBy Foo Yun CheeST GALLEN, Switzerland, May 15 EU regulators plan to issue a final decision on their competition probe into Google after the summer break, the EU's antitrust chief said, after rivals such as Microsoft complained about how Google displays Internet search results. The world's top Internet search engine reached a deal with EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia in February by agreeing to display rivals' links more prominently, hoping to end a three-year-old case that could have led to a fine of up to $5 billion (3.6 billion euros).More than a dozen companies, including Microsoft, British price comparison site Foundem and German online mapping company Hotmaps, have accused Google of squeezing them out of the market by demoting them in Internet search results. Rivals say Google's concessions do not go far enough and will only entrench its dominance of Internet searches. And sources close to the matter have told Reuters that a third of members on the European Commission also opposed the deal, underlining the political sensitivity of the matter. European Competition Commissioner Almunia said on Thursday he was listening to the various views but would not go back on the deal.""I want this to be decided before the end of this Commission.

98,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 15 Top hedge funds shed their stakes in high-profile Internet names such as Netflix Inc  and Groupon Inc in the first quarter, moving to peers viewed as more mature and less volatile.High-growth Internet software and biotech companies were the darlings of 2013, but their shares started to fall sharply in early March. Netflix, last year's biggest S&P 500 gainer and an important hedge fund holding, is down more than 24 percent from its closing high this year.Hedge funds invested in technology and healthcare fell 3.65 percent in April, the biggest monthly decline since October 2008 and extending March's 1.8 percent decline, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.Among prominent hedge fund managers, Carl Icahn cut his holding in Netflix by 15.8 percent in the first quarter, reducing it to about 2.2 million shares. Tiger Global Management sold its entire stake of 663,000 shares during the quarter. Netflix was up on the year for most of the first quarter, so the fund is likely to have sold at the right time.Tiger also dumped its stake of 11.46 million shares in Groupon. That position was worth $134.9 million at the end of 2013 and $89.9 million at the end of the quarter. The Internet software and services sector now accounts for about 10 percent of the top 100 long positions for equity/long short hedge funds, down from 20 percent to 25 percent in January, according to Credit Suisse data.Long/short hedge fund managers moved to short bets in Internet names amid a meltdown in the group, according to Credit Suisse. Long positions in the group now account for about 25 percent of the overall gross exposure to the group, which adds together both long and short positions. That's the lowest rate in at least three years. Some funds added to their ""momentum"" exposure, with Jana Partners increasing its stake in Groupon by almost 32 percent to 40.8 million shares.Other funds moved to technology names with less lofty valuations and that are viewed as more established. Third Point sold its stakes in both Yahoo Inc and biotech company Gilead Sciences Inc but increased its Google Inc  holdings by 31.3 percent.EBay Inc, which became a darling among top U.S. hedge funds in the fourth quarter just before billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn urged the company to spin off its PayPal business, continued to find fans in the first quarter.Omega more than tripled its stake in eBay, bringing it to 2.9 million shares, while Jana opened a stake of 3.9 million shares in the first quarter. Icahn, who backed down from his demands, disclosed a new stake in eBay, holding 27.8 million shares as of March 31.

104,"  BERLIN May 17 Martin Schulz, the centre-left's candidate to lead the European Commission after EU parliamentary elections this month, has joined calls for Google's  market dominance to be subject to strict regulation.Two days ago Germany's Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said a ruling by a top European court on Tuesday that Internet firms can be made to remove irrelevant or excessive personal information from the web was a ""wake up"" call for digital safeguards.Germany was considering if firms such as Google were abusing their market leader position he said. Google has declined to comment. ""Whoever knows everything about citizens, firms and politicians achieves a level of power which doesn't belong in a pluralistic democracy,"" Schulz, who is president of the European parliament, told Reuters in Berlin. Besides concerns about what data it displays, the world's top Internet search engine Google has also faced difficulties over anti-trust issues and how it shows competitors' information. Google reached a deal with EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia in February by agreeing to display rivals' links more prominently, hoping to end a three-year-old case that could have led to a fine of up to $5 billion (3.6 billion euros).Rivals say Google's concessions do not go far enough and will only entrench its dominance of Internet searches.

Nest spokesperson Ha Thai said the company does not disclose sales figures and said that the Protect product will be available again ""in a few weeks.""Nest has provided few details about sales of its Protect smoke and carbon monoxide alarm or its 2-year-old smart thermostat, which has earned positive reviews for its sleek look and its ability to help consumers reduce their energy bills. Tony Fadell, the company's founder, was quoted in media reports in December saying that ""tens of thousands"" of the Protect devices had been activated in the first nine days of its availability in the United States, Canada and Britain.Carl Purvis, a spokesman with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said the number of units cited in the recall referred to the full production run, including products sold to consumers as well as products shipped to retailers. Nest said in April that a special feature in its Protect alarm, which allows a user to switch off the device with a wave of the hand, could be inadvertently activated under certain circumstances. The company said it would immediately deactivate the feature on all smoke alarms that are WiFi-connected while it worked on a software update to fix the defect. The company also halted all sales of the smoke alarms to prevent customers from buying a device that would need an immediate patch.The Consumer Product Safety Commission notice said Nest has received no reports of incidents, injuries or property damage.Google's January acquisition of Nest represented the second-largest deal in the Internet search company's history. The deal    positioned Google to play a bigger role in the market for smart home appliances at a time when an increasing array of electronic devices are being designed to connect to the Internet.

115,"  (Adds comment from plaintiffs' lawyer, details about plaintiffs)By Jonathan StempelMay 23 Four major Silicon Valley companies have formally agreed to pay $324.5 million to settle claims brought by employees who accused them of limiting competition by colluding not to poach each other's talent.The settlement, between Apple Inc, Google Inc , Intel Corp, Adobe Systems Inc and roughly 64,000 workers, was disclosed in papers filed late on Thursday with a federal court in San Jose, California.U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has been asked to preliminarily approve the accord at a June 19 hearing, over an objection by one of the four named plaintiffs, Michael Devine, who says the settlement let the companies off too easily.The payout was originally reported by Reuters but not officially confirmed.Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 25 percent of the settlement amount in legal fees. Filed in 2011, the lawsuit accused Silicon Valley companies of conspiring to limit competition and keep wages down for engineers, programmers and other technical staff.The case has been closely watched because of the potential $9 billion of damages sought, and its occasional embarrassing revelations into how Silicon Valley operates.Among the communications that became public were pointed emails from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs that at times admonished then-Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt to stop raiding his company. Thursday's settlement gives workers only a few thousand dollars each on average.The companies' combined profit in their latest fiscal years was about $60 billion, with three-fifths coming from Apple.In court papers, two law firms representing the plaintiffs said Devine's objection should not doom what they consider a fair and reasonable settlement for an antitrust case, and which serves the best interests of the class. They pointed to a July 2012 jury verdict in the same court that found Toshiba Corp conspired to fix prices in the liquid crystal display market but awarded just $87 million of damages, one-tenth of what was sought.""The amount of the settlement does not relate to the size or profitability of the companies we sued,"" Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. ""It relates to the claims we made, the law that applies to them, and the facts that we could prove at trial.

Google Inc is building cars that don't have steering wheels, accelerator pedals or brake pedals, in an ambitious expansion of the Internet company's efforts to develop self-driving cars.The small electric cars, which seat two passengers, are currently prototypes that Google has been building through partnerships with automotive suppliers and manufacturers, Google co-founder Sergey Brin said at the Code conference in Southern California on Tuesday.Google aims to build up to 200 such cars in the near term and hopes the vehicles will be available in various cities within a couple of years, he said.Google has been testing self-driving cars since 2009, incorporating laser sensors and radars into standard automobiles such as the Prius from Toyota Motor Corp and sport-utility vehicles from Toyota luxury car division Lexus.While those vehicles require a human to remain in the driver's seat and to take over in certain situations, the new cars operate completely autonomously. Brin said the cars could operate as a service, picking up passengers when summoned, and potentially even operate as fleets of interconnected ""trains"".""Ten seconds after getting in I was doing my email, I had forgotten I was there,"" Brin said of his experience riding in one of the pod-like vehicles, which resemble a cross between a Smart car and Volkswagen Beetle. ""It ultimately reminded me of catching a chairlift."" Brin declined to specify whether Google intended to build and sell the cars itself, saying only that the company would ""work with partners"".The driverless cars are currently limited to a maximum speed of 25 miles (40 km) an hour, but Brin said there was no reason the cars could not go as fast as 100 miles an hour or more once they had been proven to be safe.The front of the cars contain about 2 feet (61 cm) of foam and the windshield is made out of plastic instead of glass to make the cars safer, he said.  ""Within a couple of years I hope we will surpass the safety metrics we've put in place, which is to be significantly safer than a human driver, and we will start testing them without drivers and hopefully you'll be able to utilize them at some limited cities,"" Brin said. A handful of U.S. states, including California and Nevada, have passed legislation to allow testing of self-driving cars on public roads.

128,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Google and other internet companies find themselves in a quandary over how to strike a balance between privacy and freedom of information as the top world search engine took a first step towards upholding an EU privacy ruling.Google moved overnight to put up an online form that will allow European citizens to request that links to obsolete information be taken down - its first response to the ruling by Europe's top court on ""the right to be forgotten"". The ruling on May 13 upheld a 1995 European law on data protection and ordered Google to remove links to a 1998 newspaper article about the repossession of a Spanish man's home. ]That puts Google and other internet companies in the position of having to interpret the court's broad criteria for information that is ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"" as well as developing criteria for distinguishing public figures from private individuals.After putting up the online form in the early hours of Friday, Google received 12,000 requests across Europe, sometimes averaging 20 per minute, by late in the day, the company said.""The court's ruling requires Google to make difficult judgements about an individual's right to be forgotten and the public's right to know,"" a Google spokesman said.Next week representatives from the EU's 28 data protection authorities are due to discuss the implications of the ruling at a two-day meeting. Digital rights campaigners say the EU authorities need to agree on a common approach to guide the search engine companies.""Companies should not be tasked with balancing fundamental rights or making decisions on the appropriateness, lawfulness, or relevance of information they did not publish,"" said Raegan MacDonald, European policy manager at Access, a digital rights organization.PUBLIC INTEREST TEST  Privacy has been a hot topic in Europe since revelations last year about mass U.S. surveillance programs involving EU citizens and some heads of state.Europe already has some of the most stringent data protection laws in the world, and the EU Commission has put forward a reform package to strengthen them even further. Member states have yet to agree to the proposals.It is not the first time that Google has had legal problems over privacy.In January a German court ordered Google to block search results in Germany linking to photos of a sex party involving former Formula One boss Max Mosley. Two months earlier a French court had also ruled against Google in the Mosley case. Advocates of freedom of speech have said the May ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union paves the way for the rich and powerful as well as for criminals to conceal information.The court allows Google to apply a public interest test in deciding whether to remove the search results. Politicians seeking to have incriminating information removed will probably not be able to benefit, according to lawyers.In addition, the ruling does not mean that the information in question will be deleted, just the link appearing in search results.Google said it had convened a committee of senior company executives and independent experts to try and craft a long-term approach to dealing with the barrage of requests.Yahoo Inc which also operates a search engine in Europe, has said it is ""carefully reviewing"" the decision to assess the impact for its business and its users.

After putting up the online form in the early hours of Friday, Google received 12,000 requests across Europe, sometimes averaging 20 per minute, by late in the day, the company said.""The court's ruling requires Google to make difficult judgements about an individual's right to be forgotten and the public's right to know,"" a Google spokesman said.Next week representatives from the EU's 28 data protection authorities are due to discuss the implications of the ruling at a two-day meeting.Digital rights campaigners say the EU authorities need to agree on a common approach to guide the search engine companies. ""Companies should not be tasked with balancing fundamental rights or making decisions on the appropriateness, lawfulness, or relevance of information they did not publish,"" said Raegan MacDonald, European policy manager at Access, a digital rights organisation.PUBLIC INTEREST TEST Privacy has been a hot topic in Europe since revelations last year about mass U.S. surveillance programmes involving EU citizens and some heads of state. Europe already has some of the most stringent data protection laws in the world, and the EU Commission has put forward a reform package to strengthen them even further. Member states have yet to agree to the proposals.It is not the first time that Google has had legal problems over privacy.In January a German court ordered Google to block search results in Germany linking to photos of a sex party involving former Formula One boss Max Mosley. Two months earlier a French court had also ruled against Google in the Mosley case. ID:nL5N0KY1ZI]Advocates of freedom of speech have said the May ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union paves the way for the rich and powerful as well as for criminals to conceal information.The court allows Google to apply a public interest test in deciding whether to remove the search results. Politicians seeking to have incriminating information removed will probably not be able to benefit, according to lawyers.In addition, the ruling does not mean that the information in question will be deleted, just the link appearing in search results.Google said it had convened a committee of senior company executives and independent experts to try and craft a long-term approach to dealing with the barrage of requests.Yahoo Inc which also operates a search engine in Europe, has said it is ""carefully reviewing"" the decision to assess the impact for its business and its users.

136,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON Fidelity Investments Contrafund, the largest mutual fund investor in Yahoo Inc, cut its stake in the Internet media company by 41 percent during the first four months of 2014, according to the fund's latest disclosure.Contrafund portfolio manager Will Danoff had expressed confidence in Yahoo's management team at the end of the first quarter, but told Reuters in an exclusive interview in April he has been looking beyond tech companies to boost the fund's performance. Contrafund is up 1.93 percent this year, lagging the 4.97 percent return on the S&P 500 Index.Fidelity was not available to comment. The $108 billion Contrafund owned 24.3 million Yahoo shares at the end of April, down from 41.1 million shares at the end of 2013. In April, the fund sold about 5.3 million shares in Yahoo, an 18 percent reduction of its stake, according to Contrafund's latest disclosure.Yahoo shares are down 14 percent this year. The shares ranged in value during April from a high of $36.98 to a low of $32.15. The shares on Monday near midday were trading at $34.75.Yahoo's most valuable asset is its 23 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, whose upcoming initial public offering could raise more than $15 billion, and could potentially top the $16 billion pulled in by Facebook Inc when it listed in 2012. The bulk of the proceeds will go to Yahoo, which bought a 40 percent stake in Alibaba in 2005 for $1 billion and which must sell more than a third of its current 22.6 percent stake through the IPO.Analysts have noted that Yahoo's stake in Alibaba is potentially more valuable than Yahoo's current market capitalization. Alibaba's value has been pegged at more than $160 billion, which puts the value of Yahoo's stake at about $37 billion. Yahoo current has a market cap of $35 billion.At the end of the first quarter, Danoff said he remained overweighted in Yahoo relative to the S&P 500 index ""due to our confidence in management's ability to stabilize and grow the core business."" At the end of April, even with the latest round of selling, Yahoo accounted for 0.82 percent of Contrafund's holdings. Yahoo makes up 0.19 percent of the S&P 500 Index.The mutual fund's biggest stake is in Google Inc, a Yahoo rival. Contrafund owned about $7.4 billion worth of the Google stock at the end of April, making up nearly 7 percent of its total holdings.

138,"  BEIJING Google services are being disrupted in China ahead of this week's 25th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, a censorship watchdog said on Monday.GreatFire.org said in a blog post that the government appeared to have begun targeting Google Inc's main search engine and Gmail, among many other services, since at least last week, making them inaccessible to many users in China.It added that the last time it monitored such a block was in 2012, when it only lasted 12 hours.""It is not clear that the block is a temporary measure around the anniversary or a permanent block. But because the block has lasted for four days, it's more likely that Google will be severely disrupted and barely usable from now on,"" the advocacy group said.Asked about the disruptions, a Google spokesman said: ""We've checked extensively and there's nothing wrong on our end.""Google's own transparency report, which shows details about its global traffic, showed lower levels of activity from China starting from about Friday, which could indicate a significant amount of disruption.Reuters was unable to reach any government officials for comment as Monday is a national holiday in China. Beijing typically responds to such reports by saying that all internet companies operating in China have to obey the law. Google in 2010 moved its Chinese search engine service out of China, the world's second-largest economy, citing rampant censorship, and now operates it from Hong Kong.The Chinese government already blocks the popular foreign websites Facebook, Twitter and Google's own YouTube.For the ruling Communist Party, the 1989 demonstrations that clogged Tiananmen Square in Beijing and spread to other cities remain taboo, particularly on their 25th anniversary.

139,"  BEIJING Google services are being disrupted in China ahead of this week's 25th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, a censorship watchdog said on Monday.GreatFire.org said in a blog post that the government appeared to have begun targeting Google Inc's main search engine and Gmail, among many other services, since at least last week, making them inaccessible to many users in China.It added that the last time it monitored such a block was in 2012, when it only lasted 12 hours.""It is not clear that the block is a temporary measure around the anniversary or a permanent block. But because the block has lasted for four days, it's more likely that Google will be severely disrupted and barely usable from now on,"" the advocacy group said.Asked about the disruptions, a Google spokesman said: ""We've checked extensively and there's nothing wrong on our end.""Google's own transparency report, which shows details about its global traffic, showed lower levels of activity from China starting from about Friday, which could indicate a significant amount of disruption.Reuters was unable to reach any government officials for comment as Monday is a national holiday in China. Beijing typically responds to such reports by saying that all internet companies operating in China have to obey the law. Google in 2010 moved its Chinese search engine service out of China, the world's second-largest economy, citing rampant censorship, and now operates it from Hong Kong.The Chinese government already blocks the popular foreign websites Facebook, Twitter and Google's own YouTube.For the ruling Communist Party, the 1989 demonstrations that clogged Tiananmen Square in Beijing and spread to other cities remain taboo, particularly on their 25th anniversary.

142,"   By Mark Miller | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Google confessed last week that it has a miserable record hiring and retaining women and minorities.The tech giant responded to public pressure - including protests led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson at the company's annual meeting - by releasing data about the gender and ethnic makeup of its workforce, and the numbers aren't pretty. Women make up just 30 percent of Google's workforce, and the company is 61 percent white. Asians represent 30 percent of Google's workers, but Hispanics represent 3 percent and African Americans just 2 percent.Yet Google didn't disclose one of the most important diversity statistic about its workers: their age.Age plays second fiddle in Corporate America to racial and gender workforce diversity, but it needs to be addressed. The country is getting grayer; workers need - and want - to stay employed longer.""It is hard to address these kinds of challenges if you're not prepared to discuss them openly, and with the facts,"" said Laszlo Bock, Google's senior vice president of people operations, in a statement accompanying the data release. Yet no facts were forthcoming on age diversity in the data disclosure, or when I asked the company about it directly this week.Workforce diversity problems aren’t unique to Google, of course. But Silicon Valley has a uniquely youth-oriented work culture, and ageism is rampant. If you doubt it, see Noam Scheiber’s excellent report in the current issue of The New Republic (bit.ly/1mpiK8X). Scheiber focuses on the difficulty older entrepreneurs have raising money to start businesses, but he also gets into the youth culture of established tech companies that seem to think they're exempt from federal - and California - age discrimination laws.“Silicon Valley has become one of the most ageist places in America,"" he writes. ""Tech luminaries who otherwise pride themselves on their dedication to meritocracy don’t think twice about deriding the not-actually-old.” The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967 makes it illegal for employers to discriminate based on age in hiring or firing practices. And in California, workers are protected from age discrimination via the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.Google settled a high-profile, multimillion-dollar age discrimination case brought under the California statute in 2011 by Brian Reid, a former professor at Stanford University who holds a PhD in computer science.Reid was fired by Google at age 54. Neither Google nor Reid would discuss the case, but the court record opens a window into the youth-oriented culture of Silicon Valley companies.Reid’s lawsuit alleged that supervisors and other employees made derogatory age-related remarks to Reid, including that his opinions and ideas were “obsolete” and “too old to matter,” that he was “slow,” “fuzzy,” “sluggish” and “lethargic.” Other co-workers called him an “old man,” an “old guy,” and an “old fuddy-duddy,” Reid charged. Fairness issues aside, there's a strong case to be made that a diverse workforce is good for business. Google's Bock made that point last week in an interview about the data release on the PBS NewsHour, noting research showing that product teams are more productive when they are less homogenous.“There are 7 billion potential users on the planet of our product, and we're going develop the best product if they actually have some input into what we are building and we understand where they are coming from,” he said.Google should be applying this thinking to aging, too. The aging of the global population is creating demand for new products and services at an unprecedented pace. Dick Stroud, an England-based marketing consultant and author specializing in the 50-plus market, has estimated that in 2010, there were 375 million people over age 60 in the United States, Northern Europe, Japan, China and India. That number will nearly double by 2030, and the growth in their spending power will outpace that of every other age group. “You don’t know what you don’t know,” says Katy Fike, a gerontologist and co-founder of Aging 2.0, a business accelerator in San Francisco focused on spurring innovation in products and services for the 50-plus market. “Younger engineers aren’t going to realize that these opportunities exist, or they may not have the right sensitivity on issues like usability challenges or how our senses change with age.“The people who understand the needs of this market are older adults and those who work with them every day. Companies that aren’t tapping into that aren't going to make the best products.”Companies that win will have a multigenerational approach, says David DeLong, an expert in organizational behavior whose research is focused on challenges posed by an aging workforce. “Companies that have diverse markets need teams that approach things through a diverse lens,” he says.DeLong adds that a growing number of his clients - especially in precision manufacturing - recognize a need for age balance. “A lot of companies also are recognizing that older and younger workers balance one another’s skills. Older workers might have an invaluable knowledge of a manufacturing process, but young workers know the new technologies.”   (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)",2014-06-05,GOOGL,"Thu Jun 5, 2014 | 10:50am EDT",Silicon Valley's ageist culture is bad for workers - and business,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-column-miller-aging-idUSKBN0EG1ZM20140605?type=companyNews
143,"  * Uncertainty over application of 'right to be forgotten'* Data protection authorities working on common approach to ruling* Google received 12,000 information removal requests in one dayBy Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS, June 5 While Google may have been dismayed by the ramifications of a ruling in Europe's top court last month upholding the 'right to be forgotten' online, European authorities are also likely to be uncertain about how it will be implemented, privacy experts and lawyers say.The ruling, which compelled Google to remove links to a 16-year-old newspaper article about a Spanish man's bankruptcy, has demonstrated once again the difficulty of striking a balance between freedom of information and the right to privacy.The world's most popular search engine, which handles more than 80 percent of all searches in Europe, took a first step in implementing the ruling last Thursday by putting up an online form allowing European citizens to request that links to information about them be removed from search results.By the end of the day it had received 12,000 requests, proving that there is strong demand to be 'forgotten' online.But it is unclear how Google will deal with all the requests, especially given the broad criteria laid down by the court for the removal of search results. The 28 national heads of the EU data protection authorities held two days of meetings in Brussels this week to assess how to respond, and will agree a common approach at their next meeting in September. Many hope that will shed light on where the lines between public interest and privacy will be drawn.""The case is a landmark,"" said Peter Hustinx, head of the European Data Protection Supervisor, who was also at the meeting. ""It is difficult to imagine for a U.S. company that privacy and data protection issues might apply to things that are publicly available.""Experts are divided on whether the ruling opens the door for baseless deletion requests which will have to be granted, potentially encroaching on free speech, or whether the ruling is nuanced enough to allow wiggle room while respecting privacy.""It's a direction of travel that leads us very quickly down the road of greater and greater censorship of the Internet,"" said Guy Vassall-Adams, a barrister specialised in media law at Matrix Chambers in London. But others believe that is an overreaction, because it will be up to individuals to pursue their cases through the courts if Google refuses their request to be forgotten - a costly and time-consuming exercise that many will decide against pursuing.""How many of those 12,000 people that filed claims so far do you think take the time and the effort to hire a lawyer and fight in court?"" said Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, a professor of Internet governance at Oxford University and the author of 'Delete - The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age'.WHAT IS PRIVATE?  Mayer-Schönberger points out that the 'right to be forgotten', which has existed in European data protection laws since 1995, does not automatically lead to the deletion of search results and the information itself will not be removed.""Google is not going to be punished with fines should they act very restrictively,"" he said, suggesting that the company may choose to act on a very small percentage of requests.In evaluating applications, Google will have to interpret what the European Court of Justice, Europe's top court, means by ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"" information.It also has to determine whether the data in question is ""excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed and in the light of the time that has elapsed"", a vague phrase in the ruling that is open to plenty of interpretation.While the criteria may be clear for a company that holds data for a specific purpose, for example a credit ratings agency, it is not as clear-cut for a search engine.""Who's to judge what information is relevant or excessive for the purpose of a search on a search engine?"" said Vassall-Adams. ""There's a million different reasons why individuals want to get access to other information about individuals.""While the public interest test ensures that information that should be in the public domain cannot be concealed - for example when it concerns politicians or other high-profile figures - it will be a lot harder for companies to argue that information about private individuals should remain in the open.""The judgment does not give any real guidance about how these difficult balancing exercises should be carried out,"" Vassall-Adams said. ""All it says is you have to find a specific public interest justification for that bit of information.""

144,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Companies based outside the European Union must meet Europe's data protection rules, ministers agreed on Friday, although governments remain divided over how to enforce them on companies operating across the bloc.The agreement to force Internet companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O) to abide by EU-wide rules is a first step in a wider reform package to tighten privacy laws - an issue that has gained prominence following revelations of U.S. spying in Europe.Vodafone's (VOD.L) disclosure on Friday of the extent of telephone call surveillance in European countries showed the practice is not limited to the United States. The world's second-largest mobile phone company, Vodafone is headquartered in the United Kingdom.""All companies operating on European soil have to apply the rules,"" EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding told reporters at a meeting in Luxembourg where ministers agreed on a position also been backed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).Non-European companies with operations in Europe currently comply with data protection laws in the country in which they are based, which some say leads to ""jurisdiction shopping"" whereby businesses set up shop in countries with a more relaxed attitude to privacy.But under the new rules all EU countries will have the same data protection laws, meaning companies will no longer be able to challenge which laws apply to them in court.Earlier this year a German court ruled that Facebook was subject to German data protection law even if its European headquarters are located in Ireland. Facebook declined to comment on Friday's agreement.Germany and the European Commission, the EU executive, have been highly critical of the way the United States accesses data since former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden last year revealed U.S. surveillance programmes.Disclosures that the United States carried out large-scale electronic espionage in Germany, including bugging Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone, provoked indignation in Europe.""Now is the day for European ministers to give a positive answer to Edward Snowden's wake-up call,"" Reding said. Commenting on Vodafone's disclosure, she said: ""All these kind of things show how important it is to have data protection clearly established.""DISAGREEMENT REMAINS The reform package, which was approved by the European Parliament in March, has divided EU governments and still needs work to become law despite Friday's progress. While ministers also agreed on provisions allowing companies to transfer data to countries outside the European Union, there was no decision on how to help companies avoid having to deal separately with the bloc's 28 different data protection authorities.That issue was thrown into stark relief by a ruling from Europe's top court requiring Google to remove links to a 16-year-old newspaper article about a Spanish man's bankruptcy. The search engine has since received tens of thousands of requests across Europe, and under current rules has to deal with each national authority.A ""one-stop-shop"" arrangement would allow companies to deal exclusively with the data protection authority in the country where it has its main establishment. But governments are concerned about a foreign data protection authority making binding decisions that they would then have to enforce. For example, if a complaint originated in Denmark against a company based in Ireland, the Danish authorities would have to implement a decision by the Irish data protection body, something that is both legally and politically difficult.

150,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc's futuristic eyeglasses are finding their way into  hospitals and clinics throughout the United States. To meet the growing demand for Google Glass from physicians, Drchrono, a Mountain View, Calif., based electronic medical record company has developed a new application for the device  it claims is the first ""wearable health record."" Doctors who register for the Drchrono app for Glass can use it to record a consultation or surgery with the patient's permission. Videos, photos and notes are stored in the patient's electronic medical record or in Box, a cloud-based storage and collaboration service and can be shared with the patient on request. Dr. Bill J. Metaxas, a podiatrist based in San Francisco, warned fellow physicians to take precautions before using Glass, such as obtaining patient consent and ""locking down security settings."" He also said Glass is no more or less secure than tablet devices such as the iPad, which are routinely used in clinical practices. Metaxas, who uses Glass in the operating room and in patient consultations, said 99 percent of his patients agree to the gadget, but it is still early days and most of his fellow physicians have yet to adopt the technology. It is primarily used by the ""bleeding edge"" minority, he added.  Still, Box spokeswoman and former Google Health employee Missy Krasner said she is aware of at least 20 venture-backed startups catering to this niche of physicians. The majority of these Glass apps, including Augmedix and Pristine, are complying with federal regulation that protects privacy, known as HIPAA. To develop the service, Drchrono worked closely with Box, one of its early investors, and the Google Glass team.  Google Glass was intended for the consumer mass market, but it has been criticized by some for its geeky appearance. But many industry professionals immediately saw value in the hands-free gadget.The Glass team hosted an event last month at its San Francisco offices for care providers, hospitals administrators and medical-tech entrepreneurs to discuss how to bring these wearable computers into practices. ""Google is still in the early-stages of determining the most viable use-cases for Google Glass,"" said Drchrono co-founder Daniel Kivatinos. ""But some doctors are demanding Glass, so Google is providing resources and support to developers."" Drchrono claims to have 60,000 registered physicians using its electronic medical record for doctors and patients. More than 300 of these physicians have already opted to use the app, Kivatinos said. The app is currently available for free, but the company may charge a fee in the near future.Google could not be reached for comment. (Reporting By Christina Farr.

155,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING  BEIJING After taking a social media drubbing in the West for accepting self-censorship in China, jobs networking site LinkedIn Corp faces bigger obstacles to growth in a market it is counting on - local rivals and a unique workforce mindset.LinkedIn is intent on making the kind of breakthrough in China that eluded Internet giants like Google Inc, Yahoo Inc and Amazon.com Inc. To do that, beyond coping with censorship, it must match big domestic players, already tuned into a generation of self-styled Internet ""losers"" with their own, irreverent take on corporate culture.Earlier this month, the West's most popular online career network censored posts from users in China marking 25 years since Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square. If that earned LinkedIn scorn on Western social media, it passed largely unnoticed within mainland China, and Wall Street investors were unmoved.""The LinkedIn mission is to connect all the world's professionals, and the country with the most professionals in the world is China,"" Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of the firm based in Mountain View, California, said at a Shanghai presentation last month. Established local peers like Dajie, Wealink and Tianji - with over 60 million members between them - stand in the way.The stakes are high for LinkedIn, which launched in China in February saying it would co-operate with the censorship climate that global social media sites like Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc have shunned. The company said then a localized site would help it reach 140 million professionals in the world's second-biggest economy - a boon for a company seeking to expand its current audience of 277 million members as it saturates developed markets.Some 10 years after it was founded as a site to connect jobseekers with recruiters, LinkedIn's net income rose by a quarter last year to $26.8 million. A year earlier, it nearly doubled.The newcomer's strategy for China appears deceptively simple - to offer Chinese-speakers professional networking on a global scale in their own language. It's a strategy viewed with scepticism by rivals - and by some of LinkedIn's own existing members among China's skilled workforce, fluent in English and already accessing the site for contacts with the rest of the world.""I don't see any necessity for the switch from English to a Chinese version because 99 percent of Chinese users of LinkedIn are very high level and English language is not a problem to them,"" said Xia, who works in public relations and has used LinkedIn for four years. Xia declined to give his full name, citing censorship sensitivities.Asked to comment on prospects and local competition in China for this story, LinkedIn said it was focused on localizing its site for Chinese professionals and connecting them with other professionals around the globe.NETWORKING 'LOSERS'  Localizing effectively is a gambit that attempts to do what Google and others could not.""We're currently trying hard to break the spell of international Internet firms struggling in China,"" Derek Shen, LinkedIn China's president, said at last month's Shanghai event.LinkedIn has added 1 million users since its high-profile launch of Chinese-language operations and now has more than five million members on its China site. That leaves it a long way behind still-growing local professional networking sites such as Dajie (27 million members), Wealink (20 million members) and Tianji (14 million), as well as jobs boards like 51job Inc and Zhaopin. In the same period as LinkedIn grew by 1 million users, Dajie said it had added 2 million.Domestic competitors like Dajie agree localization is crucial. But they are unsure if the company's Western image will appeal to China's Internet-friendly workforce, many of whom proudly refer to themselves ""diaosi"", or ""losers"" - an expression of a more detached attitude to work and careers than is usually made public by ambitious professionals in the West.""Really, Dajie's and LinkedIn's models are similar, but there are very big differences in the actual products and operations,"" said Susan Wang, Dajie's chief executive, in an e-mail to Reuters. ""Dajie works to satisfy the needs of the post-80s and post-90s 'loser' generation of users, and pays more attention to the freshness of the product, and the need to feel lively,"" Wang said. ""LinkedIn tends more towards satisfying users who are in the more cautious traditional European and American business systems, a logical social networking attitude, focusing on coldly benefiting users' careers to drive the site.""On top of professional networking, Dajie differentiates itself by letting users publish commentaries on companies, make fun of their workplace, evaluate their employers and ""fool around"", said Wang.LinkedIn may not yet be doing enough to connect with the professional Chinese audience it is targeting, according to Wang Xiaofeng, a Beijing-based analyst with Forrester Research.""When they entered China officially they used a Chinese name, 'Lingying', and used a Chinese version of the website, but there's still not much Chinese content available,"" she said.Wang said LinkedIn still has a lot of potential in China, but the key will be offering more Chinese content and industry-specific networking for professionals, something it has so far failed to do.

China's demands on Internet firms wanting to do business there have seen off, or damaged the reputations of two of Silicon Valley's big hitters, Google and Yahoo.Like LinkedIn, Google agreed to censorship when it launched its China search site in 2006. But its fortunes quickly waned after a 2010 dispute with the government on self-censoring search results. It decamped to Hong Kong and by May this year Google had less than 1 percent of China's search engine market, according to Beijing-based data firm CNZZ.Yahoo suffered damage to its reputation and share price at home after it was revealed the company had handed over a Chinese dissident's e-mail details to Beijing in 2004.""While technologically and financially you are giants, morally you are pygmies,"" the then-chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Lantos, told Yahoo executives in a Washington hearing in 2007.

157,"  * Initial tests on closed track, then on public roads* Self-driving vehicles said to be safer, more efficient* Plan comes after Google project for self-driving carsBy Anthony DeutschAMSTERDAM, June 16 Self-driving trucks could begin delivering goods from Rotterdam, Europe's largest port, to other Dutch cities within five years under a plan by a group of logistics and technology companies unveiled on Monday.The Netherlands is reviewing traffic laws to make large-scale testing of the technology possible on public roads,  Infrastructure and Environment Minister Melanie Schultz van Haegen wrote to parliament in a letter outlining the plan.Initial testing would start on computer simulations and the trucks will be tested on a closed track before ultimately driving out on public roads, her letter said. The goal is to make the technology commercially available within five years, according to one participant.The Dutch proposal comes a month after Google Inc.  said it was developing two-passenger, self-driving cars and hopes to have built 200 of the vehicles with two years.The Netherlands, a densely populated country, has a highly advanced infrastructure and is home to Europe's fourth largest airport, while Rotterdam port is a major European logistics hub. ""We really want to seek out international partners to see what we can do in this field,"" said Marianne Wuite, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.""There are countless benefits. Self-driving cars need less space and therefore use asphalt more efficiently, they avert traffic jams and reduce accidents. They are also more environmentally friendly.""The application was submitted by a consortium including the  industry group Transport and Logistics Netherlands, DAF Trucks, Rotterdam Port and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, or TNO. No financial details were made available.""We want to do the first demonstrations in the beginning of next year and roll out the trial in a controlled environment as soon as possible,"" said Bastiaan Krosse, a spokesman for TNO.The road trial, involving two full-sized lorries driving in what is called a ""platoon,"" could happen in the Rotterdam Port, or on or at the A270, a motorway with advanced infrastructure in the southern Netherlands, he said.""The goal is to develop a reliable system over the next five years,"" Krosse added.Similar experiments are underway in other European countries ""but what makes this unique is that no other project has a hard target of bringing this to market within five years, with the backing of the government,"" he said.A detailed proposal of where and how the trials will take place will be submitted to parliament after the summer, Schultz van Haegen wrote.

The deals that YouTube is offering are on ""highly unfavorable, and non-negotiable terms,"" according to a news release issued by the Worldwide Independent Music Industry Network last month. YouTube declined to comment on the terms of the deals, but said in a statement that the new service would provide new revenue for the music industry.""We're adding subscription-based features for music on YouTube with this in mind - to bring our music partners new revenue streams in addition to the hundreds of millions of dollars YouTube already generates for them each year,"" YouTube said in a statement. YouTube has already signed deals for the paid service with 95 percent of the music labels that it previously had deals with for its existing, ad-supported music video webiste, a person familiar with the matter said. Blocking certain music labels' videos from appearing on YouTube's free website might be necessary in order to provide a consistent user experience for the paid service, the person said. The YouTube service is expected to launch at the end of the summer and will allow users to listen to music without any ads, according to a person familiar with the situation. Among the other features expected are the ability to listen to music offline and the ability to listen to an artist's entire album instead of just individual songs, as is currently the case on YouTube, the person said.Streaming music services such as Spotify and Pandora are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, as digital music downloads decline. Apple Inc announced plans to acquire streaming music service and premium headphone maker Beats for $3 billion last month.Google launched the $9.99-per-month Play All Access subscription music service in 2013. The forthcoming YouTube paid music service could potentially work in coordination with the Play service so that consumers aren't forced to subscribe to two separate services, the person familiar with the situation said.

161,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Apple Inc, criticized in the past for greenhouse gas emissions, use of toxic materials and the hiring of underage workers, has improved its practices and earned better scores from groups such as Greenpeace. That's good news for environmentally-aware mutual funds that hold Apple for another big reason – it makes money.The Cupertino, California-based maker of the iPhone, the world's biggest public company by market capitalization, has adopted a slew of green policies such as expanded product recycling and using solar power at its data centers. For managers who have made it a favorite of the largest ""green"" mutual funds tracked by Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit, the improvements bolster the appeal of a stock that's risen 15 percent this year, 19th best among the Standard & Poor’s 100 index.The confluence of a rising price and improving environmental performance make Apple ""the one stock you just can't ignore,"" said Anthony Tursich, senior portfolio manager of the $498 million Portfolio 21 Global Equity Fund, a green fund that bought Apple in 2011 after the company began providing more emissions data.Tursich's biggest holding is Google Inc, which he bought only after it made progress on renewable energy, reflecting how top U.S. corporations are embracing green goals, and how the funds jump on those firms once they start making those environmental moves.Environmental fund managers may be broadening their shopping lists in part because they have more money to deploy: For the 12 months ended April 30 investors put $1.9 billion of new money into the 72 funds tracked by Lipper that use environmental criteria in their investment decisions. That's still tiny relative to the $247.6 billion that went into all U.S. equity funds, but represents a 5 percent inflow that Lipper research head Tom Roseen said was significant. The bulk of the new money, more than $1 billion, went into the dominant $9.5 billion Parnassus Core Equity Fund, Lipper said. Apple is the top holding of the Parnassus fund, which bought most of the shares in 2013, the year the fund rose 34 percent and beat 72 percent of peers, according to Morningstar. Through June 13 the fund was up about 7 percent in 2014, beating 87 percent of peers.  Apple is also the top holding of the $2.9 billion Calvert Equity Portfolio and the $118 million Green Century Balanced Fund, and is the third-largest stock in the $2 billion Pax World Balanced Fund, according to the funds' latest filings.Fund managers cited a mix of reasons for warming up to Apple, including reforms pushed by Chief Executive Tim Cook and the stock's outlook. It is up 15 percent in 2014 through Monday on enthusiasm for its iPhones and other pending products, as well as a stock split and a dividend increase. [ID: nNrm8Db95J]Apple had taken hits from activist groups like Greenpeace, which in 2010 called it ""very weak"" on climate and emissions matters, and has faced scrutiny over the hiring of children at factories that make its products. It also earned a bottom score of ""4"" on its carbon footprint from the Boston sustainability advocacy group Ceres. Ceres Senior Manager Kristen Lang said Apple had not released enough information to get a better score, such as making public its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Google received a higher score of ""2"" from Ceres, which praised its spending on renewable energy.Among other things, Greenpeace said Apple was moving too slowly to stop using hazardous materials like polyvinyl chloride plastic – often used to insulate electrical cables -- and brominated flame retardants in its products. Critics worried both materials could be released from products during use or when older computers or power cords are disposed in landfills.In recent years, however, Apple has made changes and improved its image with environmentalists. In April, Greenpeace called Apple a leader for things like powering data centers with solar arrays, wind farms and water. Ceres' Lang said Apple might get a higher score currently based on steps it has taken since data for her groups' report was collected last fall.In addition, Apple this year reported a sharp decline in number of underage workers it hired at its supplier facilities. Apple - whose board includes environmentalist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore - also last year hired former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head Lisa Jackson to oversee areas like cutting toxins from its products.Asked about the Ceres score, Apple spokesman Chris Gaither said the company powers 94 percent of its global corporate facilities with renewable energy, up from 35 percent in 2010. ""Of course, the cleanest energy is the energy you never use, and that's why we've made efficiency such an important feature in Apple facilities and products,"" he said.UNUSUAL SUSPECTS Many of the environmentally-aware funds tracked by Lipper have bought other stocks that may not appear green at first glance - like McDonald's Corp, oil driller National Oilwell Varco Inc, and lubricant maker WD-40 Co. Most of the funds also have broad mandates that allow them to go well beyond owning only windmill-makers, and consider other matters, such as firms' practices on hiring women, in their investment decisions. Also, many specialized environmental companies are small in terms of their total market capitalization, limiting the role they can play in big portfolios and making them more important for smaller and more narrowly focused ""green"" funds.Where a top holding in the Pax World Balanced Fund is Google, with a total market capitalization about $366 billion, the top holding of the $177 million Pax World Global Environmental Markets Fund is filtration company Pall Corp, with a total market capitalization of about $9 billion.That situation also means big companies that show some environmental progress can find their way into those big green portfolios, even if they aren't traditional environmental companies and don't receive top grades from environmental advocates. Calvert bought McDonald's and Walt Disney Co last year, citing changes like advanced sewage treatment systems on Disney cruise ships and better land management at McDonald's suppliers.Ceres gave McDonald's a low score of ""4"" on its carbon footprint, saying it had not set formal targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase its use of renewable energy. It gave Disney a slightly better score of ""3"" in the area, since the company set an emissions-reduction target. Neither McDonald’s nor Disney responded to requests for comment.""Companies of this scale are always going to have issues,"" said Calvert Senior Vice President Bennett Freeman. ""What we look at is, what is the strength of their commitment, their willingness to address problems.""

162,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A bill to force government agencies to get warrants before they access the email of people under investigation advanced in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday after a majority of lawmakers signed on as co-sponsors.Advocates of the reform, which have included large tech companies such as Google, welcomed the news of 218 lawmakers signing on to the bill in the Republican-controlled House. The White House has also endorsed efforts to rewrite the old law.Legislation to rewrite the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, a statute passed in pre-Web 1986, now faces a time crunch to go through deliberations and votes in the House as well as the Democrat-controlled Senate in the seven weeks left in the current Congress.""Our hope is that having a majority of the House on the bill sends a clear message to the House leadership that it should bring the bill to the floor,"" Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, told Reuters. Currently, government investigators can access certain emails with a subpoena, which has a lower legal threshold than a warrant because it does not involve a judge and is therefore easier to obtain.The law also applies different legal standards to emails depending on whether they have been opened or not and whether they are stored remotely or on the computer, and for how long. But technology companies have refused in recent years to disclose old messages without a warrant, as privacy advocates say digital messages should not be treated differently than physical private communication.Representatives Kevin Yoder, a Republican from Kansas, Jared Polis, a Democrat from Colorado, and Tom Graves, a Republican from Georgia, led the efforts to pass new legislation to make it more difficult for government investigators to obtain Americans' email information. Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont and the original author of the 1980s statute, last year reintroduced his bill to rewrite the old law. It has also cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Leahy chairs. The issue intensified last year when Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, leaked classified documents that revealed the U.S. government was broadly monitoring Americans' telephone and Internet data.

166,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE, June 19  SEATTLE, June 19 Microsoft Corp's new chief executive, Satya Nadella, likes to boast that Bing is growing and powers 30 percent of the Internet search market, making it a worthy competitor to Google Inc.But within the advertising and research industries that measure and manage search as a business, Microsoft's strength  is an open question.The figures quoted by Microsoft, which include searches by partner Yahoo Inc, are much higher than the rate at which people actually click on the links that a search returns, according to new studies by industry researchers.The new search data calls into question Bing's effectiveness for advertisers. It also lends support to the argument from some investors that Microsoft should sell Bing.Microsoft has been in the Internet search business since 1998, and Bing - five years old this month - is its latest and most intense effort to unseat market leader Google. The company initially assumed that its world-class engineers and the sheer scale of its Windows user base would sweep away competitors, but Google has not relinquished any share.To measure its progress in the search business, Microsoft prefers to cite market share numbers from comScore, which established itself as the prime source for Internet data a decade ago, when reliable numbers were hard to come by, and has long been considered the gold standard.ComScore said Google sites had 67.6 percent of U.S. searches in May, compared with Microsoft's 18.8 percent and Yahoo's 10 percent, which are both powered by Bing.ComScore bases its calculations on desktop computer Internet searches by about a million anonymous people in the United States. It does not measure searches on mobile phones or tablets, which are dominated by Google, but it does count searches within the big MSN and Yahoo portals, factors which help explain why Bing has such a significant share.CLICKS COUNT But advertisers are less interested in searches than what users do with search results. They want traffic to their sites; they care what search result links users click and what sites they visit. In recent years, technology has made that behavior much easier to track. ""Clicks are important because they tell us how well we are capturing (search users') demand, and of course advertisers pay based on clicks,"" said Jason Hartley, group media director at search marketing firm 360i, whose clients include brands such as  Coca-Cola and Verizon. ComScore data ""can lead you down the wrong path, or it doesn't give you as much insight as you'd like,"" he added.A study published last month by Conductor, a company that advises marketers on how to stand out in Web searches and social media, showed Google accounted for 85 percent of traffic to websites from search engines, with only 5 percent from Bing and 7 percent from Yahoo. The study was based on 100 million visits to 63 websites from clicks on search links - not counting ads - including from mobile devices.Ireland-based StatCounter, which gets data from more than 3 million websites, found Google accounted for 80 percent of search engine-supplied U.S. traffic in the last three months, Bing 10 percent and Yahoo 8 percent. Search marketing firm Define Media Group came up with similar figures based on 1.4 billion visits from search engines so far this year to 125 websites.Advertisers make the same point with their spending: web marketing firm IgnitionOne estimates that Google gets about 77 percent of web search ad dollars against 23 percent for Yahoo/Bing. Design software maker Autodesk told Reuters that it generally splits search ad spending 80/20 in favor of Google with its ""significantly larger pool of users"".The does not mean comScore's data is faulty. Rather, many in the search industry say it doesn't measure what advertisers and website owners want to know, the web traffic generated by a search. ""Their current methodology is likely to mislead those who take it at face value,"" said Rand Fishkin, a well-known pioneer in the search engine optimization field and co-founder of search advisory firm Moz.ComScore stands by its figures. Vice President of Marketing Andrew Lipsman said the data is not designed to measure where Web traffic goes, only the searching behavior of consumers. He added that comScore is working on integrating mobile device results into its data.Microsoft said it had no reason to doubt comScore's figures. It added that it is committed to Bing, which is a core part of Microsoft's game console Xbox and its coming voice assistant on Windows phone. Bing also powers other companies' sites and devices, including Apple Inc's Siri and soon Apple  desktop search. Bing is integrated into translation features on Facebook and Twitter.Microsoft search advertising revenue rose 38 percent last quarter, helped by higher prices and more searches, it said in its last quarterly report, without disclosing dollar figures.Microsoft's online services unit, which includes Bing, lost more than $14 billion in Bing's first four years, including the cost of a failed acquisition. Last year, Microsoft put Bing in a new reporting group so its financial performance is obscured, but many on Wall Street assume Bing is still losing money.Craig Beilinson, director of consumer communications at Microsoft, said it ""continues to gain traction"" as a standalone search engine and powering other companies' products. While Bing has grown, that improvement has come mostly at the expense of Yahoo, according to comScore figures. The combined share of Bing and Yahoo has risen less than one percentage point in five years, taking share from smaller competitors Ask.com and AOL Inc, not Google.Some search marketers say they like having an alternative to Google, and that Bing/Yahoo can be a good investment for some clients.""Clients that have an older demographic, we sometimes do better on Bing or Yahoo,"" said Pauline Jakober, founder of Group Twenty Seven, which advises mid-sized clients on paid search ad campaigns. Business-to-business, like janitorial or industrial types, could do well on Bing, while tech clients might not even want to advertise on Bing, she said.But Bing has drawn criticism from some investors because it is expensive to operate, requiring resources from engineers to server farms.The new search data called into question Bing's usefulness, said Todd Lowenstein at HighMark Capital Management.He and other investors believe Microsoft should focus on products that businesses pay for, such as the Office suite of products and the Windows operating system.""Microsoft would be better served selling Bing to another player who can use the asset,"" he said.Ironically, Google does not highlight this weakness any more than Microsoft.""Google loves the fact that anybody other than Google looks like they are doing better,"" said Danny Sullivan, longtime industry observer and editor of the Search Engine Land blog. ""It's a very handy tool for them to go out and say you don't need to be regulating us, look, the market's strong.""Google and Yahoo declined comment on the comScore data.

169,"  Gemalto NV, the French digital security company, said on Friday that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected its patent claim relating to the Android smart phone operating platform.Gemalto, which makes smart cards, filed a suit in the United States in October 2010 against Google, Motorola, Samsung and HTC, alleging that their Android applications infringed on its patents.The company's shares, which are traded in Amsterdam, fell  1.8 percent early on Friday.""Gemalto's has consistently patented and broadly licensed its innovation so we are certainly disappointed by this judgment with regards to the scope of use of some of our intellectual property,"" Olivier Piou, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.Piou said the decision would have ""no impact on our historical patents licensing activity, nor on the company’s 2017 long-term objectives."" A company spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.Analysts at ING said the court's rejection was disappointing. ""We had estimated that if Gemalto had won the case the company could have been entitled to either a one-off payment in damages, or higher royalty receipts that could amount to 30-50 million euros per annum,"" they said in a note. ING analysts estimated Gemalto's patent business contributes 15 million euros on an annual basis, but they said this could well have doubled, at least, if the company had won the lawsuit.

175,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO For decades, medical technology firms have searched for ways to let diabetics check blood sugar easily, with scant success. Now, the world's largest mobile technology firms are getting in on the act.Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and Google Inc (GOOG.O), searching for applications that could turn nascent wearable technology like smartwatches and bracelets from curiosities into must-have items, have all set their sites on monitoring blood sugar, several people familiar with the plans say.These firms are variously hiring medical scientists and engineers, asking U.S. regulators about oversight and developing glucose-measuring features in future wearable devices, the sources said. The first round of technology may be limited, but eventually the companies could compete in a global blood-sugar tracking market worth over $12 billion by 2017, according to research firm GlobalData. Diabetes afflicts 29 million Americans and costs the economy some $245 billion in 2012, a 41 percent rise in five years. Many diabetics prick their fingers as much as 10 times daily in order to check levels of a type of sugar called glucose.Non-invasive technology could take many forms. Electricity or ultrasound could pull glucose through the skin for measurement, for instance, or a light could be shined through the skin so that a spectroscope could measure for indications of glucose. ""All the biggies want glucose on their phone,"" said John Smith, former chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson's LifeScan, which makes blood glucose monitoring supplies. ""Get it right, and there's an enormous payoff.""Apple, Google and Samsung declined to comment, but Courtney Lias, director at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's chemistry and toxicology devices division, told Reuters a marriage between mobile devices and glucose-sensing is ""made in heaven.""In a December meeting with Apple executives, the FDA described how it may regulate a glucometer that measures blood sugar, according to an FDA summary of the discussion.Such a device could avoid regulation if used for nutrition, but if marketed to diabetics, it likely would be regulated as a medical device, according to the summary, first reported by the Apple Toolbox blog.The tech companies are likely to start off focusing on non-medical applications, such as fitness and education. Even an educational device would need a breakthrough from current technology, though, and some in the medical industry say the tech firms, new to the medical world, don't understand the core challenges. ""There is a cemetery full of efforts"" to measure glucose in a non-invasive way, said DexCom chief executive Terrance Gregg, whose firm is known for minimally invasive techniques.

In a blog post detailing plans for its smart contact lens, Google described an LED system that could warn of high or low blood sugar by flashing tiny lights. It has recently said it is looking for partners to bring the lens to market. The device, which uses tiny chips and sensors that resemble bits of glitter to measure glucose levels in tears, is expected to be years away from commercial development, and skeptics wonder if it will ever be ready. Previous attempts at accurate non-invasive measurement have been foiled by body movement, and fluctuations in hydration and temperature. Tears also have lower concentrations of glucose, which are harder to track.But the Life Sciences team in charge of the lens and other related research is housed at the Google X facility, where it works on major breakthroughs such as the self-driving car, a former employee who requested anonymity said.Apple's efforts center on its iWatch, which is on track to ship in October, three sources at leading supply chain firms told Reuters. It is not clear whether the initial release will incorporate glucose-tracking sensors.Still, Apple has poached executives and bio-sensor engineers from such medical technology firms as Masimo Corp (MASI.O), Vital Connect, and the now-defunct glucose monitoring startup C8 Medisensors. ""It has scooped up many of the most talented people with glucose-sensing expertise,"" said George Palikaras, CEO of Mediwise, a startup that hopes to measure blood sugar levels beneath the skin's surface by transmitting radio waves through a section of the human body.  The tech companies are also drawing mainstream interest to the field, he said. ""When Google announced its smart contact lens, that was one of the best days of my career. We started getting a ton of emails,"" Palikaras said.Samsung was among the first tech companies to produce a smartwatch, which failed to catch on widely.

One Samsung employee, who declined to be named, said the company expects to foster noninvasive glucose monitoring.Sources said Samsung is working with startups to implement a “traffic light” system in future Galaxy Gear smartwatches that flashes blood-sugar warnings.

179,"  NEW YORK, June 24 Consumer watchdog Public Citizen has called on U.S. regulators to conduct a review of Google Inc's recent acquisition of aerospace startup Skybox Imaging, concerned that Skybox's satellite technology may aid manipulation of commodity markets.In a letter to federal energy and trading regulators on Friday, Public Citizen said that access to Skybox's satellite images of oil, gas and power infrastructure is already helping deep-pocketed firms such as banks and hedge funds ""gain a financial trading intelligence advantage"" in commodities.Commodity traders already subscribe to Skybox data which includes satellite imagery of oil shipments, pipeline activities and storage sites, Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen's Energy Program, wrote in the letter addressed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.Other firms such as Genscape also provide proprietary data to traders looking to get what edge they can in a competitive marketplace. But with access to Google's huge customer base, Skybox's technology could exacerbate the kind of unfair advantage that already exists for bigger players. ""Federal regulators and Congress must take swift action to keep consumers from further harm at the hand of market participants seeking to exploit non-public information to the disadvantage of other traders,"" Slocum said.Google declined to comment. Skybox was not immediately available for comment. Historically, trading firms have purchased physical assets such as cargoes of oil or gas as part of their trading activities, but the kind of high-resolution cameras and satellite images that can track the route of a single car or person means owning infrastructure may no longer be necessary to garner knowledge of commodity markets.""A non-public contract with Google can now provide the same competitive trading advantage,"" Slocum said.

Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion in January, underscoring the Web search company's efforts to extend its reach into a broad field of Internet-connected devices. Nest on Friday announced plans to acquire Dropcam, a video-monitoring home security product. Nest suffered a public relations black eye in April when it halted sales of its smoke alarms because of a defect that could cause users to turn the alarm off unintentionally. Nest resumed selling the device earlier this month, though it has deactivated the problematic ""Wave"" feature - an option that allowed users to stop false alarms with the wave of a hand.

Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion in January, underscoring the Web search company's efforts to extend its reach into a broad field of Internet-connected devices. Nest on Friday announced plans to acquire Dropcam, a video-monitoring home security product.Nest suffered a public relations black eye in April when it halted sales of its smoke alarms because of a defect that could cause users to turn the alarm off unintentionally. Nest resumed selling the device earlier this month, though it has deactivated the problematic ""Wave"" feature - an option that allowed users to stop false alarms with the wave of a hand.

192,"  * Google issues first responses to removal requests* EU court upheld ""right to be forgotten"" in May* Links will only be hidden in Europe   (Adds details, background)By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS, June 26 Google has begun removing some search results to comply with a European Union ruling upholding citizens' right to have obsolete personal information about them hidden in search engines.The so-called ""right to be forgotten"" was upheld by Europe's top court on May 13 when it ordered Google to remove a link to a 15-year-old newspaper article about a Spanish man's bankruptcy. ""This week we're starting to take action on removals requests that we've received,"" a Google spokesman said on Thursday. ""This is a new process for us. Each request has to be assessed individually and we're working as quickly as possible to get through the queue.""Google received over 41,000 requests over four days after it put up an online form allowing Europeans to request that search results be removed, raising fears that the freedom of information on the web would be trampled upon in Europe.But the ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) only applies to EU countries, meaning links that have been removed in Europe will still appear in search results elsewhere, for example in the United States. Google also introduced an advisory at the bottom of search results which warns users that ""some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe"".The advisory only appears for name searches originating in European countries, and it will appear irrespective of whether some links have been removed, in order to respect the privacy of those people trying to conceal information about themselves. Internet privacy concerns shot up the agenda last year when former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed details of mass U.S. surveillance programmes involving European citizens and some heads of state.The EU executive has been critical of several major U.S. web companies, such as Facebook and Google, over their handling of swathes of personal data. National governments recently moved towards extending Europe's strict data protection rules to all companies, not just European ones.Google would not say how many removal requests it was granting or refusing, and citizens who are not happy with the company's decision will be able to pursue the issue with their national data protection authority.The court set out broad criteria for Google to remove links to information, saying simply that it had to be ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"" and that a balance had to be struck between privacy and the public interest when it came to public figures such as politicians.Thursday's steps were just the beginning as the search engine devises a way to hide links appearing in connection with searches for someone's name.

194,"  * Changing structure of fund industry entices new entrants* Google, Apple, Amazon among those well positioned - KPMG* Alibaba's online payment arm now a $90 bln fund manager* Index funds may be next to feel the pinch of competition* Regulation a brake to quick change in active managementBy Simon JessopMONACO, June 27 Tech companies pose a growing threat to traditional asset managers and the financial services industry needs to up its game to meet the challenge, even though the hurdle of regulation is holding back rapid change, industry executives said.Some parts of the broader financial services industry have already seen new entrants emerge, such as around online trading portals.But the prospect of younger, tech-savvy savers being forced to put more away for their retirement has led some to ask if companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple  could one day grab a slice of an industry consultancy PwC says could be worth $100 trillion by 2020.A report by consultants KPMG said the U.S. tech giants possessed a number of strengths which could benefit them in asset management, such as strong brands, relevant products and ""enviable"" distribution platforms. None of them have yet to move into the industry, however.While there are examples of firms jumping into completely new business lines - food retailer Tesco's foray into high street banking, for example - a more likely scenario is that they would partner up with an existing fund manager in some way.But nonetheless, the threat is seen as real. When asked if technological innovation would ""disrupt"" the asset management industry in the coming years, 67 percent of the audience at a panel discussion of industry executives at the Fund Forum conference in Monaco said ""yes"", with 29 percent ""no"" and 4 percent ""don't know"".Paloma Piqueras, chief executive at BBVA Asset Management, part of Spanish bank BBVA, said she was not surprised by the views of the audience and cited the scale of impact changing technology had had on other industries. ""Clients are changing the way they perceive the offer, the way they look for information; they want personalised products and content. So there is work to do on distribution, on advising, on using the data we have to propose a personalised offer and in every step of the whole value chain of the asset management business.""None of us could have thought that industries such as music, books, travel would experience such important challenges due to technology (and) we're already seeing some signs of these changes in the asset management industry,"" she added, citing Chinese Internet retailer Alibaba as an example.That country's Internet companies have blazed the way for the sale of wealth management products in the Internet age. Since last year they have offered depositors an alternative to the low interest rates - capped at 3.3 percent by the central bank - that come with putting money in China's traditional banks.The first of these was Yu'e Bao, an online investment platform offered by an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Available on smartphones, Yu'e Bao is conveniently linked to China's biggest online payments platform Alipay, similar to PayPal, and is now China's biggest money market fund in terms of assets under management (AUM).It began as a partnership with local asset manager Tianhong Asset Management Co, but at the end of May, Alipay received the green light to take a majority stake in the fund firm itself. [ID:nL3N0OG0LL} It had 554 billion yuan ($90 billion) in assets under management in the first quarter of 2014 from just 10.5 billion yuan a year earlier, according to Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based investment management consultancy.""There were a lot of fund sales through the web in the late 90s when tech funds were roaring up and people who were tech savvy bought them, but it didn't last. This feels potentially more lasting,"" said Jim McCaughan, chief executive of Principal Global Investors, the asset management arm of Principal Financial Group.""One of the impressive thing about Yu'e Bao, the Alibaba fund, is not only has it raised 91 billion (dollars) net, it has 100 million investors. I would ask you, is there a transfer agent or fund administrator in the West who could have done that?""Other examples of technology being used to shake-up financial services include eToro, a marketplace to trade currencies and other assets and which has a community for investors to interact with one another, and Nutmeg, a UK firm that helps people build portfolios online, said KPMG.""We are now seeing new parties emerging with technology-driven service models that are helping customers make decisions not using a face-to-face model, but using technology that is more suited to the needs of consumers today, and that is where the future is going,"" Dutch regulator Theodor Kockelkoren said. INDEX FUNDS More broadly, the rise in ""passive"" investment using exchange-traded funds was evidence of technology disrupting the ""active"" management industry, said Principal Global's McCaughan, and more was likely on the way.""Somebody soon, and it may be Alibaba, will be launching index funds through these web platforms. If you're an index fund provider, there's another disruption coming.""Index mutual funds track an underlying stock or other index and aim to give returns very close to those of the index. Along with exchange-traded funds, which are traded as a security in their own right, both involve minimal human oversight and rely more on technology than ""active"" funds that rely on human input.Regulation, though, was acting as a brake on new entrants moving wholesale into active management, said Maarten Slendebroek, chief executive at Jupiter Fund Management.""The reason why this hasn't happened much faster in financial services is because of financial regulation, that's the biggest barrier to selling direct to the consumer.The success of online funds such as Yu'e Bao may also be hard to replicate in other countries, as China's banks are geared towards conservatism, and are tightly controlled by regulators, meaning deposit rates are lower than elsewhere.China is also unique for the proliferation of smartphones, where 80 percent of its 618 million Internet users go online using mobile device, a cultural quirk that has already allowed other Chinese internet retailers to adopt the Yu'e Bao model, including Baidu and Tencent.The turning point could be when so-called 'Generation Y', those born between the early 1980s and 2000s, began to take more interest in saving for their retirement.""We're seeing some nascent digital industries starting up, but it will only really pick up when Gen Y start saving,"" said one investment banker in investor sales.""Then it will not just be about distribution models but about crowd-sharing ideas: 'I bought this fund, what do you think?'""($1 = 6.2251 Chinese Yuan Renminbi)   (Additional reporting by Paul Carsten in Beijing; Editing by Toby Chopra)",2014-06-27,GOOGL,"Fri Jun 27, 2014 | 11:53am EDT",Tech threat a warning for fund managers to step up,http://www.reuters.com//article/fund-conference-tech-idUSL6N0P81RX20140627?type=companyNews
195,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO, June 27  SAN FRANCISCO, June 27 Venture fund Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers filed to raise two new funds totaling $1.2 billion, showing scaled-back ambitions compared with previous funds.The new funds, an early-stage growth fund of $450 million known as KPCB XVI and a later-stage fund of $750 million known as KPCB Digital Growth, contrast with the $525 million KPCB XV, raised two years ago, and the $1 billion inaugural Digital Growth fund, raised in 2010.The new funds come at a time when a rash of competitors are clocking up outsized gains due to early investments in companies such as Facebook and Twitter, which Kleiner came to late in the game. At the same time, many investors in venture funds are coming to believe that more modest funds have an easier time making big gains than do larger funds. In the last few years, Kleiner Perkins has made an effort to reenergize itself, bringing in new partners such as Mike Abbott, formerly vice president of engineering at Twitter, and Mary Meeker, the renowned Wall Street analyst, who leads the digital growth fund.The firm's recent investments have included companies such as Lending Club, payments service Square, and thermostat maker Nest Labs, which Google bought earlier this year for $100 million. The lead partners in KPCB XVI are Abbott, John Doerr, Randy Komisar, Ted Schlein and Beth Seidenberg -- a smaller group than previously. For KPCB Digital Growth, lead partners are Doerr, Meeker and Schlein. The filings, made Friday to the Securities and Exchange Commission, reflect amounts that in the venture business sometimes grow beyond the numbers listed.Last year, rival Sequoia Capital raised $553 million for its Sequoia Capital XIV.(Reporting by Sarah McBride; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-06-27,GOOGL,"Fri Jun 27, 2014 | 7:22pm EDT",Kleiner Perkins files to raise $1.2 billion in new venture funds,http://www.reuters.com//article/venture-fundraising-kleiner-idUSL2N0P81XZ20140627?type=companyNews
196,"   By David Adams | MIAMI  MIAMI A team of top Google executives is visiting Cuba to promote open Internet access, according to a dissident blogger who says she met the group in Havana.The team, led by Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, met with Cuban officials as well as independent people in the technology and digital field, according to a report on the independent news website 14ymedio.com, which was started last month by blogger Yoani Sanchez.Google is on an official two-day visit ""to promote the virtues of a free and open Internet,"" the report said.Schmidt appeared to confirm the report when he retweeted a message on Twitter posted by Sanchez about the visit.Neither Google nor the Cuban government made any official statement about the executives' presence in Cuba.Cuba does not allow open Internet access. Only 2.6 million out of a population of 11.2 million have Internet access, almost entirely limited to government-run centers, foreign companies and tourist hotels.

202,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc will shut down its early social-networking service, Orkut, which was launched ten years ago but has failed to put Google ahead in what has become one of the Web's most popular businesses. Google said it will shut down Orkut, which is widely used in Brazil and India but hasn't caught on more broadly, on Sept. 30, to focus on its other social networking initiatives. The company declined to say how many users Orkut has.""Over the past decade, YouTube, Blogger and Google+ have taken off, with communities springing up in every corner of the world. Because the growth of these communities has outpaced Orkut's growth, we've decided to bid Orkut farewell,"" Google said in a post on the Orkut blog on Monday.  Orkut was launched early in  2004, the same year that Facebook Inc, now the world's No.1 social network with 1.28 billion users, was founded. The service's shutdown comes as Google's social networking plans remain in question. In April, Vic Gundotra, the head of Google's social networking services, left the company.  Gundotra oversaw the 2011 launch of Google+, a social networking service similar to Facebook. Gundotra said in October that 300 million users visit the Google+ web page every month.Google has increasingly sought to position Google+ less as a social networking ""stream"" that competes with Facebook, and more as a means of establishing a unified ""user identity"" system to improve Google's various Web properties. Last year, for example, Google began requiring users of its YouTube site to sign in with their Google+ identity before posting comments about videos.  The company said it would preserve an archive of all Orkut ""communities"" that will be available from Sept. 30. ""If you don't want your posts or name to be included in the community archive, you can remove Orkut permanently from your Google account,"" Google said.

204,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON, June 30  WASHINGTON, June 30 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Google Inc's bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing it of violating federal wiretap law when it accidentally collected emails and other personal data while building its popular Street View program.The justices left intact a September 2013 ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which refused to exempt Google from liability under the federal Wiretap Act for having inadvertently intercepted emails, user names, passwords and other data from private Wi-Fi networks to create Street View, which provides panoramic views of city streets. The lawsuit arose soon after the Mountain View, California-based company publicly apologized in May 2010 for having collected fragments of ""payload data"" from unsecured wireless networks in more than 30 countries.Google was accused of having collected the data while driving its vehicles through neighborhoods from 2008 to 2010 to collect photos for Street View. In June 2011, U.S. District Judge James Ware in San Francisco allowed plaintiffs in several consolidated private lawsuits to pursue federal Wiretap Act claims against Google, while dismissing California state law claims. Google already has agreed to pay $7 million to settle a probe into the matter involving 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. As part of that settlement, Google agreed to destroy data collected in the United States.The case is Google Inc v. Joffe et al, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-1181.

The Internet search company and the automaker disagreed on almost every point, from car capabilities and time needed to get it to market to extent of collaboration.It was as if the two were ""talking a different language,"" recalls one person who was present.As Google expands beyond Web search and seeks a foothold in the automotive market, the company's eagerness has begun to reek of arrogance to some in Detroit, who see danger as well as promise in Silicon Valley.For now Google is moving forward on its own, building prototypes of fully autonomous vehicles that reject car makers' plans to gradually enhance existing cars with self-driving features. But Google's hopes of making autonomous cars a reality may eventually require working with Detroit, even the California company acknowledges. The alternative is to spend potentially billions of dollars to try to break into a century-old industry in which it has no experience.""The auto companies are watching Google closely and trying to understand what its intentions and ambitions are,"" said one person familiar with the auto industry, who asked to remain anonymous because of sensitive business relationships.""Automakers are not sure if Google is their friend or their enemy, but they have a sneaking suspicion that whatever Google's going to do is going to cause upheaval in the industry.""NO STEERING WHEEL Analysts estimate Google has invested tens of millions of dollars in an effort that's ultimately a side project. But car companies, all too familiar with the devastating financial and brand damage of recalls, would see any hiccups with the self-driving car as a threat to their main business.Nowhere is the disconnect more evident than in Google's latest prototype.

That would represent a seismic shift from a longstanding model based on individual ownership, an annual $375 billion U.S. market according to J.D. Power.Moreover, a study by consulting firm KPMG last year found that American consumers would trust brands like Google and Apple more for self-driving cars than they would automakers.General Motors' global product development chief Mark Reuss recently said Google could become a ""very serious competitive threat."" EVOLUTION VERSUS REVOLUTION Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car group, would not discuss any negotiations with automakers but argues that self-driving cars will benefit car companies and consumers by expanding the number of car users.""I'm confident that when there is technology that makes sense, and when there is a business model that makes sense, that there will be interest and partnerships"" with car makers, Urmson told Reuters in an interview.Self-driving cars can free people to do more of the things that earn Google money, such as Web search. But Urmson said Google is still figuring out how to make a profit from the technology.""I would imagine that this is probably different than just making more time for people to click on web sites,"" he said.Car makers such as GM, Mercedes and Volvo have been developing their own autonomous vehicle technology for years. But most favor an incremental approach to self-driving cars, in which features such as lane centering and parking assistance are gradually integrated into vehicles. Car makers are also hesitant to invest in new features until they are certain there is enough demand to pay for them.That approach and car makers' long development process are at odds with Google's ambition to create a fully autonomous car in one swoop. The Internet company seemed to have little patience for Detroit, according to people involved in the 2012 talks with automakers.""There was a certain amount of arrogance on the Google side, in the sense of 'We know what we're doing, you just help us,'"" said a second person, representing a major car maker, who was involved in discussions with Google.""We'd say, 'Well you don't really know that much. And we're not going to put our name on a project like that because if something goes wrong, we have a lot more to lose.'""Another potential sticking point is maps developed by Google and essential for its robo-cars to operate, says Sven Strohband, a robotics expert who worked at Volkswagen until 2006 and was not involved in the discussions. That data, compiled by Google, can be extraordinarily detailed, down to the height of curbs or location of signs.""The question is who owns the data,"" he said. ""You need to have frequent map updates and your car can only go where you have really accurate map data.""Without a driver to blame when accidents happen, the vehicles could bring greater liability for car makers.Google's assurances to one car maker that it would take responsibility for accidents due to its technology, and that the data collected by the cars makes it easy to pinpoint fault, was dismissed, according to the first person involved in the 2012 discussions. ""I just couldn't believe my ears and was like 'Wow you live in a bubble,'"" the person said. ""Car makers never get to decide who is at fault. It's the lawyers, the judge and the jury.""STARTING SMALL Whether Google opts to license its technology or seeks to build cars to its specifications, Google will need Detroit for the last mile, say industry experts and insiders.Google has made headway in less sensitive areas such as entertainment and navigation. In January, Google teamed up with GM, Audi, Honda and Hyundai to form the Open Automotive Alliance to incorporate its Android operating system, the software for mobile phones and tablets, into cars.And it has taken steps to understand regulations better, hiring Ron Medford, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's former Deputy Director, in November 2012.""My view on this is both parties probably need each other,"" said Strohband, now Chief Technology Officer at venture capital firm Khosla Ventures.A source at one automaker said the company talks to Google on a weekly basis about auto matters, though they have not partnered on self-driving cars.Some in the industry predict fully automated cars will be available as soon as 2020, though research firm IHS Automotive does not expect the cars to be widely available until 2035. For now, Google is starting small with 100 to 200 prototype cars. It wouldn't identify manufacturing partners, though industry reports pinpoint Michigan-based Roush Enterprises, which assembles small volumes of custom vehicles such as race cars. Roush declined comment.To build anything more than a couple thousand cars would likely require an automaker partner. Industry insiders point to critical systems such as steering and suspension, the intricacies of working with hundreds of suppliers and high-volume production at consistent levels of reliability as skills that cannot be learned overnight.While Tesla Motors offers an example of an outsider breaking into the business, the electric car maker has benefited from a hefty government loan and from having access to the shuttered GM-Toyota NUMMI car manufacturing plant in Fremont, California.The cost to launch a new car model, including costs of developing and tooling, is generally $1 billion to $1.5 billion. For a company starting from scratch, such as Google, that cost would likely be higher, say auto industry experts.Some industry observers have suggested that Google should pair up with Tesla, which is also developing self-driving technology and which shares Google's Silicon Valley mindset. With roughly $60 billion in cash, Google could also acquire a smaller auto company, some speculate, though they note that such a move would involve more ongoing costs, liabilities and cultural challenges then Google may be willing to accept.""Google is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and nobody wants to miss the boat,"" said Edwin Olson, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, who works with Ford on an automated vehicle project. ""But at the same time I don't think automakers want Google to be dictating terms if the time comes and Google is the only game in town.""

The Internet company seemed to have little patience for Detroit, according to people involved in the 2012 talks with automakers.  “There was a certain amount of arrogance on the Google side, in the sense of ‘We know what we’re doing, you just help us,’” said a second person, representing a major car maker, who was involved in discussions with Google.“We’d say, ‘Well you don’t really know that much. And we’re not going to put our name on a project like that because if something goes wrong, we have a lot more to lose.’” Another potential sticking point is maps developed by Google and essential for its robo-cars to operate, says Sven Strohband, a robotics expert who worked at Volkswagen until 2006 and was not involved in the discussions. That data, compiled by Google, can be extraordinarily detailed, down to the height of curbs or location of signs.    “The question is who owns the data,” he said. ""You need to have frequent map updates and your car can only go where you have really accurate map data.""Without a driver to blame when accidents happen, the vehicles could bring greater liability for car makers.Google's assurances to one car maker that it would take responsibility for accidents due to its technology, and that the data collected by the cars makes it easy to pinpoint fault, was dismissed, according to the first person involved in the 2012 discussions.“I just couldn’t believe my ears and was like ‘Wow you live in a bubble,’” the person said. “Car makers never get to decide who is at fault. It’s the lawyers, the judge and the jury.” STARTING SMALL    Whether Google opts to license its technology or seeks to build cars to its specifications, Google will need Detroit for the last mile, say industry experts and insiders.Google has made headway in less sensitive areas such as entertainment and navigation. In January, Google teamed up with GM, Audi, Honda and Hyundai to form the Open Automotive Alliance to incorporate its Android operating system, the software for mobile phones and tablets, into cars.And it has taken steps to understand regulations better, hiring Ron Medford, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s former Deputy Director, in November 2012.“My view on this is both parties probably need each other,” said Strohband, now Chief Technology Officer at venture capital firm Khosla Ventures. A source at one automaker said the company talks to Google on a weekly basis about auto matters, though they have not partnered on self-driving cars. Some in the industry predict fully automated cars will be available as soon as 2020, though research firm IHS Automotive does not expect the cars to be widely available until 2035. For now, Google is starting small with 100 to 200 prototype cars. It wouldn't identify manufacturing partners, though industry reports pinpoint Michigan-based Roush Enterprises, which assembles small volumes of custom vehicles such as race cars. Roush declined comment.To build anything more than a couple thousand cars would likely require an automaker partner. Industry insiders point to critical systems such as steering and suspension, the intricacies of working with hundreds of suppliers and high-volume production at consistent levels of reliability as skills that cannot be learned overnight.While Tesla Motors offers an example of an outsider breaking into the business, the electric car maker has benefited from a hefty government loan and from having access to the shuttered GM-Toyota NUMMI car manufacturing plant in Fremont, California. The cost to launch a new car model, including costs of developing and tooling, is generally $1 billion to $1.5 billion. For a company starting from scratch, such as Google, that cost would likely be higher, say auto industry experts.Some industry observers have suggested that Google should pair up with Tesla, which is also developing self-driving technology and which shares Google's Silicon Valley mindset. With roughly $60 billion in cash, Google could also acquire a smaller auto company, some speculate, though they note that such a move would involve more ongoing costs, liabilities and cultural challenges then Google may be willing to accept.""Google is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and nobody wants to miss the boat,"" said Edwin Olson, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, who works with Ford on an automated vehicle project. ""But at the same time I don’t think automakers want Google to be dictating terms if the time comes and Google is the only game in town.""

208,"   By Alexei Oreskovic and Ben Klayman | SAN FRANCISCO/DETROIT, June 30  SAN FRANCISCO/DETROIT, June 30 In 2012, a small team of Google Inc engineers and business staffers met with several of the world's largest car makers, to discuss partnerships to build self-driving cars.In one meeting, both sides were enthusiastic about the futuristic technology, yet it soon became clear that they would not be working together. The Internet search company and the automaker disagreed on almost every point, from car capabilities and time needed to get it to market to extent of collaboration.It was as if the two were ""talking a different language,"" recalls one person who was present.As Google expands beyond Web search and seeks a foothold in the automotive market, the company's eagerness has begun to reek of arrogance to some in Detroit, who see danger as well as promise in Silicon Valley.For now Google is moving forward on its own, building prototypes of fully autonomous vehicles that reject car makers' plans to gradually enhance existing cars with self-driving features. But Google's hopes of making autonomous cars a reality may eventually require working with Detroit, even the California company acknowledges. The alternative is to spend potentially billions of dollars to try to break into a century-old industry in which it has no experience.""The auto companies are watching Google closely and trying to understand what its intentions and ambitions are,"" said one person familiar with the auto industry, who asked to remain anonymous because of sensitive business relationships.""Automakers are not sure if Google is their friend or their enemy, but they have a sneaking suspicion that whatever Google's going to do is going to cause upheaval in the industry.""NO STEERING WHEEL Analysts estimate Google has invested tens of millions of dollars in an effort that's ultimately a side project. But car companies, all too familiar with the devastating financial and brand damage of recalls, would see any hiccups with the self-driving car as a threat to their main business.Nowhere is the disconnect more evident than in Google's latest prototype. Two people sit abreast in the tiny pod-shaped car, which has a flexible windshield for safety and is topped by a spinning cone that helps navigation. here  The electric vehicles, unveiled in May, are limited to a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour and do away with several decades-long constants in motoring: the steering wheel, brake pedal and accelerator pedal.Google co-founder Sergey Brin has described self-driving cars as an on-demand service that consumers summon when needed. That would represent a seismic shift from a longstanding model based on individual ownership, an annual $375 billion U.S. market according to J.D. Power.Moreover, a study by consulting firm KPMG last year found that American consumers would trust brands like Google and Apple more for self-driving cars than they would automakers.General Motors' global product development chief Mark Reuss recently said Google could become a ""very serious competitive threat."" EVOLUTION VERSUS REVOLUTION Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car group, would not discuss any negotiations with automakers but argues that self-driving cars will benefit car companies and consumers by expanding the number of car users.""I'm confident that when there is technology that makes sense, and when there is a business model that makes sense, that there will be interest and partnerships"" with car makers, Urmson told Reuters in an interview.Self-driving cars can free people to do more of the things that earn Google money, such as Web search. But Urmson said Google is still figuring out how to make a profit from the technology.""I would imagine that this is probably different than just making more time for people to click on web sites,"" he said.Car makers such as GM, Mercedes and Volvo have been developing their own autonomous vehicle technology for years.But most favor an incremental approach to self-driving cars, in which features such as lane centering and parking assistance are gradually integrated into vehicles. Car makers are also hesitant to invest in new features until they are certain there is enough demand to pay for them. That approach and car makers' long development process are at odds with Google's ambition to create a fully autonomous car in one swoop.

211,"   By Conrad de Aenlle | LONG BEACH Calif.  LONG BEACH Calif. (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)Many tech companies saw their high-flying stocks lose altitude this year. Leaders in social media like Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. fell more than 40 percent from their 2014 highs. Others, such as the retailer Amazon.com Inc., took more modest drops, although shareholders might not have found them modest at the time.These stocks, among others, are cheaper than they were, but are they cheap enough? They almost certainly can't be considered bargains by normal valuation yardsticks. Their price-earnings ratios – when there are earnings – can run close to or into triple digits.Portfolio managers find, however, that some businesses offer sufficient growth potential to warrant bets around current prices. Kevin Landis, manager of the Firsthand Technology Opportunities Fund, has been adding to his position in Twitter, a longtime holding, because he expects the stock to improve over the long haul as the company evolves from an upstart held in tech portfolios into a respectable blue chip that will be far more widely owned.""It's only a matter of time before Twitter goes into the S&P 500,"" says Landis, a Silicon Valley investor since the days of CompuServe email addresses composed of long strings of numbers. ""Like Google 10 years ago or Facebook two years ago, everyone will have to own them.""The reason that Twitter plunged in the first place, losing more than half its value, is that investors pulled back ahead of anticipated selling by corporate insiders. Many feared a massive dumping of Twitter stock once the lock-up period from the company's November initial public offering ended. That has abated, Landis says, and the stock ""really looks like it has found a bottom.""Landis also holds Google Inc. along with Facebook Inc., which has nearly quadruped in value since late 2008, but he's having reservations about the latter. Landis questions how much growth potential Facebook has left and warns that he may sell before the year is out. ""I'm still happy to hold it, but at over $160 billion [in market value], how much can it possibly make in the next 10 years?"" he wonders. ""I don't know that we'll hold it forever.""Landis has no such misgivings about LinkedIn, a social-media company for professionals. He remained invested through the recent plunge and believes that the stock is worth buying today.""We own it and would consider adding to it,"" he says. ""It's a top brand. It's hard to imagine a scenario where LinkedIn fades from view."" The $110 million Firsthand Technology Opportunity is up an annualized 20 percent in the five years through June 27, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. The fund has an expense ratio of 1.85 percent.John Toohey, head of equities for USAA Investments, which offers the $571 million USAA Science & Technology Fund, has similar opinions about Facebook and LinkedIn, only reversed. Facebook, a holding in several USAA portfolios, including Science & Technology, is the one with the greater growth potential, in his view, because its everyman customers are more tolerant of having ads thrust in their faces than the professionals who use LinkedIn. ""They have huge opportunities to monetize their base,"" Toohey says about Facebook. Still, he encourages the company not to be greedy by saturating the site with ads or allowing ads that are targeted so precisely to users that it becomes obvious just how much information the company has on them.""People are fine being marketed to,"" Toohey says, ""but they need to strike a delicate balance.""AMAZON'S BALANCING ACT  Amazon.com, whose stock fell more than 25 percent earlier in the year, may need to execute a balancing act of its own. Amazon has spared little expense in growing its business to become a dominant retailer, but companies that spare little expense tend to have thin profit margins and generate anemic cash flow, Toohey notes. USAA Science & Technology delivered an annualized return of 21 percent in the past five years. The fund's expense ratio is 1.34 percent.""We own some Amazon, but we're cautious about it,"" he says. ""The challenge is whether they'll ever slow down spending to ramp up cash flow and margins.""Another possible impediment to Amazon and its shareholders is that it sends out so many packages at such short notice that delivery services like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. eventually may balk at doing the heavy lifting, at least at current prices.""Amazon could shoot themselves in the foot,"" Toohey warns. ""If FedEx and UPS are going to be able to support all that volume with two days' notice, they'll have to hire people and do logistics.

The Wall Street bank also said Google ""appears willing to cooperate"" if there is a court order.Google, Goldman and Goldman's law firm did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. According to Goldman, the outside contractor had been testing changes to the bank's internal processes in connection with reporting requirements set forth by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.Goldman said the contractor meant to email her report, which contained the client data, to a ""gs.com"" account, but instead sent it to a similarly named, unrelated ""gmail.com"" account. The bank said it has been unable to retrieve the report or get a response from the Gmail account owner. It said a member of Google's ""incident response team"" reported on June 26 that the email cannot be deleted without a court order.""Emergency relief is necessary to avoid the risk of inflicting a needless and massive privacy violation upon Goldman Sachs' clients, and to avoid the risk of unnecessary reputational damage to Goldman Sachs,"" the bank said.

214,"   By Blaise Robinson | PARIS  PARIS Technology and telecoms firms could be the big winners in a connected car market that may be worth $50 billion over the next decade, luring investors away from traditional automakers.Chip-makers or tech giants such as Infineon and Google are among a variety of companies involved in the rapid development and testing of intelligent cars from those that drive themselves to those allowing a driver to use mobile phone apps through the dashboard.A number of carmakers are embracing the trend, with Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG's Audi and Toyota Motor Corp working with outside tech firms to test self-driving car technology.However, it is the tech and telecom firms - from U.S. bellwethers to small European companies - that are seen benefiting the most, fund managers and analysts said.""It's a whole new market emerging,"" said Christian Jimenez, fund manager and president of Diamant Bleu Gestion.""The best way to play it for investors in the long term is to buy names such as Microsoft or chip makers such as Infineon, not (automakers) Peugeot and Renault"".If the new market grows to $50 billion as forecast by French bank Exane BNP Paribas that would be roughly half the size of German carmaker BMW's revenues last year. Internet giant Google Inc is leading the charge among tech companies, trying to break into the century-old industry as it works on its own prototypes of fully autonomous vehicles.It may be a few years before driverless cars hit the road but Google is already shaking things up in the sector, saying last week that the first cars running its Android Auto - a voice-enabled software allowing drivers to navigate maps and send messages while behind the wheel - will hit showrooms later this year.Apple is also in the race, with its new CarPlay -  which integrates iPhone functionality - allowing drivers to use applications directly via the dashboard to view maps, make calls, listen to music and send and receive text messages. Only about 10 percent of vehicles have built-in connectivity today, but the number is expected to rise to more than 90 percent by 2020, according to the British consulting firm Machina Research.""This is not a distant dream, but a five-year race where there is money to be made, or lost,"" Exane BNP analyst Stuart Pearson said in a note to clients, predicting that the market for connected car services would grow by an estimated 30 percent a year through to 2020.    EUROPEAN PRESENCE Investors are also keen to pick smaller, specialized companies at the heart of changes in the car driving.AKKA technologies, a French engineering firm which has been developing a prototype of electrical driverless car, has seen its stock soared by nearly six-fold since 2009. ""The autonomous car is not science fiction, it's real and it's happening now. The technology is ready, it's just a question of regulation at this point,"" said Philippe Obry, head of research and development at AKKA.""The idea is not to upgrade existing cars with new technologies, it's to rethink the whole sector and the way people will use cars in the future...We're not a car maker, so it's been easier for us to think outside the box.""Shares in French electric car battery maker Blue Solutions have jumped 130 percent since their initial public offering last October, which was more than 15 times oversubscribed.

If the new market grows to $50 billion as forecast by French bank Exane BNP Paribas that would be roughly half the size of German carmaker BMW's revenues last year.Internet giant Google Inc is leading the charge among tech companies, trying to break into the century-old industry as it works on its own prototypes of fully autonomous vehicles.It may be a few years before driverless cars hit the road but Google is already shaking things up in the sector, saying last week that the first cars running its Android Auto - a voice-enabled software allowing drivers to navigate maps and send messages while behind the wheel - will hit showrooms later this year.Apple is also in the race, with its new CarPlay -  which integrates iPhone functionality - allowing drivers to use applications directly via the dashboard to view maps, make calls, listen to music and send and receive text messages.Only about 10 percent of vehicles have built-in connectivity today, but the number is expected to rise to more than 90 percent by 2020, according to the British consulting firm Machina Research.""This is not a distant dream, but a five-year race where there is money to be made, or lost,"" Exane BNP analyst Stuart Pearson said in a note to clients, predicting that the market for connected car services would grow by an estimated 30 percent a year through to 2020. EUROPEAN PRESENCE Investors are also keen to pick smaller, specialised companies at the heart of changes in the car driving.AKKA technologies, a French engineering firm which has been developing a prototype of electrical driverless car, has seen its stock soared by nearly six-fold since 2009.""The autonomous car is not science fiction, it's real and it's happening now. The technology is ready, it's just a question of regulation at this point,"" said Philippe Obry, head of research and development at AKKA.""The idea is not to upgrade existing cars with new technologies, it's to rethink the whole sector and the way people will use cars in the future...We're not a car maker, so it's been easier for us to think outside the box."" Shares in French electric car battery maker Blue Solutions  have jumped 130 percent since their initial public offering last October, which was more than 15 times oversubscribed.Among big European tech stocks, Nokia and TomTom are seen facing their make-or-break moment with the connected car, Exane's Pearson said.""The two map-makers hold a duopoly in maps for embedded solutions of original equipment manufacturers and auto part suppliers.

219,"   By Lauren Tara LaCapra | NEW YORK, July 3  NEW YORK, July 3 E. Stanley O'Neal, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, said on Thursday he has ""no knowledge"" of an apparent effort to remove a BBC article mentioning him from Google Inc search results in Europe.The previous day, BBC economics editor Robert Peston suggested O'Neal may have asked the search engine to exclude a 2007 blog post that mentioned him from its results under a European privacy rule. Peston's suggestion that O'Neal had the search results tweaked came in a new blog entry posted on Wednesday. In an email to Reuters, O'Neal said ""I have no knowledge of it whatsoever.""The BBC's Peston had not confirmed that O'Neal had made any request to Google. Instead, he first inferred it was O'Neal because he was the only person named in the earlier article, which described how the CEO had been ousted from Merrill after the investment bank racked up billions of dollars in losses. Peston later updated his post to say it was ""almost certain"" O'Neal had not petitioned Google to remove the post. Instead, he said, it might have been another Merrill employee named in the comments section of the first article. The European rule stems from a court ruling in May that granted citizens the ""right to be forgotten."" O'Neal is American.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HTC has struggled to retain its market share against competition from the likes of Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, as growth in high-end smartphones slows worldwide.To return its global share to 10 percent from the current 2 percent, HTC has released flagship model One M8, extended its range of mid-tier handsets and increased its marketing budget. Revenue was T$65.06 billion in the second quarter, compared with a guidance range of between T$65 billion and T$70 billion given in May.Shares of HTC ended up 0.4 percent ahead of the earnings release, in line with a rise in the benchmark index.Global growth in smartphone sales is likely to be 23 percent this year, against 39 percent last year, according to researcher IDC. Average growth from 2013 to 2018 will be 12.3 percent, IDC said. The prospect puts increasing pressure on high-end smartphone makers to establish distinctive brands, which some analysts say HTC has struggled to do.The likely release in coming months of a new iPhone from Apple as well as and the proliferation of low-priced feature-packed models in China will add to HTC's challenges, said analyst Richard Ko of KGI Securities.Only significant inroads in a new product category such as wearable devices - where HTC plans to partner Google Inc  - could bring the company the high-growth rates experienced just a few years ago, Ko said.""Every year there's a new 'hero' product release and a quarterly uptick, but it often fizzles quickly,"" Ko said ahead of the earnings release, referring to the March launch of the One M8.

226,"   By Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Google Inc (GOOGL.O)(GOOG.O) is rating Internet service providers' video streaming quality on a new website, the latest development in the fight between broadband providers and content companies over who is to blame for slow streaming speeds. A link to the website appears when videos on Google's streaming service, YouTube, are slow to buffer. The website  quietly launched in May, but recently drew growing publicity.""There are many factors that influence your video streaming quality, including your choice of Internet Service Provider (ISP). Learn how your ISP performs and understand your options,"" the website reads. Google rates the Internet service providers based on how quickly billions of hours of YouTube videos watched every month load over 30 days and divides those results by provider and location to determine the quality of performance viewers get 90 percent of the time, the company said. The website is intended to inform customers who want to view video in high-definition how best to do it, Matt McLernon, a YouTube spokesman said. ""We are just basically providing information, not trying to tell people to change their behavior or do anything different,"" said McLernon. Customers can compare the performance of various Internet service providers in their area through the website. Google is not the first content company to send messages directly to consumers about their Internet service providers. In June, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) sent its customers messages that Verizon Inc (VZ.N) and other Internet providers were to blame for slow speeds. Last month, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission announced it would investigate agreements between Internet service providers and content companies to determine whether they are causing slow speeds.  Netflix has been calling on the FCC to do away with fees content companies pay to Internet service providers for smooth delivery of their services to consumers.The FCC is expected to consider that idea as it seeks public comment on recently proposed Internet traffic, or ""net neutrality,"" rules that suggest content companies should be allowed to strike ""commercially reasonable"" deals with broadband providers to give priority to their traffic.

227,"   By Noel Randewich | MOUNTAIN VIEW Calif.  MOUNTAIN VIEW Calif. Google smartphones with next-generation 3D sensing technology are about to blast into orbit, where they will become the brains and eyes of ball-shaped hovering robots on the International Space Station.NASA plans to use the handsets to beef up its Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites, or SPHERES, which could eventually take over daily chores for astronauts or even handle risky duties outside of the vessel.The phones, part of Google's Project Tango augmented reality initiative, will be aboard a cargo spacecraft scheduled to launch on July 11.Inspired by a scene from the movie Star Wars where Luke Skywalker spars with a hovering globe, the soccer-ball sized robots can be guided around the space station's microgravity interior, propelled by tiny blasts of CO2 at about an inch per second. When NASA sent its SPHERES to the space station in 2006 they were capable of precise movement but little else. In 2010, engineers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, looked for ways to make the devices smarter. ""We wanted to add communication, a camera, increase the processing capability, accelerometers and other sensors. As we were scratching our heads thinking about what to do, we realized the answer was in our hands,"" Smart SPHERES project manager Chris Provencher told Reuters in an interview last week. ""Let's just use smartphones."" They bought phones at Best Buy and altered them by adding extra batteries and a shatter-proof displays before sending the handsets to the space station, where astronauts used Velcro to attach them to the side of the SPHERES. That gave the robots a wealth of new sensing and visual capabilities - but still not enough to move around the station as easily as the engineers wanted.Looking to improve the robots, NASA recently turned to the experimental smartphones Google created to encourage innovation in its push for consumer mobile devices that can make sense of space as easily as people do. The Project Tango handsets include a motion-tracking camera and an infrared depth sensor similar to Microsoft's Kinect add-on for the Xbox. The sensors will detect sharp angles inside the space station and create a 3D map that lets the SPHERES navigate from one module to another. ""This type of capability is exactly what we need for a robot that's going to do tasks anywhere inside the space station,"" Provencher said. ""It has to have a very robust navigation system.”  NASA's phones have been split open so that the touchscreen and sensors face outward when mounted on the robots. They also include space-tested batteries and plastic connectors to replace the Velcro.Google wants the technology showcased by Project Tango to become ubiquitous, helping retailers create detailed 3D representations of their shops and letting gamers make their homes into virtual battlegrounds.It also teamed up with LG recently to launch a Project Tango tablet to encourage developers to experiment with its features.

232,"   By Madeleine Thomas | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO An alleged prostitute suspected of killing a California technology executive by injecting him with a fatal dose of heroin aboard his yacht off the coast of Santa Cruz has been charged with manslaughter, authorities said Thursday.Alix Catherine Tichelman, 26, was arrested last week in connection with the November 2013 death of Forrest Hayes, an executive at Google Inc and a father of five.Tichelman, who will be arraigned on July 16, faces eight charges including transporting and possessing heroin, prostitution and destruction of evidence. Her bond was set at $1.5 million, said Rafael Vazquez, assistant district attorney for the Santa Cruz County District Attorney’s Office.Security camera footage from Hayes' yacht showed Tichelman  neglecting to help Hayes, 51, after she injected him with heroin and he fell unconscious, according to the Santa Cruz Police Department. ""At one point, she steps over the body to finish a glass of wine. Finally, she leaves the boat and reaches back in to lower a blind and conceal the victim's body from outside view,"" police said in a statement.Also on Thursday, police in Milton, Georgia said they were re-examining the death of Dean Riopelle, a nightclub owner who died of what the coroner at the time ruled was an accidental overdose, the Sacramento Bee reported. Tichelman told police at that time that Riopelle had injected heroin while she was in the shower, the newspaper reported.Tichelman first became a suspect in Hayes’ death after it appeared that she may have had a sex-for-money relationship with him, police said. She was arrested on the July 4 holiday after being contacted by an officer posing as a potential client, police said, and for agreeing on a price in excess of $1,000. She was detained when she arrived at an “upscale location.” Hayes and Tichelman allegedly met on the dating website SeekingArrangement.com, which calls itself ""the leading network for Sugar Daddy and Sugar Baby relationships across the globe.""“We are shocked to learn of this tragedy and we would like to convey our deepest sympathies to Mr. Hayes’s family,"" the website said in a statement Thursday.  According to spokeswoman Angela Bermudo, the site prohibits solicitations for prostitution.""These were two adults that were involved in a consensual relationship that was ongoing,"" Bermudo said.

The lawsuit is the latest antitrust issue confronting Google, which has faced complaints from rivals including Microsoft Corp that it unfairly ranked its own services higher than competitors' in search results.

In the U.S. lawsuit, plaintiff lawyers had argued that Google forces phone manufacturers to set its own search engine as the default on Android phones. Google knows consumers will not go through the trouble of changing those default settings, the lawsuit said, putting competitors at an unfair disadvantage given Android's global market share.

Consumers, moreover, are free to customize their own phones and replace Google search as the default. ""Google's conduct is not only fully consistent with but actually promotes lawful competition,"" the company wrote.Google also argued that the lawsuit failed to show how Google's agreements with handset manufacturers caused consumers to overpay for their phones.

239,"  BEIJING, July 11 Google Inc services were once again being disrupted in China on Friday after a brief respite on Thursday, users and an anti-censorship group reported, continuing more than a month of severe disruption.Features such as Google's search, maps, online advertising services and e-mail client have been rendered almost inaccessible for users in China.The Google disruption began in the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.China maintains tight control over the Internet, nipping in the bud any signs of dissent or challenges to the ruling Communist Party's leadership.Google declined to comment. China-based anti-censorship group GreatFire.org reported that Google services appeared once again to be inaccessible within China.The ""Great Firewall"", the tool the Communist Party uses to block websites it deems undesirable, experienced a glitch that allowed Google services to work, GreatFire.org said. ""It looks like merely a bug of the Great Firewall,"" said a  member of the group who used a pseudonym. ""It's blocked again.""The brief restoration of access had occurred as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was visiting Beijing, where cyber-security was high on the list of topics he discussed. Other online services are also experiencing disruption in China, which began last week.

240,"  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc has appointed former Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally to its board of directors, drafting a seasoned Detroit executive into its ranks as it develops a self-driving car and tries to get its software into more automobiles.Mulally, once deemed a strong contender for the top job at Microsoft Corp, joins venture capitalist John Doerr, former Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and VMWare co-founder Diane Greene on the board of the Internet advertising leader. Mulally on July 1 handed Ford's helm to Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, six months earlier than expected.He had been expected to seek another high-profile post thereafter. The 68-year-old former Boeing Co executive is credited with transforming the No. 2 U.S. automaker from a money-loser to a company that expects to realize a pretax profit of up to $8 billion this year. His auto industry expertise may come in handy as Google engages Detroit, hoping that its Android software will become the standard platform for everything from messaging to media in cars. The Silicon Valley company has also pursued its vision of self-driving cars, though largely on its own. Mulally will also serve on Google's audit committee. The board is chaired by Eric Schmidt.""Alan brings a wealth of proven business and technology leadership experience,” Google CEO Larry Page said in a blogpost.

Big Ass Fans and lock maker Yale are also members of the group, which will certify Thread-compatible products.Thread is a networking protocol with security and low-power features that make it better for connecting household devices than other technologies such as Wifi, NFC, Bluetooth or ZigBee, said Chris Boross, a Nest product manager who heads the new group. Nest's products already use a version of Thread.The radio chips used for Thread-compatible smart devices are already in many existing connected home products that use ZigBee, like Philips Hue smart lightbulbs. Those ZigBee devices could be updated with software from their manufacturers to work with Thread after a product certification program starts next year, Boross said.""Around that time I imagine that Thread-compliant products will start hitting the market, but people can start building Thread today,"" he said. Companies including Silicon Labs, Freescale, NXP and Atmel Corp make chips that could be used in Thread-compatible products, which Boross said will be easy to interconnect and offer improved security. “Google is an 800-pound gorilla.

244,"   By Caroline Copley | ZURICH  ZURICH Swiss drugmaker Novartis has struck an agreement with Google to develop ""smart"" contact lenses that would help diabetics to track their blood glucose levels or restore the eye's ability to focus. The device for diabetics would measure glucose in tear fluid and send the data wirelessly to a mobile device, Novartis said. The technology is potentially life-changing for many diabetics, who prick their fingers as many as 10 times daily to check their body's production of the sugar. Success would allow Novartis to compete in a global blood-sugar tracking market that is expected to be worth more than $12 billion by 2017, according to research firm GlobalData. Diabetes afflicts an estimated 382 million people worldwide.Many people with Type 1 diabetes and some with Type 2 diabetes monitor their blood glucose level to help to manage their condition and reduce the risk of health complications such as amputation and blindness.Simon O’Neill, director of health intelligence at the charity Diabetes UK, said the field would ""welcome any investment in new technology that might one day have the potential to make this easier for people or to offer them more choice"".    He added, however, that without knowing more about this technology ""we have no idea how likely it is to develop into something that is routinely available or how long this might take to happen"".The second element of the Google agreement is centered on presbyopia, in which ageing eyes have trouble focusing on close objects. Novartis hopes the lens technology will help to restore the eye's ability to focus, almost like the autofocus on a camera. EMBEDDED TECHNOLOGY Non-invasive sensors, microchips and other miniaturized electronics would be embedded into the contact lenses. Under the deal, Novartis's Alcon eyecare unit will further develop and commercialize the lens technologies designed by Google[x], the American company's development team.  Financial details were not disclosed. The alliance comes as drugmakers explore ways for technology to reshape healthcare, helping patients to monitor their own health and lowering the costs of managing chronic diseases. In turn, technology companies such as Apple, Samsung Electronics and Google are trying to find health-related applications for wearable devices.  Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez said he hoped that a product could be on the market in about five years. ""This really brings high-technology and combines it with biology - and that's a very exciting combination for us,"" Jimenez told Reuters.""I think you're going to see more and more areas of unmet medical need where companies like Novartis are going to take a non-traditional approach to addressing those needs.""Although the licensing deal is only for the eye, Jimenez said the drugmaker was also thinking about how technology could be applied in other areas, such as remote patient monitoring in heart failure.

246,"   By Nivedita Bhattacharjee | MUMBAI  MUMBAI China's Xiaomi said it intends to invest heavily in India as the budget smartphone maker launched on Tuesday its flagship Mi phone and other products in the world's third largest smartphone market, currently dominated by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.Xiaomi's International Vice President Hugo Barra, a former    Google Inc executive who joined last year, said the company does not expect to turn a profit in India any time soon.He said the privately owned Xiaomi was planning to build India-specific features for its phones and set up a local team to help penetrate one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets.""We realize this is a market where we have to invest heavily in,"" Barra told Reuters. ""There's no point in thinking about profits at this early stage,"" he said by telephone from New Delhi, where Xiaomi launched the Mi 3, the cheaper Redmi and its Redmi tablet.    Localization will be key to Xiaomi's fortunes in India, where it will have to convince users to turn away from the apps and services they are used to and adopt Xiaomi's own system. Xiaomi's success in China has partly come from its unique Android operating system, which it tailored to its customers. The company's margins on phones are thin, as they use high-tech hardware, but it makes up for that by selling its higher-margin accessories and customized apps.Xiaomi's success has partly stemmed from its affordability. The Mi 3, Xiaomi's latest smartphone, is priced at 13,999 rupees ($230). According to Neil Shah of Counterpoint Technology Market Research, the phone's features are comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S4, which costs between 29,000-30,000 rupees.India ranks behind China and the United States in smartphone sales, with up to 90 million smartphones expected to be sold there this year, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research. In India, Xiaomi is selling its products via ecommerce company Flipkart.Xiaomi is better known globally as China's answer to Apple Inc, an image that billionaire Lei Jun had fostered initially when he founded the company in 2010 by dressing in the black tops, jeans and sneakers favored by the late Steve Jobs. In China, Xiaomi has built a fan base much like Apple. Barra said Xiaomi would remain focused on emerging markets and was planning to launch in Indonesia next. He did not specify a time frame.Xiaomi became the world's sixth-largest smartphone vendor in the first quarter of 2014, according to data firm Canalys, after repeatedly doubling its sales. The company, valued at $10 billion last year, expects to sell 60 million phones this year.

250,"   By Mary Papenfuss | SANTA CRUZ Calif.  SANTA CRUZ Calif. An accused prostitute charged with killing a Google executive by injecting him with a fatal dose of heroin on his yacht off the California coast pleaded not guilty on Wednesday and her attorney said she has been unfairly demonized in the case.A grim-faced Alix Catherine Tichelman, 26, entered not guilty pleas to eight criminal counts including manslaughter, prostitution and heroin possession during a brief hearing in Santa Cruz Superior Court and was ordered back to court on Oct. 20.Wearing red jail garb, her reddish-brown hair falling over her face, she spoke only in response to questions from Judge Timothy Volkmann as her parents sat quietly in the front row of the courtroom.Volkmann rejected a request by Tichelman's lawyers to lower her $1.5 million bail, saying that he was not impressed by her ties to the community and that she faced serious charges. Prosecutors say Tichelman, a high-priced call girl, injected 51-year-old Forrest Hayes with the drug during a tryst aboard his yacht off Santa Cruz in November, then made no effort to help him after he fell unconscious - instead stepping over the technology executive's body to finish her glass of wine.Outside court, Larry Biggam, a Santa Cruz County public defender, told reporters the defense was not contesting that Tichelman was a prostitute but that she was a ""wounded bird"" herself who should not be blamed for Hayes' death.""There was no intent to harm and injure, much less kill, Mr. Hayes,"" Biggam said. ""Why would she? He was a lucrative source of income for her."" Biggam said his client and Hayes were engaged in ""consensual drug use"" at the time of his death and that ""to demonize and sensationalize Alix Tichelman is unfair.""Tichelman was arrested earlier this month after being contacted by a police officer posing as a potential client and agreeing to a price in excess of $1,000 authorities have said.  Hayes and Tichelman allegedly met on the dating website SeekingArrangement.com, which calls itself ""the leading network for Sugar Daddy and Sugar Baby relationships across the globe."" A spokeswoman for the website has said it prohibits solicitations for prostitution.According to local media reports, police in Milton, Georgia, are investigating Tichelman in connection with the death of Dean Riopelle, 53, of a heroin overdose in September 2013. She has not been charged in that case.

Android operating software boss Andy Rubin stepped aside last year, and Salar Kamangar, head of the YouTube video website, was succeeded in February by longtime Google ad executive Susan Wojcicki.In April, Vic Gundotra, head of social networking services, said he was exiting. Arora's surprise departure was announced as Google reported results that beat investors' expectations on Thursday.Revenue in the three months ended June 30 totaled $15.96 billion, compared to $13.11 billion in the year-ago period.

255,"  (Adds Xbox details)By Bill RigbySEATTLE, July 17 Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella kicked off one of the largest layoffs in tech history on Thursday, hoping to reshape the aging PC industry titan into a nimbler rival to Apple and Google, and jolt a culture at the company that is used to protecting its existing Windows and Office franchises.Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it will slash up to 18,000 jobs, or 14 percent of its workforce, over the next 12 months as it almost halves the size of its newly acquired Nokia phone business and tries to become a cloud-computing and mobile-friendly software company.The larger-than-expected cuts are the deepest in the software giant's 39-year history and come five months into Nadella's tenure.Beyond the Nokia reductions, Nadella gave few clues about where the ax will fall or what areas will receive more funding.One source briefed on the cuts said a major victim would be the 175-strong Xbox Entertainment Studios unit, which will start to wind down efforts to create original content. But it will continue to work on its highest-profile project, a filmed version of the blockbuster 'Halo' videogame.Nadella said he will answer questions from employees at a town hall meeting at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on Friday and flesh out his plans publicly after Microsoft's quarterly earnings report on July 22.""We will simplify the way we work to drive greater accountability, become more agile and move faster,"" Nadella wrote to employees in a memo made public early Thursday. ""We plan to have fewer layers of management, both top down and sideways, to accelerate the flow of information and decision making.""The size of the cuts were welcomed by Wall Street, which was critical of the Nokia acquisition and viewed Microsoft as bloated under previous CEO Steve Ballmer, topping 127,000 in staff after absorbing Nokia earlier this year.""This is about double what the Street was expecting,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""Nadella is clearing the decks for the new fiscal year. He is cleaning up part of the mess that Ballmer left."" Microsoft shares rose 1.8 percent to $44.88 on Nasdaq, reaching their highest since the technology stock boom of 2000.About 12,500 of the layoffs will come from eliminating overlaps with the Nokia unit, which Microsoft acquired in April for $7.2 billion, with the bulk of the cuts coming from Nokia itself. The acquisition of Nokia's handset business in April added 25,000 people to Microsoft's payroll.The Nokia-related cuts were widely expected. When it struck the deal, Microsoft said it would cut $600 million per year in costs within 18 months of closing the acquisition.Excluding the Nokia cuts, the remaining 5,500 layoffs were not as shocking as it first appeared, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen.""The aggregate number is still bigger than expected but it's not as big as it comes across,"" he said. ""There's going to be a lot of re-hiring in other areas of the business. On a net basis, the numbers are small."" Microsoft's campus appears to have escaped heavy cuts, at least for now. The first wave of layoffs include 1,351 jobs in the Seattle region, Microsoft said.About 1,100 jobs will be cut from Nokia's original home country of Finland, according to government and union representatives there, with about half coming from the closure of its research and development operation in the northern city of Oulu.Stephen Elop, the former CEO of Nokia who now runs Microsoft's devices unit, said phone engineering efforts will now be concentrated in Salo and Tampere, Finland, and it will reduce engineering work in Beijing and San Diego.He said phone manufacturing will be focused in Hanoi, Vietnam, with some production to continue in Beijing and Dongguan, China. Some Microsoft manufacturing and repair operations will be moved to Manaus, Brazil and Reynosa, Mexico, as it winds down operations in Komaron, Hungary.The EU's employment commissioner said he has asked to meet with Microsoft to discuss the social impact of the layoffs. As part of the integration of Nokia, Microsoft is  abandoning its experiment in making phones powered by Google's Android system, moving some of its Nokia X line of phones onto Windows phone software.The company said it expects to take pretax charges of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion over the next four quarters to account for the costs of the layoffs.Nadella's cuts are the biggest at the Redmond, Washington-based company since Ballmer axed 5,800, or about 6 percent of headcount, in the depths of the recession in early 2009.The new CEO's moves are designed to help Microsoft shift from being a primarily software-focused company to one that sells online services, apps and devices it hopes will make people and businesses more productive. Nadella needs to make Microsoft a stronger competitor to Google and Apple Inc, which have dominated the new era of mobile-centric computing.Marking this change of emphasis, Nadella last week rebranded Microsoft as ""the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world.""Microsoft is not alone among the pioneers of the personal computer revolution now slimming down to adapt to the Web-focused world.PC-maker Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a radical three-to-five-year plan that will lop up to 50,000 from its staff of 250,000.International Business Machines Corp is undergoing a  ""workforce rebalancing,"" which analysts say could mean 13,000, or about 3 percent of its staff, being laid off or transferred to new owners as units are sold.Chipmaker Intel Corp and network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc both said in the past year they were cutting about 5 percent of their staff.

256,"  TOKYO, July 17 Nissan Motor Co chief executive Carlos Ghosn said some car makers remain reticent about working with technology giant Google Inc as it develops driverless vehicles for fear of their brands' identities becoming submerged.Ghosn, who also heads France's Renault, said car makers can benefit from collaborating with Google, which offers its Android software for cars and which is building prototypes of self-driving cars. ""But at the end of the day, I think all car makers are extremely cautious about maintaining control on their own cars,"" he told a news conference in Tokyo on Thursday.""We obviously don't want to become just a kind of a simple common hardware,"" Ghosn said. ""We really want to keep the attractiveness of the product and the control on the product."" Nissan, along with General Motors, Volkwagen AG's  Audi and Honda Motor Co, teamed up with Google this year to form the Open Automotive Alliance to incorporate the Android operating system into cars. Ghosn previously set a target for Japan's third-biggest car maker to introduce its own self-driving vehicles on a commercial basis by 2020. On Thursday he said it's a goal for Nissan to become the first to introduce driverless cars on a mass scale so as to set the standard and boost its brand's presence. ""There is always a premium for those who come first because you are associating the brand with something that in the end everybody is going to get,"" he said.In order to hit its 2020 target, Nissan plans to introduce systems that allow fully automated parking of cars and enable driverless cars to negotiate crowded highways, both by 2016. These innovations will be followed by technologies to allow the driverless cars to automatically change lanes and cross intersections in cities, Ghosn said.

257,"  (Adds background on debate, comment from privacy expert)By Joseph AxNEW YORK, July 18 A federal judge in New York has granted prosecutors access to a Gmail user's emails as part of a criminal probe, a decision that could fan the debate over how aggressively the government may pursue data if doing so may invade people's privacy.U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein said Friday he had authorized a warrant to be served on Google Inc for the emails of an unnamed individual who is the target of a money laundering investigation.Gorenstein said his decision ran counter to several other judges' rulings in similar cases that sweeping warrants give the government improper access to too many emails, not just relevant ones.But he said the law lets investigators review broad swaths of documents to decide which are covered by warrants.Google did not respond to a request for comment. The ruling came three months after U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis in New York said prosecutors can force Microsoft Corp to hand over a customer's email stored in an Ireland data center.Microsoft has appealed, in what is seen as the first challenge by a company to a warrant seeking data stored overseas.Companies including Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, Cisco Systems Inc and Apple Inc  have filed briefs in support of Microsoft, as has the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group. A hearing is set for July 31 before U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York. The government's ability to seize personal information has grown more contentious since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked secret documents in June 2013 to media outlets outlining the agency's massive data collection programs.In June, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruled police generally need a warrant to search an arrested suspect's cellphone, citing privacy concerns.Gorenstein's ruling joined a public debate playing out among several magistrate judges, who typically handle warrant requests. It is unusual to issue lengthy opinions on such matters particularly when, as in Gorenstein's case, the judge approves the application. In April, John Facciola, a magistrate in Washington, D.C., rejected a warrant for the Apple email account of a defense contractor as part of a kickback investigation, one of several similar opinions he has authored recently.Last year, a Kansas magistrate denied warrant applications for emails and records at Google, Verizon, Yahoo! Inc, Microsoft unit Skype and GoDaddy in a stolen computer equipment case.Both judges said the warrants were overly broad.On the other hand, several U.S. appeals courts have rejected motions to suppress such searches, Gorenstein said.Hanni Fakhoury, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, applauded Gorenstein for explaining his reasoning in writing, though he said he disagreed with the analysis.""The more voices and opinions we can add to the discussion, the better,"" he said in an email.

Google shares were up 2 percent at $593.37 in early trading on the Nasdaq.The company, which is also set to benefit from the so-called ""internet of things"", said on Thursday that second-quarter revenue rose 22 percent to $15.96 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $15.61 billion. Growth was driven by the company's core search business, YouTube and product-listing ads, which combined to drive three times as much mobile traffic for merchants compared with last year, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.Brokerage Jefferies maintained its ""buy"" rating and $700 price target on the stock.Of the 46 analysts covering Google, 36 have a ""buy"" or a higher rating on the stock and 10 have a ""hold"".

264,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. consumer lawsuit accusing Google of monopolizing prime real estate on Android smartphones will help mobile rivals like Microsoft make their antitrust case with European regulators should damaging secrets emerge in court.The suit, filed in California federal court in May by two smartphone consumers, said Google requires handset manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) to restrict competing apps like Microsoft's Bing search on Android phones, partly by making Google's own apps the default. Google argued last week the proposed class action should be dismissed because consumers still are free to use the other apps. The plaintiffs counter that most consumers either don't know how to switch default settings, or will not go to the trouble.If a judge lets the lawsuit proceed, plaintiffs' attorneys would be allowed to delve into internal Google emails and contracts with smartphone companies, and could interview Google executives under oath, said Steve Berman, who represents the consumers. ""I'm confident we will get into juicy stuff, and I think that will up the pressure on Google as some of the material we discover becomes public,"" he said. Google declined to comment. A hearing on Google's bid to dismiss the case is scheduled for October.Any damaging evidence from the class action would play into the hands of Google's rivals. Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans said the company ""is not a party"" to the consumer lawsuit, but last year a group of companies - including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Oracle (ORCL.N), Nokia NOK1V.HE, Expedia (EXPE.O) and TripAdvisor (TRIP.O) - filed a complaint with European antitrust regulators over some of the same issues in the U.S. lawsuit.Google apps ""are widely used on Android by requiring default placement and other mechanisms for disadvantaging competing apps,"" the companies said in a summary of their complaint. Google last year said it was working cooperatively with European regulators, who have yet to decide whether to formally investigate.  MICROSOFT TIES Berman has a long history of taking on large U.S. companies. He reached a settlement for consumers suing Apple (AAPL.O) over its e-book sales practices that could reach $450 million, and  settled for $1.6 billion a lawsuit on behalf of Toyota (7203.T) car owners with unintended acceleration claims.But the Seattle-based plaintiffs' lawyer also has represented one of Google's main rivals. Berman defended Microsoft when it faced its own antitrust investigations over Windows. Berman said he has had ""conversations with Microsoft over the years about Google's conduct,"" but not about this lawsuit.No stranger to antitrust inquiries, Google was scrutinized by U.S. and European regulators over allegations that it improperly manipulated search results to rank its own services higher than competitors.  U.S. authorities ultimately closed their investigation without filing a lawsuit, and Europe's competition commissioner negotiated a settlement earlier this year which is awaiting approval by the broader European Commission. PRIME REAL ESTATE The main issue for U.S. courts will be whether Android and mobile services like search are ""technically separate, or tied in ways that impedes competition for consumers,"" said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.  Cusumano has extensively researched Microsoft, which unsuccessfully sued the professor in the 1990s for access to his notes. This year Microsoft has sought to hire him to write an expert opinion in an unrelated proceeding.The U.S. consumer lawsuit is based largely on contracts between Google and Android manufacturers Samsung and HTC (2498.TW) that became public during Oracle's separate 2012 trial against Google. If Samsung or HTC wishes to use Google apps on its phones, the consumer lawsuit said, they must preload a suite of services - including YouTube and Maps - on ""prime screen real estate"" on the phones, and set Google search as the default. It also argues that Google's deal with Apple to be the default search on iPhones and iPads locks out competitors across the mobile universe. Apple does not have its own search engine, has lower market share worldwide than Android and is not a defendant in the case. Google's deals with handset makers do not prevent rival search engines ""from reaching consumers through the various distribution channels available to them,"" Google wrote in its motion to dismiss the U.S. lawsuit. Cusumano said the U.S. class action could hurt Google if a judge finds that it improperly pushes its mapping and location services, which is embedded across the Android system.It's ""kind of a Pandora's Box to look inside what Google does, and the relationship it has with all these smartphone and handset manufacturers,"" he said.

266,"  * EU invited Google, Apple to discuss in-app purchases* Google implementing a number of measures* Europe's app industry worth 10 billion euros a yearBy Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS, July 18 Apple has provided no concrete and immediate solutions to tackle the problem of adults and children racking up credit card bills by making ""in-app"" purchases on tablets and mobile phones, the European Commission said on Friday.Following concerns raised by consumer groups in a number of European countries, the EU executive called in industry members, policymakers and consumer protection authorities to discuss clearer guidelines in February.Since then, Google, which owns the Android operating system for smartphones, has proposed a number of measures that are being implemented. These include banning the word ""free"" when games contain in-app purchases and changing the default settings so that payments have to be actively authorised before every purchase.But the Commission regretted that Apple, maker of iPhone, had not made any firm commitments on tackling the issue of payment approvals. ""No concrete and immediate solutions have been made by Apple to date to address the concerns linked in particular to payment authorisation,"" the Commission, the EU executive, said in a statement.Many of those playing the games are children or teenagers, who can often make the in-app purchases without parental approval. It is then up to the parents to foot the bill.Industry members, including Apple, could face legal action from national authorities if they are deemed to be breaking EU consumer protection law.Apple said it would address the concerns brought up by the Commission, although it gave no time frame for when it might make the changes, the EU executive said. ""Over the last year we made sure any app which enables customers to make in-app purchases is clearly marked,"" said an Apple spokesman. ""We will continue to work with the EC member states to respond to their concerns.""BOOMING APP INDUSTRY  The app industry in Europe is huge and growing. It employs more than 1 million people and has annual revenue of around 10 billion euros ($13.53 billion), of which about 80 percent comes from in-app purchases, according to the Commission.National authorities will continue to engage with Apple to ensure that it addresses the concerns they brought up in December last year.While the company has not met their demands on payment consent, it has introduced clearer labelling on its iTunes store when apps marketed as free also offer in-app purchases. It has also proposed creating a specific email address through which enforcement authorities can contact it about possible breaches of EU law and discuss the problem with the app developers.The Commission estimates that over half of the EU online games market is advertised as ""free"" despite carrying hidden costs.""In-app purchases are a legitimate business model, but it's essential for app-makers to understand and respect EU law while they develop these new business models,"" said Neelie Kroes, the EU's telecoms commissioner.In one case in Britain, an 8-year-old girl managed to run up a bill of 4,000 pounds ($6,700) making ""in-app"" purchases from games such as My Horse and Smurfs' Village. In that instance, Apple reimbursed the girl's father.In-app purchases can be disabled on most mobile devices.

267,"   By Danilo Masoni | MILAN  MILAN Italy's data protection regulator has given Google 18 months to change the way it treats and stores user data, bringing to an end an investigation that is part of a European drive to reform the internet giant's privacy practices.Regulators in several European nations including Italy began a joint inquiry last year after Google consolidated its 60 privacy policies into one, combining data collected on individual users across its services, including YouTube, Gmail and social network Google+. It gave users no means to opt out.In a statement on Monday, the Italian watchdog said Google's  disclosure to users on how their data was being treated remained inadequate, despite the company having taken steps to abide by local law. The watchdog gave the group 18 months to comply fully and indicated a series of measures Google must put into practice. The Rome-based regulator said Google would not be allowed to use the data to profile users without their prior consent and would have to tell them explicitly that the profiling was being done for commercial purposes. It also demanded that requests from users with a Google account to delete their personal data be met in up to two months. A spokesman for Google said the company had always cooperated with the regulator and would continue to do so, adding it would carefully review the regulator’s decision before taking any further steps. As part of the process, Google also agreed to present a document by the end of September that will set a roadmap of steps to comply fully with the Italian regulator's decision. A source familiar with the regulator said should Google not comply it could risk fines of up to about 1 million euros, a tiny fraction of Google's income, as well as possible criminal proceedings. Regulators in France and Spain have already fined Google for breaking local laws on data protection, underscoring growing concerns across Europe about the volume of personal data that is held in foreign jurisdictions. In Britain, the ICO regulator gave Google until September 20 last year to make changes to bring the policy into line with local law. On Monday a spokesman did not return a request for comment asking for an update on the case. In the Netherlands, the data protection regulator found in November that Google's privacy policy was in breach of local law. A spokeswoman said the Dutch regulator was still weighing whether to take enforcement measures, which can include fines.In a separate regulatory development, Google is taking initial steps to meet a European ruling that citizens can have objectionable links removed from Internet search results, a ruling that pleased privacy campaigners but raised fears that the right could be abused to hide negative information.

But the agreement has been criticized, both by tech companies and European politicians, as inadequate. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said at the time he would accept Google's concessions without consulting complainants, prompting a furious response.On Tuesday, the Commission said it was considering formal complaints to the agreement and aimed to make a decision on the matter in September. ""We have written to the formal complainants in the ongoing proceedings and we have not received yet all their replies,"" a spokesman for the Commission said. ""In early August all replies will have been submitted. We will then thoroughly analyze the arguments they contain and, depending on the outcome of that analysis, the next steps will be decided by Mr. Almunia in September.""Google may face other investigations, including regarding its Android operating system for smartphones.The European Commission recently sent a fresh request for information to handset makers on their dealings with Android, which runs on roughly four-fifths of the world's smartphones. That line of inquiry is likely to turn into a formal investigation, the Journal reporting, citing a person with knowledge of the situation. Last month, Almunia said he could initiate an investigation of YouTube if he saw any attempt by Google to abuse its dominance of online video searching.

""This will lead to some difficult decisions for Google.""EUROPEAN PRIVACY TOUR California-based Google faces a number of privacy headaches in Europe, where rules protecting people's personal data are much stricter than in the United States.While the EU has been discussing a major overhaul of its pre-Internet era data protection laws for over two years, the debate heated up last year after revelations that the United States had been conducting mass surveillance programmes involving European citizens and some heads of state.U.S. web companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, came under increased scrutiny over their handling of swathes of personal data in Europe.In a sign of the importance Google is attaching to the privacy debate in Europe, it has recruited a panel of high profile academics, policymakers and civil society experts to advise it on how to implement the ruling as it ploughs through the over 70,000 requests it has received so far.Separately, a group consisting of representatives from the EU's 28 data protection regulators are developing guidelines to help them deal with complaints against Google in a coherent manner, given the differences in national data protection legislation. Thursday's meeting will feed into that process.Complaints from people whose requests have been refused by Google have begun to trickle in. The British privacy regulator had received 23 complaints by Tuesday afternoon, a spokesman said, while complaints to the French and Italian authorities were still in single figures.

Three weeks earlier, the FBI served a warrant on the residence of the engineer, Sharon Leach, in Wyandotte in suburban Detroit, court records show.Seized from the residence, according to documents filed by the FBI with the district court, were four laptop computers and a desktop computer, along with three USB drives, financial records, some documents from Leach's employer and one T-Mobile Google telephone.A third warrant was served to Google Inc, asking for records of Leach's email account including emails sent to and from her account as well as drafts of emails and deleted information associated with the email account but still available to Google, according to court documents. Google supplied several items, including a video disk marked as a reply to the search warrant and a cover letter, according to court documents. Google sent the items by overnight delivery on Wednesday, court documents show.However, the court documents did not show the contents of the disk or other information supplied by Google.""Ford initiated an investigation of a now former employee and requested the assistance of the FBI,"" Ford spokeswoman Krusel said.

At least two downgraded ratings to the equivalent of ""hold"".Amazon is engaged in ""a massive ecosystem war"" with Apple Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp  Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter said.""Within that context, it is clear that this ... is going to be expensive and will impact margins,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Holdings Group Ltd  also looms as a threat to Amazon as it expands in the U.S. market, Schachter and others say.Amazon is spending billions of dollars to expand its network of warehouses, build up its business in China and India, and to buy digital content to help its Prime online video service take on Netflix Inc. Google forced Amazon to cut prices for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing service earlier this year by offering big price cuts earlier this year.Sharp price cuts for AWS - which also faces competition from Microsoft's Azure cloud service - hurt Amazon's revenue growth in the quarter, coming in below analysts' expectations.Amazon's digital content store, which offers mobile and tablet apps, ebooks, music and video, competes with Apple's App Store and Google's Play store.Google is also taking on Amazon through its Shopping Express home-delivery service. It has been a busy year for Amazon. The company has also unveiled a subscription book service, a TV streaming-box, and the ""Fire"" smartphone - all of which required investment.ANOTHER OPERATING LOSS Amazon forecast an operating loss of $410 million-$810 million for the third quarter ending Sept. 30, a sharp increase from a loss of $25 million a year earlier. ""The primary bear case against Amazon is, and always has been, that (Chief Executive Jeff) Bezos will never ramp margins, as he will always find new investments,"" Schachter said.""We have to admit that after this 3Q guidance, it is frustratingly difficult to dismiss such concerns.""Pacific Crest analyst Chad Bartley said the poor operating earnings outlook would weigh on the stock in the second half.Amazon shares should be valued at $36.67, based on analysts' expected earnings growth rates over the next decade, according to StarMine.""In our view, the company clearly has solid growth prospects for the foreseeable future as it invests in new businesses,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Williams said.""However, heavy spending is hampering profitability in the near term, placing pressure on the margin structure.""More than 10 million Amazon shares had traded by late morning, more double the 50-day moving average.

285,"  Google Inc (GOOGL.O) (GOOG.O) faces a variety of challenges from European Commission regulators, in contrast to its experience in the United States where the Internet search company has largely mitigated regulatory threats.The following are some of the regulatory issues that Google is contending with in Europe:*Android - EC regulators have stepped up inquiries into Google's policies regarding its Android mobile operating system, which is used in 80 percent of the world's mobile phones. Regulators appear to be focused on whether Google’s mobile policies impede rivals.  *Search - An EC investigation that began in 2010 seeks to address complaints that Google manipulated its search results to rank its own services higher than competitors. A proposed settlement, under which Google has agreed to display rivals' links more prominently, among other things, is contested by critics who say it lets Google off too easily.*Right to be Forgotten - Google has scrambled to process tens of thousands of requests by individuals who want search-result links to unflattering news articles removed, following a ruling by Europe's top court in May. Regulators criticized Google for restricting its implementation of the ruling to European sites rather than to the broader Google.com website. *User data - Italy's data protection regulator gave Google 18 months to change the way it treats and stores user data, a response to Google’s controversial move to combine data collected on individual users of its various online services and to consolidate its 60 privacy policies. *Taxes - Britain, France and Germany have called for stricter rules to stop companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon aggressively avoiding taxes in austerity-bitten Europe. Google has said it complies with the tax rules of all the countries in which it operates.

287,"  * Up to 90 pct of smartphones share flaws* Google Android devices face issues involving spoofed IDs* No evidence consumers have been harmed to dateBy Eric AuchardVIENNA, July 31 Security researchers have revealed two separate threats this week they say could put up to 90 percent of the world's 2 billion plus smartphones at risk of password theft, stolen data and in some cases let hackers take full control of devices.One vulnerability involves flaws in the way scores of manufacturers of Apple, Google Android and Blackberry devices, among others, have implemented an obscure industry standard that controls how everything from network connections to user identities are managed.The threat could enable attackers to remotely wipe devices, install malicious software, access data and run applications on smartphones, Mathew Solnik, a mobile researcher with Denver-based cyber security firm Accuvant, said in a phone interview.A separate threat specifically affecting up to three-quarters of devices running older Android software has been unearthed by researchers at Bluebox Security of San Francisco.Dubbed ""Fake ID"", the vulnerability allows malicious applications to trick trusted software from Adobe, Google and others on Android devices without any user notification, the company said on Wednesday.""Essentially anything that relies on verified signature chains of an Android application is undermined by this vulnerability,"" Bluebox said in a statement referring to devices built before Google updated its core software late last year. These risks could not be independently verified by Reuters.Solnik stressed that the threat to smartphone management software identified by Accuvant remained remote to average users and said that only a few dozen mobile communications experts in the world would currently be able to replicate the technique. But by publicising the risks, his company hopes to avert this becoming a danger on a global scale.FIXING FLAWS The global smartphone industry has been scrambling for the past few years to respond to an increasing number of vulnerabilities uncovered in mobile technology. Both research groups will present their findings at next week's Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas, which is highlighting research on mobile technology, among other themes.An Apple spokesmen declined immediate comment.Blackberry said it was aware of Accuvant's findings and was seeking more details.""BlackBerry has been working closely with Accuvant. Internal and external security researchers serve a critical role in improving industry security standards,"" a spokeswoman said. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the general vulnerability raised by Accuvant about many smartphone devices. He confirmed that Google had quickly distributed a patch to Android phone makers on learning of the issue from Bluebox.In general, Android's open software development process encourages individuals and security firms to report security issues, allowing the company to push patches to manufacturers, which in turn must implement the fixes.The spokesperson said it has scanned all apps in Google Play, Android's application market place, and elsewhere and have found no risks to users. ""We have seen no evidence of attempted exploitation of this vulnerability,"" he said.Christina Richmond, a security services analyst with research firm IDC said detecting these vulnerabilities is positive in that the phone industry has a chance to act on these findings before they can be exploited by bad actors.""These security threats have become everyday issues for billions of smartphone users worldwide,"" she said. ""Mr. and Mrs. end user needs to understand the risk of not updating their phone's software.""The disclosures come as market share statistics released on Thursday by mobile research firm Strategy Analytics show Android capturing a dominant 85 percent share of smartphones shipped worldwide in the second quarter. All major rivals from Apple iOS to Microsoft to Blackberry lost market share.Security researchers say Android's rapid growth and dominant market share has come with an Achilles heel.Until late last year, successive versions of Android were distinct creatures, making it hard, if not impossible for developers to update products for each software release, and meaning most Android security features could not be back-dated.The ""Fake ID"" vulnerability is widespread in Android phones dating back to the January 2010 release of Android 2.1 software and affects all devices not patched by Google, Bluebox said.

289,"   By Malathi Nayak | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Aug 4 A mobile game that simulates Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip and invites users to ""drop bombs and avoid killing civilians"" has been pulled from Google Inc's app store, a company spokesman said on Monday after a public backlash.""Bomb Gaza,"" developed by PlayFTW and still available as an app on Facebook, simulates the on-going conflict between Israel and the Islamist group Hamas, which dominates the Palestinian territory. Players drop bombs from a fighter jet while dodging missiles from Hamas fighters in black and green masks.""We remove apps from Google Play that violate our policies,"" a spokesman for Google said, confirming that the game had been removed from the Google Play app store. Google did not specify which policy the game had violated. Google Play has rules that prohibit content that amounts to hate speech, bullying and violence and lets users flag abusive content.The game triggered outraged comments on the Google app store review page as well as on Facebook. It had been downloaded about 1,000 times since its July 29 launch, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper. ""You disgust me,"" Saj Ishaq wrote on PlayFTW's public Facebook page. Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment and PlayFTW could not be immediately reached.""Please take this off the Play store. It is offensive and I am really let down that Google actually allowed this. If this game isn't removed I'm starting a Google boycott,"" Oma Al, a user, wrote on the game's review page, according to the Guardian.On July 8, Israel launched an offensive on Gaza in response to a surge in Hamas rocket strikes. Gaza officials say more than 1,831 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed and about 3,000 Palestinian homes have been destroyed or damaged since the offensive began.

290,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Jack ShaferAug 6 ""Don't be evil"" - the first sentence of Google's ""Code of Conduct"" - has served as the technology company's corporate motto since its earliest days. But given Google's role in the arrest late last month of a Houston man on child pornography charges, perhaps we've been misreading it. Perhaps the motto is aimed at its customers, as in, ""Don't you be evil or we'll have you busted.""Google, obviously, isn't the first Internet company to alert investigators of a user who might be transmitting or be in possession of child pornography images. Since the late 1990s, the law has required service providers to report apparent violations of child pornography laws. In 2004, for example, AOL provided a tip that resulted in a child pornography conviction. In 2007, Yahoo took similar action that helped earn a child pornography defendant a 16-year sentence. So far, the courts have rejected Fourth Amendment challenges to these prosecutions, and are likely to continue to do so. No credible sources have appeared to denounce the prosecutions as overkill, and I doubt if any will. The Houston bust, in which John Henry Skillern allegedly sent explicit images of a young girl to a friend via email, comes a year after Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond renewed his company's commitment, which he dated to 2006, to expunge child pornography from the Web and identify its traffickers. As the company's email policies state, ""Google has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery. If we become aware of such content, we will report it to the appropriate authorities. "" In its efforts, Google has funded groups that search for the images and, with other companies, has built a shared database of digital fingerprints (via ""hashing"") of the images. These fingerprints allow Google and other companies, such as Microsoft and Facebook, to ""trawl"" accounts for apparent violations of the child pornography laws. The hashing technology, it should be noted, is only as reliable as the database. If you were to create new child pornography this afternoon and load it on to the Web, Google's algorithms would not automatically detect it as child pornography until somebody identified it, fingerprinted it, and fed it to the database.Google assuages users who worry it might be scouring their Gmail accounts for evidence of other potential crimes. It told Business Insider this week it does not do that - even though its updated-in-April terms of service leave it plenty of latitude to glean whatever it likes from your account. ""Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails),"" the terms of service state. ""This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored."" Still, you're not likely to get turned in by Google or other providers for sharing recipes for meth or bombs. At least not any time soon. Yet the civil-liberties paranoid - and who among us is not one, thanks to the National Security Agency revelations? - frets anyway. It was inevitable that the all-seeing eyes of the search giants, which excel at locating tiny specks of information hidden beneath terabytes of data, would also perfect ways of cataloging forbidden, illegal content and ratting-out those who transmit it.Luckily for us, child pornography is just about the only information forbidden by our laws (for purposes of brevity, I'm ignoring the legal prohibitions against spilling nuclear secrets and sharing signals intelligence). But as we continue to digitize the most intimate details of our lives and send them to the clouds for storage, we will become ever more vulnerable to the scrutiny of the companies and the governments who control the switches. Should a moral panic generated by another 9/11-style attack, an epidemic, or a natural disaster sweep through our culture, who is to say that the tools being perfected to apprehend aficionados of child pornography won't be turned on the rest of us? And it's not just the big data of lives that needs protection. If nothing else, the Snowden revelations have sensitized us to how revealing even the seemingly innocuous meta-data generated phone calls can be. Like cannibals, murderers, pedophiles and rapists, child pornographers - and customers of child pornography - constitute the worst of the human worst. They are the exemplars of the retrograde. Our natural impulse will always be to use whatever means, legal or technological, to expose and punish such unrepentant deviants.Today, I'm fine with Web companies using scanning technology to uncover those who trade in child pornography. But the powers conjured up out of universal abhorrence have a way of spinning out of control, leading us to commit immoral acts in our pursuit of morality. It wasn't that long ago that marrying across racial lines was a crime. Or that homosexual acts were punished by law. Or that pot smokers were jailed for decades. Or property covenants prevented Jews from buying properties. Should the current powers thrown at the child pornographers not be judged to work, it's inevitable that otherwise rational people will start calling for stronger security measures - maybe banning anonymity and forcing everybody to carry government-issued Internet licenses? - to end the current scourge.The old legal cliché holds that bad facts make bad law. To that I'd add this codicil: Bad guys make bad law, too.

291,"  * Q2 net income $27.4 million vs $17.6 million* Firm moves focus away from desktops and searchBy Ari RabinovitchJERUSALEM, Aug 6 Israel-based Perion Network  posted on Wednesday higher quarterly earnings, but lowered its 2014 outlook after Google dented revenue prospects by unexpectedly altering its browser policy.Perion, whose technology helps developers distribute apps and make money off them through advertising, is also shifting focus away from desktop computers and search functions to the mobile and video sectors, company chief executive Josef Mandelbaum told Reuters.""We're lowering the outlook mainly because of the change in (Google browser) Chrome. We're not going to spend as aggressively because we would be losing money, and we are preserving the profitability of the business,"" Mandelbaum said.Last month Google made a simple yet significant switch, adding extra steps for users to take in order to accept internet add-ons, when previously, agreeing was the default setting, he said.This will likely cut into revenue, Mandelbaum said, because users are less likely to take the time to agree to a new add-on - a process that generates income for Perion. Perion and its competitors, which include IAC/InterActiveCorp and Blucora Inc, had not expected the change, he said.""If past history is an indicator, it will require two to three quarters of adjusting,"" he said.Perion shares in Tel Aviv were down 1.53 percent to 27.10 shekels in afternoon trading. OUTLOOK SLIPS Perion is also looking to lift its activities in the mobile sector. In June it agreed to buy Grow Mobile Inc of San Francisco for up to $42 million in cash and equity to expand its offering for mobile application advertising.""We are actively looking at further acquisitions ... and there are things in the pipeline,"" Mandelbaum said. Second-quarter revenue jumped to $111 million from $81.7 million a year earlier while net income rose to $27.4 million from $17.6 million.For 2014, Perion trimmed its revenue outlook to $380-$400 million from a previous range of $460-$470 million.The forecast for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was cut to $110-$120 million from $125-$130 million and its estimate for net income fell to $80-$90 million from $103-$108 million.Perion announced last week it had extended by three years its partnership with Microsoft search engine Bing, which in the past has brought hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, Mandelbaum said.He added that the new deal should be similar in size.Perion is also known for its consumer apps IncrediMail and Smilebox.

The European Union's top court in May ruled that people have a right to request that years-old personal information that is no longer relevant be removed from Internet search results. ""There is a good arguable case that Google Inc is the publisher of the Words and liable for their publication,"" said Marlene Ng, the deputy high court judge, in her ruling.  Google declined to comment on the verdict. Yeung is seeking damages from Google for libel and wants the company to remove the defamatory search suggestions, court documents said.Google argued that autocomplete works according to an automated algorithm and the company is not responsible for the resulting suggestions, which change depending on what a critical mass of users search for. ""The entire basis of the internet will be compromised if search engines are required to audit what can be assessed by users using their search tools,"" court documents attributed Gerard McCoy, Google's lawyer, as saying.""It would be impossible for Google Inc to manually interfere with or monitor the search processes given the billions of searches conducted by Google Search,"" McCoy said according to the documents.Because Google did not protest that the autocomplete suggestions were defamatory and they have criminal associations, Google may end up paying a large amount of money if Yeung sues successfully. ""In my view, it cannot be said at this stage that damages for reputational damage in Hong Kong are likely to be minimal if Yeung wins at trial,"" Ng said.

298,"  (Adds Intel comment, more details from ruling)By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO Aug 8 Four Silicon Valley companies including Apple and Google failed to persuade a U.S. judge to sign off on a $324.5 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit by tech workers, who accused the firms of conspiring to avoid poaching each other's employees.In a ruling on Friday, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said the class action settlement was too low, given the strength of the case against the companies. Intel  and Adobe were also part of the proposed deal.There is ""substantial and compelling evidence"" that late Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs ""was a, if not the, central figure in the alleged conspiracy,"" Koh wrote. The judge provided details in evidence of anecdotes involving Jobs and other Valley executives to show why she thought the workers deserved more.Representatives for Apple and Google Inc declined to comment. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the company is disappointed Koh rejected an agreement ""that was negotiated at arm's length over many months,"" but appreciates that Koh provided additional information on her views.Lawyers for the workers, along with an Adobe representative, were not immediately available to comment.In their 2011 lawsuit, the tech employees said the conspiracy had limited their job mobility and, as a result, kept a lid on salaries. The case has been closely watched because of the possibility of big damages being awarded and for the opportunity to peek into the world of some of America's elite tech firms. The case was based largely on emails in which Apple's Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt and some of their rivals hatched plans to avoid poaching each other's prized engineers.PARIS BLUES Koh referred to one email exchange which occurred after a Google recruiter solicited an Apple employee. Schmidt told Jobs that the recruiter would be fired. Jobs then forwarded Schmidt's note to a top Apple human resources executive with a smiley face. Koh also disclosed a 2006 exchange over Google's plans to open an engineering center in Paris. Google sought to hire three former Apple engineers for the project, but Jobs objected. Jobs wrote that his company would ""strongly prefer that you not hire these guys."" Google then told Jobs it had scrapped plans for the Paris center, ""based on your strong preference.""The four companies agreed to settle with the workers in April shortly before trial. The plaintiffs had planned to ask for about $3 billion in damages at trial, which could have tripled to $9 billion under antitrust law.Plaintiff attorneys argued Koh should approve the deal because the workers faced serious risks on appeal had the case gone forward. Some tech workers filed objections to the settlement, however, saying both sides should go back to the negotiating table in the hopes of obtaining a larger amount. Daniel Girard, a lawyer for one of the objectors, said he is ""very pleased that the court agreed with his position."" It is unclear whether objectors would be included in any future settlement negotiations.In her ruling, Koh repeatedly referred to a related settlement last year involving Disney and Intuit. Apple and Google workers got proportionally less in the latest deal compared to the one involving Disney, Koh wrote, even though plaintiff lawyers have ""much more leverage"" now than they did a year ago.To match the earlier settlement, the latest deal ""would need to total at least $380 million,"" Koh wrote.The judge also said the plaintiffs had strong evidence to prove how the no-poaching deals impacted wages. In response to hiring pressure from Facebook, Google co-founder Sergey Brin announced a policy in 2007 of making counteroffers ""within one hour"" to any Google employee approached by the social networking company.Google then tried to entice Facebook into a no-poaching deal, Koh wrote, but Facebook refused. The Facebook threat eventually led Google to alter its salary structure and increase all salaries by 10 percent, Koh wrote.A further hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 10.The case is In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation,  U.S. District Court, Northern District of California 11-cv-2509.

307,"  (Adds analysts' comments)By Deepa SeetharamanSAN FRANCISCO Aug 13 Amazon.com Inc  unveiled a $10 credit-card reader and mobile app for businesses on Wednesday, expanding further into bricks-and-mortar retail and the rapidly evolving mobile payments arena.The move pits Amazon against a slew of rivals including startup Square, which popularized a card swiper that plugs into a smartphone or tablet and allows small- and mid-sized businesses like food trucks and coffee shops to quickly accept credit and debit transactions. The new point-of-sale system, called Amazon Local Register, would give Amazon crucial data on how U.S. consumers shop offline, analysts say. More than 90 percent of U.S. retail sales still take place in physical stores, according to U.S. government data.On Wednesday, an Amazon spokeswoman said all data from Amazon Local Register customers would be securely protected and would not be used merely for fraud protection and risk management. ""There may be some hesitation among merchants to process payments through Amazon due to data sharing or competitive concerns,"" R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote on Wednesday.The biggest technology firms like Apple Inc and Google Inc may also step up their investment in mobile payments, which is taking off as smartphones become ubiquitous. Amazon hopes to court small businesses in part by charging lower fees than Square and eBay Inc's PayPal. Those who sign up for Amazon's program before Oct. 31 will be charged 1.75 percent for each card swiped until January 2016.For those who sign up after October, Amazon will take a 2.5 percent cut of each card swipe, still less than Square's 2.75 percent flat transaction rate and PayPal's 2.7 percent.Amazon's move ""was indicative of the blurring lines between commerce and payments, and ultimately Amazon competing against eBay/PayPal, Google and Apple in the mobile payment space,"" Sebastian said.

But the TechCrunch blog reported in July that Samsung was in discussions to pay more than $200 million for the two-year-old startup of 55 employees, which has raised $15.5 million in venture capital from Greylock and Russian investor Yuri Milner, among others.SmartThings, which lets people use a mobile app to control connected devices, says it has some 5,000 developers building devices that connect to its open platform. It will continue to operate independently but move its base from Washington, D.C. to Palo Alto, California. Some tech and telecommunications executives view the market for ""smart,"" or connected, home devices as poised to explode.Manufacturers are rolling out Internet-connected burglar alarms, televisions and light switches. But like the early days of video cassette recorders, current smart home products are often incompatible with each other. The largest tech players are now drawing up alliances to  create common standards for the next generation of gadgets.Apple, known for strictly controlling how other companies' products interact with its own, in June announced HomeKit, which it describes as a framework to communicate with devices in the home. Google's Nest has also partnered with companies including Whirlpool Corp and light bulb maker LIFX to integrate their products with its thermostats and smoke detectors.Samsung, which already makes Internet-connected appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, has allied with Intel Corp and Dell Inc, among others.

309,"   By Dan Levine  A U.S. appeals court on Friday rejected patent claims brought by a Vringo Inc subsidiary against several companies including Google, sending Vringo shares plummeting.Vringo subsidiary I/P Engine had won a jury verdict of infringement against Google, finding that Google's AdWords platform infringed two patents on filtering Internet search results. The jury awarded over $30 million. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday declared both patents invalid in a split ruling. Vringo shares were trading at 92 cents in afternoon trading, down over 70 percent.In a statement, Vringo said it is evaluating its options. Catherine Lacavera, director of IP litigation for Google, said ""we always believed strongly in our case, and we are pleased with this decision.""In rejecting the Vringo patents, a three-judge Federal Circuit panel in Washington voted 2-1 that the invention was obvious to anyone skilled in the field. The commercial success of Google's Adwords platform is not evidence to the contrary, the court ruled.  Judge Raymond Chen dissented. In a separate concurrence, Judge Haldane Robert Mayer delved into the current debate over how much patent protection should be accorded to software. Recent Supreme Court case law restricting software patents should make Vringo's inventions ineligible for patent protection regardless of whether they were obvious, Mayer wrote. Since Vringo's patents do not improve the functioning of a computer itself, Mayer wrote, ""unnecessary litigation, and nearly two weeks of trial and imposition on citizen jurors, could have been avoided.""The case in the Federal Circuit is I/P Engine vs. Google et al., 13-1307.

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.* Coca-Cola Co announced that it had acquired a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp for $2.15 billion. The deal unites the biggest soda maker in the world with the largest energy drink brand in the United States. (nyti.ms/XlqFuy)* Trading linked to congestion on New York State's electric grid, a market intended to protect power companies and ultimately benefit consumers, has made big profits for trading firms. (nyti.ms/1m023gq) * Financial regulators are pushing for an arcane but crucial modification to the contracts that stand behind the $700 trillion global market for derivatives. The change is part of the regulators' efforts to avoid the sort of systemic chaos that occurred after Lehman Brothers Holding Inc crashed. (nyti.ms/1l7Ne0l) * Lenders to Puerto Rico's big electric power authority gave it a breather on Thursday instead of enforcing a looming deadline on the lines of credit the company uses to buy fuel for its power plants. The banks that provide the credit line gave the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority until March 31 to make good on principal repayments that originally came due at the end of July. (nyti.ms/VqZhJN)* The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and Pershing Square Capital Management have broken any laws while pursuing a hostile takeover of Allergan Inc. The inquiry is in its early stages and may not lead to a formal investigation, according to a person briefed on the matter. (nyti.ms/1pdJlpN) * Starbucks Corp announced revisions on Thursday to the way the company schedules its 130,000 baristas, saying it wanted to improve ""stability and consistency"" in work hours week to week. The company intends to curb the much-loathed practice of ""clopening,"" or workers closing the store late at night and returning just a few hours later to reopen, wrote Cliff Burrows, the group president in charge of American stores, in an email to baristas across the country. (nyti.ms/1sZbQZX)* Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has purchased SmartThings, a start-up that makes accessories that connect home appliances to the Internet.

315,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Technology investor Esther Dyson thinks she has found the answer to America's growing health concerns, and has enlisted five smaller cities across the country to try and prove it.Dyson, an early investor in Square and board member for Yandex, Russia's answer to Google Inc, has drafted five towns to participate in a five-year long test, or what she calls a ""healthy living challenge.""By introducing programs and urban planning initiatives, such as wholesome school lunches, corporate wellness programs and more bike paths, Dyson hopes to reduce overall rates of obesity and chronic disease in these towns. Dyson calls this the ""Way to Wellville,"" where such programs reinforce each other, promote awareness, and hopefully avert expensive healthcare costs over the long term. Its sponsor is a nonprofit organization called the Health Initiative Coordinating Council, or HICCup, which Dyson founded. HICCup will help local officials find funding from social investors, local businesses and philanthropic organizations.Each of the towns expects to spend between $20 million and $80 million over the next five years. HICCup, run by former insurance executive Rick Brush, has set aside some $5 million for administrative costs.  The five towns are: Muskegon, Michigan; Lake County, California; Spartanburg, South Carolina; Clatsop County, Oregon; and Niagara falls, New York. These communities all have populations of less than 100,000 people, and their local officials are fully on board with the initiative, Dyson said. Dyson hopes to establish a model for other communities and provide direct feedback to policymakers in government. Her experiment is timely, given the Obama Administration's support for ""population health"" initiatives as a means to cut spiraling costs. Population health advocates push for increased funding for preventative measures for groups of patients to reduce rates of chronic illness.  For instance, if a town invests a small sum into programs to inform citizens about the health risks associated with fast food, as well as counseling for pre-diabetes, it could avoid thousands of dollars in medical care and reduced work productivity. ""The programs by and large won't be remarkable,"" Dyson said. ""What's remarkable is doing them together, reinforcing one another, and critical density, in small self-contained communities where they will have maximum impact."" (Reporting By Christina Farr.

316,"   By Bill Cotterell | TALLAHASSEE Fla.  TALLAHASSEE Fla. A record 24 million tourists visited Florida this spring, up 3 percent from 2013, spurred by unusually cold northern weather, a Google program that allows virtual beach tours and aggressive marketing, a state official said on Tuesday.Preliminary numbers also show tourism spending totaled $35.7 billion from January through May, up 7.4 percent from the same period last year, said Will Seccombe, president and chief executive of Visit Florida, the state's travel promotion agency.The spikes accompanied the state's first cold-weather marketing campaign during an usually harsh northern winter.“It happened to coincide with the polar vortex, which none of us were really planning on or banking on,” Seccombe said.  At a meeting on Tuesday, he showed Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state Cabinet television spots that were aimed at northerners and Canadians with the slogan “Must be the sunshine.” One featured tourists flying in “V” formation like geese to beaches, golf courses and theme parks.With children going back to school, Seccombe said the year-round ad campaign will now begin targeting retirees and young couples whose vacation plans are not tied to school calendars.Visit Florida estimated that 2.8 million overseas visitors came to the state in the April-June quarter, including 1 million Canadians. Scott, whose re-election campaign is focused heavily on job creation, said his administration invested $74 million in Visit Florida with a goal of drawing 100 million tourists this year.With 26 million visitors in the first quarter and 24 million in the second, he said Florida was on pace to meet that target. Both quarters set records for the state. Employment in the state's hospitality industry stands around 1 million — with roughly one job produced by every 85 tourists, Seccombe said. Seccombe said millions of people have virtually toured Florida's beaches through a partnership with Google that created online ground-level views. Four men walked 740 miles of beaches to upload video to Google Maps and Visitflorida.com for the initiative.

Google's effort is partly driven by the fact that some parents are already trying to create accounts for their children and the company wants to make the process easier and compliant with the rules, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the effort.

323,"  FRANKFURT Aug 22 A German regulator handed Google Inc a victory on Friday as it said it would not pursue a complaint brought against the internet search engine operator by a group of publishers for giving users access to their news articles.Several publishers including Axel Springer SE and Burda had banded together in a group called VG Media to demand Google pay them for making their online articles available to the public. ""Sufficient suspicion is always necessary to initiate an abuse procedure. The complaint from VG Media did not establish this,"" Andreas Mundt, president of Germany's Federal Cartel Office, said in a statement on Friday. Under German legislation that came into effect just over a year ago, publishers can prohibit search engines and similar services from using their news articles beyond very short excerpts. The cartel office said, though, that the scope of that legislation was not yet entirely clear. It said it would nonetheless monitor Google's reaction to publishers' demands and launch anti-trust proceedings if warranted.

324,"  SHANGHAI Aug 24 China could have a new homegrown operating system by October to take on imported rivals such as Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Apple Inc, Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.Computer technology became an area of tension between China and the United States after a number of run-ins over cyber security. China is now looking to help its domestic industry catch up with imported systems such as Microsoft's Windows and Google's mobile operating system Android.The operating system would first appear on desktop devices and later extend to smartphone and other mobile devices, Xinhua said, citing Ni Guangnan who heads an official OS development alliance established in March.Ni's comments were originally reported by the People's Post and Telecommunications News, an official trade paper run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).""We hope to launch a Chinese-made desktop operating system by October supporting app stores,"" Ni told the trade paper. Some Chinese OS already existed, but there was a large gap between China's technology and that of developed countries, he added. He said he hoped domestically built software would be able to replace desktop operating systems within one to two years and mobile operating systems within three to five years.In May, China banned government use of Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system, a blow to the U.S. technology firm's business which raised fears China was moving to protect domestic firms. Microsoft is also under investigation for anti-trust violations. In March last year, China said that Google had too much control over China's smartphone industry via its Android mobile operating system and has discriminated against some local firms.Mutual suspicions between China and the United States over hacking have escalated over the past year following revelations by Edward Snowden that U.S. intelligence planted ""backdoor"" surveillance tools on U.S.-made hardware. The U.S. Justice Department, meanwhile, indicted five Chinese military officers in May on counts of extensive industrial espionage.Ni said the ban on Windows 8 was a big opportunity for the Chinese sector to push forward its own systems, but that the industry needed further development and investment.""Creating an environment that allows us to contend with Google, Apple and Microsoft - that is the key to success,"" he added.

325,"  (Adds comments from Amazon and Twitch executives, background on Google interest in Twitch)By Deepa Seetharaman and Malathi NayakSAN FRANCISCO Aug 25 Amazon.com Inc  snapped up live-streaming gaming network Twitch Interactive for about $970 million in cash, reflecting Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos' resolve to transform Amazon into an Internet destination beyond its core retail operations.The move, announced by the two companies on Monday, is the largest deal in Amazon's 20-year history and will help the U.S. e-commerce company vie with Apple Inc and Google Inc  in the fast-growing world of online gaming, which accounts for more than 75 percent of all mobile app sales.The acquisition involves some retention agreements that push the deal over $1 billion, a source close to the deal told Reuters.""Twitch will further push Amazon into the gaming community while also helping it with video and advertising,"" Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter said in a note.Twitch's format, which lets viewers message players and each other during live play, is garnering interest as one of the fastest-growing segments of digital video streaming, which in turn is attracting more and more advertising dollars.The deal, expected to close in the second half of the year, is an unusual step for Amazon, which tends to build from within or make smaller acquisitions. Tech rival Google was earlier in talks to buy Twitch, which launched slightly more than three years ago, one person briefed on the deal said. Neither Amazon nor Twitch would discuss how the deal came together or comment on Google's interest.In an interview, Twitch Chief Executive Officer Emmett Shear said the startup contacted Amazon because its deep pockets and ad sales expertise would allow the startup to pursue its strategic objectives more quickly.""The reason why we reached out to Amazon, the reason I thought working for Amazon, having Twitch being a part of Amazon, would be a great idea for us (because) they would give us the resources to pursue these things that we honestly already want to pursue and they'd let us do it faster,"" Shear said. Ethan Kurzweil, a partner at Bessemer Ventures, which has backed Twitch since its earliest days, said Amazon's expertise in developer platforms through Amazon Web Services gave it a window into Twitch's potential growth.""They understand the power of engaged developer platforms,"" he said, noting Twitch's popularity with game developers and publishers was as important as its popularity with consumers.Bessemer provided Twitch an introduction to Frank Quattrone, a banker at boutique investment bank Qatalyst Partners, with a view to ""catalyzing interest in Twitch,"" Kurzweil said.Quattrone advised Amazon on its 1997 initial public offering. Twitch raised $20 million in funding last September from game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software and firms such as Bessemer Venture Partners and Thrive Capital.Other venture backers include Alsop Louie Partners and Draper Associates.More than 55 million unique visitors viewed more than 15 billion minutes of content on Twitch in July.Some video game live casters on Twitch have embedded links to the Amazon's online store. Analysts said the deal may result in more product tie-ins and a deeper integration with Amazon Instant Video and Amazon devices like the Kindle Fire tablet and recently launched Fire TV set-top box.Twitch and Amazon did not disclose details on new retail opportunities for Amazon through Twitch's network of gamers.""We have lots of ideas we've discussed, there's a lot of interest and a number of things we can pursue,"" Michael Frazzini, VP of Amazon Games, said in an interview.

""Google is also supporting us ... Probably this gives us a very very big leap."" Karbonn currently gets 5-7 percent of its revenue from exports largely to South Asian markets such as Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.Google said in June it was working with three Indian manufacturers to develop a sub-$100 smartphone for the Indian market this fall, getting Android software into the world's third-largest and fastest-growing mobile markets.  As prices fall, manufacturers see huge opportunities for growth as most buyers in India use feature phones and first-time buyers often opt for sub-$200 smartphones.Apart from Karbonn, Google is partnering Micromax Informatics Ltd and Spice Group.Karbonn's Android phones retail between 2,699 rupees and 14,990 rupees.""A new entry level price point is being breached by the Indian home grown vendors every quarter ...,"" research firm International Data Corp said in August.  ""This ultra low-cost segment may not sound a viable option to the repeat buyers, but it works well on the targeted segment.""  Sales of smartphones grew 84 percent in India in the second quarter of this year, according to IDC.Smartphone users in India are expected to grow six times to 385 million by 2017 from 2014, according to a recent study by Google and A.T. Kearney. (bit.ly/1t6sTuJ)Karbonn is also scouting for locations in Indian states with ports such as Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh to build a factory to ramp up production. The company, which ranks behind Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Micromax in India's highly competitive smartphone market, currently sources its phones from China, Taiwan and Korea.Karbonn shrugged off competition from the entry of China's Xiaomi Inc into the Indian market in partnership with local online retail giant Flipkart.""We know the Indian market very well ... my main forte has always been distribution,"" Hasija said.""So for all these (China) guys to come and learn the whole distribution … especially going to tier 2 and 3 cities will take some time.""

332,"  * War with Hamas weighing on consumers, industry, tourism* Bank of Israel has cut interest rates twice; at record low* Budget deficit target set to be missed* Economists see growth potential dropping to around 3 pctBy Steven ScheerJERUSALEM, Aug 26 For more than a decade, Israel's high-tech-fuelled economy has weathered the global financial crisis and several military conflicts with little impact on growth or the free flow of foreign investment.But its strong run, which led former finance minister Yuval Steinitz to coin its justifiably upbeat tag as the 'Best in the West', may be coming to an abrupt end, with the era of sustainable high growth rates consigned to history.The war against Hamas in Gaza, which ran into a 50th day on Tuesday, has taken a heavy toll, hitting tourism, slowing consumer spending as people stay indoors and denting manufacturing, especially in plants close to Gaza.Even before the conflict began on July 8, growth was weakening. A preliminary estimate showed the economy grew an annualised 1.7 percent in the second quarter, down from 2.8 percent in the first, while unemployment inched above 6 percent from 5.7 percent in late 2013.With a concerned central bank expecting the war to knock around half a percentage point off output, forecasts for growth of around 3 percent this year now look wildly optimistic, and the budget deficit is likely to exceed its 3 percent target.After a decade of growth of 3-5 percent a year - during which Israel's economy has nearly tripled in nominal terms to $300 billion - some are even predicting a complete reversal.""We might have a recession,"" said veteran Israeli economist Ayelet Nir, although she adds it wouldn't be a deep one.Prospects of a sharp downturn, coupled with near zero inflation, prompted a second surprise interest rate cut in the past month on Monday, when the Bank of Israel trimmed its benchmark rate to an all-time low of 0.25 percent. ""We are definitely in a slowdown in activity,"" said central bank governor Karnit Flug.Economists point out that the economy - 40 percent dependent on exports, mostly high-tech goods and software - is still looking solid compared with much of Europe and the West.But like most developed economies, Israel is becoming more services-oriented, which means growth depends on its major trading partners buying its high-value services.With the largest, Europe and the United States, both struggling and the shekel currency strong, Israel has to work even harder to be competitive and grow its exports.Add to that war-weary consumers who are growing fed up with the high cost of living -- even if inflation is stable -- and the days of Israel posting up to 5 percent growth may be over.""Our growth potential is not as high as before,"" said Nir, who projects long-run output of around 3 percent. ""The population growth is not as high as in the past, investment is not as high as in the past, productivity is very low ... and Israel is transitioning from manufacturing to services,"" she said. ""It is happening very fast.""SQUEEZED ON ALL SIDES Mai Doan, an emerging markets economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said many of Israel's problems stem from the fact that the world has changed: Global trade has slowed, while fiscal restraint has weighed on growth, especially in Europe.""Israel is a developed country so we are not talking high single digits (anymore). So 2-1/2 or 3 percent is a decent rate of growth,"" she said.Once the Gaza conflict ends, the next problem Israel faces is the 2015 budget and the risk of missing fiscal targets. Finance Minister Yair Lapid has said the 3 percent deficit goal for 2014 will likely be breached. A 2015 target of 2.5 percent of GDP is also in jeopardy due to a likely jump in the defence budget. At the same time, Lapid had promised not to raise taxes or limit social spending.""There is some room for manoeuvre but not much,"" Nir said. ""It can be 3 to 3.5 percent but not 5-6 percent again.""One perennial bright spot for Israel has been more than $10 billion a year in foreign direct investment as global companies such as Apple and Google snap up Israeli tech firms. In 2013, Israel was ranked fourth among the OECD -- a club for rich countries -- for foreign direct investment.The country has also seen heavy investments in developing its natural gas sector, although investment in residential building and industries has declined over the past year.Nir fears that the current round of fighting could dent inflows as companies take a wait-and-see approach.Such flows have also been an Achilles heel for Israel's economy, prompting the shekel to appreciate sharply and making exports relatively more expensive. As a result, the Bank of Israel has bought more than $55 billion of foreign currency since 2008 in a bid to weaken the shekel.It now stands at a nearly one-year low of 3.58 versus the dollar, after a 4.5 percent depreciation in the past month.But in historical terms it remains strong. Only a month ago, it stood at a three-year high of 3.40, having appreciated 20 percent since 2009.""What's hurting Israel now is the tradeable sector due to the strong shekel,"" Doan said.Analysts doubt the Bank of Israel will push its key rate to zero but if it does, the next step would be to buy bonds, following the pattern of 'quantitative easing' adopted in the United States.""There is a good chance that Israeli rates will stay low even when the United States starts to raise them,"" Nir said.

340,"  (Adds details from announcement, analyst comment)By Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO Aug 28 Google Inc   is developing airborne drones capable of flying on their own and delivering anything from candy to medicine, the Internet company said on Thursday.The effort, which Google calls Project Wing, marks the company's latest expansion beyond its Web-based origins and could help Google break into lucrative markets such as commerce and package delivery, ratcheting up the competition with Amazon.com Inc.Google, the world's largest Internet search engine, said it will take years of development to create a service with multiple vehicles flying multiple deliveries per day.An early version of the drone, which Google showcased in a video on its website, has a 1.5 meter-(yard-)wide wingspan and is capable of flying pre-programmed routes. ""These planes have much more in common with the Google self-driving car than the remote-controlled airplanes people fly in parks on weekends,"" Google said on its website, referring to the company's test fleet of automobiles that use sensors and radars to navigate city streets and freeways on their own.The drone Google showed in the video Thursday was equipped with rotors to allow for vertical takeoff and landing, as well as a fixed wing for plane-like flying. The drone flew about 40 meters above the treeline, Google said, and dropped a package of chocolate bars to a farmer in Queensland, Australia. Google spokesman Ray Gobberg said it was too soon to discuss specific business plans for the delivery drones, but the company said on its website that self-flying vehicles could offer a cheaper, faster and less wasteful way to move goods.Google rival Amazon.com Inc announced plans last year to use aerial delivery drones for a service called ""Prime Air.""""Local delivery of products is the next battlefront,"" said Sameet Sinha, an analyst with B. Riley & Co. ""Google has had its eyes on e-commerce, basically trying to get around Amazon."" Google has partnered with local retailers in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York for its Shopping Express service, which allows consumers to order goods online and have them delivered to their doorstep on the same day.While Google has been quietly developing its aerial drone project since late 2011, the company will now focus on teaching the vehicles to safely navigate around each other, to reduce the noise of the vehicles and to refine the delivery capability such that a package can be delivered to a spot the size of a doorstep.Google's Gobberg said the company has briefed the Federal Aviation Administration on the project and has been updating the agency. Gobberg said Google has done some ""small scale research flights"" in the United States but hoped to talk more with the agency to determine specific locations for testing.In 2012, Congress required the FAA to establish a road map for the broader use of drones. The FAA has allowed limited use of drones in the United States for surveillance, law enforcement, atmospheric research and other applications.

AbbVie and Calico said on Wednesday the initial funding would help Calico use its scientific expertise to create research facilities in the San Francisco Bay area. Each partner could ultimately invest an additional $500 million in the collaboration.""Calico expects to begin filling critical positions immediately and plans to establish a substantial team of scientists and research staff in the San Francisco Bay area,"" the companies said in a joint release. A year ago Google announced it was creating Calico, to be headed by Art Levinson, the former chief executive officer and guiding force behind Genentech, a cancer company considered by many to be the most successful biotechnology company in history. Levinson left after Genentech was bought by Roche Holding AG ROG.VX.Calico is run separately from Google, the world's largest Internet search company, and focuses on such issues as life-threatening diseases and problems affecting mental and physical agility due to aging.Google increasingly is placing itself at the intersection of medical science and technology. It also backs privately held 23andMe, which sells a $99 DNA test that provides customers ancestry-related genetic reports and uninterpreted raw genetic data. AbbVie said it was the first drugmaker to forge a collaboration with Calico. Under the deal, AbbVie will provide scientific and clinical development support and commercial expertise.The partners will share costs equally, and profits, if drugs are successfully developed.Calico will be responsible for discovering drugs and studying them in early stage trials during the first five years. It will continue for a 10-year period to advance its experimental drugs through Phase 2a studies, small mid-stage trials that establish a likelihood the drugs may work in larger studies.Under the deal, AbbVie will back Calico's early research and, following completion of Phase 2a studies, will have the option to manage late-stage trials and marketing. AbbVie was spun off in early 2013 from Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N), and sells Humira, a $13 billion-a-year treatment for rheumatoid arthritis which is the world's top-selling  medicine.Humira accounts for 60 percent of AbbVie sales, and the suburban Chicago company needs new drugs to lessen its heavy reliance on the product. It is developing drugs for arthritis, hepatitis C, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AbbVie in July agreed to pay $55 billion for Dublin-based Shire Plc (SHP.L), moving it into the lucrative arena of rare diseases, in a deal that will allow it to slash its tax bill by relocating to Britain.

347,"  * Android One set to boost low-end smartphone demand* Samsung rapidly losing share in India, China* Android One threatens much pricing pressure for Samsung* Samsung likely to reexamine lower-end strategy - analystsBy Nivedita BhattacharjeeMUMBAI, Sept 3 Google Inc's  partnership with three Indian phone makers is set to rev up fast-growing demand for lower priced smartphones, and spell more trouble for Samsung Electronics which is rapidly losing share in emerging markets.Micromax Infomatics Ltd, Karbonn Mobiles and Spice Group are the first phone manufacturers to sign up for Google's Android One initiative, which provides specifications for key hardware parts. Some of the new phones are due to hit the market this month.The aim is a vast improvement in quality that would lead to a surge in demand for low-end Android phones. Currently many cheap emerging market smartphones run different and somewhat customised versions of the Android operating system, which along with the many variations in hardware make apps on those phones prone to glitches.While Google plans to push Android One globally, India, the world's third-biggest and fastest growing smartphone market, offers fertile ground for immediate results. Many Indians are buying a smartphone for the first time and a strong reception for Android One could promote common standards and consolidation in a market where more than 80 smartphone companies operate.But any boom for higher-quality low-cost smartphones in India and other price conscious markets has the potential to exert intense pricing pressure on Samsung. The South Korean firm uses a customised version of the Android operating system but focuses on higher-margin offerings like its Galaxy S series.""A major threat for Samsung is that Android One will accelerate the race to the bottom on smartphone pricing,"" said Neil Mawston, a UK-based analyst at Strategy Analytics.""Android One now makes Google a foe, not just a friend, for Samsung."" A major strategy rethink for low to mid-tier products is now in order for the world's biggest phone maker and top seller in India, analysts say, particularly as Samsung is also losing share to Apple Inc at the higher-end.GAINS FOR GOOGLE For Google, a strong uptake of Android One smartphones should increase access to the Internet and Google's suite of products.Analysts and industry sources also note the potential for Google to expand revenue in ways more favorable to itself than in the past, as Android One phones won't come with the heavy customisation that Samsung and other phone makers using the Android operating system provide. That will mean more default settings for Google products and less competition from rival search engines and other app stores.For the Indian phone manufacturers, they are banking on  Android One to be the weapon that helps them grab further share  as well as providing a launch pad for more exports.Karbonn hopes the programme will expand its overseas revenue to near 20 percent in the next two years, from 5-7 percent now. It is looking to export to markets such as Europe, South Africa and Russia, Chairman Sudhir Hasija told Reuters.PRICING PRESSURE Samsung still leads India's smartphone market - a segment expected to propel the country's annual cellphone shipment revenues to as much as $20 billion by 2017, up from more than $14 billion this year, according to Counterpoint Research. But its grip is looking shakier. Its second-quarter smartphone market share tumbled to 25.3 percent from 33.3 percent in the first quarter, while No. 2 maker Micromax jumped to 19.1 percent from 16.7 percent. Karbonn has 5.9 percent.How much immediate pressure Samsung will come under will depend on prices.Announcing Android One phones in June, Google touted pricing under $100 (6,000 rupees) but local media, citing industry sources, have said that may be too ambitious and the phones could be priced between 7,000 and 10,000 rupees.Karbonn, Micromax and Google declined to comment on the reports. Spice did not respond to a request for comment.While Samsung does sell cheaply priced phones in India, its marketing is focused on high-end products around 40,000 rupees. One of its most popular models sells for about 20,500 rupees. Samsung declined to provide its average selling price for smartphones in India.Competition is coming not only from local players using Android One. Mozilla announced this month a low-cost smartphone in India based on its Firefox operating system and priced at just $33.How Samsung responds to Android One in India is set to have big ramifications for other markets.In China too, for example, Samsung has rapidly lost share, falling to rank No. 2 in the second quarter behind Xiaomi Inc, a firm which did not even place in the top five in the same period a year ago.One key factor for Samsung to consider is whether it could and should adopt Android One for its cheaper phones.""Samsung needs to figure out whether it's going to stay in (the) market at the lower end and come lower or whether it's going to maybe focus on higher level segments,"" said Rachel Lashford, a Singapore-based analyst at tech research firm Canalys.Samsung declined to comment on its strategy in India and other emerging markets. It said in a July earnings call it plans to revamp its mid-to-low-tier line-up with more aggressive  pricing and a focus on a smaller set of products.

350,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Google's (GOOGL.O) antitrust deal with EU regulators was criticized by Microsoft (MSFT.O) and other competitors in a last-ditch attempt to influence European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia before he leaves office at the end of October.The Competition Commissioner is preparing to decide whether to wrap up the case or hand it over to his successor when his mandate ends, after spending three years examining whether Google squeezes out rival services in online search results.          Almunia reached a preliminary deal with the world's most popular Internet search engine in February. He has told 18 complainants that he intends to rebuff their grievances and is now examining their responses.Microsoft's director of competition law, Jean-Yves Art, said the U.S. software company was particularly concerned about Google's contractual curbs on advertisers making it difficult for them to switch to other online platforms.  ""The proposals don't cure or eliminate all restrictions that we and rivals see. There are still restrictions preventing them from providing interoperability,"" he said at a news conference organized by a host of Google complainants.The head of British price-comparison site Foundem, Shivaun Raff, said the Commission had no evidence that Google's offer to let three rivals display their logos and web links in a box and allow content providers to decide what material Google can use for its own services would resolve competition issues.  ""(Google's proposals) are not a remedy.

Almunia reached a preliminary deal with the world's most popular Internet search engine in February. He has told 18 complainants that he intends to rebuff their grievances and is now examining their responses. Microsoft's director of competition law, Jean-Yves Art, said the U.S. software company was particularly concerned about Google's contractual curbs on advertisers making it difficult for them to switch to other online platforms.""The proposals don't cure or eliminate all restrictions that we and rivals see.

352,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Google Inc has agreed to refund at least $19 million to parents who were unfairly billed for charges racked up by children playing video games such as Ice Age Village and Air Penguins on smartphones and tablets.Children sometimes put hundreds of dollars on their parents' credit cards without permission and thousands of complaints were made, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday in announcing the settlement. The agreement was similar to a $32.5 million settlement reached with Apple Inc in January.The FTC said Google had also agreed to change its billing practices to ensure that parents know, and agree to, purchases that their children make.Google said that it implemented changes in March 2014 that made it clearer when real - as opposed to virtual - money was being spent. And it said that it allowed consumers to choose whether they wanted to be prompted to enter a password with each purchase, as a way to head off unauthorized charges by children.""We're glad to put this matter behind us so we can focus on creating more ways for people to enjoy all the entertainment they love,"" said a Google spokeswoman. In the Apple settlement, it agreed to refund to customers at least $32.5 million in unauthorized charges made by children and to change its billing practices to require consent from parents for in-app spending. The commission sued Amazon.com in July on the same issue. The FTC has alleged that the companies were too lax in allowing children playing some app games to ring up charges on their parents' credit cards to buy pricey digital goods. In the game Air Penguins, for example, children can buy virtual fish costing $49.99 to feed virtual penguins living on virtual melting ice caps.""Children could rack up charges just by tapping on pop-up boxes,"" said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, adding that Google's staff pointed to what they called ""family fraud"" or ""friendly fraud"" as a leading source of refund requests.Google first began offering in-app charges, as the virtual purchases are known, in 2011 without requiring any password or taking other steps to ensure that the parent approved of the child's charges, the FTC said. In 2012, Google began asking for the credit card holder's password before allowing the purchase. But, granting permission for one purchase would open a 30-minute window where children could make purchases without re-entering a password, the FTC said.Initially, Google urged unhappy parents to take up the issue with the app developer, the FTC said.Google shares were about 1 percent higher in afternoon trading on Thursday.

359,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Four technology companies including Apple and Google blasted a U.S. judge for rejecting a proposed $324.5 million settlement over hiring practices in Silicon Valley and asked an appeals court to intervene, according to a court filing.Plaintiff workers accused Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe in a 2011 lawsuit of conspiring to avoid poaching each other's employees. Last month U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, rejected the proposed class action settlement, saying the amount was too low.In a court filing late on Thursday, the companies asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overrule Koh's decision.Koh ""committed clear legal error"" and ""impermissibly substituted the court's assessment of the value of the case for that of the parties who have been litigating the case for more than three years,"" they wrote.Adobe declined to comment, as did an attorney for the plaintiffs. Representatives for the other three firms could not immediately be reached for comment. Tech employees alleged that the conspiracy limited their job mobility and, as a result, kept a lid on salaries. The case has been closely watched because of the possibility of big damages being awarded and for the opportunity of a glimpse into the world of some of America's elite tech firms. Plaintiffs based their allegations of conspiracy largely on emails circulated among Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt, and some of their rivals.Plaintiff attorneys argued Koh should approve the deal because the workers faced the risk of losing the case in an appeal.  In rejecting the proposed settlement, Koh cited ""substantial and compelling evidence"" that Jobs ""was a, if not the, central figure in the alleged conspiracy."" Koh repeatedly referred to a related settlement last year involving Disney and Intuit.

To match the earlier settlement, the latest deal ""would need to total at least $380 million,"" Koh wrote. In the filing on Thursday, Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe said Koh's approach was ""rigid and formulaic.""Instead of approving the deal, Koh ""dismissed the parties' analysis of the trial risks, suggesting that, unless the settlement was larger, the court had — in its own words — 'wasted years on this case.'""A hearing before Koh is scheduled for Sept. 10.

362,"   By Leila Abboud | PARIS  PARIS A panel appointed by search engine Google will hold the first of a series of meetings on Tuesday to debate the balance between privacy and the free flow of information after a May court ruling reinforced Europeans' ""right to be forgotten"".The event in Madrid will be the first of seven meetings in European capitals, as the Internet giant struggles with thousands of requests a month to remove from its search results everything from serious criminal records, embarrassing photos, instances of online bullying and negative press stories.By mid-July, Google, which holds more than 80 percent of Europe's search market, said it had received more than 90,000 requests and accepted more than half since the European Union's top court ruled they must remove results if the information was ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"".Meanwhile data protection regulators from European countries, which are next set to meet on Sept. 15, are working on guidelines for the search engines, which also include Microsoft and Yahoo!, to ensure that requests are handled consistently. Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads France's privacy watchdog and the WP29 group of EU national data protection authorities, said on Friday she was sceptical about the Google initiative, which she described as part of a ""PR war"" on an issue that was important to the company's business strategy.""Google is trying to set the terms of the debate,"" she said. ""They want to be seen as being open and virtuous, but they handpicked the members of the council, will control who is in the audience, and what comes out of the meetings.""If a search engine declines a person's request, he or she has the right to appeal to the national data protection regulator. Some 90 such appeals have been filed in Britain, 70 in Spain, 20 in France and 13 in Ireland.Some examples of link removals have become public because Google notified media outlets such as the BBC and Guardian when their stories were removed from search results. That prompted critics to charge that Europe's Internet was being scrubbed and the press censored. SPIRIT OF THE RULING  The Wikimedia Foundation, which operates online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, set up a web page to post all the link removal notices it has received, as a form of protest that attracts attention to the very information someone wanted removed. Regulators have said that such notifications undermine the spirit of the court ruling on online privacy, and are considering whether they should try and curb them. The issue of notifications is one of the many that Google asked the advisory panel to consider, said Sylvie Kauffmann, one of its members and the editorial director of France's Le Monde newspaper.""There are a seemingly infinite variety of cases coming in, so Google is struggling to apply the court decision,"" said Kauffmann in an interview.""Google has asked us to formulate ideas to help them, and there is of course a public relations dimension to the exercise as well.""Kauffman added that Google would not pay panel members, beyond covering their travel expenses, and that the company had assured them they would have total independence. Google asked French regulator Falque-Pierrotin via letter whether she or other regulators would take part in the meetings, but she declined, saying it would be inappropriate for a regulator with enforcement powers. She said some national regulators could send staff members to observe the proceedings.A spokesperson for the Spanish regulator said it had no plans to attend the Madrid meeting.The advisory council includes eight representatives from outside Google, including a former German justice minister and two academics, as well as Google's general counsel David Drummond and chairman Eric Schmidt.Other members include Jimmy Wales, the Wikipedia founder and vocal critic of the ""right to be forgotten"", United Nations human rights official Frank La Rue, and Jose-Luis Pinar, who headed Spain's data protection regulator from 2002 to 2007.After Madrid the council will meet in Rome on Wednesday, Paris on Sept. 25, Warsaw on Sept. 30, Berlin on Oct. 14, and London on Oct. 16, before concluding in Brussels on Nov. 4.Google said it would stream the sessions online.

363,"   By Ben Klayman | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) Executive Chairman Bill Ford said new technologies that allow cars to talk to each other and drive themselves may scare some people, so the industry will need to allow consumers to opt out of such features. ""A lot of this really cool technology ... kind of freaks some people out,"" he said on Monday at an ""intelligent transportation"" conference here. ""Some people hear 'autonomous driving,' and say 'Oh my God, I never want to get into that vehicle,'"" he added, referring to  self-driving technology. ""Other people say, 'I don’t want my car talking to other cars. That's terrible.' We have to do this thoughtfully.""Ford said privacy issues will be important as connected and self-driving vehicles are developed to reduce traffic deaths and congestion. ""We believe, at Ford, that opting in is important so people do have that comfort.”Automakers are racing to develop such features as cars that apply brakes automatically when they sense an impending collision or slow down because a vehicle ahead on the highway has warned that traffic has stopped. In addition, Internet search company Google Inc (GOOGL.O) is developing the technology for a completely driverless car.  General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Sunday that it will introduce a car in 2016 that communicates with other vehicles and will also introduce a vehicle that incorporates semi-automated hands-free driving technology. Bill Ford told the audience he saw an accident on Sunday in which a man who was texting while driving hit a tree. Some features will help avoid that situation, but most automakers have said a vehicle like Google's driverless car remains far off in the future. ""Right now, you have to have eyes on the road, hands on the wheel and it’s going to be that way for a while,"" Ford said. ""Even as we start putting in a lot of these features that will assist you, the driver still has to be vigilant and in control.""When the industry evolves to the point where Google's planned technology is feasible, it will not seem a big deal because these new features will have been added gradually over time, he said.But the technologies are coming as world population grows and more people move to cities, Ford said. ""You cannot shove two cars in every garage in Mumbai. In fact, it’s preposterous."" The ultimate vision is all forms of transportation on a single network communicating with each other, he said. The industry has to collaborate to make it work, however, as you cannot have Ford vehicles talking only with other Fords.He also said he thinks electric-powered cars are ""probably the way to go,” but an over-reliance on coal-fired plants to power pure electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles is not the ideal solution.

365,"  * Asks panel of experts to debate ""right to be forgotten""* EU court allows people to ask for links to be removed* Meetings set in seven cities starting with Madrid* Regulators working on guidelines for web companiesBy Leila AbboudPARIS, Sept 8 A panel appointed by search engine Google will hold the first of a series of meetings on Tuesday to debate the balance between privacy and the free flow of information after a May court ruling reinforced Europeans' ""right to be forgotten"".The event in Madrid will be the first of seven meetings in European capitals, as the Internet giant struggles with thousands of requests a month to remove from its search results everything from serious criminal records, embarrassing photos, instances of online bullying and negative press stories.By mid-July, Google, which holds more than 80 percent of Europe's search market, said it had received more than 90,000 requests and accepted more than half since the European Union's top court ruled they must remove results if the information was ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"".Meanwhile data protection regulators from European countries, which are next set to meet on Sept. 15, are working on guidelines for the search engines, which also include Microsoft and Yahoo!, to ensure that requests are handled consistently.Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads France's privacy watchdog and the WP29 group of EU national data protection authorities, said on Friday she was sceptical about the Google initiative, which she described as part of a ""PR war"" on an issue that was important to the company's business strategy. ""Google is trying to set the terms of the debate,"" she said. ""They want to be seen as being open and virtuous, but they handpicked the members of the council, will control who is in the audience, and what comes out of the meetings.""If a search engine declines a person's request, he or she has the right to appeal to the national data protection regulator. Some 90 such appeals have been filed in Britain, 70 in Spain, 20 in France and 13 in Ireland.Some examples of link removals have become public because Google notified media outlets such as the BBC and Guardian when their stories were removed from search results. That prompted critics to charge that Europe's Internet was being scrubbed and the press censored. SPIRIT OF THE RULING The Wikimedia Foundation, which operates online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, set up a web page to post all the link removal notices it has received, as a form of protest that attracts attention to the very information someone wanted removed.Regulators have said that such notifications undermine the spirit of the court ruling on online privacy, and are considering whether they should try and curb them.The issue of notifications is one of the many that Google asked the advisory panel to consider, said Sylvie Kauffmann, one of its members and the editorial director of France's Le Monde newspaper.""There are a seemingly infinite variety of cases coming in, so Google is struggling to apply the court decision,"" said Kauffmann in an interview. ""Google has asked us to formulate ideas to help them, and there is of course a public relations dimension to the exercise as well.""Kauffman added that Google would not pay panel members, beyond covering their travel expenses, and that the company had assured them they would have total independence.Google asked French regulator Falque-Pierrotin via letter whether she or other regulators would take part in the meetings, but she declined, saying it would be inappropriate for a regulator with enforcement powers. She said some national regulators could send staff members to observe the proceedings.A spokesperson for the Spanish regulator said it had no plans to attend the Madrid meeting.The advisory council includes eight representatives from outside Google, including a former German justice minister and two academics, as well as Google's general counsel David Drummond and chairman Eric Schmidt.Other members include Jimmy Wales, the Wikipedia founder and vocal critic of the ""right to be forgotten"", United Nations human rights official Frank La Rue, and Jose-Luis Pinar, who headed Spain's data protection regulator from 2002 to 2007.After Madrid the council will meet in Rome on Wednesday, Paris on Sept. 25, Warsaw on Sept. 30, Berlin on Oct. 14, and London on Oct. 16, before concluding in Brussels on Nov. 4.Google said it would stream the sessions online.

369,"   By Andrew Chung  A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived part of a patent lawsuit brought by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen against AOL, Apple, Google and Yahoo, saying a lower court incorrectly found that the tech companies didn't infringe one of its patents. The patent, held by Allen's Interval Licensing, relates to the ubiquitous pop-ups that computer users routinely see while surfing the Web or shopping online.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said that Chief Judge Marsha Pechman of the federal district court in Seattle had made an ""erroneous"" interpretation of the patent in 2013 and it sent the case back to her for further hearings.At the same time, Circuit Judge Raymond Chen agreed with Pechman for invalidating certain claims made over the same Interval patent, and a second one, declaring them too ambiguous.  Interval Licensing is the patent-licensing arm of a Silicon Valley research entity that Allen financed, Interval Research Corp, which shut down in 2000. Interval Licensing sued the tech companies in 2010 for allegedly infringing four of its patents, although only two became the subject of the appeal. It said they infringed the patents through products and software that use pop-up notifications, court documents said. Attorneys for Interval could not immediately be reached for comment. Nor could attorneys for the defendants.  Allen and partner David Liddle founded Interval Research in 1992. It employed over 110 scientists and engineers and was granted 300 patents during its existence, according to court documents. The case is Interval Licensing v.

Her biggest case could be an ongoing probe into charges that Google may be squeezing out rivals in Internet search results which she may have to take on if outgoing commissioner Joaquin Almunia fails to resolve the case before he leaves next month.She will also have to decide if Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands provide an unfair advantage to companies such as Apple, Starbucks and Fiat with tax rulings which help them cut their tax bills.TELECOMS  German conservative and current EU energy czar Guenther Oettinger takes on a job of vital importance to Germany. Despite her efforts in the last five years, current telecoms chief Neelie Kroes has not been able to create a bloc-wide telecoms market.Telecoms operators such as Deutsche Telekom say this is necessary to spur investment in fast speed Internet, encourage e-commerce and create jobs.Oettinger will have to tackle the net neutrality issue which pits the telecoms industry against U.S. tech giants over the right to prioritise some Internet traffic over others. Critics fear companies with deep pockets may benefit.Privacy is another hot issue. Oettinger, who has to face down Gazprom in his current role, will need to strike a balance between privacy and the free flow of information. Some see it as a battle between U.S. companies such as Google and Facebook  and Europe. These new appointments are part of incoming European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's team for the next five years.Analysts said the two new faces could be more sympathetic towards Europe's former telecoms monopolies who have criticised Almunia for his tough line towards mergers in the sector though all were cleared with relatively soft concessions.""Oettinger seems a strong pro-incumbent appointment, in our view, due to his party affiliation (the German CDU has been quite supportive of Deutsche Telekom positions in recent years, and we believe (German chancellor) Angela Merkel is supportive of Juncker's overall digital agenda),"" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note to clients.""Denmark seems a fairly pro-competitive market to us, and this also characterises the telecoms market.""Telecoms lobbying group ETNO said the new policymakers should take a broader view of issues under their charge.""We believe it is time for a new approach: more growth-enhancing policies and less traditional regulation to benefit both European citizens and businesses,"" ETNO head Luigi Gambardella said.The creation of a single telecoms market is seen as key for increasing the competitiveness of European telecoms operators - hit by years of falling revenues - with their U.S. counterparts.

In 2012, the commissioner's office ordered Facebook to overhaul privacy protection for its users abroad following a probe. Dixon replaces the retired Billy Hawkes who has served as commissioner since 2005, when Facebook was still only available in a small number of universities.

393,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON New international tax rules proposed on Tuesday could eliminate structures that have allowed companies such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to shave billions of dollars off their tax bills.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced a series of measures that, if implemented by members, could stop companies from employing many commonly-used practices to shift profits into tax havens.Corporate tax avoidance has become a hot political topic following media coverage and parliamentary investigations into the arrangements many big companies use to cut tax bills.Amazon and Google say they pay all the taxes they should. Analysts say competitive pressures force companies to seek to minimize all costs, including tax.Last year, the Group of 20 leading economies asked the OECD to develop an action plan to tackle the problem.Big U.S. technology companies could be those most affected by the OECD's plans but others could also be hit, including pharmaceuticals and branded consumer goods firms, as well as many European companies.Chris Morgan, Head of Tax Policy at accountants KPMG in London, said the proposals were ""balanced"" and while some firms would pay more tax, big business accepted the need for change.Anti-poverty charity ActionAid criticized the plans saying some of the measures envisaged would be too expensive for developing countries to implement.The draft proposals announced have been agreed by all G20 members and OECD members, which include most major industrialized countries, the OECD said in a statement.But the measures form part of a larger ""(tax) base erosion and profit shifting"" program that will conclude next year. Only then will countries look at enshrining the results of the program in law.TREATY MISUSE  For more than 50 years, the OECD’s work on international taxation has been focused on ensuring companies are not taxed twice on the same profits. The fear was that this would hamper trade and limit global growth.Over the years, the OECD has formulated a standardized model tax treaty which allows countries to split taxation rights and avoid double taxation, partly by providing reliefs from measures intended to stop tax avoidance, such as withholding taxes.But companies have been using such treaties to ensure profits are not taxed anywhere.For example, search giant Google takes advantage of tax treaties to channel more than $8 billion in untaxed profits out of Europe and Asia each year and into a subsidiary that is tax resident in Bermuda, which has no income tax.Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt has said changes to rules that increase its tax bill would hit innovation.The OECD's proposals would make amendments to its model treaty so that cross-border transactions would not benefit from the reliefs in tax treaties, if a principal reason for engaging in the transactions was to avoid tax.""We are putting an end to double non-taxation,"" OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans said in a call with reporters. The think tank, which also advises members on economic policy, also wants curbs on how much profit companies can report in centralized intra-company lending and purchasing arms, which are often based in tax havens.Where such subsidiaries generate large profits on the back of intra-company trade, the OECD said the profits should be shared across the group.This could hit UK telecoms provider Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), which has a Luxembourg subsidiary that buys telephone equipment for the group. Vodafone Procurement Company's 200 staff generated profits of more than 400 million euros ($518.5 million) last year, making it one of the group's smallest but most profitable divisions. An unusual Luxembourg tax rule allowed the subsidiary to pay no tax on that profit.Vodafone said businesses across Europe already benefited from savings achieved by the Luxembourg operation and that it did not expect a significant impact on its business from the OECD measures.     TAX RESIDENCE The OECD has also proposed changes in the rules on tax residence that allow U.S. tech giants to generate billions of dollars in sales in many countries but not have those revenues assessed for tax by those countries' tax authorities.A long-standing rule that allows a company to operate a warehouse in a country without creating a tax residence there should be reconsidered, the OECD said.This would potentially hit Internet retailer Amazon as the warehouse exclusion allowed Amazon to channel 15 billion euros last year in European sales to a subsidiary in Luxembourg, where it can build up profits tax free.A raft of companies which sell online including Apple Inc's iTunes service, software provider Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE.O) and e-commerce group eBay Inc. (EBAY.O) could also be forced to report revenues in the countries where they are generated, if the OECD's proposal that having a ""significant digital presence"" in a country would also create a tax residence.A Reuters investigation last year found that three quarters of the 50 biggest U.S. technology companies channeled revenues from European sales into low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Switzerland, rather than reporting them nationally.The companies all say they comply with tax rules in all the countries where they operate.     Anton Hume, Global Head of Transfer Pricing at accountants BDO, said the measures could prompt companies to change their structures and move jobs out of tax havens: ""It may mean that a lot of activities are onshored again.""However, Ireland's jobs and enterprise minister, Richard Bruton, said his country would not lose out.""As countries move away from other tax haven situations, a good country with a very clear, certain, regime like Ireland can stand to gain,"" he said.

399,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS European regulators have agreed on criteria for judging appeals for the ""right to be forgotten"", taking into account public profiles or crime for example, when search engines such as Google turn down requests to have information deleted from search results.But regulators made no mention of two thorny issues: whether search engines ought to inform publishers when articles have been delisted from search results, and whether links ought to be removed from all versions of Google, such as Google.com.The working group of EU data protection authorities aims to bring some clarity to implementing a landmark court decision in May that gave Europeans the right for the first time to ask search engines to erase information about them from the web.The guidelines, which are expected to be finalised by the end of November, will set out categories for organizing the types of appeals coming in from citizens and create a common record of decisions taken by regulators.This will help regulators determine whether the information should remain accessible under the individual's name by asking them to weigh factors such as the public role of the person, whether the information relates to a crime and how old it is.""We want the toolbox to guide difficult decisions on how to balance the individual's right to privacy in the Internet age against the public interest,"" Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads France's privacy watchdog and the WP29, said earlier this month.A contact person at each data protection authority will ensure that appeals people file are handled consistently across the EU's 28 member states, the statement from the Article 29 Working Party (WP29) said on Thursday. Regulators came up with a draft of the criteria at a two-day meeting in Brussels this week.Around 90 such appeals have been filed with privacy regulators in Britain, 70 in Spain, 20 in France and 13 in Ireland. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS The WP29 members also met with media companies on the sidelines of the meeting to gather their views on how to strike a balance between the freedom of information and privacy. In July they met with search engine companies Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. [ID:nL6N0PZ4VD]Google's decision to notify the media via email that their articles had been scrubbed from results prompted the BBC and The Guardian to write articles about the removals, condemning them as censorship aimed at whitewashing the past.""There might be single, outstanding cases where involving the publisher might be appropriate. But to do so systematically is undue,"" said Johannes Caspar, head of Hamburg's data protection body in Germany which has jurisdiction over Google. Google says it has received over 120,000 requests from across Europe to remove from its search results everything from serious criminal records, embarrassing photos and negative press stories.

400,"  * Privacy watchdogs agreed guidelines to handle appeals* Regulators seek ""toolbox"" to weigh privacy vs public interest* Regulators met with media companies this week   (Updates with details of press release)By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS, Sept 18 European regulators have agreed on criteria for judging appeals for the ""right to be forgotten"", taking into account public profiles or crime for example, when search engines such as Google turn down requests to have information deleted from search results.But regulators made no mention of two thorny issues: whether search engines ought to inform publishers when articles have been delisted from search results, and whether links ought to be removed from all versions of Google, such as Google.com.The working group of EU data protection authorities aims to bring some clarity to implementing a landmark court decision in May that gave Europeans the right for the first time to ask search engines to erase information about them from the web.The guidelines, which are expected to be finalised by the end of November, will set out categories for organising the types of appeals coming in from citizens and create a common record of decisions taken by regulators. This will help regulators determine whether the information should remain accessible under the individual's name by asking them to weigh factors such as the public role of the person, whether the information relates to a crime and how old it is.""We want the toolbox to guide difficult decisions on how to balance the individual's right to privacy in the Internet age against the public interest,"" Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads France's privacy watchdog and the WP29, said earlier this month.A contact person at each data protection authority will ensure that appeals people file are handled consistently across the EU's 28 member states, the statement from the Article 29 Working Party (WP29) said on Thursday.Regulators came up with a draft of the criteria at a two-day meeting in Brussels this week. Around 90 such appeals have been filed with privacy regulators in Britain, 70 in Spain, 20 in France and 13 in Ireland.UNANSWERED QUESTIONS  The WP29 members also met with media companies on the sidelines of the meeting to gather their views on how to strike a balance between the freedom of information and privacy. In July they met with search engine companies Google, Microsoft  and Yahoo.Google's decision to notify the media via email that their articles had been scrubbed from results prompted the BBC and The Guardian to write articles about the removals, condemning them as censorship aimed at whitewashing the past.""There might be single, outstanding cases where involving the publisher might be appropriate. But to do so systematically is undue,"" said Johannes Caspar, head of Hamburg's data protection body in Germany which has jurisdiction over Google.Google says it has received over 120,000 requests from across Europe to remove from its search results everything from serious criminal records, embarrassing photos and negative press stories.

401,"   By Alexei Oreskovic and Ross Kerber | SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON, Sept 18  SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON, Sept 18 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd'sIPO-BABA.N upcoming public offering will give Yahoo Inc billions of dollars for a potential shopping spree that investors hope will jumpstart its comeback.But with numerous holes to fill and soaring tech company valuations, Yahoo will have to make tough choices with any acquisitions.Yahoo is expected to sell about $9.5 billion in stock of the Chinese e-commerce company. After giving at least half back to investors and paying taxes, Yahoo's cash stockpile, currently $4.2 billion, may swell by $3.1 billion. That is not a lot in Silicon Valley these days.""They are not in a position to make huge acquisitions,"" said Jean Yu, assistant portfolio manager of the $2.8 billion ClearBridge Value Trust fund, which owns Yahoo shares. Yu expects the new proceeds to be used for deals around several hundred million dollars each.Yahoo's revenue growth has stalled in recent years as its once-hot Web portal and email service have lagged rivals. Key areas in need of repair include Yahoo's mobile offerings and an advertising system that doesn't deliver the precise targeting available from rivals like Google Inc and Facebook Inc , investors say. Yahoo is not one of the first three or four places that consumers go to on their mobile phone, said Bill Tai, partner emeritus at venture capital firm CRV.""All the momentum right now is shifting rapidly to mobile,"" said Tai. Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has more than doubled monthly mobile users to 450 million since taking the helm two years ago. She revamped the line-up of mobile apps by making small acquisitions that brought in teams of mobile engineers.That may be the path forward, too, since many of the best-known mobile properties are out of Yahoo's financial reach. Messaging service Snapchat, for instance, was recently valued at close to $10 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.Online review site Yelp Inc is a long-rumored Yahoo acquisition target that could help Yahoo expand into new ""transactional"" businesses, such as restaurant food deliveries from which Yahoo would receive fees. But with a $5.5 billion market cap, Yelp would represent a huge acquisition for Yahoo that might not go over well with investors. Yahoo was not immediately available for comment.Some argue that Yahoo could get more bang for its buck by focusing its acquisitions on advertising technology, a sector where prices are not as rich.Publicly-listed ad tech companies such as The Rubicon Project Inc, YuMe Inc and Tubemogul Inc  all have market values of roughly $400 million or less, while the privately-owned AppNexus was valued at $1.2 billion in its most recent funding round.Advertising also could deliver an immediate jolt of revenue, said Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser.

The first scientific study of driving while texting with Google Glass found that the hands-free eyewear is no safer to use on the road than a smartphone.“When you look at how fast people react to an unexpected traffic event – how fast they slam on their brakes, we didn’t find a statistically significant difference between Google Glass and smartphones,” said psychological researcher Ben Sawyer at the University of Central Florida.Google Glass users are able to send text messages using voice transcription technology as well as head commands.The Governors Highway Safety Association reports that 44 states ban texting while driving, which studies show doubles the risk of crashes or near-crashes.This year eight states have considered laws to also ban drivers from using Google Glass and other head-mounted computers or displays, according to LegiScan, a legislative data service. Sawyer said Google Glass proponents have claimed erroneously that the wearable device delivers information with less distraction because drivers’ eyes remain directed toward the road.“Looking does not necessarily mean you are seeing,” said Sawyer, because thought processes remain affected. Google, the California-based Internet services and products company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. About 40 people took part in the study, in which they texted about an arithmetic problem via Google Glass or a smartphone while driving in a simulator. In the process, the drivers were confronted with a car braking suddenly in front of them.After a near-collision in the simulator, Sawyer said the texters demonstrated different levels of confidence in their ability to safely text and drive. Smartphone users created more space than Google Glass users between their car and the car ahead. Sawyer said Google Glass offered one slight advantage: users recovered from the near-accident quicker, getting back up to speed on the road faster than smartphone users. Sawyer said that difference suggests future technological advances might be able to lessen distraction problems.That, he said, is critical for certain drivers whose safety can depend on information obtained on the road, including military and emergency personnel.“You can tell a teenager to stay off the phone when driving.

419,"  (Corrects ""private"" to ""privacy"" in paragraph 7)By Julia FiorettiBRUSSELS, Sept 25 European data privacy regulators on Thursday handed Google a package of guidelines to help it bring the way it collects and stores user data in line with EU law after six regulators opened investigations into the internet giant.The group of European data protection authorities, known as the Article 29 Working Party, sent Google a list of measures it could implement, such as spelling out clearly for what purposes it collects user data and what third party entities would also be able to collect people's information.Regulators in six European countries, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, have opened investigations into Google after it consolidated its 60 privacy policies into one and started combining data collected on individual users across its services, including YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps. It gave users no means to opt out.In January France's data protection authority, the CNIL, fined Google 150,000 euros ($191,100) for failing to bring its new privacy policy in line with local law. A spokesman for the company said Google was open to the regulators' feedback and looked forward to discussing the list of guidelines.""We have worked with the different data protection authorities across Europe to explain our privacy policy changes,"" said Al Verney. The fines for privacy breaches remain small in most countries when compared with the $12.2 billion net profit Google earned in 2013.Google has actively responded to a separate European court ruling that it must remove links from internet search results under a person's name if the information is inadequate or irrelevant.

422,"  (Adds bulletins from Amazon and Google in seventh paragraph)By Jim FinkleBOSTON, Sept 25 Hackers have begun exploiting the newly identified ""Shellshock"" computer bug, using fast-moving worm viruses to scan for vulnerable systems and then infect them, researchers warned on Thursday.""Shellshock"" is the first major Internet threat to emerge since the discovery in April of ""Heartbleed,"" which affected encryption software used in about two-thirds of all web servers, along with hundreds of technology products.The latest bug has been compared to ""Heartbleed"" partly because the software at the heart of the ""Shellshock"" bug, known as Bash, is also widely used in web servers and other types of computer equipment.According to security experts, ""Shellshock"" is unlikely to affect as many systems as ""Heartbleed"" because not all computers running Bash can be exploited. Still, they said the new bug has the potential to wreak more havoc because it enables hackers to gain complete control of an infected machine, which lets them destroy data, shut down networks or launch attacks on websites.The ""Heartbleed"" bug only allowed hackers to steal data.The industry is rushing to determine which systems can be remotely compromised by hackers, but there are currently no estimates on the number of vulnerable systems.Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc have released bulletins to advise web services customers how to protect themselves from the new cyber threat. A Google spokesman said the company is releasing software patches to fix the bug.""We don't actually know how widespread this is. This is probably one of the most difficult-to-measure bugs that has come along in years,"" said Dan Kaminsky, a well-known expert on Internet threats. For an attack to be successful, a targeted system must be accessible via the Internet and also running a second vulnerable set of code besides Bash, experts said.""There is a lot of speculation out there as to what is vulnerable, but we just don't have the answers,"" said Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust. ""This is going to unfold over the coming weeks and months.""ATTACKS ON DEVICES Joe Hancock, a cybersecurity expert with insurer AEGIS in London, said in a statement that he is concerned about the potential for attacks on home broadband routers and controllers used to manage critical infrastructure facilities. ""In some areas this will be a challenge to fix, as many embedded devices are not designed with regular updates in mind and will never be able to be patched,"" Hancock said.HD Moore, chief research officer with security software maker Rapid7, said it could take weeks or even months to determine what impact the bug will have.""At this point we don't know what we don't know, but we do expect to see additional exploit vectors surface as vendors and researchers start the assessment process for their products and services,"" Moore said in an email. ""We are likely to see compromises as a result of this issue for years to come.""Linux makers released patches to protect against attacks on Wednesday, though security researchers uncovered flaws in those updates, prompting No. 1 Linux maker Red Hat Inc to advise customers that the patch was ""incomplete."" ""That's a problem. It's been a little over 24 hours and we're still in the same boat,"" said Mat Gangwer, lead security consultant at Rook Security. ""People are kind of freaking out. Rightfully so.""WORMS Russian security software maker Kaspersky Lab reported that a computer worm has begun infecting computers by exploiting ""Shellshock.""The malicious software can take control of an infected machine, launch denial-of-service attacks to disrupt websites, and also scan for other vulnerable devices, including routers, said Kaspersky researcher David Jacoby.He said he did not know who was behind the attacks and could not name any victims.Jaime Blasco, labs director at AlienVault, said he had uncovered the same piece of malware, as well as a second worm seeking to exploit ""Shellshock,"" which was designed for launching denial of service attacks.""Heartbleed"" is a bug in an open-source encryption software called OpenSSL. The bug put the data of millions of people at risk, as OpenSSL is used in about two-thirds of all websites. It also forced dozens of technology companies to issue security patches for hundreds of products that use OpenSSL.(Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn and Devika Krishna Kumar in Bangalore; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2014-09-26,GOOGL,"Thu Sep 25, 2014 | 8:20pm EDT",UPDATE 3-Hackers exploit 'Shellshock' bug with worms in early attacks,http://www.reuters.com//article/cybersecurity-shellshock-idUSL2N0RQ21P20140926?type=companyNews

427,"   By Tracy Rucinski  and Byron Kaye | MADRID/SYDNEY  MADRID/SYDNEY (This version of the Sept. 28 story has been repeated with no changes in text)A year after Spain, the sunniest country in Europe, issued notice of a law forcing solar energy-equipped homes and offices to pay a punitive tax, architect Inaki Alonso re-installed a 250 watt solar panel on a beam over his Madrid roof terrace.""The government wanted people to be afraid to generate their own energy, but they haven’t dared to actually pass the law,"" Alonso said as he tightened screws on the panel on a sunny summer day this month. He had removed solar panels from the roof last year.""We're tired of being afraid,"" he said.Halfway across the globe, in the ""sunshine state"" of Queensland, Australia, electrical engineer David Smyth says the war waged by some governments and utilities against distributed energy, the term used for power generated by solar panels, is already lost.""The utilities are in a death spiral,"" he told Reuters by telephone while driving between a pub where he helped set up 120 solar panels to cut its A$60,000 ($53,000) annual power bill and a galvanizing plant which was also adding solar panels to reduce costs.In Australia, he said, solar panels have shifted from being a heavily subsidized indulgence for environmentally-conscious households to a pragmatic option for businesses wanting certainty about what their running costs will be next year.""Not many people are doing it because of emissions or the environment,"" Smyth said. ""It's about the cost.""Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels constitute the fastest growing renewable energy technology in the world since 2000. Global capacity has exploded from 1.5 gigawatts at the turn of the century to 136 gigawatts currently, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency. Meanwhile, the price of solar panels has plummeted 80 percent since 2008 thanks to generous state subsidies aimed at promoting clean energy.It's still less than one percent of energy capacity worldwide, but the surge in installations of rooftop solar panels is beginning to hit utilities and their business model of charging customers on the basis of consumption.Joined by traditional energy companies, they are lobbying governments to reverse decades of subsidies to green, renewable energy such as solar and, in some cases, to tax them.  In Europe, Australia and in the United States, energy companies have powerful lobbies that argue that they form a cornerstone of the economy and provide jobs to tens of thousands. Governments are forced to pay heed and in some cases they have acted.SLASHED REBATES Local Australian governments have slashed rebates for households which feed spare solar energy back into the grid, and approved massive increases to set daily connection fees. In Queensland, Australia's most solar-powered state, one state-owned grid company just raised daily connection fees by 1,142 percent while removing per-unit consumption charges - effectively removing the incentive to switch to solar.Spain's decree, although never converted to law, would force solar-equipped homes and businesses to connect to the grid and pay a tax on each kilowatt consumed. Asked when it might be approved, an industry ministry official told Reuters by e-mail: ""It all depends on what the cabinet decides to do in the coming months.""Nevertheless, the mere threat of the law was enough to ground solar panel installations to a halt in the country. Fewer panels have been installed in Spain this year than any since the early 2000s, renewable energy experts say.""The draft law was a brilliant move by the government to keep people from going off the grid, delaying competition for the big utilities,"" said Cote Romero of renewable energy advisors ECOOO. ""They’ve paralyzed a whole sector without actually regulating it.""And yet, households and businesses find solar energy appealing in an environment where utility bills are increasing.""Current policy is encouraging people to go off the grid,” said Roger Gill, owner of Spanish solar energy company Expert Sistemas Solares.""Most of our clients right now are small businesses, particularly in the farming and fishing industries, who are fed up and want some stability in their energy costs."" Although the surge in solar energy may be fueled in part by environmental concerns, it is not being led by environmentalists. Apple Inc, America's biggest company, powers its biggest data center, in Maiden, North Carolina, with the country's largest privately-owned solar farm which it owns.Google Inc, America's third-largest company, gets a third of the power for its giant Mountain View, California headquarters from its own solar installation.The record for a country installing solar PV in a year was China, in 2013, with 11.3 gigawatts or nearly a third of global installations. China wants 35 gigawatts of solar PV capacity by 2015 and 100 gigawatts, nearly the entire current world total, by 2020. A HIT WHERE IT HURTS Solar's rapid rise - along with warmer weather, more energy efficient appliances and various geopolitical factors - has pushed down demand for traditional electricity and cut into utilities' profits across the world.Earlier this year, German energy giant RWE AG blamed plant closures caused by solar demand for its 2.76 billion euro ($3.52 billion) loss in 2013; its first annual net loss in more than 60 years. It and the two other German energy companies - E.ON and EnBW - have seen their combined market value dwindle by an average 54 percent since 2007.A 60 percent drop in wholesale power prices in six years has forced Germany's utilities to book billions of euros in writedowns on their coal and gas plant portfolio. ""The low power prices are leaving a trail of blood in our balance sheet,"" RWE Chief Financial Officer Bernhard Guenther said in May, reporting first-quarter operating profit fell by a fifth.Although U.S. utilities have yet to feel a financial sting from solar's rise, they are leery of a future in which the burden of maintaining their delivery systems is spread among a smaller number of customers.Last year, Arizona became the first U.S. state to introduce a solar tax after the state regulator let its main utility, Pinnacle West Capital Corp unit Arizona Public Service Co, charge 70 cents per kilowatt, or about $5 per month for most households, to those on the grid who use solar. That is much less than the $100 a month APS wanted, but several other states are considering similar proposals, or have pledged to reform electricity rates to address the rise of distributed generation.""Public utility commissions are all looking at this change in the distribution system and potential change in the business model of utilities,"" said David Owens, executive vice president at Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned utilities in the United States. The experience of Hawaii, which has a far larger percentage of homeowners with rooftop panels than any other U.S. state, offers a window into the challenges other regions may face as they bring more and more distributed generation onto their grids. Homeowners on Oahu – Hawaii's most populous island – need to get the utility's approval before installing solar because some of the island’s power circuits have reached a threshold where it would be dangerous to add more PV without investing in upgrades to the distribution system.In Australia, Queensland state-owned power network company Ergon reported a 5 percent slide in household energy consumption in the 2013 financial year. Last month, the country's No. 1 and No. 2 energy retailers, Origin Energy and AGL Energy, both blamed solar uptake for declines in underlying profit.FIGHTING BACK So old energy is fighting back.Germany, the world's largest solar market following years of generous state subsidies, imposed a levy in 2014 on small businesses which use self-generated solar power - referred to as the ""sun tax"".""Those who protect the climate get penalized, those who harm it get cleared,"" said Carsten Koernig, managing director of German solar campaigner BSW.""Instead of supporting solar power in its transition to become competitive, it is now artificially made more expensive.""Australia's Queensland has ruled out a solar tax but promised to re-jig energy pricing so that everyone - solar-reliant or otherwise - pays the same. But that removes the incentive to go solar, and leaves customers at the mercy of later price rises by the utilities.""Distributed generation (DG) could be the end of utilities as we know them today,"" U.S. investment research firm Morningstar said earlier this year. ""Utilities' centralized network monopolies break down when customers become self-sufficient competitors.""Romero, the Spanish renewable energy expert, said: ""Utility companies know that the future is in renewables, but they're not going to go down without putting up a fight.""

432,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc is planning new and revamped streaming-music services in coming weeks, searching for a way to stand out in an increasingly crowded field of rivals from Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc to Spotify. Nailing music is one way for Google to raise chances of continued success as people spend more time on mobile devices.Google's YouTube service has become a low-profile titan in streaming through the popularity of music videos. Currently, videos must be chosen one track at a time. YouTube in coming weeks will launch new subscription and ad-supported YouTube music services able to play several tracks in a row, a person familiar with the plans said.Google had been expected to launch the YouTube services by the end of summer and had offered few details.Also coming soon: an update of Google's existing $10-a-month All Access subscription-music streaming service. The new version will incorporate technology acquired by Google with the purchase of Songza, a service known for its ability to recommend music, Jamie Rosenberg, Google's Vice President of Digital Content, said in an interview.The variety of approaches risks confusing consumers, said Alex Luke, a venture capitalist at The Valley Fund, who has worked as an executive at music label EMI Music and was the director of music programming at Apple until 2011.He argued that the winners in digital music would offer radio-style programs, downloads and let listeners put together their own playlists. (For a graphic of music sales see: link.reuters.com/fap92w) “The marketplace hasn’t found itself yet and you’re going to continue to see the big players like Apple and Google experiment,” Luke said. ""The thing that Google and YouTube both have in their favor is these huge, active user bases."" The latest music push comes 16 months after Google launched its All Access subscription service. Industry observers say All Access has struggled to stand out and set Google into a markedly different business than the free, ad-supported services that have long underpinned its success. Google’s All Access subscription music service likely draws between 500,000 and a few million users, said Mark Mulligan of research and consulting firm Midia Research. That puts it in the same ranks as rivals Rhapsody and Deezer, but behind Spotify, which has more than 10 million paying subscribers.Apple has a Beats subscription streaming service, acquired with the Beats headphone line in May, and it has free iTunes radio, which analysts say has not been a breakout success. E-commerce giant Amazon launched its music service in June, providing streaming of a limited catalog of music to members of its $99-a-year Prime service.  The U.S. music market is worth $7 billion but royalty and marketing expenditures mean most streaming music businesses currently lose money, according to estimates from Brian Zisk, executive producer of the SF MusicTech Summit.  Mulligan described Google's music service in a ""holding pattern"", arguing that Google should be at least as big as Spotify given Google's resources and existing user base. Google’s Rosenberg acknowledged the service is not the market leader, but said Google was encouraged by what he called a ""very healthy"" portion of consumers who subscribed after a free one-month trial. He saw no need to cut the $10 monthly subscription price. “Is the bigger upside getting more people to try these services, or is the bigger upside dropping the price by a dollar or two?"" he asked. ""Right now we’re focused on creating broad awareness that the service exists."" All Access is now available in 43 countries, he said.To stand out, Google envisions a service ""that extends seamlessly to your wearable device or to your car,"" and that's intelligent enough to play ""the right music for the right moment,"" Rosenberg says. Marc Ruxin, the Chief Operating Officer of Rdio, a competing, privately-held streaming service, said Google wanted to use music to keep its main service, search, top of mind.“Google like any Internet company is in a war for attention, so they want as much user time on a daily basis that they can get,” he said.

434,"  * JVP-backed Cyberark listed on Nasdaq last week* Jerusalem Venture Partners launched in 1993* Firm has invested around $1 billion in scores of start-upsBy Luke BakerJERUSALEM, Oct 1 Within sight of Jerusalem's Old City stands a modernist building housing one of Israel's most successful venture capital firms, the backer of scores of start-ups over the past 20 years that have generated nearly $18 billion for investors.Jerusalem Venture Partners has picked a string of high-tech winners over the years despite its location away from the rest of Israel's flourishing industry, which is largely based on the Mediterranean coast north of Tel Aviv.Last week, shares in cybersecurity firm Cyberark, which JVP has been building up for over a decade, surged after their initial public offering on Nasdaq, rising 85 percent in three days to value the company at around $880 million.With JVP holding nearly 40 percent of the stock, the deal earned investors a nominal gain of $335 million.That follows a string of other recent ""exits"", including the sale of CyOptics to U.S. semiconductor maker Avago for $400 million last year, EMC's acquisition of flash storage firm XtremIO for $430 million in 2012 and the $1 billion IPO of QlikTech on Nasdaq in 2010.Entrepreneurs from across Israel are lining up for JVP  funding, especially those in the cybersecurity and data storage sectors, where the fund has built a niche and Israel's military-backed innovation leads the world.""We see about 700 ideas every year, at least a few of them as disruptive as any idea you can imagine,"" said Kobi Rozengarten, JVP's general partner, who spent decades in the Israeli and U.S. semiconductor industry before moving into spotting and nurturing start-ups.Founded in 1993 by Erel Margalit, a former business adviser to Jerusalem's mayor and now a Labour Party member of the Israeli parliament, JVP is raising capital for its seventh fund, which will invest $120-150 million in 20 or so companies over the coming 3-5 years, looking for the next high-tech superstar - and if possible an Israeli Google or Facebook. ""One of the strengths of Israeli innovation is that we don't have a local market, so when we build companies we are building them towards the outside market,"" said Rozengarten, highlighting the growing interest of China, with its demand for cybersecurity and data storage capability.Despite the upheaval in the Midde East, Israel remains dynamic, its innovation partly inspired by the military technology it constantly develops. For investors, the promise of a return is enough to offset any qualms about instability.CHINA WANTS ISRAEL JVP is not without competition - one directory lists more than 80 venture firms in Israel, including the local offices of several high-performing U.S. funds such as Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners.Since the Israeli government offered tax and other incentives for investors to put seed money into venture firms back in 1993, there has been a proliferation in the industry, but few have managed to notch up JVP's track record. For every dollar put into its first fund, investors got $9 back after five years, while the second had a 500 percent return. There have been bad years too, including 2000, when the dotcom bubble burst, and the 2008 global financial crisis.While JVP attracts most investment from the United States, there is growing interest from Asia, from where Rozengarten has just returned, meeting investors in Hong Kong and Shanghai.As technology has developed and new areas have emerged, JVP has shifted emphasis, moving away from the communications and networking start-ups it used to finance and focusing on three principle areas: data storage and management, cyber security and media infrastructure.With the Israeli military a hot-bed of technology investment and innovation, JVP has set up an 'incubator' in Beersheva, a city in southern Israel where the military will soon move its headquarters. Many of the best start-ups in Israel spring from ideas soldiers have while serving in specialist army units during their three years of military service.WHERE'S THE GOOGLE?  Yet for all the innovation the country has produced over the past two decades - from the flash-memory stick to the Waze navigation programme bought by Google in 2013 - it has yet to produce a global success story like Google of its own.In part that is because the local economy is small - just eight million people - which means hot ideas quickly look abroad, where they are snapped up by larger rivals. Two of JVP's most lucrative deals came early on, including the sale in 2000 of Chromatis Networks to Lucent for $4.5 billion.Often investors do not have the patience to stay with a company for the long-haul. Well aware that up to a third of start-ups will fail, those that finance companies for 6 or 7 years naturally want to see a return on their money.That frequently means that at the first opportunity the company's backers will look to do an initial public offering, probably on Nasdaq. It serves both the entrepreneurs and the investors, even if it means floating a relatively small fish.Rozengarten sees the lack of an Israeli Intel as positive, since it has encouraged broader, more competitive innovation and perhaps prevented an experience like that of Finland with Nokia, where the once-dominant mobile-phone company's near collapse dragged the country's economy down with it.At the same time, Israeli start-ups are growing in size and becoming more mature. Whereas once JVP would help build up a company to a value of $50 million or $100 million before exit, several are now hitting $400 million or more.""We are moving towards larger companies, larger valuations, larger exits,"" said Rozengarten.JVP's aim is to invest an average of $6-8 million in a company over 3-5 years, working with around 6 companies a year. Investors are paid out in 8-10 years. Experience shows that out of every 10 companies, three fail, three do okay and three succeed, with one a ""home run"".Having more money to invest would not necessarily deliver bigger returns for investors, said Rozengarten.""With a fund of $120 million we do about 20 companies (over 3-5 years). With a fund of $400 million you would have to do too many companies,"" he said. ""If you gave me more money, we would just spoil our entrepreneurs.""

435,"   By Alexei Oreskovic, Liana B. Baker and Lisa Richwine  Softbank Corp’s investment in a Hollywood movie studio represents the coming out party for two new players in the U.S. entertainment industry -- the Japanese telecommunications company and Nikesh Arora, the former Google Inc executive running a new media and internet company.Two months after unexpectedly decamping from Google for SoftBank, Arora struck a $250 million deal for a minority stake in Legendary Entertainment, announced on Thursday. Earlier, he had tried unsuccessfully to strike a partnership with DreamWorks Animation, sources said.As CEO of San Carlos, California-based SoftBank Internet and Media Inc, Arora is charged with investing in and operating media and digital media companies, including music, e-commerce and gaming, said one person close to Softbank. Softbank, owned by legendary investor Masayoshi Son, owns U.S. mobile carrier Sprint and is the largest investor in China e-commerce company Alibaba.At Google, Arora oversaw sales, marketing and partnerships, an outsider's job at a company, where engineering skills are prized above all else.The buttoned-down and polished Arora, who has a masters degree in business from Northeastern University and previously worked at T-Mobile Europe, became one of the most powerful Google executives, and the highest paid in 2012, when he made $51 million in cash and stock.Several former colleagues described Arora as very effective at getting results, often by eschewing the collaborative, consensus-based culture within Google. “He didn’t really try hard to convince people that he didn’t need to convince,” recalled one former Google executive, who declined to be identified. “He would be willing to say 'we need to do this, get it done.' He valued execution.”He also had a reputation for being brutally direct, particularly with people he viewed as unprepared, the former colleagues said. A representative for Arora declined to make him available for an interview or to respond to comments about him. Google also declined to comment.The Google business chief rubbed shoulders with Hollywood's elite while selling ads and making deals.Arora is “perfectly placed” to build Softbank's media portfolio, said Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of advertising group WPP, citing Arora’s “knowledge gleaned from his years at Google about the media community.”Arora advocated for Google to acquire online movie company Netflix in 2009, according to one former Google employee who was present when Arora pitched the idea to Google’s senior executive team. At the time, Netflix had a market cap of roughly $3 billion, compared to its current $27 billion valuation. Arora also proposed at the time that Google should acquire LoveFilm, a UK-based streaming video company that was later acquired by Amazon in 2011, the person said.But the ideas never progressed beyond internal deliberations, as Google executives at the time were more interested in developing ad-supported online video through the company’s YouTube website, the person added.'PLUGGED IN'  Arora was a frequent attendee at events frequented by media and tech elite, such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland and the Allen & Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.“He was very plugged in with the top management at Fox and some of the studios,” recalls one former colleague, referring to Twentieth Century Fox, which produced the 2013 comedy film 'The Internship' depicting Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as fictional Google interns.When Arora ran Google’s European, Middle East and Africa operations during his early years at the company, he broke free of the Silicon Valley-based committee which approved all new hires, according to several people then at Google.Arora convinced the company to let him established his own hiring process, a coup which turned heads throughout the company, the people said. Arora occupied a large corner office with sweeping views of London, an anomaly in an egalitarian corporate culture where most employees work in open cubicles and where even former Chief Executive Eric Schmidt shared an office with an engineer for several years, according to the former Google manager.“He made the argument that he had to meet with important people,” the person recalled.

442,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The acting head of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, former Google Inc executive Michelle Lee, is being seriously considered to permanently head the agency, sources have told Reuters.Lee, a former deputy general counsel and head of patents and patent strategy at Google, the search and advertising group, has been acting head of the agency since January. After leaving Google and before coming to the Virginia-based patent office, Lee headed the U.S. patent office's Silicon Valley outpost.She is being considered for the agency's top job on a permanent basis, two sources told Reuters. The sources, who were not authorized to speak on the record, knew of no other potential candidates. The USPTO has been under fire for approving what critics say are bad or weak patents, particularly software patents, which became fodder for infringement litigation. It has also been criticized for lax oversight of examiners and others who telecommute and fill out time cards though they are not working. A perennial complaint about the patent office has been its backlog. In December 2011, the unexamined backlog was almost 722,000 patents. It was 615,000 as of August, according to patent office data. The USPTO has been without a permanent director since David Kappos, a former International Business Machines Corp executive, left on Feb. 1, 2013.The USPTO is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and awards patents and registers trademarks. The USPTO declined to comment. Lee has an engineering degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a law degree from Stanford Law School.

443,"  (Repeats for wider distribution)By Alexei Oreskovic, Liana B. Baker and Lisa RichwineOct 2 Softbank Corp's investment in a Hollywood movie studio represents the coming out party for two new players in the U.S. entertainment industry -- the Japanese telecommunications company and Nikesh Arora, the former Google Inc executive running a new media and internet company.Two months after unexpectedly decamping from Google  for SoftBank, Arora struck a $250 million deal for a minority stake in Legendary Entertainment, announced on Thursday. Earlier, he had tried unsuccessfully to strike a partnership with DreamWorks Animation, sources said.As CEO of San Carlos, California-based SoftBank Internet and Media Inc, Arora is charged with investing in and operating media and digital media companies, including music, e-commerce and gaming, said one person close to Softbank. Softbank, owned by legendary investor Masayoshi Son, owns U.S. mobile carrier Sprint and is the largest investor in China e-commerce company Alibaba.At Google, Arora oversaw sales, marketing and partnerships, an outsider's job at a company, where engineering skills are prized above all else.The buttoned-down and polished Arora, who has a masters degree in business from Northeastern University and previously worked at T-Mobile Europe, became one of the most powerful Google executives, and the highest paid in 2012, when he made $51 million in cash and stock.Several former colleagues described Arora as very effective at getting results, often by eschewing the collaborative, consensus-based culture within Google.""He didn't really try hard to convince people that he didn't need to convince,"" recalled one former Google executive, who declined to be identified. ""He would be willing to say 'we need to do this, get it done.' He valued execution."" He also had a reputation for being brutally direct, particularly with people he viewed as unprepared, the former colleagues said.A representative for Arora declined to make him available for an interview or to respond to comments about him. Google also declined to comment.The Google business chief rubbed shoulders with Hollywood's elite while selling ads and making deals.Arora is ""perfectly placed"" to build Softbank's media portfolio, said Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of advertising group WPP, citing Arora's ""knowledge gleaned from his years at Google about the media community."" Arora advocated for Google to acquire online movie company Netflix in 2009, according to one former Google employee who was present when Arora pitched the idea to Google's senior executive team. At the time, Netflix had a market cap of roughly $3 billion, compared to its current $27 billion valuation.Arora also proposed at the time that Google should acquire LoveFilm, a UK-based streaming video company that was later acquired by Amazon in 2011, the person said.But the ideas never progressed beyond internal deliberations, as Google executives at the time were more interested in developing ad-supported online video through the company's YouTube website, the person added. 'PLUGGED IN' Arora was a frequent attendee at events frequented by media and tech elite, such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland and the Allen & Co conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.""He was very plugged in with the top management at Fox and some of the studios,"" recalls one former colleague, referring to Twentieth Century Fox, which produced the 2013 comedy film 'The Internship' depicting Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as fictional Google interns.When Arora ran Google's European, Middle East and Africa operations during his early years at the company, he broke free of the Silicon Valley-based committee which approved all new hires, according to several people then at Google.Arora convinced the company to let him established his own hiring process, a coup which turned heads throughout the company, the people said.Arora occupied a large corner office with sweeping views of London, an anomaly in an egalitarian corporate culture where most employees work in open cubicles and where even former Chief Executive Eric Schmidt shared an office with an engineer for several years, according to the former Google manager.""He made the argument that he had to meet with important people,"" the person recalled.

449,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) sued the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday, intensifying its battle with federal agencies as the Internet industry's self-described champion of free speech seeks the right to reveal the extent of U.S. government surveillance. The lawsuit, which Twitter said follows months of fruitless negotiations with the government, marks an escalation in the Internet industry's battle over government gag orders on the nature and number of requests for private user information.In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for Northern California, Twitter said that current rules prevent it from even stating that it has not received any national security requests for user information.The messaging service said such restrictions violate the Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free speech.""This is an important issue for anyone who believes in a strong First Amendment, and we hope to be able to share our complete transparency report,"" Twitter said in a blogpost.Tech companies have sought to clarify their relationships with U.S. law enforcement and spying agencies in the wake of revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that outlined the depth of U.S. spying capabilities.Twitter's lawsuit follows an agreement between Internet companies like Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) with the government about court orders they receive related to surveillance.The agreement freed the companies to disclose the number of orders they received, but only in broad ranges. A company that offers email services, for example, would be able to say it received between zero and 999 orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during a six-month period for email content belonging to someone outside the United States. In a separate case, a federal appeals court in San Francisco on Wednesday will hear arguments on whether the FBI can gag recipients of national security letters. A lower court judge had ruled those secrecy guidelines unconstitutional.CAN'T EVEN DISCLOSE ZERO REQUESTS  Twitter, which allows its 271 million monthly users to send  140-character text messages, has traditionally taken an aggressive posture challenging government censorship requests and has previously described itself as ""the free-speech wing of the free-speech party."" The American Civil Liberties Union praised Twitter's action, saying in a statement that the company was doing the right thing by ""challenging this tangled web of secrecy rules and gag orders.""""The U.S. government has taken the position that service providers like Twitter are even prohibited from saying that they have received zero national security requests, or zero of a particular type of national security request,"" Twitter said in its complaint.The Justice Department responded to the lawsuit with a statement on how it has worked with other companies.“Earlier this year, the government addressed similar concerns raised in a lawsuit brought by several major tech companies,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. ""There, the parties worked collaboratively to allow tech companies to provide broad information on government requests while also protecting national security."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that defends civil liberties in the digital world, said it had been disappointed that tech companies had given up their fight.""EFF and a number of privacy and free-speech organizations expressed our profound disappointment that the companies dropped their lawsuit for so little,"" Nate Cardozo, staff attorney with the group, said on Tuesday.The government's restrictions on providing more details about requests for user data, he said, are ""useful for one thing, which is to keep the public in the dark about what authorities the government uses to get our data.Twitter's lawsuit said the company has discussed the matter with the government for months. In a meeting with officials from the DOJ and the FBI in January, Twitter argued that it should not be bound by the disclosure limits that the government offered to Google and the other companies. It said it submitted a draft transparency report with more detailed data to the FBI in April, but the agency denied Twitter’s request to publish the draft five months later.  ""We’ve tried to achieve the level of transparency our users deserve without litigation, but to no avail,"" Twitter said in Tuesday's blogpost.

458,"  (Adds slug, background, details on bug and ""Poodle"" attack)BOSTON Oct 14 Three Google Inc  researchers have uncovered a security bug in widely used web encryption technology that they say could allow hackers to steal data in what they have dubbed a ""Poodle"" attack.""Poodle"" stands for Padding Oracle On Downloaded Legacy Encryption.The problem is an 18-year old encryption standard, known as SSL 3.0, which is still widely used in web browsers and websites. It was disclosed in a research paper published late on Tuesday on the website of the OpenSSL Project, a group that develops the most widely used type of SSL encryption software.Rumors that a new bug in OpenSSL software had been circulating on Twitter and technology news sites in recent days, prompting some corporate security professionals to prepare to respond to a major new threat this week. So far this year, they have responded to April's ""Heartbleed"" bug in OpenSSL, which affected an estimated two-thirds of all websites and thousands of other technology products, as well as last month's ""Shellshock"" bug in a piece of Unix software known as Bash.But security experts said that the bug disclosed on Tuesday, which could allow hackers to steal browser ""cookies,"" was not as serious as the two prior bugs. ""It's quite complicated. It requires the attacker to have a privileged position in the network,"" said Ivan Ristic, director of application security research with Qualys and an expert in SSL.Jeff Moss, founder of the Def Con hacking conference and an advisor to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said that successful attackers could exploit the bug to steal session cookies in browsers, taking control of accounts for email providers, social networks and banks that use that technology. To do that, however, they would need to launch a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack, placing themselves in between the victim and the websites they were visiting. One common approach is to create a rogue WiFi ""hot spot"" in an Internet cafe, he said.Matthew Green, assistant research professor at Johns Hopkins University's department of computer science, said this vulnerability was not as bad as either Heartbleed, which allowed hackers to snoop or steal large quantities of data, or Shellshock, which could give attackers remote control of computers.He advised businesses and computer uses to disable SSL 3.0 technology on their servers and browsers, a process that he said can be difficult for the average computer user.""It's not going to take out the infrastructure of the Internet. But it's going to be a hassle to fix,"" he said.

463,"  BERLIN Oct 14 Germany's economy minister warned during a debate with Google chairman Eric Schmidt on Tuesday that the tech giant's dominant position might undermine democratic rights and hamper competition, adding that stricter regulation is needed.""I admire Google, but I also admire an engineer who is able to build a car - and nevertheless I am in favour of road traffic rules,"" said Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat who is also deputy to conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany's broad governing coalition.In Germany, concerns over Google's market power have mingled with wider fears of U.S. cyber espionage since the revelations of mass U.S. snooping on German citizens last year.The digital sphere needs more ground rules, Gabriel said, and Germany would shortly send proposals to the new European Commission on how to address this. Last May Gabriel suggested firms like Google should be broken up if they were abusing dominant market positions.Schmidt responded that critics overstated Google's market power and that one also should look at its U.S. rivals like Facebook or Amazon. ""Google is not the only site people use,"" he said. The California-based company accounts for more than 80 percent of the European Internet search market and more than 90 percent of that in Germany.Google is the target of a European antitrust investigation into its Internet search engine.

466,"  * Ireland to end tax regime that saved multinationals billions* Swift upturn ushers in tax cuts rather than austerity* Government faces backlash over uneven nature of recovery   (Adds finance minister interview, Google comment)By Padraic Halpin and Conor HumphriesDUBLIN, Oct 14 Ireland will phase out a tax loophole that multinationals use to save billions of dollars under sweeping changes to its corporate tax structure announced in Tuesday's budget, the first in seven years without new austerity measures.With one eye on an election in 18 months' time, Finance Minister Michael Noonan also unveiled plans to cut the income tax burden on low and middle income earners frustrated by Ireland's uneven recovery from the global crisis, changes that will benefit workers at foreign as well as domestic companies.Ireland, which left a European Union/IMF bailout programme only last year, is enjoying an economic resurgence that the euro zone has held up as proof that austerity policies can work.But Noonan responded to criticism over the past 18 months from both the EU and the United States for Irish tax rules that have enabled firms such as Google and Apple  to cut their overseas tax rates to single digits.The changes spell the eventual end to ""Double Irish"" schemes, so-called because they involve multinationals setting up two Irish subsidiaries to slash their tax liabilities.""I want to make sure that the slur of the ""Double Irish"" is no longer attached to Ireland's reputation and it had become something that was thrown at us internationally,"" Noonan told Reuters in an interview after his budget speech.""There's a big advantage I believe for Ireland to be the first mover. Our competitor countries, if you were investing there tomorrow you would still be uncertain about what the regime might be in two years time."" TAX REFORM The changes mark Ireland's most significant tax reform since it lowered the corporate tax rate to 12.5 percent in the late 1990s to entice companies to bring jobs to the country.At risk for Ireland are the 160,000 jobs - almost one in 10 workers in the country - paid for by about 1,000 foreign firms that have set up a base in Ireland to benefit from its tax code and flexible, English-speaking work force.Among the most criticised parts of the Irish tax code is the complex corporate structure whereby a multinational can channel untaxed revenues to an Irish subsidiary, which then pays the money to another company registered in Ireland that is tax resident elsewhere, usually in a tax haven such as Bermuda.From January, Irish-registered firms will automatically be deemed to be tax resident in Ireland, bringing Irish law in line with U.S. and British rules. Companies already incorporated in Ireland will have until 2020 to comply with the new rules.The head of Google's Irish operations John Herlihy said in a statement that the company was deeply committed to Ireland and will work to implement the changes as they become law. Noonan also announced changes to the intellectual property tax regime in the hope of keeping Ireland an attractive destination for business. Following a consultation process, he planned to bring in a ""Knowledge Development Box"" similar to ""patent boxes"" in other jurisdictions in a year's time, he said.This, the minister told Reuters, will help lead to more employment, rather than putting jobs at risk.LONG ROAD TRAVELLED While the corporate tax changes were watched with interest abroad, workers at home want a reward for their sacrifices following tax increases and spending cuts that have taken 30 billion euros ($38 billion) or about 20 percent of annual output out of the economy.Ireland originally required tax increases and spending cuts of 2 billion euros in the 2015 budget, but with unemployment falling, exports rebounding and the economy set to grow by 4.7 percent this year, Noonan instead had money to spend.He lowered the top rate of income tax to 40 percent from 41 percent and raised the income threshold, which currently hits middle as well as high-income earners. Employees with annual salaries over 70,000 euros will see no change in their tax burden next year, he added. There was tax relief of 20 percent on new water charges, the last new tax imposed under the EU/IMF bailout deal, after tens of thousands rallied on Saturday in the biggest anti-austerity protest for years.""I know that for many of you watching tonight, Ireland's recovery is still a headline, something you have yet to feel in your life from day to day,"" Prime Minister Enda Kenny said.""Today we start to address that. We will never repeat the economic mistakes of the past because we know how precious the hard-won recovery is.""Spending minister Brendan Howlin was able to bring in the first welfare increases since 2009 when Ireland's crisis began, increasing child benefit by 5 euros per child and offering the unemployed a larger Christmas bonus in their jobless payments.More than 1,700 new teachers will be employed next year, recruitment will resume in the police force and there will be no further overall reductions in public service numbers following a 10 percent reduction since 2008, he added.The modest changes mean Ireland's budget deficit, which was set to fall to 2.4 percent of GDP next year if no changes were introduced, is instead expected to hit 2.7 percent, still below the EU limit of 3 percent but a risky strategy, according to the country's budget watchdog.""BUYING VOTERS"" Ireland's main opposition party Fianna Fail, which is trailing Noonan's governing Fine Gael party in opinion polls, said his budget was about ""using borrowed money to buy votes"".Several voters walking in central Dublin were also unimpressed by a string of ministers proclaiming that the era of austerity was effectively over. ""I don't think things are getting better. They're getting worse,"" said Linda Francis, 49, a driver and single mother, who said most of her friends had lost faith in all the political parties.""They keep hitting the working people,"" she said.

468,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc is preparing to test new technology that may provide the foundation for a wireless version of its high-speed ""Fiber"" Internet service, according to telecommunication experts who scrutinized the company's regulatory filings. In a public but little-noticed application with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Monday, Google asked the agency for permission to conduct tests in California across different wireless spectrums, including a rarely-used millimeter-wave frequency capable of transmitting large amounts of data.It is unclear from the heavily redacted filing what exactly Google intends to do, but it does signal the Internet giant's broader ambition of controlling Internet connectivity. The technology it seeks to test could form the basis of a wireless connection that can be broadcast to homes, obviating the need for an actual ground cable or fiber connection, experts say.By beaming Internet services directly into homes, Google would open a new path now thoroughly dominated by Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and other entrenched cable and broadband providers. It could potentially offer a quicker and cheaper way to deliver high-speed Internet service, a potential threat to the cable-telecoms oligopoly, experts said.“From a radio standpoint it’s the closest thing to fiber there is,” said Stephen Crowley, a wireless engineer and consultant who monitors FCC filings, noting that millimeter frequencies can transmit data over short distances at speeds of several gigabits per second.“You could look at it as a possible wireless extension of their Google Fiber wireless network, as a way to more economically serve homes. Put up a pole in a neighborhood, instead of having to run fiber to each home,” said Crowley.Craig Barratt, the head of the Google Access and Energy division leading the effort to offer high-speed fiber networks in Kansas City and other locations, signed off as the authorized person submitting Google's FCC application.The world’s No.1 Internet search engine has expanded into providing consumers with services such as Internet access. The company said it wants to roll out its high-speed Internet service to more than 30 U.S. cities, and in 2013 it struck a deal to provide free wireless Internet access to 7,000 Starbucks cafes across America.  Earlier this year, technology news website The Information reported that Google was exploring ways to offer a full-fledged wireless service, with voice and Internet access, in markets where the company already offers its Fiber service. Google’s application to conduct the 180-day test is heavily redacted to protect confidential information that Google said would provide “valuable insight into Google’s technology innovations and potential business plans and strategy.” The purpose of the test is so that Google can “expeditiously test radios in a way that is likely to contribute to the development, extension, expansion or utilization of the radio art,” Google stated cryptically in one of the filings. Google declined to comment on the FCC filing. COULD BE JUST BASIC RESEARCH  Wireless experts noted that the tests could simply be basic research that does not ultimately lead to new products or services. In the past, Google has submitted applications with the FCC to test wireless communications.The latest test, which Google hopes to begin on Nov. 13, will include three sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, including one in San Mateo county and two locations a half-mile apart which appear to be on Google’s Mountain View, California campus. Google said the effort will use radio transmitters operating in the 5.8 GHz frequency, the 24.2 GHz frequency and in the millimeter wave bands of 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz, according to the application.  Millimeter wave frequencies work best over short distances, such as a few city blocks, and require a direct line-of-sight connection to a receiver. But multiple such devices placed next to each other, atop buildings could provide an alternative to in-the-ground fiber cables used for shuttling data throughout a city as well as for delivering Internet access directly to residences, theorized several wireless experts.“This could be anything from something relatively small scale, like a way to supplement their existing fiber system to something like how to put a wireless cloud around your city that leverages your fiber backbone,” said Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a non-profit that focuses on broadband access and competition issues and which receives funding from tech companies including Google.The FCC is scheduled to hold a meeting on Friday about the use of wireless spectrum above 24 GHz for mobile services, including ways the agency can facilitate the development and deployment of technology using such frequencies.Google noted that the tests are for narrow-bandwidth transmissions. According to Crowley, the application suggests that Google will not be transmitting data over the networks, but sending simple pings between locations to gauge how the signals travel over distances and in different terrains. Google appears to be trying to get ahead of the competition in understanding the potential to use the millimeter frequencies now being discussed by the FCC, said Public Knowledge's Feld.“If they can pull it off, they will have a potentially very innovative next-generation delivery system,” he said.

469,"  (Adds comments from Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, security expert)By Jim FinkleBOSTON Oct 14 Three Google Inc  researchers have uncovered a security bug in widely used web encryption technology that they say could allow hackers to take over accounts for email, banking and other services in what they have dubbed a ""Poodle"" attack.The discovery of ""Poodle,"" which stands for Padding Oracle On Downloaded Legacy Encryption, prompted makers of web browsers and server software to advise users on Tuesday to disable use of the source of the security bug: an 18-year old encryption standard known as SSL 3.0.It was the third time this year that researchers have uncovered a vulnerability in widely used web technology, following April's ""Heartbleed"" bug in OpenSSL and last month's ""Shellshock"" bug in a piece of Unix software known as Bash.Security experts said that hackers could steal browser ""cookies"" in ""Poodle"" attacks, potentially taking control of email, banking and social networking accounts. Even so, experts said the threat was not as serious as the two prior bugs.""If Shellshock and Heartbleed were Threat Level 10, then Poodle is more like a 5 or a 6,"" said Tal Klein, vice president with cloud security firm Adallom. The threat was disclosed in a research paper published on the website of the OpenSSL Project, which develops the most widely used type of SSL encryption software.Rumors of a bug in SSL software had been circulating in recent days, prompting some security professionals to prepare for a major new threat this week.Ivan Ristic, director of application security research with Qualys, said ""Poodle"" was not as serious as the previous threats because the attack was ""quite complicated,"" requiring hackers to have privileged access to networks. Jeff Moss, a cyber adviser to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said attackers would need to launch a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack, placing themselves between victims and websites using approaches such as creating rogue WiFi ""hotspots"" in Internet cafes.Google suggested a technical workaround to secure web servers, but added on its blog that it hopes to eventually remove support for SSL 3.0 from all client software.Mozilla plans to disable SSL 3.0 by default in the next version of its Firefox browser, to be released on Nov. 25. (mzl.la/1DaxOwY). ""SSL version 3.0 is no longer secure,"" Mozilla said on its blog. ""Browsers and websites need to turn off SSLv3 and use more modern security protocols as soon as possible.""Microsoft Corp issued an advisory suggesting that customers disable SSL 3.0 on Windows for servers and PCs.Representatives with Apple Inc could not be reached. An Oracle Corp spokeswoman had no immediate comment.Matthew Green, an assistant research professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University said that disabling SSL 3.0 can be difficult for some computer users.""It's not going to take out the infrastructure of the Internet. But it's going to be a hassle to fix,"" Green said.   (Reporting by Jim Finkle.

470,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The White House on Thursday nominated Michelle Lee to be  director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which the former Google executive has led on an acting basis since January. The patent office, regarded as the steward of U.S. intellectual property, employs about 12,000 people, mostly patent examiners. It has long been under fire for taking more than two years to consider many patent applications. Lee, who founded and headed the U.S. patent office's Silicon Valley outpost, was deputy general counsel and head of patents and patent strategy at Google, working there from 2003 to 2012. Her nomination is subject to approval by the U.S. Senate. The patent office is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and awards patents and registers trademarks""Michelle is a proven leader with strong management skills, having ably led the PTO since January,"" U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said in a statement. ""She brings decades of legal, technical and business experience in delivering real results for our nation’s innovators.""Lee was also a partner at the law firm Fenwick and West, and has degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as a law degree from Stanford. The patent office has been without a permanent director since David Kappos, a former IBM Corp executive, left in February 2013.  Paul Michel, who retired from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2010, once employed Lee to clerk for him on the court, which specializes in patent and trademark cases.""Her academic record was just astronomically impressive. If my memory serves me right, she got an A in every class she took at MIT,"" Michel told Reuters. Lee's biggest challenges would be reducing the patent backlog while ensuring no bad patents slip through, said Michel. Poorly written patents are often blamed for meritless litigation. A perennial complaint about the patent office has been its backlog. In December 2011, the unexamined backlog was almost 722,000 patents. It was down to 605,646 in September, the most recent patent office data show.In September, patent applications took an average of 27.4 months from the time they were filed to when they were approved. Another issue facing Lee is the difficulty in planning and budgeting. The agency collects funds from users but cannot spend the money without authorization from Congress, which it sometimes cannot get.

Economic data showed initial jobless claims fell to their lowest level in 14 years, and industrial output rose sharply in September.But investors remained cautious, and the selloff could continue if U.S. earnings fail to ease worries about weak global demand. Investors also have been rattled by a widening Ebola scare and plunging oil prices. The S&P 500 is still off 7.4 percent from its Sept. 18 record closing high and is up just 0.8 percent for the year so far.""A lot of the selling got done yesterday, whether it was forced liquidation or just scared money leaving the market ... so it looks like it's a short-term bounce,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. ""We need to see the S&P regain its 200-day moving average before we can say that the uptrend has been restored. Fundamentals are still somewhat negative.""The S&P 500 again closed below its 200-day moving average of around 1,905.Energy shares provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500, with the S&P 500 energy index up 1.7 percent. The index, which has lost ground dramatically in recent weeks, briefly slipped into bear market territory earlier this week.Shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp rose 17 percent to $20.79 and the stock was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer after Southwestern Energy Co said it would buy some oil and gas assets in the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in West Virginia and Pennsylvania from Chesapeake. Small caps also extended this week's rebound, with the Russell 2000 index rising 1.3 percent, its third session in a row of more than 1 percent gains. It is up 3.5 percent in the last three sessions.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.5 points, or 0.15 percent, to 16,117.24, the S&P 500 gained 0.27 points, or 0.01 percent, to 1,862.76 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 2.07 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,217.39.Trading volume remained higher than average. About 9.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 8.4 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Netflix shares plunged 19.4 percent to $361.70, among the biggest drags on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 , a day after it said it signed up fewer video-streaming subscribers than forecast for the quarter.After the bell, shares of Google fell 2.7 percent to $522 after third-quarter revenue growth at the technology company came in shy of Wall Street expectations.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,180 to 903, for a 2.41-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,833 issues rose and 879 fell for a 2.09-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

475,"   By Valerie Volcovici | NEW YORK  NEW YORK As mobile devices proliferate and big business turns to cloud computing to cut costs and improve efficiency, technology companies are facing a double challenge: powering energy-hungry data centers to expand the cloud while keeping carbon emissions from skyrocketing.Cloud computing has paved the way for technologies such as video conferencing and smart building management that can make corporations greener. But it is also shifting a larger share of electricity consumption - and the carbon output associated with it - onto firms such as Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) that run the data centers or manufacture computer servers.The trend has made low-carbon energy access and conservation a competitive necessity in the technology sector. Faster, smaller servers and renewable energy contracts accomplish both, industry sources said. ""As you take a look at the fact that the cloud today uses as much energy as the country of Japan every year, you know it doesn't take much longer until we run out of energy,"" Gabi Zedlmayer, chief progress officer at Hewlett Packard (HPQ.N), said in an interview as part of the Reuters Global Summit on Climate change from Oct 13. to Oct. 16.""We knew we had to disrupt what we are doing and put our R&D in the server line to go toward zero energy,"" she said. The current focus on HP Labs' research is a system called ""The Machine,"" which combines memory storage and cache into a single device and uses fiber optics instead of copper.It has also recently unveiled its ""Moonshot"" server, a customized server that takes up 80 percent of the space of and uses 89 percent less power than regular servers that require huge amounts of energy for heating and cooling.Josh Henretig, Microsoft’s director of environmental sustainability, said the spread of cloud computing is shifting  ""carbon accountability"" - a responsibility to cut emissions - to technology companies from their customers who were ""unplugging their own IT infrastructure and handing that over to Microsfot to manage in our own cloud environment."" ""The transition in our business model moving from a physical software that customers downloaded on their machines to one that is delivered through the cloud ... was forcing us to build and create large-scale data centers all around the world,"" Henretig said in a separate interview in New York.""This in turn was putting a lot of pressure on our energy supply and our carbon emissions,"" he added.THE CLOUD IS SIXTH-LARGEST ELECTRICITY USER The growth of cloud computing and current use of the Internet results in a electricity demand that would rank sixth as a country in current rankings, according to an April report on greening the Internet by environmental group Greenpeace.  Demand could grow by 60 percent or more by 2020, the report said, as the online population grows globally.The group said there is a compelling business case for companies to rapidly shift to renewable energy to power their data centers since renewable energy costs are dropping.Henretig said the company’s wind energy investments to date represent as much as 10 percent of the company’s energy use.The company has signed two 20-year power purchase agreements from a 110-megawatt wind farm in Texas and a 175-megawatt wind farm in Illinois. The company also uses an internal carbon fee to hold itself accountable for the carbon it emits from energy use to real estate to air travel, which makes renewable energy more competitive with cheaper natural gas.Microsoft is playing catchup with rival Google, which has signed five power purchase agreements for wind power totaling nearly 600 megawatts of capacity. The Internet search giant has also worked with local utilities to push for more renewable energy to power its data center in coal-reliant North Carolina.And on Thursday, Internet rival Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) announced it had entered into a long-term power purchase agreement for wind power with wind farm developer OwnEnergy to support its operations in the Great Plains region.The competition for the next long-term wind or renewable energy deal between Google or Microsoft has potential benefits for the environment, Henretig said. ""We’ll compete in other areas, but we both agree that is a healthy rivalry to have – especially when some of these breakthrough technologies come to bear in how we manage large-scale cloud infrastructure more efficiently,"" he said.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits(This version of the story orrects to say Microsoft's wind energy investments total 10 percent of energy use, not natural gas, 14th paragraph)",2014-10-16,GOOGL,"Thu Oct 16, 2014 | 5:05pm EDT","For tech firms, the cloud makes carbon curbs compulsory",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-climatechange-summit-cloud-computing-idUSKCN0I51Z620141016?type=companyNews

In a statement, a Google spokeswoman said the company wanted to provide additional security for its users to protect personal documents but would still work with law enforcement when appropriate. An Apple representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Comey said FBI agents have come across a growing number of cases for which they believe evidence was in a phone or a laptop that they were unable to crack, though he did not provide specific examples.  ""If this becomes the norm, I suggest to you that homicide cases could be stalled, suspects walk free, child exploitation not discovered and prosecuted,"" he said.  Comey also urged Congress to update the law that governs law enforcement's ability to intercept communications, which was enacted two decades ago and does not address some newer technologies.In his speech, he gave examples of cases that agents were able to piece together from evidence contained on cell phones, including against a Louisiana man who was convicted of murdering a 12-year-old boy and a drug trafficking ring in Kansas City.  The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday criticized Comey's remarks, arguing that the law did not force telecommunications companies to build an avenue for decryption into their products. In an interview, ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani said it was not clear if FBI agents will be hindered in their investigations through the new encryption since they already have access to other types of information. “A couple of anecdotes from the FBI isn’t enough,"" Singh said.

Shares of Google fell 2.7 percent to $510.11 in extended trading on Thursday. “The CPC decline abated. That’s a big positive,” argued BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. ""If CPCs flatline that’s going to help the core meaningfully.”  Google posted $16.52 billion in revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to $13.75 billion in the year ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for revenue of $16.57 billion in the latest quarter.Google ramped up its spending during the quarter. The company increased its headcount by roughly 3,000 employees, contributing to a 46 percent rise in research and development costs. On Thursday, Google announced it had appointed Omid Kordestani its new chief business officer, replacing Nikesh Arora, who had departed a quarter ago to join Japan's Softbank Corp. The chief business officer is considered a key position, overseeing all the company's revenue-generating activities and serving as a liaison to investors and Wall Street.

495,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Having difficulty managing chronic disease? Now there's an app for that.Vida, a new startup founded by Google Inc's former commerce chief, aims to help patients get healthy, reduce stress levels and lose weight through online ""health coaches."" Many mobile health apps focus on fitness. Vida, started by Stephanie Tilenius, a former Google and eBay executive, claims to help tackle chronic diseases, which account for more than three-quarters of U.S. health-care spending, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""People don't know how to manage these conditions,"" Tilenius said in an interview with Reuters.Tilenius said she started the company after witnessing her father struggling with his health, while existing coaching tools were too expensive, she added. For $15 a week, patients can ask questions, and receive  medication reminders and health advice from Vida's team of coaches including nurses, medical assistants, nutritionists and doctors. To ensure high-quality care, Tilenius said the company only accepted and trained 1 percent of people who applied to be a coach, who are paid on an hourly basis.  Doctors and other caregivers can request access to the app to monitor progress over time. Tilenius has made previous forays into healthcare. She co-founded an online pharmacy startup called PlanetRx in the 1990s but did not return to the health sector until recently.The ""timing is right,"" she said. Apple Inc, Google Inc and other Silicon Valley tech giants are currently exploring opportunities in the relatively untapped field of healthcare.Capital funding for digital health systems in the first half of 2014 reached $2.3 billion, more than the total for all of the previous year, according to a study by Rock Health, which provides startups in the sector with funding and support.     Vida, which is available on Apple's iOS 8 operating system, is integrated with the iPhone maker's HealthKit service, so it can pull in patient-generated data from a variety of wearables and mobile medical devices, such as glucometers. An app for Google Android phones will be released in the coming months. Vida is also developing a database of clinical trials and disease prevention programs for users. Those include Dr. Mark Hyman's The Blood Sugar Soluton, a treatment program for diabetics and those at risk of contracting the disease. The startup is now partnering with major U.S. hospitals, like the MD Anderson Cancer Center and Duke University Hospital, which are using the app to deliver remote care to chronically ill patients. She said the company is testing its product with employers, but declined to provide details as those pilots are ongoing.""A lot of different vendors have been trying to solve this problem, but Vida can drive behavior change,"" said Jennifer Fonstad of Aspect Ventures, an early investor in the startup. Fonstad said employers are ""highly motivated"" to adopt tools that can help workers stay healthy and productive. Vida recently raised $5 million in startup funding from venture firms including Khosla Ventures, Aspect Ventures and Signia Venture Partners, as well as individuals like Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang.

The launch comes a year before U.S. merchants will have to meet a deadline to adopt “EMV” chip technology that would make credit cards more secure.Unlike older systems that will have to be expanded or replaced over time to support new innovations such as contactless mobile payments, Poynt says its terminal comes with a full range of capabilities at the same price.Its terminal, which will be disseminated to merchants by banks, can accept a variety of credit cards, including more secure chip-and-pin credit cards and Apple Pay, the mobile payments service Apple Inc launched last week. It also comes with wireless capability.“No one is tackling the terminal itself,” Bedier said in an interview. “A phone is an essential device for the consumer. The terminal is required device for the merchant.” The $299 device will be shipped to merchants in the first quarter, but developers can get an early version of the device for $499 in the fourth quarter. Poynt does not compete with the likes of Square and Stripe, which focus on other aspects of the payments, said Bedier, who left Google last year to work on Poynt full time.

513,"   By Kathryn Doyle  (Reuters Health) - The characteristic hardware of the Google Glass frame partially obstructs peripheral vision above the right eye, according to an ophthalmologist who owns the wearable tech himself.“I actually had Google Glass myself when it first came out, and I almost got into a car accident when I didn’t see a car coming from the right,” said Dr. Tsontcho Ianchulev of the University of California, San Francisco.“I realized as an ophthalmologist it was blocking a part of my visual field,” he told Reuters Health by phone.Google Glass is a small computer that’s mounted in frames that look like eyeglasses. A small monitor tucked into a corner of the frame lets users read email, check maps, and basically see what they’d see on their smartphone.In a recent study, Ianchulev and his colleagues compared Google Glass with regular eye wear to test its effect on visual function. Three healthy individuals with 20/20 best-corrected vision and normal baseline visual fields wore the device.After an hour of wearing Glass to get acclimated, they completed visual tests to assess their peripheral vision. Then the same three people completed the same tests wearing regular eyeglasses.All three participants had noticeable blind spots in the upper right area of the visual field, due only to the hardware of the frame, since the device was turned off and software was not running, the authors write in a research letter in JAMA. “Put on your favorite shades, glasses, baseball hat, or hoodie, and you’ll quickly see that this study tells us what we already know; wearing something on your face or head may affect your peripheral vision,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters Health in a statement. “From the beginning, the Glass team has worked closely with a range of experts to develop a device that is safe for use, and after extensive study they have not found any safety issues when it’s used correctly.”The spokesperson stressed the importance of wearing Glass correctly, which is reviewed in the introductory materials for setting up the device.The display should be positioned above the eye and not in front of it, according to the Glass quick start guide. Ianchulev and his team searched the Internet for images of Glass users to survey how people wear them. In about 30 percent of the images they saw, users had positioned the prism, or screen area, in front of the pupil of the right eye, which is likely to interfere with vision.According to the Glass FAQ page, consumers should follow the laws in their areas regarding using mobile devices while driving or bicycling, and should use care even within the law.“The population that wears Google Glass right now are young and very active,” Ianchulev said. “This is a small study, we just wanted to make people aware,” Ianchulev said. “There are thousands of these gadgets out there and people are biking, rollerblading, driving a car.”The blind spot could be minimized with a better fit or different design, he said. Glass is a one-size device but people have different-sized heads, he observed. The Glass help center indicates that its durable frame can be bent to fit any face.“One thing that was surprising was that Google announced a co-development project with Mercedes Benz in 2013,” Ianchulev said. “That’s probably not a great idea.”Glass is a good tool for specific tasks and at work, he noted.“I don’t use it that much in sports and activity,” Ianchulev said. “I wouldn’t personally drive with it.”SOURCE: bit.ly/1usmQlg JAMA 2014.",2014-11-04,GOOGL,"Tue Nov 4, 2014 | 4:56pm EST",Google Glass may obstruct peripheral vision,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-google-glass-vision-idUSKBN0IO28R20141104?type=companyNews
514,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS A senior EU official criticized a series of public meetings held in Europe by Google on a landmark court ruling on the ""right to be forgotten"", saying the meetings were part of lobbying efforts against EU data protection rules.Paul Nemitz, a director in the European Commission's justice department, made his comments at Google's Brussels meeting, the last in the series of meetings aimed at helping the world's most popular Internet search engine implement the judgment.The European Union's top court ruled in May that search engines were responsible for content that pops up under searches for people's names and so must remove links to information deemed ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"".Google subsequently set up an advisory council staffed by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, lawyers, former regulators and a philosopher to come up with recommendations to the U.S. firm.The council, which has held seven meetings so far across the EU, will draft a report in January next year. Nemitz said such gatherings suggest Google may not be so amenable toward Europe's privacy rules. ""In Brussels of course we are used to big-time lobbying activities, and as some have commented these panels may in part be a good-faced (well-intentioned) effort to find practical solutions to the problem, but in part of course also they may be passive-aggressiveness toward our data protection rules and our jurisprudence,"" he said at the Brussels meeting.

515,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Nov 4 A senior EU official criticised a series of public meetings held in Europe by Google  on a landmark court ruling on the ""right to be forgotten"", saying the meetings were part of lobbying efforts against EU data protection rules.Paul Nemitz, a director in the European Commission's justice department, made his comments at Google's Brussels meeting, the last in the series of meetings aimed at helping the world's most popular Internet search engine implement the judgement.The European Union's top court ruled in May that search engines were responsible for content that pops up under searches for people's names and so must remove links to information deemed ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"".Google subsequently set up an advisory council staffed by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, lawyers, former regulators and a philosopher to come up with recommendations to the U.S. firm. The council, which has held seven meetings so far across the EU, will draft a report in January next year.Nemitz said such gatherings suggest Google may not be so amenable towards Europe's privacy rules. ""In Brussels of course we are used to big-time lobbying activities, and as some have commented these panels may in part be a good-faced (well-intentioned) effort to find practical solutions to the problem, but in part of course also they may be passive-aggressiveness towards our data protection rules and our jurisprudence,"" he said at the Brussels meeting.The meetings have been criticised as a ""PR war"" against the ruling by data protection authorities, who have also said it seeks to create doubts about the ruling.

520,"   By Harro Ten Wolde and Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Germany's biggest news publisher Axel Springer has scrapped a move to block Google from running snippets of articles from its newspapers, saying that the experiment had caused traffic to its sites to plunge.Springer said a two-week-old experiment to restrict access by Google to some of its publications had caused web traffic to plunge for these sites, leading it to row back and let Google once again showcase Springer news stories in its search results.Chief Executive Mathias Doepfner said on Wednesday that his company would have ""shot ourselves out of the market"" if it had continued with its demands for the U.S. firm to pay licensing fees. Springer had sought to restrict Google's use of news from four of its top-selling brands: welt.de, computerbild.de, sportbild.de and autobild.de, the company said.Springer, which publishes Europe's top-selling daily newspaper Bild, said Google's grip over online audiences was too great to resist, a double-edged compliment meant to ram home the publisher's criticism of what it calls Google's monopoly powers.Publishers in countries from Germany and France to Spain have pushed to pass new national copyright laws that force Google and other web aggregators to pay licensing fees - dubbed the Google Tax - when they publish snippets of their news articles.Under German legislation that came into effect last year, publishers can prohibit search engines and similar services from using their news articles beyond headlines. Last week, Spain's upper house passed a similar law giving publishers an ""inalienable"" right to levy such licensing fees on Google.Seeking to capitalize on the German law, two weeks ago VG Media - a consortium of around 200 German publishers, including Springer - said that Google could no longer publish snippets of text and images from their publications.Google complied and ran only headlines of articles to limit their liability. It requires publishers who want their content to continue to show up in Google search results to give it explicit permission to do so and freedom from any liability for licensing fees under such laws. CALL TO REGULATORS Springer said traffic flowing from clicks on Google search results had fallen by 40 percent and traffic delivered via Google News had plummeted by 80 percent in the past two weeks. Doepfner said the resulting dramatic drop in traffic to his company's publications was proof of Google's overwhelming power in the search market. He said he hoped lawmakers, courts and competition regulators would take action to curb its powers. ""Others will have to pick up the ball now,"" the Springer boss told reporters on a conference call following the publication of the Berlin-based company's quarterly results.A Google spokesman in Germany praised Springer's decision. ""The decision shows that Google is making a significant contribution to the economic success of news publishers,"" the spokesman said.He said Google delivers more than half a billion clicks to German news sites per month. The search company has paid more than one billion euros in online advertising fees to German media publishers in the last three years, the spokesman said. ""Google wants to work in the future with publishers on new models to promote their websites and apps to increase traffic and to support digital publishing,"" he said.    The German cartel office in August decided not to pursue a complaint against Google by a group of publishers, including Springer, saying that the scope of new legislation was not yet entirely clear.

The U.S. firm accounts for more than 80 percent of the European Internet search market and more than 90 percent of that in Germany.The European Union's new digital commissioner Guenther Oettinger said last month that he was mulling a regional Internet copyright levy, taking aim at Google.

524,"   By Caroline Copley | ZURICH  ZURICH Google's ambition to defy the limits of ageing has fired up interest in the field, drawing in drug companies who are already quietly pioneering research, despite the regulatory and clinical hurdles that remain.In September life-science company Calico, which was set up by Google last year to investigate the aging process, joined with U.S. drugmaker AbbVie in committing an initial $250 million apiece to developing cures for age-related diseases.Away from the limelight, however, Switzerland's Novartis and Denmark's Novo Nordisk are already testing new roles for existing drugs, which could keep people alive for longer, as they look to cater to the ever larger numbers living into their 80s and beyond.""Everybody now is talking about the aging population and how to have a healthy old age,"" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Chief Science Officer at Novo Nordisk.By 2020 people aged 60 and older will outnumber children younger than five for the first time in history, according to a paper published in the Lancet medical journal on Thursday.But with greater age comes a bigger burden of disease.At least 300 million people will suffer from diabetes by 2025, the World Health Organization estimates, while the global number of dementia sufferers is expected to triple to 135 million by 2050.The goal is not to create some ""elixir of life"" pill to help people live ever longer, but rather to maximize healthy lifespan and reduce the period of end-of-life sickness and dependency.Alex Zhavoronkov, chief executive of Baltimore-based biotech company Insilico Medicine, believes shifting healthcare spending from treatment to prevention will be central to this.""Instead of trying to keep a person alive for another three to six months and essentially bankrupting healthcare systems, it might make sense to introduce drugs that prevent the onset of age-related diseases and aging itself,"" he said. IMMUNE SYSTEM BOOSTER Research into anti-ageing drugs has historically received little attention from Big Pharma, given the difficulties of running clinical trials to prove such an effect.Moreover, companies have been deterred by regulators in the United States and Europe who will only approve medicines for specific illnesses and not for something as broad as aging, which is not in itself defined as a treatable disease.Despite these obstacles, Novartis has completed a successful pilot trial examining its cancer drug everolimus as a potential treatment to reverse immunosenescence, or the gradual deterioration of the immune system that occurs with age and is a major cause of disease and death.  Encouraged by studies showing that the closely related drug rapamycin extended the lifespan of worms, flies and mice, Novartis looked for ways to assess whether everolimus could have a similar effect in humans.The hurdles were high. Aging is a gradual, decades-long process making it impractical to assess directly in clinical trials. ""For aging you have to pick a target system that can be investigated in months or years, not decades,"" said Novartis's  head of research Mark Fishman.The company's work-around is to focus on immunosenescence. It gave 218 people aged over 65 a six-week course of everolimus followed by a regular flu vaccine after two weeks.Results showed that taking the drug improved the immune system response by more than 20 percent compared to placebo, potentially opening the door to use it as a treatment to increase the efficacy of vaccines and help stave off the infections associated with old age.While Fishman stresses the research is still early-stage, Novartis's work highlights the growing interest in aging as a biological process that can be manipulated, treated and delayed.  OLD DRUGS, NEW PURPOSE Given the regulatory barriers, experts believe re-purposing existing treatments in new indications will likely be the fastest way to get drugs with an anti-ageing benefit to market, since these medicines have already been proven safe.A study published in the journal Neuropharmacology this week found lixisenatide, a drug sold as Lyxumia by Sanofi to treat type 2 diabetes, could slow nerve cell damage in mice with some of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.

539,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Nov 13 A U.S. appeals court appeared skeptical of mobile phone maker Motorola Mobility's attempt to sue several Asian suppliers for price-fixing, signaling a possible blow to the reach of U.S. antitrust law overseas.At a Chicago hearing on Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals questioned whether the allegations had enough connection to the United States to be heard in U.S. courts.Motorola Mobility, a unit of China's Lenovo Group Ltd , sued the suppliers in Chicago federal court in 2009, saying some of its subsidiaries had overpaid for liquid crystal display screens because of a conspiracy in Asia. Some screens entered the U.S. market, the lawsuit said.Judge Richard Posner, a member of the appeals panel, questioned the consistency of the company's legal positions. ""For tax purposes, you treat the foreign subsidiaries as separate, but for antitrust purposes, you treat them as part of Motorola,"" Posner said.Motorola Mobility lawyer Thomas Goldstein said the company should be able to sue under U.S. law because a former Chicago-based parent negotiated its supply contracts.Lenovo bought Motorola Mobility in October for $2.91 billion from Google Inc, which had bought it in 2012. Motorola Mobility says it paid the LCD makers more than $5 billion from 1996 to 2006. Defendants named in the lawsuit are AU Optronics Corp , Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd, HannStar Display Corp, LG Display Co Ltd, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Samsung SDI Co Ltd, Panasonic Corp unit Sanyo, Sharp Corp and Toshiba Corp.The appeals court ruled against Motorola Mobility in March but agreed to hear the case again after the Obama administration said the ruling threatened its ability to prosecute global price-fixing. The U.S. Justice Department, whose investigation of global LCD price-fixing led to more than $1.3 billion in criminal fines, asked the court to find that the conspiracy directly affected U.S. commerce.The governments of Belgium and Japan filed briefs criticizing the reach of U.S. antitrust law and urging the court to rule for the suppliers.The appeals court could issue a decision any time.The case is Motorola Mobility v.

541,"   By Alexei Oreskovic, Sarah McBride and Malathi Nayak | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO After two years of popping up at high-profile events sporting  Google Glass, the gadget that transforms eyeglasses into spy-movie worthy technology, Google co-founder Sergey Brin sauntered bare-faced into a Silicon Valley red-carpet event on Sunday.He'd left his pair in the car, Brin told a reporter. The Googler, who heads up the top-secret lab which developed Glass, has hardly given up on the product -- he recently wore his pair to the beach.But Brin's timing is not propitious, coming as many developers and early Glass users are losing interest in the much-hyped, $1,500 test version of the product: a camera, processor and stamp-sized computer screen mounted to the edge of eyeglass frames. Google Inc itself has pushed back the Glass roll out to the mass market.While Glass may find some specialized, even lucrative, uses in the workplace, its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim, many developers say.Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device. Three more have switched to developing for business, leaving behind consumer projects.Plenty of larger developers remain with Glass. The nearly 100 apps on the official web site include Facebook and OpenTable, although one major player recently defected: Twitter.""If there was 200 million Google Glasses sold, it would be a different perspective. There’s no market at this point,"" said Tom Frencel, the Chief Executive of Little Guy Games, which put development of a Glass game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms, including the Facebook Inc-owned virtual-reality goggles Oculus Rift.Several key Google employees instrumental to developing Glass have left the company in the last six months, including lead developer Babak Parviz, electrical engineering chief Adrian Wong, and Ossama Alami, director of developer relations.And a Glass funding consortium created by Google Ventures and two of Silicon Valley's biggest venture capitalists, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Andreessen Horowitz, quietly deleted its website, routing users to the main Glass site.Google insists it is committed to Glass, with hundreds of engineers and executives working on it, as well as new fashionista boss Ivy Ross, a former Calvin Klein executive. Tens of thousands use Glass in the pilot consumer program.“We are completely energized and as energized as ever about the opportunity that wearables and Glass in particular represent,"" said Glass Head of Business Operations Chris O'Neill. Glass was the first project to emerge from Google’s X division, the secretive group tasked with developing “moonshot” products such as self-driving cars. Glass and wearable devices overall amount to a new technology, as smartphones once were, that will likely take time to evolve into a product that clicks with consumers. “We are as committed as ever to a consumer launch. That is going to take time and we are not going to launch this product until it’s absolutely ready,” O'Neill said. Brin had predicted a launch this year, but 2015 is now the most likely date, a person familiar with the matter said. GLASS SELLING... ON EBAY After an initial burst of enthusiasm, signs that consumers are giving up on Glass have been building.  Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users as ""Explorers."" But as the Explorers hit the streets, they drew stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy intrusion, deriding the once-proud Explorers as “Glassholes.”“It looks super nerdy,” said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a drawer. “I’m a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too many.” Glass now sells on eBay for as little as half list price.Some developers recently have felt unsupported by investors and, at times, Google itself.The Glass Collective, the funding consortium co-run by Google Ventures, invested in only three or four small start-ups by the beginning of this year, a person familiar with the statistics said. A Google Ventures spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of investments and said the Web site was closed for simplicity. ""We just found it's easier for entrepreneurs to come to us directly,"" she said.The lack of a launch date has given some developers the impression that Google still treats Glass as an experiment.“It’s not a big enough platform to play on seriously,"" said Matthew Milan, founder of Toronto-based software firm Normative Design, which put on hold a Glass app for logging exercise and biking.Mobile game company Glu Mobile, known for its popular “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood” title, was one of the first to launch a game on Glass. Spellista, a puzzler released a year ago, is still available, but Glu has discontinued work on it, a spokesman for the company said.  Another developer, Sean McCracken, won $10,000 in a contest last year for creating an aliens-themed video game for Glass, Psyclops, but Google never put it on the official hub for Glass apps, making it tougher to find. He has quit working on updates.Still, there are some enthusiastic developers. Cycling and running app Strava finds Glass well-suited for its users, who want real-time data on their workouts, said David Lorsch, vice president of business development. And entrepreneur Jake Steinerman said it is ideal for his company, DriveSafe, which detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel. PIVOTING AWAY In April, Google launched the Glass at Work program to help make the device useful for specific industries, such as healthcare and manufacturing. So far the effort has resulted in apps that are being tested or used at companies such as Boeing and Yum Brands' Taco Bell. Google is selling Glass in bulk to some businesses, offering two-for-one discounts.CrowdOptic, which uses Glass as portable computers for surgeons and other people out of offices, is currently in use at 19 U.S. hospitals and expects that to grow to 100 hospitals early next year, said Chief Executive Jon Fisher.Alex Foster began See Through, a Glass advertising analytics firm for business, after a venture firm earlier this year withdrew its offer to back his consumer-oriented Glass fitness company when it became clear no big consumer Glass release was imminent. ""It was devastating,"" he said. ""All of the consumer glass startups are either completely dead or have pivoted,"" to enterprise products or rival wearables.

Mayer would not disclose the financial terms other than to say that the partnership is a revenue sharing agreement and includes certain ""guarantees.""The partnership, which integrates Yahoo search into Firefox's browser for desktop PCs and mobile devices such as smartphones, will produce a ""share gain"" for Yahoo, Mayer said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. The Mozilla deal means that users of the Firefox browser in the U.S. will automatically be routed to search results on Yahoo's website when they type a query into the small box that appears at the top of the browser.""It's one of the largest independently-directed search share opportunities available in the market,"" Mayer said, declining to estimate how much of a boost Yahoo expected to receive from the deal. Yahoo's share of the U.S. search market on desktop PCs is currently about 10 percent, according to industry research firm comScore, compared to Microsoft's roughly 20 percent and Google's 67 percent.Google previously served as the default search option for users of the Firefox Web browser on an international basis. With Google's three-year deal coming to an end, Mozilla has struck deals with several search engines in different regions, including Baidu Inc in China and Yandex NV in Russia. Yahoo said it has revamped the look of its search engine, making more use of rich graphics and photos, for the Firefox partnership. The Web search results will continue to be powered by Microsoft, in keeping with the 10-year partnership that Yahoo and Microsoft began in 2010.Firefox had 10.4 percent of the U.S. browser market on desktop PCs, mobile smartphones and tablets last month, according to tech data firm StatCounter.

551,"   By Alexei Oreskovic, Julia Fioretti and Alastair Macdonald  The European Parliament is preparing a non-binding resolution that proposes splitting Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) search engine operations in Europe from the rest of its business as one possible option to rein in the Internet company’s dominance in the search market.European politicians have grown increasingly concerned about Google's and other American companies' command of the Internet industry, and have sought ways to curb their power. A public call for a break-up would be the most far-reaching action proposed and a significant threat to Google's business.The draft motion does not mention Google or any specific search engine, though Google is by far the dominant provider of such services in Europe with an estimated 90 percent market share. Earlier on Friday, the Financial Times described a draft motion as calling for a break-up of Google.Google declined to comment.The motion seen by Reuters ""calls on the Commission to consider proposals with the aim of unbundling search engines from other commercial services as one potential long-term solution"" to leveling the competitive playing field.Parliament has no power to initiate legislation and lacks the authority to break up corporations, and while the draft motion is a non-binding resolution, it would step up the pressure on the European Commission to act against Google. Google already faces stern criticism in Europe about everything from privacy to tax policies, and has been wrestling with a European court’s ruling that requires it to remove links from search results that individuals find objectionable.The company has grown so large as to inspire distrust in many corners, with a chorus of public criticism from politicians and business executives.""It’s a strong expression of the fact that things are going to change,” said Gary Reback, a U.S. attorney who has filed complaints on behalf of companies against Google over fair search. “The parliament doesn’t bind the commission for sure, but they have to listen.” RESOLUTION “VERY LIKELY” TO BE ADOPTED Europe's new antitrust chief said she would take some time to decide on the next step of the four-year investigation into the Internet search leader, after her predecessor had scrapped a proposed settlement with the company.European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who took over from Joaquin Almunia on Nov. 1, said she would take a representative sample of views from parties involved in the case and check on the latest industry developments before taking any action.Resentment, however, has been building in Europe for years.    Google has tried to counter that mistrust, which its executives believe is linked to European perceptions of the United States in general. But recent revelations about U.S. surveillance practices, including that Washington monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone, have ignited a strong backlash, particularly in Germany, where the historic experiences of Nazism and Communism have left people deeply suspicious of powerful institutions controlling personal data. Andreas Schwab, the German Christian Democrat lawmaker who co-sponsored the resolution, told Reuters it was “very likely” it would be adopted as both his own center-right group, the largest in parliament, and the main center-left group supported it. Schwab proposed the resolution along with Spanish centrist Ramon Tremosa earlier this week.In a statement on Wednesday, the two said Google had failed to propose adequate remedies during the antitrust investigation by the commission. Vestager has said she wants time to study the dossier after her predecessor decided against a settlement with Google that would have ended the case.Google ”continued thereby to suppress competition to the detriment of European consumers and businesses,“ Schwab and Tremosa said.In a position paper, they cited a number of possible solutions to what they saw as Google’s abusive dominant position in search engines and its ability to drive Internet traffic to favored sites. If these failed, then, they suggested, legislation should be tried.“In case the proceedings against Google carry on without any satisfying decisions and the current anti-competitive behavior continues to exist, a regulation of the dominant online web search should be envisaged,” they said. Reflecting broad suspicion of Google, other parties in parliament may also support the non-binding resolution.Jan Philipp Albrecht of the Greens said: ""Search engines like Google should not be allowed to use their market power to push forward other commercial activities of the same company.Officials at the European Commission could not be immediately reached for comment.It was also not clear how U.S. regulators would respond. In a major victory for Google, U.S. regulators in 2013 ended an investigation into the Internet company and concluded that it had not manipulated Web search results to hurt rivals. It did get Google to agree to change some of its business practices, including halting the ""scraping"" of reviews and other data from rivals' websites for its own products.Rivals such as Yelp Inc (YELP.N) argue that the company is squeezing them out in Internet search results.The review site, which has complained that Google ranks its own content higher than Yelp's, said on Friday that the Internet search service harms users by favoring its own products, for instance social network Google+, which also carries review content.""By hardwiring Google+ in the largest category of search, Google isn’t just stifling innovation, it's harming consumers,"" Luther Lowe, Yelp Director of Public Policy, told Reuters.

Earlier on Friday, the Financial Times described a draft motion as calling for a break-up of Google.Google declined to comment.The motion seen by Reuters ""calls on the Commission to consider proposals with the aim of unbundling search engines from other commercial services as one potential long-term solution"" to leveling the competitive playing field.Parliament has no power to initiate legislation and lacks the authority to break up corporations, and while the draft motion is a non-binding resolution, it would step up the pressure on the European Commission to act against Google.Google already faces stern criticism in Europe about everything from privacy to tax policies, and has been wrestling with a European court's ruling that requires it to remove links from search results that individuals find objectionable.The company has grown so large as to inspire distrust in many corners, with a chorus of public criticism from politicians and business executives. ""It's a strong expression of the fact that things are going to change,"" said Gary Reback, a U.S. attorney who has filed complaints on behalf of companies against Google over fair search. ""The parliament doesn't bind the commission for sure, but they have to listen.""RESOLUTION ""VERY LIKELY"" TO BE ADOPTED Europe's new antitrust chief said she would take some time to decide on the next step of the four-year investigation into the Internet search leader, after her predecessor had scrapped a proposed settlement with the company.European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who took over from Joaquin Almunia on Nov. 1, said she would take a representative sample of views from parties involved in the case and check on the latest industry developments before taking any action. Resentment, however, has been building in Europe for years.Google has tried to counter that mistrust, which its executives believe is linked to European perceptions of the United States in general. But recent revelations about U.S. surveillance practices, including that Washington monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone, have ignited a strong backlash, particularly in Germany, where the historic experiences of Nazism and Communism have left people deeply suspicious of powerful institutions controlling personal data.Andreas Schwab, the German Christian Democrat lawmaker who co-sponsored the resolution, told Reuters it was ""very likely"" it would be adopted as both his own centre-right group, the largest in parliament, and the main centre-left group supported it. Schwab proposed the resolution along with Spanish centrist Ramon Tremosa earlier this week.In a statement on Wednesday, the two said Google had failed to propose adequate remedies during the antitrust investigation by the commission. Vestager has said she wants time to study the dossier after her predecessor decided against a settlement with Google that would have ended the case.Google ""continued thereby to suppress competition to the detriment of European consumers and businesses,"" Schwab and Tremosa said. In a position paper, they cited a number of possible solutions to what they saw as Google's abusive dominant position in search engines and its ability to drive Internet traffic to favored sites. If these failed, then, they suggested, legislation should be tried.""In case the proceedings against Google carry on without any satisfying decisions and the current anti-competitive behavior continues to exist, a regulation of the dominant online web search should be envisaged,"" they said.Reflecting broad suspicion of Google, other parties in parliament may also support the non-binding resolution.Jan Philipp Albrecht of the Greens said: ""Search engines like Google should not be allowed to use their market power to push forward other commercial activities of the same company.Officials at the European Commission could not be immediately reached for comment.It was also not clear how U.S. regulators would respond. In a major victory for Google, U.S. regulators in 2013 ended an investigation into the Internet company and concluded that it had not manipulated Web search results to hurt rivals. It did get Google to agree to change some of its business practices, including halting the ""scraping"" of reviews and other data from rivals' websites for its own products.Rivals such as Yelp Inc argue that the company is squeezing them out in Internet search results.The review site, which has complained that Google ranks its own content higher than Yelp's, said on Friday that the Internet search service harms users by favoring its own products, for instance social network Google+, which also carries review content.""By hardwiring Google+ in the largest category of search, Google isn't just stifling innovation, it's harming consumers,"" Luther Lowe, Yelp Director of Public Policy, told Reuters.

559,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Nov 24 EU lawmakers will likely vote on Thursday on a motion proposing the break-up of Google  and other Internet technology companies, increasing political pressure on the bloc's antitrust regulators to take a stronger line on the group.The parliament has no power to dismember a firm. But the vote, underlining widespread concern among EU politicians about American dominance of the Internet industry, would be a significant public challenge to Google's business in Europe.Andreas Schwab, a German Christian Democrat lawmaker at the European Parliament, and Spanish liberal Ramon Tremosa unveiled a draft of their resolution last week, saying separating search engines from other commercial services would ensure a level playing field for rivals in Europe.The conservatives, liberals and socialists, who command a large majority of the parliamentary seats, will work out a joint motion on Tuesday and expect to debate the issue in parliament on Wednesday and vote on it on Thursday, Tremosa's aide said on Monday. European politicians and some competing companies have complained that Google's dominance allows it to promote its own services at rivals' expense, and attacked it on a range of issues including its tax and privacy policies.Google has regularly said it faces fierce competition in a constantly-changing market. The parliament's proposal to the commission, if passed, would put pressure on new EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to take a tougher line than her predecessor in resolving complaints against Google.Vestager's predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, held four years of investigations, triggered by complaints from rivals including Microsoft. German publishing group Axel Springer has also complained about Google's market power. The European Commission has never ordered the break-up of any company for anti-competitive practices.Kurt Lauk, the head of the pro-business wing of Germany's conservative party CDU, which is also Schwab's party, criticised the proposal to break up Google.""Instead of exploiting the opportunities of the Web, some lawmakers in the European Parliament are nursing their phobias,"" he told Saturday's edition of German paper Handelsblatt.""Threatening Google and other large Internet companies who are in fierce competition with each other, is a loser's debate,"" Lauk was quoted as saying.

568,"  (Repeats story unchanged)* Google in firing line in Europe as lawmakers vote on break-up* Though powerless, parliament tries to influence antitrust chief* Anti-American sentiment exists, but not main driver for attacks* U.S. rivals turning to EU to try and blunt Google's edgeBy Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, Nov 26 When EU politicians call for the break-up of Google, it can sound like sour grapes, the anti-American backlash of an ageing Europe envious, and fearful, of the wealth and growing power of young U.S. tech giants.But should any American take time on Thanksgiving to scoff at Thursday's non-binding vote in the European Parliament, when lawmakers may urge EU regulators to get tough with the search engine Goliath, they should know that behind the EU antitrust probe of Google stand not only Europeans but U.S. competitors.Indeed, to many in Brussels it is Google's fellow Americans - such as Microsoft, Expedia and TripAdvisor - whose complaints and big-money lobbying have driven a four-year-old investigation by the powerful European Commission into whether Google abuses its dominance of Internet searches to push favoured Web sites.""The American companies are using the European Commission as a battleground among themselves,"" a senior EU official told Reuters. ""They are the ones coming to us with complaints.""They are the ones who are not happy when rivals present concessions and say these are not enough."" U.S. companies like Microsoft, hit by a $700-million fine last year for foisting its flagging Explorer browser on PC buyers, are well aware of the Commission's power in the world's biggest economic bloc. It also may seem more aggressive than its counterpart in Washington, which last year dropped its own case inquiry into Google, concluding the firm had not broken rules.Three attempts it made to reach a settlement were turned down by EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, who agreed with Google's rivals that concessions it offered to avoid a fine of up to $5 billion were not enough. The case is now in the hands of Margrethe Vestager, who succeeded Almunia this month.U.S. tech firms ""are all playing on a little playing field"", said Bert Foer, head of Washington think-tank the American Antitrust Institute. ""Naturally they're going to move fastest and farthest in jurisdictions that have more favourable laws.""While there's not a whole lot of difference between American antitrust law and European antitrust law, there is a difference in enforcement style and aggressiveness right now. So it's not surprising that a lot of the fight is over there. And it's not surprising that a lot of the companies are American.""""It's simply not about one side of the ocean against the other,"" said Thomas Vinje, a partner in the Brussels office of London law firm Clifford Chance. He is advising FairSearch, a group of firms including Microsoft, Oracle and Twenga in their complaint against Google with the European Commission. ""Never has a competition case brought together such a geographical or industrial breadth of concerned parties. There's just never been anything like it,"" said Vinje. ""Probably never has any company exerted so much power on so many key markets.""TRANSATLANTIC SUSPICION That is not to say that there is no anti-U.S. animus in Europe, among the public and some politicians. It is a fact Google, which declined comment for this article, highlights in portraying itself at times as caught in Transatlantic crossfire.Last year's revelations of U.S. spying on the digital doings of Europeans, including even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, heightened mistrust of U.S. power in the digital world - though Europeans still use Google overwhelmingly to search the Web. Google suffered a setback this year when the EU supreme court upheld a ""right to be forgotten"", ordering it to block links to information if people request it. It also faces legal challenges over copyright fees, led notably by German publishers, and over a variety of privacy concerns.Underscoring a sense of siege following the drafting of the resolution in the European Parliament, the U.S. mission to the EU in Brussels issued a statement appealing for objectivity so that the antitrust case was not ""politicised"".Vinje, however, said talk of anti-Americanism was overdone and accused Google executives of ""pushing the line that its troubles are driven by anti-U.S. sentiments in Europe"" to gloss over what he said were real concerns about its business.Antitrust lawyer Alfonso Lamadrid at the Brussels office of Spanish firm Garrigues said the legal troubles of Google, and other U.S. firms, simply reflected their global success: ""It is mainly because in most cases U.S. firms are the allegedly dominant players worldwide. I wish more European firms were in a position to be subject to similar investigations in the U.S.""Michael Marelus, at the Brussels office of Anglo-American law firm DLA Piper which is not directly involved in the Google case, also played down the political elements of the EU inquiry:""Politics is clearly and heavily involved in any statement made by the European Parliament and very much so in the parliament's call to consider unbundling Google,"" he said.""It would however be unfair to say that U.S. companies are being targeted as such ... It seems that parliament is taking an aggressive stand in considering unbundling Google in the hope of ultimately obtaining a more realistic commitment from it.""The resolution, being debated in parliament on Wednesday, was proposed by a German conservative and Spanish liberal.

587,"  (Adds comments from accountancy firm, opinion poll)By Tom Bergin and William JamesLONDON Dec 9 A British tax on companies that shift profits out of the country and into tax havens will target inter-company fees for services such as the use of intellectual property, according to draft legislation published on Wednesday.Companies will also be required to report their potential liability to the new tax, which will sit outside the existing corporate tax system, under the changes outlined by finance minister George Osborne last week.Such a move could avoid legal challenges under existing tax treaties with countries such as Ireland, a major conduit for shifted profits.Recouping cash is important to Osborne as Britain's public finances have become a major issue in the run-up to national elections in May. Osborne said last week that he wanted to raise a further 5 billion pounds by tightening rules on tax avoidance.Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at accounting group ACCA, said the 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) expected to be raised by the new tax over the next five years was modest given the size of the UK operations of the firms likely to be affected. George Bull, a senior tax partner at accountancy firm Baker Tilly, was also surprised by the low amount.""Perhaps (Britain's tax department) has deliberately downplayed these figures so that the move is seen less as a 'money spinner', and more about leading the reform of the taxation of international corporates?"" he said in a statement.An opinion poll published on Wednesday showed the announcement was popular among voters, with 59 percent of respondents in a survey by polling firm ComRes for ITV News saying they were in favour of the tax. The Treasury said the 25 percent tax would be effective from April 1, 2015, and would target conduit-type structures, such as the ""double-Irish"" used by Google.In that manoeuvre, Google denies having a taxable presence in its main business in Britain and reports its annual UK revenue of more than $5 billion in Ireland. It then pays most of this to a Bermudan affiliate as a fee for using Google's intellectual property.Under the new rule, the charge paid to the Bermudan affiliate could be reduced by the UK tax authority when assessing how much profit is linked to UK activities.ACCA's Roy-Chowdhury said legal challenges to the new diverted profits tax would still be possible. ""Just because the UK says the DPT is not Corporation Tax, this does not mean that other jurisdictions will accept it as such,"" he said.

590,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc, which has been criticized for exacerbating income inequality in San Francisco, on Thursday said it will donate $2 million to help the city’s large homeless population. The Internet search company, which is making the grant commitments through its philanthropic arm Google.org, said it would support three local homeless groups: HandUp, Hamilton Family Center and Larkin Street Youth Services. The most recent 2013 tally of San Francisco’s homeless population found that 6,436 adults were living on the streets and in shelters. The actual number is thought to be higher, despite the city’s $165 million budget to make a dent in the homeless population through supportive housing and other efforts. Hamilton Family Center will receive $1 million to reduce the waiting list for homeless families at shelters in San Francisco. Larkin Street said it will use its $500,000 grant for its college and career preparation programs.  Google said it has reserved the remaining $500,000 for San Francisco-based HandUp, an application for direct giving to homeless people. HandUp has received backing from such high-profile technology investors as Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff and ‘Lean Startup’ founder Eric Ries, among others. Through the month of December, HandUp said Google will match new recurring donations made to its San Francisco fund.Technology companies have come under fire in recent years for adding to the problem of growing income inequality, with buses that ferry workers the 40 miles from San Francisco to its offices in Mountain View, Calif., becoming symbols of gentrification.  San Francisco has the second highest gap between rich and poor in the United States, second only to Atlanta, Georgia, according to a Brookings Institution report. And evictions in the city are at their highest levels since 2001-2, according to the latest report from the San Francisco Rent Board. Google said it has given $100 million to Bay Area nonprofit organizations since 2010.

591,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dec 11 Google Inc, which has been criticized for exacerbating income inequality in San Francisco, on Thursday said it will donate $2 million to help the city's large homeless population.The Internet search company, which is making the grant commitments through its philanthropic arm Google.org, said it would support three local homeless groups: HandUp, Hamilton Family Center and Larkin Street Youth Services.The most recent 2013 tally of San Francisco's homeless population found that 6,436 adults were living on the streets and in shelters. The actual number is thought to be higher, despite the city's $165 million budget to make a dent in the homeless population through supportive housing and other efforts. Hamilton Family Center will receive $1 million to reduce the waiting list for homeless families at shelters in San Francisco. Larkin Street said it will use its $500,000 grant for its college and career preparation programs.Google said it has reserved the remaining $500,000 for San Francisco-based HandUp, an application for direct giving to homeless people. HandUp has received backing from such high-profile technology investors as Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff and 'Lean Startup' founder Eric Ries, among others. Through the month of December, HandUp said Google will match new recurring donations made to its San Francisco fund. Technology companies have come under fire in recent years for adding to the problem of growing income inequality, with buses that ferry workers the 40 miles from San Francisco to its offices in Mountain View, Calif., becoming symbols of gentrification. San Francisco has the second highest gap between rich and poor in the United States, second only to Atlanta, Georgia, according to a Brookings Institution report. And evictions in the city are at their highest levels since 2001-2, according to the latest report from the San Francisco Rent Board.Google said it has given $100 million to Bay Area nonprofit organizations since 2010.Google.org's portfolio manager for the Bay Area, Justin Steele, said the storm that has been raging in San Francisco Thursday serves as a reminder of the important role of local non-profits to help vulnerable populations.

592,"   By Eric Auchard | LONDON  LONDON Google said it plans to close its news-linking service in Spain in response to legislation under which publishers will soon be able to force Internet sites to pay for re-publishing headlines or snippets of news.In a statement, the search giant said the new law makes the Google News service unsustainable and that it will remove Spanish publishers from Google News sites worldwide and shut down this service in Spain on 16 December.The move also means readers in Latin America and around the globe will no longer find links to articles from any Spanish news publishers on Google News.The change to the copyright law, which is set to take effect in January, only applies to news aggregation sites such as Google News or domestic rival Meneame. It does not prevent Google users in Spain or elsewhere from reading snippets of the same stories when they look up news in Google search results, where Google stands to capitalise by selling ads alongside news stories that turn up.""The new law requires publishers to charge Google News for showing even the smallest snippets of their content -- whether they want to charge or not,"" the company said. Google News displays no advertising and makes no revenue from the service, it noted.Google's action caps a decade of acrimony with news publishers who blame the search giant for revenue and readership declines. The company maintains that it sends millions of clicks that allow news sites to make money via online advertising. The stand-off also comes amid a growing campaign by politicians, regulators and courts across Europe to rein in Google's power over the Internet search market and the impact it has on deeply ingrained social norms around personal privacy.The European Union's recently installed digital commissioner Guenther Oettinger said in October that he was mulling a regional Internet copyright levy, taking aim at Google. In recent years, publishers in countries from Germany and France to Spain have pushed to pass new national copyright laws that force Google and other web aggregators to pay licensing fees when they publish snippets of their news articles.In Spain and Germany, these laws require publishers who want their content to continue to show up in Google search results to give the company explicit permission to do so. Google has responded by requiring publishers to release it from any liability for licensing fees under such laws. The Spanish law thwarts this by giving publishers an ""inalienable"" right to levy licensing fees. However, in November, Germany's largest publisher, Axel Springer scrapped a bid to block Google after an experiment by a consortium of about 200 German publishers caused online traffic to plunge. Internet search experts say the shutdown of Google News in Spain may be greater on smaller, less-well known news publishers than on name-brand news sites who are less reliant on the site to draw in readers. For the top five Spanish news sites (ElPais.com, ElMundo.es, ABC.es, LaVanguardia.com and ElPeriodico.com), referrals from sites such as Google News are responsible for less than a quarter of traffic, ranging from 8 percent for ABC to 21 percent for La Vanguardia, according to online traffic measurement firm SimilarWeb. Social networks such as Facebook make up a smaller amount.Google's move also does not appear to affect current agreements it has with major Spanish publishers to supply them with ad-serving technology that in effect creates a private ad marketplace to support their respective publications.Reacting to the announcement, the Spanish ministry of education, culture and sport said the company was making a business decision to pull out of certain services but that the government remained open to negotiation about how it implemented what its statement referred to as a 'Google tax'.

Hi.Q, a free app for the Apple Inc iPhone and iPad launching on Monday, includes 10,000 questions across 300 topics, such as food allergies, childhood health, and portion control. After taking the test, users are given a breakdown of their expertise across certain health areas.Founder and Chief Executive Officer Munjal Shah, who sold his prior company Like.com to Google Inc in 2010, said early data show a strong correlation between health literacy and obesity. Shah's team is also tracking whether a person's health knowledge correlates with the rate of hospitalizations. The Hi.Q team believes that Silicon Valley jumped too quickly into developing wearable devices to track fitness and wellbeing. A recent study from research firm Endeavor Partners found that one-third of people who owned a wearable stopped using it after six months.  Shah believes the first step to get more people engaged in their health on a daily basis should be ""quantified knowledge."" ""Wearables are ending up in a drawer, [and] I believe that's because most people fundamentally lack the practical knowledge to stay healthy in the modern world,"" he added.The company said 250,000 people have already used the app in its trial phase.

A judge on Thursday said she would require consumers suing Google over its Android smartphone operating system to submit more factual details in order for an antitrust lawsuit to proceed, at a time when the Internet search company faces increased regulatory pressure.The lawsuit filed earlier this year says Google Inc  requires Android handset manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to restrict competing apps like Microsoft Corp's Bing search, partly by making Google's own apps the default.The consumers claim these deals raise smartphone prices, because Google's rivals are not allowed to compete for premium placement on phone screens.At a hearing on Thursday in a San Jose, California, federal court, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman questioned whether that theory is too vague for the lawsuit to proceed. ""The speculative nature of the damages is really quite concerning to me,"" Freeman said.The judge said she would most likely dismiss the lawsuit, but give the plaintiffs an opportunity to revise it with additional facts to try to proceed on some legal claims.Last month, the European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a non-binding resolution urging antitrust authorities to break up Google.

612,"   By Alexei Oreskovic and Ben Klayman | SAN FRANCISCO/DETROIT  SAN FRANCISCO/DETROIT Google Inc (GOOGL.O) is laying the groundwork for a version of Android that would be built directly into cars, sources said, allowing drivers to enjoy all the benefits of the Internet without even plugging in their smartphones.The move is a major step up from Google's current Android Auto software, which comes with the latest version of its smartphone operating system and requires a phone to be plugged into a compatible car with a built-in screen to access streaming music, maps and other apps. Google, however, has never provided details or a timeframe for its long-term plan to put Android Auto directly into cars. The company now plans to do so when it rolls out the next version of its operating system, dubbed Android M, expected in a year or so, two people with knowledge of the matter said.The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly.""It provides a much stronger foothold for Google to really be part of the vehicle rather than being an add-on,"" said Thilo Koslowski, vice president and Automotive Practice Leader of industry research firm Gartner, who noted that he was unaware of Google's latest plans in this area.If successful, Android would become the standard system powering a car's entertainment and navigation features, solidifying Google's position in a new market where it is competing with arch-rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O). Google could also potentially access the valuable trove of data collected by a vehicle.Direct integration into cars ensures that drivers will use Google's services every time they turn on the ignition, without having to plug in the phone. It could allow Google to make more use of a car's camera, sensors, fuel gauge, and Internet connections that come with some newer car models.     Analysts said Google's plan could face various technical and business challenges, including convincing automakers to integrate its services so tightly into their vehicles.Google declined to comment.Technology companies are racing to design appliances, wristwatches and other gadgets that connect to the Internet. Automobiles are a particularly attractive prospect because Americans spend nearly 50 minutes per day on average on their commute, according to U.S. Census data.Apple unveiled its CarPlay software in March and Google has signed on dozens of companies, including Hyundai, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), for its Open Automotive Alliance and its Android Auto product.  Android Auto and CarPlay both currently ""project"" their smartphone apps onto the car's screen. Many of the first compatible cars with this smartphone plug-in functionality are expected to be on display at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next month and to go on sale in 2015.By building Android into a car, Google's services would not be at risk of switching off when a smartphone battery runs out of power, for example.""With embedded it's always on, always there,"" said one of the sources, referring to the built-in version of Android Auto. ""You don't have to depend on your phone being there and on."" Google's software could potentially connect to other car components, allowing, for example, a built-in navigation system like Google Maps to detect when fuel is low and provide directions to the nearest gas stations.By tapping into the car's components, Google could also gain valuable information to feed its data-hungry advertising business model. ""You can get access to GPS location, where you stop, where you travel everyday, your speed, your fuel level, where you stop for gas,"" one of the sources said.But the source noted that Android would need major improvements in performance and stability for carmakers to adopt it. In particular, Android Auto would need to power-up instantly when the driver turns the car on, instead of having to wait more than 30 seconds, as happens with many smartphones.Automakers might also be wary of giving Google access to in-car components that could raise safety and liability concerns, and be reluctant to give Google such a prime spot in their vehicles.""Automakers want to keep their brand appeal and keep their differentiation,"" said Mark Boyadjis, an analyst with industry research firm IHS Automotive. ""Automakers don't want to have a state of the industry where you get in any vehicle and it's just the same experience wherever you go.""

Prosecutors said a forensic examination of Perez's computer confirmed it was the device used to send the post in question. Perez appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kristen L. Mix on Tuesday to be advised of his rights and the charges against him. Prosecutors said he will be held in custody pending a detention and preliminary hearing scheduled for Dec. 29.

622,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO For years, Google Inc's commerce chief, Stephanie Tilenius, held a demanding job and helped oversee the medical care of her parents, an experience that led her to leave the Internet search giant in 2012 and start a company to help patients combat chronic disease. Earlier this year, Tilenius' company launched Vida, a mobile app that lets patients consult with a team of professionals, including doctors, nurses and nutritionists, from their smartphone. The program costs $15 a week and includes reminders to take medication. Caregivers and family members can request access to the app to keep up to date with a patient's progress. Tilenius said her father, who eventually died from heart disease, could not afford regular medical consultations that could have helped him lose weight and manage stress. ""There was a total lack of resources on my parents' side,"" Tilenius said in an interview. A growing number of high-level Silicon Valley executives from the ""sandwich generation” - those who are simultaneously caring for children and parents - have left their jobs to launch mobile and digital health startups.

624,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING  BEIJING Google Inc's Gmail was blocked in China after months of disruptions to the world's biggest email service, with an anti-censorship advocate suggesting the Great Firewall was to blame.Large numbers of Gmail Web addresses were cut off in China on Friday, said GreatFire.org, a China-based freedom of speech advocacy group. Users said the service was still down on Monday.""I think the government is just trying to further eliminate Google's presence in China and even weaken its market overseas,"" said a member of GreatFire.org, who uses a pseudonym. Google's own Transparency Report, which shows real-time traffic to Google services, displayed a sharp drop-off in traffic to Gmail from China on Friday.""We've checked and there's nothing wrong on our end,"" a Singapore-based spokesman for Google said in an email.In Washington, the U.S. State Department expressed concern over China's actions. ""We encourage China to be transparent in its dealings with international companies and to consider the market signal it sends with such acts,"" State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said. Almost all of Google's services have been heavily disrupted in China since June this year, but until last week Gmail users could still access emails downloaded via protocols like IMAP, SMTP and POP3. These had let people communicate using Gmail on apps like the Apple iPhone's Mail and Microsoft Outlook.China maintains tight control over the Internet, nipping in the bud any signs of dissent or challenges to the ruling Communist Party's leadership. The country is host to the world's most sophisticated internet censorship mechanism, known as the Great Firewall of China. Critics say China has stepped up its disruption of foreign online services like Google over the past year to create an Internet cut off from the rest of the world.The Google disruption began in the run-up to the 25th anniversary of the government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.Gmail's setback could make email communication difficult for companies operating in China, said GreatFire. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not know anything about Gmail being blocked, adding that the government was committed to providing a good business environment for foreign investors.""China has consistently had a welcoming and supportive attitude toward foreign investors doing legitimate business here,"" she said. ""We will, as always, provide an open, transparent and good environment for foreign companies in China.""One popular way to get around China's internet censorship is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which allows unhindered access to blocked sites and services.""Using a VPN seems to be the only answer to doing anything these days online in China,"" said Zach Smith, a Beijing-based digital products manager at City Weekend magazine.

The search giant is planning soon to pilot its new Google Compare auto insurance comparison shopping site, wrote Forrester analyst Ellen Carney in a note. According to Carney, the company has been pitching the service to insurance providers for more than two years.Google, which currently offers a service in the UK for users to compare over 125 auto insurance options, takes a cut when a user buys insurance online or by phone.

Google already offers its users a site to compare travel destinations and find the cheapest flight fares, for instance.  Google in past years has begun to expand beyond its home turf of Internet search and advertising, seeking to extend its technological dominance to fields as diverse as self-driving cars and robotics.Carney expects the California pilot for the new service to begin in the first quarter of 2015. Google is already licensed to sell auto insurance in 26 states and is working with a handful of insurers including Dairyland, MetLife and others, she said.

Urmson is expected to announce his company's plans to seek partnerships within the auto industry.Car makers including GM are racing to develop features that will make cars safer to drive. The longer-term vision includes cars that will largely drive themselves. Lauckner said any automaker teaming up with Google would need to establish how the relationship would work.""You have to figure out how would something like that actually work,"" he said. ""Would it be something where it would be an opportunity to work together in a joint development agreement?"" ""I'd say probably anybody who's interested ought to at least go over and kick the tires,"" Lauckner said.

636,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Jan 12 Walt Disney Co, Sony Corp  and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc urged a federal judge to throw out a antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring not to poach each other's animators in order to keep wages down.The defendants told U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, that the plaintiff animators took too long to sue by waiting until five years after the U.S. Department of Justice in 2009 began probing recruiting practices at Silicon Valley and other technology companies.In a Friday night filing, the defendants also called it ""implausible"" to believe they would collude to suppress wages after the federal probe began, and after several companies including Disney had settled related private litigation.""The court might ask what, exactly, these plaintiffs have uncovered that was somehow missed by the industrious High-Tech plaintiffs,"" the companies said.

In this case, Google is in the former camp, through its ""Project Zero"" team, which scans all types of software for bugs and reports problems privately to the developers who created them.

643,"  DETROIT General Motors Co (GM.N) is open to working with Google Inc (GOOGL.O) on developing self-driving car technology, the chief technology officer for the U.S. automaker said on Monday.“I’m not in charge of deciding what we will and won’t do, but I’d say we’d certainly be open to having a discussion with them,” Jon Lauckner said in an interview at the Detroit auto show.Lauckner made his comments two days before the head of Google's self-driving car project, Chris Urmson, is scheduled to speak at a conference held annually in conjunction with the auto show. Urmson is expected to announce his company's plans to seek partnerships within the auto industry.Car makers including GM are racing to develop features that will make cars safer to drive. The longer-term vision includes cars that will largely drive themselves.Lauckner said any automaker teaming up with Google would need to establish how the relationship would work.  ""You have to figure out how would something like that actually work,"" he said. ""Would it be something where it would be an opportunity to work together in a joint development agreement?""""I’d say probably anybody who’s interested ought to at least go over and kick the tires,” Lauckner said. He said GM has worked with many of the people who are now in Google's self-driving car program. Urmson was at Carnegie Mellon when the university worked with GM on a self-driving SUV that won a DARPA challenge in 2007.“I’d be completely surprised if Google doesn’t have something to offer,"" Lauckner said.  “We know they have talented people and we know they have capability.” (Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Toni Reinhold)",2015-01-13,GOOGL,"Mon Jan 12, 2015 | 7:12pm EST",GM open to working with Google on self-driving car technology,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autoshow-gm-google-idUSKBN0KL2GH20150113?type=companyNews
644,"   By Paul Lienert and Joe White | DETROIT  DETROIT Internet search company Google Inc has begun discussions with most of the world's top automakers and has assembled a team of traditional and nontraditional suppliers to speed efforts to bring self-driving cars to market by 2020, a  Google executive said on Wednesday.""We'd be remiss not to talk to ... the biggest auto manufacturers. They've got a lot to offer,"" Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, said in an interview.Those manufacturers, he said, include General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG.""For us to jump in and say that we can do this better, that's arrogant,"" Urmson said. Google has not determined whether it will build its own self-driving vehicles or function more as a provider of systems and software to established vehicle manufacturers.Google's self-driving prototype cars, he said, were built in Detroit by engineering and specialty manufacturing company Roush.GM is open to working with Google on self-driving cars, Jon Lauckner, GM's chief technology officer, said on Monday.Urmson's expectation that the first fully autonomous vehicles will be production-ready within five years mirrors the view expressed a day earlier by another Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla Motors Inc. Musk, who spoke Tuesday at the Automotive News World Congress conference, said he expects the lack of clear federal regulations covering self-driving cars could delay their introduction until 2022 or 2023.Urmson, however, said his Google colleagues ""don't see any particular regulatory hurdles.""Google has been briefing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the chief U.S. auto regulator, ""from early on in our program,"" Urmson said. ""The worst thing we could do is surprise them.""Urmson said Google is developing and refining self-driving systems and components with such auto parts suppliers as Continental AG, Robert Bosch, ZF and LG Electronics. Google's prototype cars use microprocessors made by Nvidia Corp , a Silicon Valley chipmaker that also supplies Mercedes-Benz and other automakers. Continental said it began discussions in 2012 about supplying parts for Google's self-driving car. Google asked the German supplier to provide tires, some electronics and other components, according to Samir Salman, chief executive of Continental's NAFTA region.Google shortly will begin deploying a test fleet of fully functioning prototypes of its pod-like self-driving car, which dispenses with such familiar automotive parts as steering wheel, brakes and accelerator pedal. While each of the Google prototypes will have a ""test driver"" on board, the cars have no provision for human intervention in steering or braking.Urmson suggested the no-frills look of the Google prototypes, a far cry from the opulent appearance of the self-driving F015 concept vehicle unveiled last week by Mercedes, does not necessarily reflect the final design for production.He described the Google prototype as ""a practical, near-term testing platform"" that will evolve over time. ""Airliners today don't look like the Wright brothers' flyer"" of 100 years ago, he said. Urmson said self-driving cars represent a ""transformative"" moment in the evolution of transportation, an opportunity to extend motoring to blind, elderly and disabled persons who otherwise could not drive.""You're really changing the relationship you have with transportation. You're changing what it means to get around.""Regarding Google's desire to partner with traditional automakers and suppliers, Urmson said Detroit is more innovative than is sometimes acknowledged. Automakers are ""doing something incredibly complicated.""""You look at a car ... and people forget just how much magic there is in that thing.""

647,"   By Estelle Shirbon  Google Inc. sought on Wednesday to block a lawsuit filed against it by Max Mosley in the High Court in London over access through its search engine to images of the former motor racing chief taking part in a sex party.Google wants to avoid a legal obligation to monitor and limit the flow of data on the Internet. Mosley, who was present in court, argues the firm is breaching his fundamental right to privacy by allowing users to access the pictures.The images were first published in 2008 by Rupert Murdoch's now-defunct News of the World, which said they showed a Nazi-themed orgy -- an incendiary story, as Mosley's father Oswald Mosley was a British fascist politician in the 1930s.Max Mosley later won 60,000 pounds ($91,290) in damages from the newspaper after a court ruled the party had no Nazi theme and the story was not in the public interest. Mosley, 74, has remained in the public eye in Britain ever since, mainly as a campaigner for privacy rights and against media intrusion. He launched legal action against Google and its British subsidiary in July last year, seeking damages and asking the court to compel the search engine to prevent any user accessing the sex party images in future.Google's lawyers say it has removed the images from search results in instances where Mosley has notified the firm of specific search terms being used, and has provided the detailed location of the images. However, the firm does not wish to go further and set up a filtering system that would prevent users from accessing the images, arguing that would amount to an obligation to monitor the Internet.At the first court hearing in the case, Google's lawyers argued on Wednesday that Mosley's lawsuit should be thrown out because the images had been so widely available for so long that he had no realistic expectation of privacy left. They also disputed Mosley's position that Google should be considered a ""publisher"" of the images for legal purposes.The court hearing was scheduled to last two days.

649,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Four Silicon Valley companies including Apple Inc and Google Inc have agreed to a new settlement that would resolve an antitrust class action lawsuit by tech workers, who accused the firms of conspiring to avoid poaching each other's employees.Plaintiffs accused Apple, Google, Intel Corp and Adobe Systems Inc in the 2011 lawsuit of limiting job mobility and, as a result, keeping a lid on salaries. The case has been closely watched because of the possibility of big damages being awarded and for the opportunity to peek into the world of some of America's elite tech firms.U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, last year rejected a $324.5 million settlement of the lawsuit as too low after one of the named plaintiffs objected.

The case was based largely on emails in which Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt and some of their rivals detailed plans to avoid poaching each other's prized engineers.In rejecting the $324.5 million deal, Koh repeatedly referred to a related 2013 settlement involving Disney and Intuit. Apple and Google workers got proportionally less than Disney workers, Koh wrote, even though plaintiff lawyers had ""much more leverage"" against Apple and Google.To match the earlier settlement, the deal with Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe ""would need to total at least $380 million,"" Koh wrote.In the short court filing on Tuesday, the companies said plaintiffs would file a detailed explanation of the new deal ""imminently."" Koh will then likely decide whether to accept or reject it.The case is In Re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California 11-cv-2509.

652,"  * Z1 model priced at $92, targets 1st-time smartphone users* Launch comes after several delays in Tizen phone release* Samsung seeks to cut Google reliance, build own ecosystem   (Updates with background, comments on Tizen)By Se Young LeeSEOUL/NEW DELHI, Jan 14 South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has launched the first smartphone powered by its Tizen operating system, a major development in the tech giant's aim to build a software ecosystem to rival Google Inc's Android.The Z1 device went on sale in India in Wednesday for 5,700 rupees ($92) each, targeting first-time smartphone buyers, the world's No.1 smartphone maker said in a statement. The no-nonsense handset - one of Samsung's cheapest - sports a 4-inch display, a plastic body and a simplified user interface. The launch is a key step in the company's strategy to break free from the Android platform, which powers Samsung's flagship Galaxy devices and most other smartphones on the market.At less than $100, the Z1 will be able to compete with low-price offerings by manufacturers like Micromax Infomatics Ltd in India. The price will also help convince first-time smartphone buyers to try a Tizen-powered device, analysts said. ""Samsung has better chances of success with first-time smartphone users, who may have limited exposure to the huge ecosystem offerings from Android or (Apple Inc's ) iOS,"" IDC analyst Kiranjeet Kaur said ahead of the launch.While India is already the world's third-biggest market for smartphones, most consumers in the country do not yet own one of the devices, meaning the growth potential is huge.A Samsung spokeswoman said the firm had not decided whether to launch the Z1 in any other countries. Samsung is however pushing to grow Tizen on other platforms such as televisions. Until now, Tizen has been deployed only in Samsung smartwatches and cameras, leading some analysts to doubt if it would ever power devices in the crucial smartphone business. The mobile division as a whole accounted for about 68 percent of the firm's operating profit in 2013.Delays in a Tizen smartphone launch undermined confidence and dissuaded third-party developers from creating software applications needed to populate a Tizen ecosystem.Samsung says more than 1,000 apps will be available for download in the Tizen Store - a tiny fraction of the number of offerings on Google Play. The Z1 comes with pre-installed apps and web links to services like Amazon.com, Flipkart, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo and YouTube.Z1 buyers will also get free data from Indian mobile operators Reliance Communications Ltd and Aircel for six months, as well as free music and video content worth a combined 1,750 rupees per year.

660,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Google is only removing search results from European websites when individuals invoke their ""right to be forgotten"", contrary to regulators' guidelines, but will review that approach soon, the company's chief legal officer said on Monday.The issue of how far the so-called right to be forgotten should extend has concentrated the minds of Europe's privacy regulators since the continent's top court ruled in May that individuals could have ""inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant"" information removed from search results. Google has consistently argued that it believes the ruling should only apply to its European websites, such as Google.de in Germany or Google.fr in France.But the group of privacy watchdogs from EU countries, the Article 29 Working Party, concluded in November that they want search engines to scrub results globally because of the ease of switching from a European domain to Google.com. David Drummond, Google's Chief Legal Officer, said the Internet giant's approach had not changed since November and it would review it when a group of experts publishes a report on last year's court judgment towards the end of this month. ""We've had a basic approach, we've followed it, on this question we've made removals Europe-wide but not beyond,"" he said at an event in Brussels on Monday.Between September and November, an advisory council, including a former German justice minister and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, held public meetings across Europe to debate the balance between privacy and the free flow of information.It is expected to publish a report with its conclusions at the end of January to help inform Google on its application of the ruling. ""We'll take that (the report), along with the Article 29 input and other input and arrive at an approach,"" Drummond said.""It's our strong view that there needs to be some way of limiting the concept, because it is a European concept.""Since the ruling in May, Google has received more than 200,000 requests from across Europe affecting over 700,000 URLs, according to its online transparency report.  The EU's privacy chiefs adopted a set of non-binding guidelines in November to ensure the ruling is applied consistently across the bloc's 28 member states.Citizens whose removal requests have been refused by a search engine can appeal to their national data protection regulator, who can then take action against the company.On Friday, the Article 29 Working Party wrote to Microsoft, Yahoo and French search engine Qwant to remind them of the regulators' view that results should be scrubbed across all relevant domains.

662,"   By Hyunjoo Jin and Paul Lienert | SEOUL/DETROIT  SEOUL/DETROIT Technology advances in telematics and driver assistance systems are gathering steam as the enablers of future connected and self-driving cars, according to an analysis of global patent applications released Monday.South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor posted the biggest gains in the number of patent filings over the past five years, narrowing the gap with industry leader Toyota, according to the report by Thomson Reuters IP & Science.The survey, ""The State of Innovation in the Automotive Industry 2015,"" analyzed patent applications and mapped trends in five key areas: Propulsion, navigation, handling, safety and security, and entertainment.Hyundai was among the leaders in every category, ranking number three overall behind Toyota Motor Corp and Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL]. Hyundai, which along with sister company Kia Motor is fifth in global sales, has outperformed the overall auto market thanks to its stylish, yet affordable models, but experts say the duo lacks a technological edge to better compete with rivals.    Hyundai, which has been a fast-follower in the industry, had seen a surge of patent litigation since gaining global prominence in recent years. Hyundai's patent filings more than doubled to 1,200 in 2013, from 500 in 2010, according to the report by Thomson Reuters' Intellectual Property & Science business.     Although Toyota is still the overall leader in terms of auto innovations  - those protected with patents - Hyundai is the fastest-growing, most up-and-coming innovator in the space, the report said. Hyundai ranked third in the number of patent lawsuits filed by the firms which specialize in suing others for infringement, just behind Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co, according to SU Intellectual Property, a Seoul-based IP firm. ""Hyundai has belatedly realized the importance of patents and has been keeping pace with rivals,"" said Jung Dong-joon, representative attorney of SU Intellectual Property.  ""While Hyundai has increased the number of its patent filings, it is still a follower in terms of patent quality,"" he said, adding that Hyundai needs to secure more core patents.Overall, Asians and Germans dominated the top 10 companies for patent applications, while GM, ranked seventh, was the only U.S. company making the list.    The automotive sector saw the number of patent filings around the world grow by double-digits year-on-year over the past five years, the Thomson Reuters report said.While Google Inc has dominated headlines in self-driving cars, Toyota, GM and Hyundai received the most patents in this area, said Bob Stembridge, one of the report's authors. Telematics refers to the linking of wireless communication devices with computers in cars, for navigation, to track vehicles on the road, or to control a car's functions from your smart phone. ""We see a lot of increasing activity in telematics and driver assistance systems as the supporting technologies for self-driving cars,"" said Stembridge, an analyst with Thomson Reuters IP & Science.Among the leaders in driver-assistance patents are Bosch, Daimler AG, Continental AG, Valeo SA and Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi. GM and Hyundai lead the advances in telematics.

671,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) won the dismissal of a nationwide privacy lawsuit accusing them of illegally tracking the Internet activity of boys and girls who visited Nickelodeon's website, in order to send targeted advertising.The lawsuit claimed that Viacom secretly kept track of children under the age of 13 who streamed videos and played video games on its Nick.com website, and shared what it learned with Google.It said both companies then without permission put text files known as ""cookies"" into the children's computers, letting them gather additional information that advertisers could use.The lawsuit was brought on behalf of young children who registered to use Nick.com. But in a Jan. 20 decision, U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler in Newark, New Jersey found no showing that Google and Viacom could identify which children streamed specific videos or played specific video games, as opposed to identifying children generally. He also found no showing that the companies engaged in ""highly offensive"" behavior for which they could be held liable.""Children do indeed warrant special attention and heightened protections under our laws and social norms,"" Chesler wrote.""Although plaintiffs have identified conduct that may be worthy of further legislative and executive attention, they have not cited any existing and applicable legal authority"" to support their claims, he added.  The plaintiffs had accused Viacom of violating the federal Video Privacy Protection Act, and both companies of violating a New Jersey anti-computer hacking law.Chesler dismissed other claims last July, and said the plaintiffs cannot amend their lawsuit again. The litigation against Mountain View, California-based Google and New York-based Viacom began in 2012. Evan Rosenberg, a lawyer for the children, did not respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.A Nickelodeon spokesman said the Viacom unit is pleased with the dismissal.

673,"  * Top data privacy regulator signals openness to proposal* European passenger database on table after Paris attacks* Google could face penalties on 'right to be forgotten'By Mark JohnPARIS, Jan 21 Europe's data privacy watchdogs will meet in coming days to discuss revising their earlier opposition to countries sharing airline passenger data as part of efforts to tighten security and thwart terror attacks, the group's head said on Wednesday.The talks come after EU President Donald Tusk said he would press lawmakers in the European Parliament to drop their resistance to the so-called EU Passenger Name Record system in the wake of deadly Islamist attacks in France.Lawmakers have resisted endorsing the system for sharing data, known as the PNR, on the grounds it would infringe on people's privacy by instituting mass tracking and surveillance of all travellers.""The G29's position has been reserved up till now,"" said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who chairs the group of European data protection regulators as well as France's watchdog called the CNIL, at a briefing. ""We will discuss it again in 10 days or so.""In a position set out in late 2011, European data protection regulators argued that there was no evidence that the mass collection and transfer of air passenger data would help security, deeming it a ""disproportionate"" response.Falque-Pierrotin suggested, however, that any future record system could be accompanied by guarantees to address privacy concerns. She suggested the possibility of safeguards on access to such data, together with other guarantees on length of storage of data and the security of such databases.She noted a national passenger record system due to be put in place by France later this year included similar safeguards, including a two-year limit on holding passenger data. The current European proposal would hold data for five years. Falque-Pierrotin, speaking on the same day France announced it would hire 1,400 extra intelligence staff in its efforts to ensure there was no repeat of attacks that claimed 17 lives, acknowledged the current events were ""a game-changer"".However she argued that any move by authorities to tighten security should be accompanied by guarantees that this would not undermine personal liberties - a criticism made notably of the U.S. Patriot Act laws introduced after the Sept. 2001 attacks.""The idea that there is a straight trade-off between freedoms and security is, to my mind, a bit sterile,"" she said. Falque-Pierrotin said 2014 saw progress on data protection and privacy in a number of areas, including a ruling by Europe's top court that individuals had a ""right to be forgotten"" online, under which they can ask search engines to remove outdated or incorrect information about them.Since the ruling in May, Google has set up a system for people to make such requests and received more than 200,000 from across Europe affecting over 700,000 URLs. Other big web companies like Microsoft and Facebook  have been slower to set up systems to comply.However Google has tussled with regulators about how the ruling should be applied. It argues that ruling should only apply to its European websites, such as Google.de in Germany or Google.fr in France - a position that France's CNIL and other watchdogs oppose.Falque-Pierrotin said discussions continued with Google but that data protection regulators have the option of putting the company on notice to change its arrangements or face fines.""The message to the company is the following: Like any other player, you must comply with European law - no more, no less.""Earlier attempts by European regulators to get Google to comply with local rules have failed. Several have fined Google over changes in 2012 to its user privacy policy, but the company has not altered its approach.The penalties remain small compares with Google's size.  France fined it 150,000 euros in January 2014, while Spain imposed one of 900,000 euros. Google's annual revenue in 2013 was $55.52 billion.

Contrafund held Google stock worth $7.06 billion, or 6.4 percent of the fund's assets, according to an end of November holdings update. Google, when combining Class A and Class C shares, was the fund's largest holding. After the recent reduction, the stock remained one of the largest positions and overweightings in the fund. No precise figure was given for Google's two share classes in the latest quarterly update. ""Google was the fund's largest holding at the end of the quarter, as we expect the company's best-of-breed product suite and dominant market position in the mobile advertising category to bear fruit over the long term amid increasing global Internet usage,"" the fund said in its commentary.Danoff's savvy tech picks have made him one of the best performing U.S. portfolio managers over the past 20 years.

The deal has turned personal computer-maker Lenovo into a challenger in the higher-end smartphone market, competing with Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  ""The (Chinese) market itself is so big here and Motorola has no share today, so we believe that what we’re really going to succeed in doing is hopefully take some share from other people in the market,"" Rick Osterloh, President of Motorola Mobility told Reuters.Motorola will compete in China with Apple and Samsung in the premium smartphone market and with the world's third biggest smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL] in mid- and mid-high level phones. Lenovo is already the number two smartphone maker in China.  ""Our approach is to have global products tailored and customised for local markets,"" Motorola's Osterloh said. Motorola will also stick to relatively high-end products, he said. Bryan Ma, a Singapore-based analyst at tech research firm IDC, said Motorola might test the waters with smartphones designed for the Americas, but in the next 12-24 months they could announce more localised products. ""They're trying to introduce themselves to a new group of friends and trying to establish street cred,"" Ma said.

683,"  (Updates with details on case, context)MEXICO CITY Jan 27 Mexico's federal transparency body said on Tuesday it had initiated proceedings to impose sanctions on the Mexican unit of Google Inc  for possible breach of the country's data protection law.The Federal Institute for Information Access and Data Protection (IFAI) said it had taken the step following a request from an unidentified person who had asked Google Mexico to erase his personal data from the search engine and to stop using it.In a statement, the IFAI said it received the request in September 2014 after Google Mexico ignored the person's wishes. The institute noted that in December 2014 it had tried to make the company comply with the request. But that failed, it said, after the company argued that its parent Google Inc and not Google Mexico was responsible for the search engine.The IFAI, which rejected that argument, did not provide details on the person who made the complaint, or what sanctions it was considering imposing on Google Mexico. Google Mexico could not immediately be reached for comment.According to Mexican law, the first sanctions applied to those in breach of data protection laws force them to comply with the government's order. Failing that, they can face a series of fines of up to 22.4 million pesos ($1.53 million). The Mexican case follows complaints by Internet users against Google over data protection in a number of countries.In an effort to tighten privacy laws, European Union ministers in June agreed that companies based outside the bloc such as Google must meet Europe's data protection rules.($1 = 14.6345 Mexican pesos)   (Reporting by Dave Graham and Tomas Sarmiento)",2015-01-28,GOOGL,"Tue Jan 27, 2015 | 10:03pm EST",UPDATE 1-Mexico says may sanction Google over data protection breach,http://www.reuters.com//article/google-mexico-idUSL1N0V705720150128?type=companyNews

Facebook reported on Wednesday that mobile ads on its network doubled year-over-year during the fourth quarter.Google said on Thursday the average price of its online ads, or ""cost per click,"" decreased 3 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while the number of consumer clicks on its ads increased 14 percent. Some analysts had hoped for gains in cost-per-click, said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis, adding that the company, which gets about half of its revenue overseas, also was hurt by the strong dollar.""Business is slowing. The core is slowing. And what we're saying is, it's going to look on paper even worse as the dollar strengthens. And we are not at that point where mobile monetization is improving,"" he said. ""The thesis that the landscape is changing and Google is missing out - I don't think it will hold to be true, but they haven't squelched it."" Consolidated revenue in the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $18.10 billion, compared to $15.71 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for revenue of $18.46 billon.Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette said in a statement that revenue grew ""despite strong currency headwinds.""Net income rose to $4.76 billion, or $6.91 per share, from $3.38 billion, or $4.95 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share of $6.88 missed analysts' expectations of $7.11.

687,"  (Adds Google comment)By Leila AbboudPARIS Jan 30 Search engine Google has agreed to better inform users about how it handles their personal information after an investigation by Britain's data protection regulator found its privacy policy was too vague.The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said in a statement on Friday that it required Google to sign a ""formal undertaking"" that it would make the changes by June 30 and take further steps in the next two years.As a result, Google will not be fined by the United Kingdom for its actions, in contrast to France and Spain where regulators imposed penalties in addition to asking for changes. The company welcomed the regulator's decision, saying it had agreed improvements to its privacy policy.""We're pleased that the ICO has decided to close its investigation,"" a Google spokesman said. The tussle between Google and Europe's data protection regulators began after the company took a new approach in March 2012 to consolidate some 70 existing privacy policies into one.It also began to pool data collected on individual users across its services, including YouTube, Gmail and its social network Google+, giving users no way to opt out. Data protection regulators from 28 European countries, known as the Article 29 group, soon found that the approach did not comply with EU rules and gave Google a deadline to change it or face sanctions. That touched off a long period of back and forth between the company and the various national regulators.Spain fined Google 900,000 euros ($1 million) over the privacy policy, and France 150,000 euros, small penalties relative to Google's scale. Its annual revenue in 2013 was $55.52 billion.Other countries are still weighing their responses. In December, Google submitted a ""number of improvements"" aimed at addressing the European regulators' concerns, the ICO said.

694,"  * Competition, regulations fuel merger pressures* Health insurers fight price war for market share* Mutuals so far not interested in selling sharesBy Leigh ThomasPARIS, Feb 2 Tight health budgets, regulatory revolutions and the threat of Google have unleashed a surge of competition among France's mutual insurers, triggering a wave of mergers in the usually staid corner of the financial sector.Malakoff Mederic and La Mutuelle Generale were the latest not-for-profit mutuals to ink a tie-up creating a combined group this month with annual revenues of 4.6 billion euros ($5.2 billion).""There're about 400 institutions today,"" Malakoff Mederic head Guillaume Sarkozy told Reuters, ""I wouldn't be surprised if it's less than 50 in the coming years.""The merger came weeks after the biggest mutual health insurers, MGEN and Harmonie Mutuelle, agreed to merge, eager to keep costs down through economies of scale. ""This is a very compelling point for us,"" Harmonie Mutuelle chief Joseph Deniaud told Reuters, estimating that the group would have annual revenues close to 5 billion euros.In France, the state provides basic health insurance, but it is looking to cut health spending by 10 billion euros over three years. That leaves insurers providing additional coverage to foot an ever bigger portion of the health bill.Size can also be an advantage as fierce competition sweeps into the sector before new rules starting next year under which  small firms have to offer employees health insurance as bigger companies already do. Competing with listed for-profit insurers like AXA   and CNP Assurances, mutuals already have 54 percent of the highly fragmented market for health insurance as well as sizable chunks of other insurance markets.The new regulations have triggered a price war with some mutuals offering health coverage for as low as 16 euros a month, even though it is all but impossible to break even at that level, said Matthieu Stankowiak, head of development at mid-sized mutual M comme Mutuelle.""Everyone's trying to get market share now because once you get it, it doesn't change much over time,"" he told Reuters.Non-mutual insurers do not want to be left behind. CNP Assurances said on Friday it had set up a joint venture with insurance broker Alptis targetting small companies. In the absence of shareholders to fall back on for more capital, weaker mutuals are also flocking to better capitalised rivals before new EU insurance rules enter into force next year, requiring more capital than now.Additionally, mutuals are increasingly worried that data-savvy technology firms will began treading on their turf as the likes of Google test the waters in some insurance markets.""I absolutely don't want to be overtaken by a non-insurance company,"" Malakoff Mederic's Sarkozy said, citing Google.Despite the sector's shake-up, so far none are following the example of U.S. or British rivals by becoming for-profit firms and seeking outside capital.""This subject is not on the table in France,"" said Sarkozy, brother of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. ""If a company needs capital there are different solutions: it can issue financial instruments or merge with other institutions.""($1 = 0.8830 euros)   (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Andrew Callus and Susan Thomas)",2015-02-02,GOOGL,"Mon Feb 2, 2015 | 7:32am EST",Urge to merge grips French mutual insurers as price war breaks out,http://www.reuters.com//article/france-insurance-idUSL6N0V93X120150202?type=companyNews

700,"  FRANKFURT Technology companies such as Google are unlikely to become mass car manufacturers, even if they have the potential to disrupt an industry increasingly focused on software and automated driving, the head of German carmaker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) said on Friday. In recent years, automakers and Silicon Valley companies have grown increasingly inter-dependent because next-generation cars need advanced software and sensors, shaking up the traditional pecking order among carmakers and their suppliers.  While Google (GOOGL.O) unveiled an advanced self-driving car last year, Daimler chief executive Dieter Zetsche said the U.S. company's objective was probably to better understand how cars are used, rather than to become a manufacturer in its own right.  ""Google and the likes want to get involved, I don’t think in the first place to build vehicles,"" Zetsche told analysts, adding that Google was studying the home, the office and the car as places where people spend time.  ""We have to understand that, and then to find our roles, to which extent they are complementary, to which extent we become dependent, to which extent we are competitors,"" he added.  Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz brand, will put great emphasis on controlling data from self-driving and other cars. ""When we talk about high safety with Mercedes, it does not apply specifically for protection from accidents, but this means safety of their personal data as well.

""Today, the need to help children has never been greater and since retiring I have more time and I want to do so much more,"" said Beckham, who is marking 10 years as a good will ambassador for the U.N. Children's Fund. ""Everything I have done, my soccer career, my family, has led to this point – this is the moment for me to do what I can to help children in every corner of the world. This is something I want my own children to be proud of,"" added Beckham, a father of four.Beckham also asked his fans to back his call to world leaders to put children first as they negotiate new global development goals. The launch of ""7"" comes after one of the worst years for children on record, UNICEF said.  More than 15 million children were exposed to extreme violence in conflicts in 2014 and millions more were hit by natural disasters. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa has also left thousands orphaned and many more out of school.Worldwide, some 168 million children are engaged in child labor and many others are victims of sexual violence, trafficking and female genital mutilation, UNICEF said.  (Editing by Ros Russell)",2015-02-09,GOOGL,"Mon Feb 9, 2015 | 10:35am EST",David Beckham launches '7' fund for kids in danger around the world,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-un-beckham-children-idUSKBN0LD1BB20150209?type=companyNews

""That's something many would like to know but unfortunately I cannot comment. We only talk about customer projects when they're implemented,"" he said.

""Even if no car is ever produced, it may accelerate the race to adopt 'Car of the Future' technologies,"" Michaeli said. Anybody who wants to build a self-driving car needs to understand sensors, algorithms and software, Denner said. If Apple really wanted to explore this market, it would probably talk with the entire industry, Denner said.

717,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Italy's data privacy watchdog said Google Inc had agreed to it conducting inspections at its Californian headquarters, the first time a European Union regulator will make checks on the company inside U.S. territory.Friday's announcement represents the latest privacy challenge for the company in the EU and underscores the willingness of the 28-member bloc to ensure its citizens' data are treated according to EU law, even when held in foreign jurisdictions.Google has been under investigation by several EU data protection authorities (DPAs) since it consolidated some 70 existing privacy policies into one in March 2012, combining data collected on individual users across its services, including YouTube, Gmail and social network Google+.It gave users no means to opt out.On Friday the Italian data protection authority said Google had agreed to put in place all the privacy protections required of it and to submit to regular checks. It said Google had until Jan. 15, 2016 to implement changes in how it treats and stores users' data. ""For the first time in Europe, it (Google) will be the subject of regular checks to monitor progress ... of the actions to bring its platform into line with domestic legislation,"" the DPA said.A Google spokeswoman said: ""As we said in July last year, we have fully engaged with (the Italian regulator) ... throughout this process and will continue to do so,"" but did not confirm the details of any agreement.The authority said it expected quarterly updates on progress and reserved the right to inspect Google's headquarters to verify if its treatment of Italians' data complied with the rules. Separately, social network Facebook Inc's privacy policy is under scrutiny in Germany, highlighting concerns across Europe about U.S. tech companies' handling of personal information.Under changes agreed on Friday, Google will have to make clear to users how their data would be used, the regulator said, adding Google would not be allowed to use data to profile users without their prior consent and would have to guarantee them the right to oppose their information being used in such profiling.      Google will also need to improve how it stores data and guarantee its deletion within a specified timeframe to users who request it.Only last month the group agreed to change its privacy policy in response to the British regulator's investigation, avoiding a fine.

The case helped spark a broad discussion in Silicon Valley about sexism. In San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday, Pao's lawyer  Alan Exelrod said in his opening statement that Kleiner had promoted only one woman to senior investing partner by 2011, despite more than 40 years in business.""Was there a level playing field for Ellen Pao at Kleiner Perkins?"" Exelrod said to the jury. ""We will prove to you in this case that there was not.""Kleiner attorney Lynne Hermle said, however, that the firm excels at recruiting female executives and investing in businesses founded by women. The reason Pao was not promoted, Hermle said, is because she did not have the skills to be an investing partner. ""She did not come close,"" Hermle said.Since Pao filed her lawsuit in 2012, women employees at Pantheon Ventures Ltd and CMEA, two other venture firms, and a co-founder at Tinder filed similar suits that were later settled. In her lawsuit, Pao, now interim chief executive at social news service reddit, said her standing at Kleiner deteriorated after she ended a brief affair with a colleague, Ajit Nazre, who has also since left the firm. Nazre could not be reached for comment and has not spoken publicly about the case.In court, Exelrod said Nazre subsequently lured another female Kleiner advisor, Trae Vassallo, to New York for a purported business meeting. Nazre eventually propositioned Vassallo, appearing at her hotel door in a bathrobe, but Vassallo rebuffed him and then told Pao. Vassallo is scheduled to testify.  But Hermle said Kleiner partner John Doerr, a Google board member, has been ""on a mission"" to advance women in tech. Pao tries to ""twist facts, circumstances and events"" to support her contention of a conspiracy of gender bias at Kleiner, Hermle said.Pao is seeking as much as $16 million from the firm, a lawyer for Kleiner Perkins has said.

731,"   By Sarah McBride and Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Feb 24 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the investment firm that has backed tech companies from Google to Amazon, will defend itself in court on Tuesday in a closely watched gender discrimination case that could lay open the inner workings of venture capital.Former Kleiner partner Ellen Pao accuses the firm of holding her back from a promotion and better compensation after she complained about harassment by a male partner. Kleiner has denied the accusations of discrimination and retaliation, and says Pao underperformed her peers. Both sides are expected to make opening statements on Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court.The case helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion in Silicon Valley about sexism. Since Pao filed her suit in 2012, female employees at Pantheon Ventures Ltd and CMEA, two other venture firms, and a co-founder at Tinder filed similar suits that were later settled. Last month, a former girlfriend sued venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale for sexual assault and harassment. Lonsdale has denied those allegations and accused the woman of defamation.Many big technology firms have released statistics showing the percentage of their employees who are female hovers at around 30 percent. They blame in part a dearth of qualified women to hire, but many critics say the firms are not doing enough to attract and retain women. In her lawsuit Pao - now interim chief executive at social news service reddit - said her standing at Kleiner deteriorated after she ended a brief affair with another partner who has also since left the firm. Her career hit the slow track after he and the firm started retaliating against her, she said in court filings. Kleiner says Pao did not deserve a promotion and the better compensation that would have come with it. The firm says it has two senior women partners, more than most venture firms in Silicon Valley.Pao is seeking as much as $16 million from the firm, a lawyer for Kleiner Perkins has said. Kleiner could cite Pao's current compensation at reddit to rebut her claim that she missed out on income by not moving upward at the venture firm.The case is Pao v.

733,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Feb 25 Google Inc   launched an initiative on Wednesday to make smartphones running its Android software more appealing to corporations, a move that could help extend the Internet company's reach into workplaces. Google said on its official blog that its Android for Work program will provide improved security and management features for corporations that want to give their employees Android smartphones. Smartphones supported by the new initiative will be able to keep an employee's work and personal apps separate, and a special Android for Work app will allow businesses to oversee key tools such as email, calendar and contacts. Google said it is partnering with more than two dozen companies including Blackberry Ltd, Citrix Systems Inc , Box Inc. Google's Android software is the world's most popular mobile operating system, but many corporations, which have significant security and device management requirements, give their employees smartphones made by Blackberry or Apple Inc.

734,"  TORONTO Feb 25 BlackBerry Ltd said on Wednesday that it is working with Google Inc to enable its software to manage and secure some of Google's Android devices, a move that builds on BlackBerry's recent partnership with Samsung Electronics Co.In November, BlackBerry announced partnerships with Samsung and other high-profile technology industry players, broadening the reach of its revamped mobile-device management and security platform. BlackBerry said it is offering a ""highly secure mobility solution"" for Samsung's Android devices. The new system weds BlackBerry's  security platform with the South Korean company's own security software for its line-up of Galaxy devices that are powered by Google's Android operating system. On Wednesday, BlackBerry outlined a similar tie-up directly with Google, to manage devices equipped with Android for Work - Google's own solution to securely separate business and personal data and applications.

735,"  MILAN Italian authorities are investigating whether Google violated any tax laws in the country, Milan's prosecutor said on Wednesday, adding that talks were under way with the U.S. company over a possible settlement. Officials had started discussions with Google representatives relating to its earnings in Italy in the years from 2008 to 2013, Milan prosecutor Edmondo Bruti Liberati said in a statement. No accord had been finalised yet.Checks on tax payments had been made as part of the investigation, the statement said.Google was considering whether to provide information over revenues it generates in Italy, it added. It did not say when the investigation or the discussion with Google would conclude.Authorities in countries across Europe have been investigating whether big companies like Google are using complex accounting schemes to cut their tax bills.     Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said on Wednesday that Google had reached a settlement with Italian authorities that envisages the payment of 320 million euros (234 million pounds). That amount was calculated on a taxable income in Italy of 800 million euros over five years, the paper said.A Google spokeswoman in Italy said in an email there had been no settlement. She said the group continued to work with the Italian tax authorities.  This is not the first time Italy has investigated Google over tax-related issues. In November 2012 an economy ministry document said Google had developed a system to transfer profits from its Italian operations to Ireland so it could benefit from a more favorable tax regime.The document said earlier investigations had found the group failed to declare at least 240 million euros of income to authorities and owed more than 96 million euros in sales tax. Google has always denied any allegations of wrongdoing.

The Internet giant is merging its northern and western European division with the unit covering southern and eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, the source said. The shake-up follows a year of setbacks for the company on political and regulatory fronts on issues ranging from antitrust to privacy to how much tax it pays in different European nations, as well as fraught relations with some European industries including media and telecom groups.The decision was taken to simplify the organization, both for commercial reasons as well as to work more effectively with business partners and policy makers.     Google's regional headquarters will remain in Dublin, where it employs thousands of staff, and the reorganization will not result in job losses, the source said.The U.S. company has become a lightning rod for criticism in Europe of aggressive Silicon Valley business practices, a role reversal from previous years when it was revered as a standard-bearer of innovation and new economic possibilities.  In response, Google has argued that for Europe to remain competitive in global markets, it needs to form a single digital market instead of relying on national regulations in its 28-member states that often act to protect local industries.OLYMPIC ROWER  Matt Brittin, who previously led Google's northern and western European division, will head up the combined Europe, Middle East and Africa operation while Carlo d'Asaro Biondo, formerly head of the other regional unit, will take on a strategy role, the source said.Brittin, a former Olympic rower for Great Britain, joined Google in 2007 to run its UK operations, leaving newspaper publishing group Trinity Mirror where he was director of strategy.

749,"   By Sarah McBride and Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Onetime highflying tech executive Ray Lane testified on Monday during a sex discrimination trial involving his former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, that he made a mistake in judgment involving the harassment of a female venture capitalist at the firm.Lane, who previously served as executive chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and president of Oracle Corp (ORCL.N), told the court that he erred in not immediately informing others that Trae Vassallo told him about unwanted advances by her colleague, Ajit Nazre, during a 2011 business trip.""I made a mistake,"" he said. ""It was my mistake. I cared more about her feelings than anything else. I thought it should be her choice"" whether to tell others at the firm and start an investigation, he said.Whether Kleiner reacted appropriately to allegations of sexism is at the heart of the suit, filed by former partner Ellen Pao.The case, brought in 2012, helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion about gender issues in Silicon Valley. In the suit, Pao alleges she suffered discrimination and retaliation after Nazre pressured her into a 2006 affair which she soon ended.     Pao alleged in her lawsuit that Lane and other partners did not initially respond to her complaints. Eventually, Lane told her to consider marriage to Nazre, she said in her suit. The discriminatory conduct spread to other partners, leading her to miss out on a key promotion, she alleges.Vassallo, who testified in the case last week, said Lane had told her to be ""flattered"" by Nazre's advances, although she later said she believed he was joking. But Kleiner did eventually start an investigation into Nazre's actions after she told more partners.The firm has vehemently denied Pao’s allegations. Kleiner’s lawyer, Lynne Hermle, said in court last week that the firm treated women fairly and did not promote Pao because she lacked talent.  But Pao’s attorney, Alan Exelrod, said the firm systematically failed to promote women to senior investing partner. He said Pao excelled at her work, lining up patent firm RPX, which raised $160 million in an initial public offering, as an investment.Lane joined Kleiner Perkins in 2000, after leaving software giant Oracle. He championed Fisker Automotive, which raised $1.5 billion before declaring bankruptcy in 2013.Lane is now a partner emeritus at the firm. The case is Pao v.

750,"   By Sarah McBride and Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Onetime highflying tech executive Ray Lane testified on Monday during a sex discrimination trial involving his former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, that he made a mistake in judgment involving the harassment of a female venture capitalist at the firm.Lane, who previously served as executive chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co and president of Oracle Corp , told the court that he erred in not immediately informing others that Trae Vassallo told him about unwanted advances by her colleague, Ajit Nazre, during a 2011 business trip.""I made a mistake,"" he said. ""It was my mistake. I cared more about her feelings than anything else. I thought it should be her choice"" whether to tell others at the firm and start an investigation, he said.Whether Kleiner reacted appropriately to allegations of sexism is at the heart of the suit, filed by former partner Ellen Pao.The case, brought in 2012, helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion about gender issues in Silicon Valley. In the suit, Pao alleges she suffered discrimination and retaliation after Nazre pressured her into a 2006 affair which she soon ended.Pao alleged in her lawsuit that Lane and other partners did not initially respond to her complaints. Eventually, Lane told her to consider marriage to Nazre, she said in her suit. The discriminatory conduct spread to other partners, leading her to miss out on a key promotion, she alleges.Vassallo, who testified in the case last week, said Lane had told her to be ""flattered"" by Nazre's advances, although she later said she believed he was joking. But Kleiner did eventually start an investigation into Nazre's actions after she told more partners.The firm has vehemently denied Pao's allegations. Kleiner's lawyer, Lynne Hermle, said in court last week that the firm treated women fairly and did not promote Pao because she lacked talent. But Pao's attorney, Alan Exelrod, said the firm systematically failed to promote women to senior investing partner. He said Pao excelled at her work, lining up patent firm RPX, which raised $160 million in an initial public offering, as an investment.Lane joined Kleiner Perkins in 2000, after leaving software giant Oracle. He championed Fisker Automotive, which raised $1.5 billion before declaring bankruptcy in 2013.Lane is now a partner emeritus at the firm.The case is Pao v.

758,"  (Adds comment from Google spokeswoman)BOSTON, March 3 Apple Inc and Google Inc said on Tuesday that they have developed fixes to mitigate the newly uncovered 'Freak' security flaw affecting mobile devices and Mac computers.The vulnerability in web encryption technology could enable attackers to spy on communications of users of Apple's Safari browser and Google Inc's Android browser, according to researchers who uncovered the flaw.Apple spokesman Ryan James said the computer had developed a software update to remediate the vulnerability, which would be pushed out next week.Google spokeswoman Liz Markman said the company had also developed a patch, which it has provided to partners. She declined to say when users could expect to receive those upgrades. Google typically does not directly push out Android software updates. Instead they are handled by device makers and mobile carriers.The Washington Post reported that the bug left users of Apple and Google devices vulnerable to cyberattack when visiting hundreds of thousands of websites, including Whitehouse.gov, NSA.gov and FBI.gov. http: (wapo.st/18KaxIA) Whitehouse.gov and FBI.gov have been fixed, but NSA.gov remains vulnerable, the paper cited Johns Hopkins cryptographer Matthew D. Green as saying.A group of nine researchers discovered that they could force web browsers to use an form of encryption that was intentionally weakened to comply with U.S. government regulations that ban American companies from exporting the strongest encryption standards, according to the paper. Once they caused the site to use the weaker export encryption standard, they were then able to break the encryption within a few hours. That could allow hackers to steal data and potentially launch attacks on the sites themselves by taking over elements on a page, the newspaper reported.Markman said that Google advises all websites to disable support for the less-secure, export-grade encryption.""Android's connections to most websites - which include Google sites, and others without export certificates - are not subject to this vulnerability,"" she added.The group of researchers dubbed the flaw Freak, for ""Factoring RSA-EXPORT Keys,"" according to a website where they described the vulnerability: www.smacktls.com.

It will later target U.S. businesses seeking a presence in both countries, Ethan Yu, a vice president at Alibaba who runs the international cloud business, told Reuters.""This is a very strategic move for us,"" Yu said, declining to say how much Alibaba invested in the data center or disclose its location for security reasons.

767,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO The Silicon Valley race to build a self-driving car may revolve around one simple question: to map or not to map. The company at the forefront of the race, Google Inc, is creating intricate maps that detail every tree and curb along the road - an expensive endeavor that other companies could find difficult to match.Newer entrants such as ride-share service Uber and Apple Inc could take a shortcut and develop a car capable of piloting itself without such elaborate and expensive blueprints, industry experts say.The dueling technological approaches represent more than a philosophical divide: they hint at how and when the companies, competing to expand into a significant new class of product, could put autonomous cars onto the road.Raj Rajkumar, one of the leading experts on self-driving cars at Carnegie Mellon University, said the map-based approach makes sense for a company with Google’s resources but is not required. “Google is capable of collecting all this information. In our case, we don’t have that capability, so we have to be creative. It turns out that’s sufficient” said Rajkumar, who has developed a modified Cadillac that relies on radars, video cameras and six laser scanners and in 2013 drove 33 miles (53 km) to the local airport without human intervention or 3D maps.Both approaches currently have limitations, and even the most optimistic acknowledge that a variety of technological, regulatory and legal issues mean it will be years, perhaps longer, before completely self-driving cars hit the road.Apple is studying the potential for a self-driving car, a source familiar with the matter has told Reuters. Uber, which operates the popular ride-hailing service, announced a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University in January to focus on self-driving cars. Electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc is developing self-driving technology, and traditional automakers including General Motors Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd are also adding automated features into their vehicles. And companies such as Nokia's Here are also developing detailed 3D maps that potentially could be licensed by car companies. Apple, Uber and Google declined to discuss self-driving cars.MAPS OF THE FUTURE  Mapping the entire United States to the level of detail used by Google’s cars could easily cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take five to seven years, said Egil Juliussen, an analyst with research firm IHS Automotive.All autonomous cars rely on basic electronic maps for navigation and lane centering. But Google’s cars use far more detailed 3D maps, which the company creates by using laser scanners. Google analyzes the data, determining where traffic lights and stop signs are, for instance, so that the vehicle ""knows"" exactly where it is.Google’s pod-shaped prototype cars use on-board sensors, including the distinctive spinning laser on the car’s roof, to detect anything not on the map, such as vehicles or baby carriages. Google’s existing mapping know-how and resources give it an extra advantage, said Boris Sofman, the co-founder and CEO of Anki, a robotics company that makes self-driving toy cars. But the maps can quickly become stale, he said. Fresh snow could change the landscape.“The map-based approach allows you to drive accurately in a controlled environment, where you know that things don’t change much,” said Dirk Langer, the chief technology officer of ASCar, which makes sensors for autonomous vehicles.Gated retirement communities and college campuses would be examples, he said, arguing that for broader uses sensors are more important than 3D maps.

770,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed former Google Inc executive Michelle Lee to head the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, a position that has been vacant for more than two years.President Barack Obama's choice was approved by an unrecorded voice vote in the full Senate, just over a week after the Senate Judiciary Committee gave the nod to her nomination. The Alexandria, Virginia-based federal agency has more than 12,000 employees whose main role is to determine which inventions deserve a patent. The agency had gone without a confirmed leader since David Kappos, a former IBM Corp executive, left in February 2013.     Lee, a former deputy general counsel and head of patents and patent strategy at Google, had been the acting director of the office. She started with the agency in 2012 as the first director of the patent office's Silicon Valley outpost.   The agency has been a focus of Congressional efforts at patent reform aimed at curbing patent litigation in federal court. The patent office has been criticized for approving what some say are weak software related-patents that have formed the bulk of the litigation.  Robert Stoll, a 29-year veteran of the agency and its commissioner of patents from 2009 to 2011, said Lee's main task will be to improve the quality of patents granted by the agency.""Assuring better quality patents will help blunt the patent troll problem,"" said Stoll, now a partner at the law firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath in Washington, D.C., using a term some use for companies that profit from patent lawsuits instead of making products.  Another complaint has been the agency's long backlog in examining patents. In December 2011, the unexamined backlog was almost 722,000 patents. It currently stands at 602,265, according to the agency's website.The Senate on Monday also approved Daniel Marti to be the White House's intellectual property enforcement coordinator, otherwise known as the ""IP Czar.""

774,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed former Google Inc executive Michelle Lee to head the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, a position that has been vacant for more than two years.President Barack Obama's choice was approved by an unrecorded voice vote in the full Senate, just over a week after the Senate Judiciary Committee gave the nod to her nomination.The Alexandria, Virginia-based federal agency has more than 12,000 employees whose main role is to determine which inventions deserve a patent. The agency had gone without a confirmed leader since David Kappos, a former IBM Corp executive, left in February 2013. Lee, a former deputy general counsel and head of patents and patent strategy at Google, had been the acting director of the office. She started with the agency in 2012 as the first director of the patent office's Silicon Valley outpost.The agency has been a focus of Congressional efforts at patent reform aimed at curbing patent litigation in federal court. The patent office has been criticized for approving what some say are weak software related-patents that have formed the bulk of the litigation.Robert Stoll, a 29-year veteran of the agency and its commissioner of patents from 2009 to 2011, said Lee's main task will be to improve the quality of patents granted by the agency. ""Assuring better quality patents will help blunt the patent troll problem,"" said Stoll, now a partner at the law firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath in Washington, D.C., using a term some use for companies that profit from patent lawsuits instead of making products.Another complaint has been the agency's long backlog in examining patents. In December 2011, the unexamined backlog was almost 722,000 patents. It currently stands at 602,265, according to the agency's website.The Senate on Monday also approved Daniel Marti to be the White House's intellectual property enforcement coordinator, otherwise known as the ""IP Czar.""",2015-03-10,GOOGL,"Mon Mar 9, 2015 | 9:06pm EDT",Former Google exec Lee confirmed to lead U.S. patent office,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-patents-lee-confirmation-idUSL1N0WC01020150310?type=companyNews

The Internet company did not do enough to make clear that the $1,500 computer that mounts to a pair of eyeglasses was merely a prototype and not a finished product, Google’s Astro Teller said during a talk at the South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin. “We allowed and sometimes even encouraged too much attention for the program,” said Teller, whose official title at Google is Captain of Moonshots, during a talk that focused on how his group has learned from some of its failures.Google stopped selling Glass to consumers earlier this year, noting that it was time for a “pause” and a strategy “reset.” The company still sells Glass to businesses.  The device was greeted with enthusiasm among tech aficionados when it was first unveiled in 2012. But Glass, which allows users to access e-mail messages on its eye-level screen and to record video with a tiny camera, quickly ran into problems. Some mocked its awkward appearance, while others expressed concern it could be used to make video recordings surreptitiously.Teller said the “bumps and scrapes” the company experienced with Glass were “absolutely critical for informing the future of Glass and wearables in general.” He also discussed the learning benefits of setbacks in other high-profile projects at the five-year-old Google X division, including drones, solar-powered balloons and self-driving cars. Google initially designed its autonomous cars so that human drivers could take the controls when necessary but abruptly changed course when the company concluded that such a set-up was not safe enough, Teller said. Google’s current self-driving car prototypes eliminate the steering wheel and brake pedal entirely, putting the machine always in control.  The decision to make such a change was not easy, he said, noting that the initial version of the company's self-driving modified Lexus SUVs had advanced to the point where the vehicles could handle highway driving extremely well.“We probably could have made a lot of money selling those,” Teller said.

787,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Boeing Co (BA.N) on Monday said it could clinch a deal this year to build a high-throughput communications satellite for top technology companies such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) or Apple Inc (AAPL.O).Jim Simpson, vice president of business development and chief strategist for Boeing Network and Space Systems, told Reuters the big technology firms were keen to expand Internet access around the world to help them grow. ""The real key to being able to do these type of things is ultra high-throughput capabilities, where we’re looking at providing gigabytes, terrabytes, petabytes of capability,"" Simpson told Reuters after a panel at the Satellite 2015 conference.Simpson declined to give specific details about discussions with the tech companies. He said the challenge was to drive down the cost of satellite communications to be more in line with terrestrial costs, which would help the tech firms justify the expense of building a larger communications satellite. But if sufficient demand failed to materialize, the tech companies would be left with the cost of ""a really high performance satellite,"" he said.Boeing and other satellite makers have been eying a new source of demand from technology firms such as Google and Amazon.com, given their interest in reaching the estimated 70 percent of the globe that still lacks access to the Internet. Privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, has said it plans to build a system of 4,000 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) for global Internet connectivity. In January, it received $1 billion in investments from Google and mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments.Simpson noted that the Google investment was an equity stake in the company, not in the satellite project, but declined to say whether that meant Google could still be a possible customer for a higher-end Boeing system in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO).Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International, said he expected demand for GEO satellites to remain steady at about two dozen a year, but he said those satellites would clearly need to have greater processing power and larger bandwidth, given rising demand for global connectivity. He said GEO satellites were larger and more expensive, but they would save the cost of more frequent maintenance and launch costs for a large network of low-earth orbit satellites. At the same time, he said Boeing was also prepared to build LEO satellites, depending on customer preference.(Story refiles to correct typo in ""petabytes"" in 3rd paragraph) (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Ken Wills)",2015-03-17,GOOGL,"Tue Mar 17, 2015 | 9:18am EDT",Boeing eyes satellite deal with tech giant this year,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-boeing-satellites-idUSKBN0MD00T20150317?type=companyNews

It is the company's first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors.  The device needs an Apple iPhone to work fully, and analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets.""We believe wearable technology will take off,"" Michael Bell, vice president of Intel's New Devices unit, said at a news conference with Tag Heuer at the Baselworld watch and jewellery fair. Intel struck partnerships with several consumer goods companies last year to develop smart wearable products, including eyewear brand Oakley, owned by Luxottica (LUX.MI), watchmaker Fossil (FOSL.O), and U.S. fashion brand Opening Ceremony.""Tag Heuer’s decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said.""With Apple Watch hitting the market it's no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow."" Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music. The unit of French luxury group Kering (PRTP.PA) gave no details of pricing or launch timing.Some luxury executives remained sceptical about smartwatches, however. Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group UHR.VX watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes (HRMS.PA) and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch.""The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic,"" he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday.Hayek forecast his three brands would enjoy a similar year in terms of sales growth to 2014, although trading in Hong Kong, one of his biggest markets, remained difficult.

792,"   By Andrew Chung  While a highly contentious copyright dispute between Oracle Corp and Google Inc gets most of the attention, the battle over patents between the tech heavyweights continues as a U.S. appeals court on Friday resurrected part of an Oracle patent that had been successfully invalidated by Google. A unanimous, three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday agreed with Oracle attorney Marc Hearron of Morrison & Foerster in ruling that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office should not have invalidated all of the Oracle patent's claims. The panel said the agency's interpretation of the patent was faulty and sent it back for reconsideration.

795,"  * Investors hope move signals greater cost discipline* Google shares up more than 2 percent* Porat is latest Wall Street executive to head to tech sector   (Adds context, paragraphs 1-3; datelines)By Alexei Oreskovic and Lauren Tara LaCapraSAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, March 24 Google Inc  hired Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat as its own finance chief, a sign Google is aiming to rein in costs as it invests in new businesses such as self-driving cars and internet-connected eyeglasses.Porat has helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at Morgan Stanley. The bank cut its expenses, excluding compensation, to 29 percent of its revenue last year, down from 34 percent in 2012.Google's costs have jumped as the company embarked on an increasing number of ambitious projects. Last year, the company's revenue grew 19 percent, while total expenses rose 23.4 percent, a trend that alarmed some analysts.""You want someone to come in there and push back against the free spenders,"" said Colin Gillis, an equity research analyst at BGC Partners, a brokerage, adding that investors hope Porat will be that person.Google's shares rose as much as 2.5 percent on Tuesday after Porat's appointment was announced by both companies. She will start her new job on May 26.Porat is the latest among a string of Wall Street executives to leave an industry that is increasingly regulated to move into the more free-wheeling technology sector, where fortunes can be built fast but businesses can also become irrelevant overnight.Total compensation to Google's departing CFO was twice as much as Porat's for the three years through 2013 - $62.2 million vs $29.6 million, according to public filings by the companies. Google has not disclosed how much it expects to pay Porat. She joined Morgan Stanley in 1987, and led Morgan Stanley's investment banking business for tech companies during the Internet boom, working with Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc , among others.Some analysts took her appointment as a sign Google acquisitions could pick up.Porat ran the investment banking business for financial companies including banks, and during the financial crisis she became Morgan Stanley's point person with regulators and other government officials in Washington. Porat, 57, was considered a potential candidate to become chief executive whenever current CEO James Gorman steps down.But several high-level Morgan Stanley sources who have spoken to Reuters about succession planning over the past two years said she was not seen as a top contender. Instead, they pointed to two other executives - Gregory Fleming, 52, who runs wealth management and asset management, and Colm Kelleher, 57, who runs investment banking and trading - as more likely contenders.Some observers saw gender bias at play, given her qualifications and Wall Street's history as a male-dominated industry. At an event last year, Porat criticized the lack of female leadership in corporate America as ""an embarrassment.""""If a woman 'leans in,' but is leaning against a door that is nailed shut, no amount of leaning will bust down the door,"" she said. ""So I think we must hold our organizations accountable where they control the doors by demanding clarity and transparency around succession planning."" Critics have also accused Silicon Valley's culture of being hostile to women. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, is suing her firm for discrimination. The trial heads into final arguments on Tuesday.WALL STREET IS LESS FUN Porat joins an array of bankers, analysts, and other executives that have left Wall Street as strict post-crisis regulations have made the business safer and stodgier. Some of these executives have headed into the technology sector, including Anthony Noto, once an investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, who last year became CFO at Twitter Inc.  In 2010, Mary Meeker, a widely followed tech analyst at Morgan Stanley, left the bank to join Kleiner Perkins.Porat has ties to Silicon Valley, having spent much of her childhood in California and attended Stanford University, where she serves on the board of trustees.She has spent time building her connections with Washington. During the financial crisis, she led the Morgan Stanley teams advising the U.S. Treasury on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank on American International Group Inc.Those ties to Washington could have translated into a government post - she was widely reported to have been a candidate to be the Treasury deputy secretary, but said she was not interested.Porat will replace Patrick Pichette at Google, who said on March 10 that he planned to retire.At Morgan Stanley, Jonathan Pruzan, co-head of the bank's global financial institutions group in investment banking, will become CFO. Pruzan, 46, joined Morgan Stanley in 1994.""He understands the current regulatory environment, having shepherded clients through the Fed's stress test ..."" Gorman said in a memo to staff.

806,"   By Alexei Oreskovic and Lauren Tara LaCapra | SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK Google Inc hired Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat as its own finance chief, a sign Google is aiming to rein in costs as it invests in new businesses such as self-driving cars and internet-connected eyeglasses.Porat has helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at Morgan Stanley. The bank cut its expenses, excluding compensation, to 29 percent of its revenue last year, down from 34 percent in 2012.Google's costs have jumped as the company embarked on an increasing number of ambitious projects. Last year, the company's revenue grew 19 percent, while total expenses rose 23.4 percent, a trend that alarmed some analysts. ""You want someone to come in there and push back against the free spenders,"" said Colin Gillis, an equity research analyst at BGC Partners, a brokerage, adding that investors hope Porat will be that person.Google's shares rose as much as 2.5 percent on Tuesday after Porat's appointment was announced by both companies. She will start her new job on May 26. Porat is the latest among a string of Wall Street executives to leave an industry that is increasingly regulated to move into the more free-wheeling technology sector, where fortunes can be built fast but businesses can also become irrelevant overnight.Total compensation to Google's departing CFO was twice as much as Porat's for the three years through 2013 - $62.2 million vs $29.6 million, according to public filings by the companies. Google has not disclosed how much it expects to pay Porat.She joined Morgan Stanley in 1987, and led Morgan Stanley's investment banking business for tech companies during the Internet boom, working with Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc, among others.Some analysts took her appointment as a sign Google acquisitions could pick up. Porat ran the investment banking business for financial companies including banks, and during the financial crisis she became Morgan Stanley's point person with regulators and other government officials in Washington. Porat, 57, was considered a potential candidate to become chief executive whenever current CEO James Gorman steps down.But several high-level Morgan Stanley sources who have spoken to Reuters about succession planning over the past two years said she was not seen as a top contender. Instead, they pointed to two other executives – Gregory Fleming, 52, who runs wealth management and asset management, and Colm Kelleher, 57, who runs investment banking and trading – as more likely contenders.  Some observers saw gender bias at play, given her qualifications and Wall Street's history as a male-dominated industry. At an event last year, Porat criticized the lack of female leadership in corporate America as ""an embarrassment.""""If a woman 'leans in,' but is leaning against a door that is nailed shut, no amount of leaning will bust down the door,"" she said. ""So I think we must hold our organizations accountable where they control the doors by demanding clarity and transparency around succession planning.""Critics have also accused Silicon Valley's culture of being hostile to women. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, is suing her firm for discrimination. The trial heads into final arguments on Tuesday. WALL STREET IS LESS FUN  Porat joins an array of bankers, analysts, and other executives that have left Wall Street as strict post-crisis regulations have made the business safer and stodgier. Some of these executives have headed into the technology sector, including Anthony Noto, once an investment banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, who last year became CFO at Twitter Inc. In 2010, Mary Meeker, a widely followed tech analyst at Morgan Stanley, left the bank to join Kleiner Perkins.Porat has ties to Silicon Valley, having spent much of her childhood in California and attended Stanford University, where she serves on the board of trustees. She has spent time building her connections with Washington. During the financial crisis, she led the Morgan Stanley teams advising the U.S. Treasury on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank on American International Group Inc.Those ties to Washington could have translated into a government post - she was widely reported to have been a candidate to be the Treasury deputy secretary, but said she was not interested.Porat will replace Patrick Pichette at Google, who said on March 10 that he planned to retire.At Morgan Stanley, Jonathan Pruzan, co-head of the bank's global financial institutions group in investment banking, will become CFO. Pruzan, 46, joined Morgan Stanley in 1994. ""He understands the current regulatory environment, having shepherded clients through the Fed's stress test ..."" Gorman said in a memo to staff.

811,"  (Changes carmakers to drivers in 7th para)* German automakers seek more domestic road tests* Fear Google racing ahead* Complex softwear tests prolong processBy Edward TaylorFRANKFURT, March 26 In the race to build a self-driving car, German automakers are hitting a road block in their efforts to test vehicles so complex they need more than 10 times the amount of software found in a fighter jet.German laws currently place limits on testing on public roads.Automakers fear this is allowing U.S. competitor Google  to pull ahead in developing software, specifically progammes that will give cars the correct reflexes in real-life traffic situations.For years, so-called ""autonomous vehicles"" have been a distant dream but technological advances and a push by Google, with its huge financial resources, to introduce a model in 2012 has kicked the race build them into high gear.Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn told Reuters:  ""We are currently testing at our research facilities, some of them in the United States. The question is: do we only test these cars on public roads in the United States or can we also do it in Germany. Not enough has been done.""Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi already have prototype autonomous vehicles out on German roads but they lack the ability to legally test one of the most difficult parts of the journey - handing control back to a distracted driver.Drivers in Germany are legally not allowed to be distracted during the testing process on public roads. E-mailing in a moving car on a public road is forbidden, for example. ""How much warning does a driver need to take back control of a vehicle after they were e-mailing? Is five seconds enough, or do they need 20? These are just some of the issues that need to be resolved,"" Daimler spokeswoman Katharina Becker said.Mercedes-Benz wants cars with highly autonomous functions to be on the road by 2020.OK COMPUTERS The importance of carmakers putting their feet to the pedal on software verification is evident from looking at the aircraft industry, which has 40 years experience of developing vehicles that run on computers.Lockheed Martin's $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme, which began in 2001, is still being held up by software glitches, despite the company having more than 500 software engineers.Eric Feron, a professor of Aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech, said the auto industry faces a massive challenge to verify software in autonomous cars. ""Cars need much more software than aircraft. The environment in the air is easier, there are no obstacles and they are driven by professional pilots. It is much more complicated on the ground,"" Feron said.The F-35 has between 5 million and 10 million lines of software code, compared with 100 million lines in a modern car.According to auto supplier Bosch, automation in passenger cars started with safety systems that intervened without asking the driver for permission, such as the introduction of anti-lock brakes in 1978, followed by traction control in 1986.These systems have since evolved to include adaptive cruise control, predictive emergency braking, lane-keeping support, and automatic parking assistance systems.A recent drive on an autobahn in a Mercedes-Benz S-Class on the outskirts of Stuttgart showed how far car technology has already advanced. The limousine cruised comfortably in busy traffic, keeping in lane and maintaining the distance to a truck in front, no matter how curvy the route or how slow the traffic ahead. That model can be bought in showrooms today.ETHICAL DECISIONS In August 2013, Mercedes-Benz responded to Google's push by developing a version of its S-class limousine which drove between Mannheim and Pforzheim, a 103 km (64 mile) stretch, without any driver input.Now carmakers are testing prototypes on both sides of the Atlantic. While motoring in Germany commonly takes place on narrow roads, highways in the United States are frequently wider and may have more than six or eight lanes. The location of traffic lights and shape of road signs also vary.In September last year, California granted Mercedes-Benz a licence to test autonomous cars in daily traffic if specially trained test drivers were able to override the autonomous mode at any time.California was following in the footsteps of Nevada, which passed a law in June 2011 to allow test drives of autonomous vehicles there, a factor that helped Google test its own autonomous prototype in 2012.Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas estimate global sales of semi-automated vehicles to reach 8.7 million by 2020, rising to 22.7 million by 2025.Sales of highly automated vehicles, ones where permanent active input from the driver is not required, will not start until 2020, but then rise to around 9 million by 2025.But despite progress in technological matters, carmakers are  still struggling with ethical challenges posed by autonomous cars.For example if a small car suddenly pulls out in front of a truck that was obscuring the view and the car is faced with a choice of hitting either the truck or the car. What is the correct reflex for software programmers to code, Winterkorn asked.""Technologically we can do fully automated self-driving, but the ethical framework is missing,"" Winterkorn said.

812,"  * Unnamed Gulf investor could seek stake* Some shareholders likely to resist capital increase* Partnership agreement would open up new markets in GulfBy Christoph Steitz and Tom KäckenhoffFRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, March 27 Working with a deep-pocketed Gulf backer could be just what RWE boss Peter Terium needs to restore shareholder confidence and escape budget constraints that have plagued Germany's top power producer.The utility last week disclosed it was in talks with an unnamed Gulf investor, raising hopes that it could receive fresh funds and emerge from a crisis that has saddled it with 31 billion euros ($33.6 billion) of debt.The talks, which sources say are at a preliminary stage, come when the 117-year-old German group is desperately looking for ways to reinvent its business model after a surge in renewable capacity and weak energy demand across Europe sent wholesale prices and profits into a decline.""You have a company with no money and lots of knowledge and an investor awash in cash but without any expertise,"" a senior source familiar with the matter said when asked about the rationale behind any form of cooperation.Terium, 51, is no stranger to transformative deals, having helped to engineer RWE's 8.2 billion euro takeover of rival Essent in 2009.The soft-spoken Dutchman is under pressure to deliver after bigger rival E.ON announced last year it would spin off its troubled power generation unit.But Terium might have to settle, for now at least, for a partnership deal with a new backer because of opposition from cash-strapped German municipal shareholders who would not want their stakes diluted in a capital increase. NEW MARKETS A cooperation agreement would make sense too.RWE already has a foothold in the Gulf after forming a joint venture with state-run utility Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) in 2012 to provide consulting services to investors, energy suppliers and governments.Last year, RWE won a contract to help Dubai set up an energy agency, whose aim is to boost growth in the emirate via energy efficiency measures.Dubai, where energy demand grows by about 5 percent per year compared with a stagnant Europe, in January more than doubled its target for renewables in its overall energy mix given the falling cost of solar power.""Investors from the Arab region would be interested in German know-how, which is considered top notch globally,"" a senior adviser said, declining to be named. RWE, in turn, is aiming for financially potent investors in its renewable energy strategy. It would trade its expertise in operation and maintenance for funds to finance assets it can't afford on it own, notably offshore wind parks, which carry a price tag of at least 1 billion euros apiece.OWNERSHIP SHAKE UP? Middle East investors have long seen Europe as a place to splash out billions of euros. Qatar is the most active player, with stakes in the Shard, London's tallest building, as well as companies including Sainsbury's, Volkswagen  and Spanish utility Iberdrola.With RWE's cash reserves depleted, Terium needs to rebuild confidence in the group's shares which have dropped by a quarter since he took over as CEO in 2012, losing almost 5 billion in market value.

813,"  SYDNEY, March 30 Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey hinted on Monday at changes that could force digital companies like Apple Inc, Google Inc, Alibaba Group Holding and Uber to pay more tax on transactions that take place in Australia.""I want to find a way for them to pay the GST,"" Hockey told reporters, referring to the goods and sales tax, after releasing a discussion paper on the country's ""unsustainable"" tax system.""We're not collecting the revenue that we should be collecting and that we want to collect, that is fair,"" Hockey said.The long-awaited 200-page ""Re:Think"" report does not outline any definitive changes but political and market analysts believe its focus on a few key areas heralds forthcoming changes.Up for discussion are a cut to Australia's corporate tax rate, a broadening of the goods and services that are included in the GST and a new levy on bank deposits. ""New technology, changing consumer behaviour and increasing global trade are threatening the medium and long-term viability of our taxation system,"" Hockey told reporters in Canberra. ""For too long, our taxation system has been reactive not proactive.""Australia led a push by the Group of 20 as its chair last year to develop stricter rules on cross border taxation to close loopholes that have allowed companies like Google, Amazon.com Inc and Starbucks Corp to avoid paying taxes.The Australian government collects up to 70 percent of its revenue from company tax and personal income tax, a level that Hockey said is unsustainable. It needs the support of the state governments to make any changes to the GST, which at 10 percent is one of the lowest in the developed world.At the other end of the spectrum, Hockey suggested that Australia's company tax was too high and is being eroded by online-based companies. Australia's 30 percent company tax rate is higher than many of its competitors' and a third of all company tax is paid by just 12 companies.Hockey stressed that the existing bank deposit levy of 0.5 percent on deposits up to A$250,000 was introduced by the previous labour government and suggestd it was not enough.""There's many things I don't like that I have to implement at the moment, that have been a legacy from six years of bad Labor government,"" Hockey said.Submissions and suggestions on the paper are due by Jan. 1.

817,"  (Adds quotes, details on Chrome, background)By Paul CarstenBEIJING, April 2 A Chinese Internet regulator on Thursday slammed as ""unacceptable"" a decision by Google Inc  to no longer recognise its certificates of trust, a move which could deter Chrome browser users accessing sites approved by the authority.Google said on its official security blog on Wednesday that it would no longer recognise the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) certificate authorities, following a joint investigation between the company and CNNIC into a potential security lapse last month.That means that users of Google's Chrome, the world's top Internet browser, may get a warning when attempting to visit sites certified by CNNIC. It was not immediately clear how many websites CNNIC has certified and could yield warning messages.CNNIC, which plays a central role in administering China's Internet by allocating and certifying IP addresses and web domain names, urged Google to consider user rights and interests. ""The decision that Google has made is unacceptable and unintelligible,"" the agency said in a statement on its website.Last week CNNIC's certificates, which are used to ensure that the connection between an Internet user and a website is secure, came under scrutiny after an official Google blog post said the Chinese agency had allowed Cairo-based MCS Holdings to issue unauthorised certificates for various Google domains. That rendered connections between users and those websites vulnerable to 'man-in-the-middle' hacking attacks, Google said. These attacks can intercept and alter communications.Microsoft Corp and Mozilla, which together with Google develop three of the world's most-used web browsers, also removed trust of those unauthorised certificates last week, following Google's post.""While neither we nor CNNIC believe any further unauthorised digital certificates have been issued, nor do we believe the misissued certificates were used outside the limited scope of MCS Holdings' test network, CNNIC will be working to prevent any future incidents,"" Google said on Wednesday. The U.S. search giant added that CNNIC was welcome to reapply for recognition ""once suitable technical and procedural controls are in place,"" and CNNIC's existing certificates would be trusted for a limited time through a whitelist.MCS Holdings said in a statement on its website last week that the security lapse was the result of human error following testing of certificates issued to it by CNNIC, which was meant to take place in a controlled environment.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's Internet regulator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Google shut down its local search engine in China in 2010 over censorship concerns, and most of its services are now inaccessible in China.

830,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS The European Union will accuse Google on Wednesday of abusing its dominant position in Internet searches, opening the U.S. tech company up to a risk of massive fines and enforced changes in its business model, the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday.However, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that a formal antitrust charge sheet will not be ready for Wednesday and could take several more months to draw up. The EU can impose fines of up to 10 percent of global turnover, or more than $6 billion in penalties in Google's case.An EU official said Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager would make an important announcement about Google on Wednesday, after the EU's executive holds its weekly meeting.The Commission's chief spokesman would not confirm the reports, which cited EU officials, but said there would be a news conference around noon after the meeting. Vestager, who had indicated she would not be rushed into a decision on the five-year-old case, is due to fly to the United States later on Wednesday for a high-profile working visit.  Americans, including business leaders and President Barack Obama, have questioned EU efforts to curb the power of U.S. tech companies.The Danish liberal will accuse Google of breaching competition law by diverting traffic from rivals to favor its own services, said the FT, adding that some fellow commissioners had been concerned Vestager was narrowing the probe. The possibility of an early announcement of action against Google was made public earlier this week by Guenther Oettinger, the conservative German commissioner for the digital economy, who has been a sharp critic of Google and has spoken up for the interests of European technology and publishing companies. Separately, Vestager will launch an investigation into Google's Android mobile software business, the FT said.The Commission has been laying the groundwork for a case centered on whether Google abuses the dominant market share of Android to promote its own services.Vestager made the decision to go ahead with charges on Tuesday together with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and will inform her colleagues on Wednesday, the Journal said. In office since November, Juncker's executive has put the fostering of Europe's digital economy and free trade with the United States among its priorities, but some EU officials are concerned U.S. companies are choking European competitors.Vestager has narrowed the case, which she inherited from her Spanish predecessor, Joaquin Almunia - who rejected three settlement proposals from Google - the FT said. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Andreas Schwab, a German conservative member of the European Parliament who has pushed for the EU executive to consider even breaking up Google, told Reuters earlier this week he expected the Commission to bring competition charges against the company.However, industry and EU sources played down earlier on Tuesday suggestions that Vestager was about to announce charges against the Google. The EU investigation is one of the highest profile competition cases of recent years, rivaling probes into Microsoft Corp, and comes amid political disquiet in Europe at the perceived dominance of U.S. tech companies.Almunia launched the probe in 2010 and initially concluded that Google may have hurt competitors by favoring its own products and services in search results and blocking advertisers from moving their campaigns to rival platforms.Since then, Google has offered three proposals to resolve the case. Most recently, just over a year ago, it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website, let content providers decide what material it can use for its own services and make it easier for advertisers to move their campaigns to rivals.Almunia initially accepted that deal, only to reverse his decision six months later and demand more concessions, leaving the ultimate decision to his successor.Microsoft has been hit with total EU fines of more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.34 billion) over the past decade.

833,"  BRUSSELS, April 14 Google may learn more on Wednesday about how Europe's antitrust chief will treat complaints about its market dominance, according to EU officials who said Margrethe Vestager was likely to make an announcement.However, industry and EU sources played down suggestions that Vestager, who took over as EU competition commissioner in November and has indicated she will not be rushed into concluding the five-year-old inquiry, was about to announce charges against the U.S. Internet search giant.A European Commission spokesman declined comment on Tuesday on whether Vestager, who is due to fly to the United States on Wednesday afternoon, would make a statement after the weekly meeting of all 28 EU commissioners in the morning. That followed a comment on Monday by another commissioner, digital economy chief Guenther Oettinger, who said Vestager would make a statement on Google in days. Another EU official said he expected an announcement on Wednesday.Asked about such remarks, Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a routine news briefing on Tuesday: ""The Commission does not always express itself on ongoing competition cases. ""If there is a time for announcements it will be announced, but there is nothing on this question today."" Google could not be reached for comment.Andreas Schwab, a member of the European Parliament who has pushed for the EU executive to consider even breaking up Google , told Reuters he expected the Commission to conclude its investigation and issue a statement of objections - effectively bringing charges against Google that could result in huge fines and orders to reshape its business in Europe.

The shopping case, on which the EU has had the most complaints dating back the longest time, could potentially set a precedent for concerns over Google's search products for hotels, flights and other services.Vestager, a Dane who took over the politically charged case in November, announced the moves on the eve of a high-profile visit to the United States. Her findings follow nearly five years of investigation and abortive efforts by her Spanish predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, to strike deals with Google.""I am concerned that the company has given an unfair advantage to its own comparison shopping service, in breach of EU antitrust rules,"" she said. Google could face fines, she warned, if the Commission proves its case that it has used its ""near monopoly"" in Europe to push Google Shopping ahead of rivals for the past seven years.Google rejected the charges. Its shares closed up 0.40 percent on Wednesday after earlier losing 1 percent.Meanwhile, Google's rivals are pushing U.S. antitrust enforcers to investigate the use of Android, two people with knowledge of the matter said.    Analysts said the EU charges were unlikely to hurt Google's evaluation because it reflected the regulatory risk. If recent history of EU probes into tech companies is an indicator, however, Google shares may have trouble moving forward until the issue is resolved.In its first reaction, the Mountain View, California-based company said in a blog post that it strongly disagreed with the EU's statement of objections and would make the case that its products have fostered competition and benefited consumers.""Android has been a key player in spurring this competition and choice, lowering prices and increasing choice for everyone (there are over 18,000 different devices available today),"" it said of its free operating system for mobile devices.The Commission, whose control of antitrust matters across the wealthy 28-nation bloc gives it a major say in the fate of global corporations, can fine firms up to 10 percent of their annual sales, in Google's case up to 6.2 billion euros.  If it finds that companies are abusing a dominant market position, the EU regulator can also demand sweeping changes to their business practices, as it did with U.S. software giant Microsoft in 2004 and chip-maker Intel in 2009. Its record antitrust fine was 1.09 billion euros on Intel.Competition lawyer Bertold Baer-Bouyssiere at DLA Piper in Brussels said: ""Even more than Microsoft, this case will shape the landscape for the digital sectors in the years to come.""""NOT ANTI-AMERICAN"" Rejecting suggestions - recently from President Barack Obama himself - that the EU was pursuing an anti-American, protectionist policy, Vestager, a liberal former economy minister, said about a quarter of the firms which had complained to the EU authorities about Google were themselves U.S.-owned.She insisted that political pressure had played no part in her decision to accuse Google.

She wanted a change in the ""principle"" underlying searches rather than a redesign of current Web pages or tweaks to algorithms by which Google ranks results.

Vestager stressed her antitrust staff would continue to investigate other areas of concern, including alleged ""web scraping"" to copy rivals' content, and restrictive practices on advertising.A final resolution - quite possibly involving court action if Google does not choose to settle - is likely to take many months and probably years, legal experts said.

841,"   By Diane Bartz and Dan Levine | WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO, April 15  WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO, April 15 Google Inc  competitors are pushing U.S. antitrust enforcers to investigate allegations the Internet services company unfairly uses its Android system to win online advertising, two people with knowledge of the matter said.A small number of technology companies have complained to the Department of Justice that the Android mobile operating system is anti-competitive, said the sources, who declined to be named to protect business relationships.Google reached a settlement in 2013 with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over Web search allegations. Any new action by U.S. regulators would be a major risk for the company in its home market.However, regulators often speak with companies about fairness complaints without the discussions leading to an investigation, and Google has already successfully fought off a U.S. civil suit involving Android.The meetings between Google critics and regulators predate Wednesday's announcement by the European Union after a five-year probe that Google distorted Web search results to favor its own shopping service. The EU also opened another antitrust investigation into Android.Google has been accused anti-competitive conduct in the United States and Europe because of the control it exerts over handset makers who want to use its smartphone operating system. Tech companies have complained about requirements that they give Google search, maps and other products a prominent place on the handsets. Gary Reback, a Carr Ferrell LLP attorney who battled Microsoft Corp in the 1990s and has spent much of the past decade fighting Google, predicted that more companies would reach out to regulators in coming months.""Stay tuned on Android. There are going to be more complaints from apps people,"" he said at a panel discussion hosted on Wednesday by anti-Google industry coalition Fair Search. The coalition includes Microsoft, Expedia Inc  and Nokia Oyj.However, Google might have some legal ammunition to fight a potential investigation of Android. Earlier this year, a federal judge in San Jose, California dismissed a consumer class action lawsuit alleging Google requires handset makers to make Google search the default on Android phones, which helps it stay dominant in search.By forbidding competitors such as Microsoft to pay for prime placement on screens, Google inflated the cost of Android phones for consumers, the lawsuit said.U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled that the allegations consumers were harmed were ""too speculative"" for the lawsuit to proceed. The plaintiffs uncovered no facts to indicate Google's conduct ""prevented consumers from freely choosing among search products or prevented competitors from innovating,"" the judge wrote. The plaintiffs have since withdrawn the case. Steve Berman, an attorney for the consumers, could not immediately be reached for comment about whether they would try to refile the suit in light of the European announcement.One legal expert said it would be very hard for the U.S. government to win an antitrust lawsuit involving Android. It would have to show, for example, that the agreements with phone makers severely restricted the ability of customers to substitute apps.""This has been a recurring problem in these Google investigations: that the squawking has come mainly from competitors,"" said Herbert Hovenkamp, a law professor at the University of Iowa.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission closed its case in January 2013 after requiring Google to stop ""scraping"" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. The FTC also demanded that advertisers be allowed to export data to evaluate advertising campaigns independently.Google and the Justice Department declined comment for this story.

842,"  NEW YORK, April 15 The European Union on Wednesday launched an antitrust probe into Google Inc's  Android system, and if recent history is any indicator, shares of the Internet giant may have trouble moving forward until the issue is resolved.There have been high-profile investigations by the EU into two other U.S. tech companies in the past ten years, and in both cases the stocks fell between the date of initiation and the date of resolution, though both rebounded in the two months following the end to the investigation. Intel Corp fell about 35 percent between July 2007 and May 2009, during an EU investigation. After paying a fine, the Dow component rose nearly 10 percent over the subsequent two months. The EU initiated three investigations into Microsoft Corp  between 2008 and 2013, the first two of which were resolved without a fine. Over the period of the third investigation, which was resolved with a fine, the stock fell about 5 percent, though it subsequently rose by roughly that same amount in the subsequent two months. The EU's investigation into Google was first reported by media outlets on Tuesday, when the stock fell 1.6 percent. Shares were up 0.6 percent to $533.53 on Wednesday.

846,"   By Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp emanated an air of quiet satisfaction on Wednesday as European antitrust regulators readied charges against rival Google Inc for abusing its monopoly power in the online search business. The software giant, one of the leading complainants against Google in the EU, has been pushing for closer regulatory scrutiny on its online rival for years both in public and behind the scenes.Long-time staffers at Microsoft, still scarred from its own battles with U.S. and European regulators over the last two decades, did not express sympathy for Google facing a similar process. ""They have to go through what they have to go through,"" said one Microsoft general manager, who was closely involved in the company's public relations at the time of Microsoft's antitrust trial against the U.S. Department of Justice, which started in late 1998 and dragged on until early 2000.The judge in that trial found that Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly by forcing PC makers to bundle its Internet Explorer browser with its operating system. But his proposed remedy of splitting Microsoft into two parts was later overturned and the parties agreed to settle in 2001. To add in some irony, one of the key agitators for the U.S. Justice Department to prosecute Microsoft for abusing its Windows monopoly in the 1990s was Novell CEO Eric Schmidt, now the executive chairman of Google.""What goes around comes around, eh?"" said one former senior Microsoft executive, who remembers the effects of the extended skirmish with the Justice Department. Microsoft's official position on the EU's proposed action against Google was not inflammatory, but it welcomed the scrutiny. ""Today’s decision provides to Google a full opportunity to explain its views at a hearing, and the Commission will then have the opportunity to decide whether European legal rules have been respected,"" a Microsoft spokesman said in an emailed statement.Microsoft has said Google makes it hard for its own Bing search engine to access Google's YouTube and refuses to share advertisers' data with Bing, among other anti-competitive practices. Even as it appears that such issues will now get wider attention, several Microsoft staffers said on Wednesday that it was ""business as usual"" at its campus in Redmond, Washington, and not a day for celebration. That may be a reflection of the fact that many of the younger workers at Microsoft do not remember the antitrust tribulations 15 years ago, and also that the culture has changed in the past year.Former CEO Steve Ballmer was known for his pugnacious dislike of Google, whereas his successor Satya Nadella, who took over 14 months ago, has made smoothing relations with Silicon Valley rivals a key theme of his tenure.""People here are focused on a fairer market,"" said another Microsoft staffer.

848,"   By Alastair Macdonald | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Google boss Eric Schmidt might have missed it in the uproar over the EU's antitrust charges against the U.S. tech giant, but European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager wants to congratulate him.It was a throwaway line in an hour-long press conference in Brussels as Vestager moved dramatically against Google a day ahead of her first big working visit to the United States. The EU accused Google of abusing its dominance of Internet searches to push its own products. But Vestager's praise for the innovative Californian company's hugely popular services echoed a mantra of fairness and independence from political and corporate lobbying on all sides. The 47-year-old Dane has clung to that mantra since becoming competition commission in November - a job that makes her among the most powerful figures in global business, with a power she now seems determined to exercise across many issues.""My kids or myself never consider for a minute this is a U.S. company or a European company. The reason we use it is that Google has very good products,"" said Vestager, who moved in under six months to a prosecution that her predecessor eschewed for five years, much to the fury of some big EU governments.""It's in our language. If you look for something you say, 'Let me Google it'. ... I think you should congratulate a company that is so successful."" It was a message that seemed aimed at those who rejoiced on Wednesday at Google's comeuppance, whether across the political spectrum in Germany, France and other EU states dismayed by the way Americans have eclipsed Europe in the new century's industrial revolution, or among Google's U.S. rivals, which have been among the most persistent campaigners for its punishment.""Dominance as such is not a problem. Not in general and not under EU law,"" Vestager said, stressing that she for one has no great problem with Google's 90 percent share of EU web searches and that she was open to persuasion that penalties were not required. THE MORE THE FUSS, THE MORE THE FOCUS In a cool performance, alternating charm and combativeness, Vestager, a liberal former Danish economy minister, dismissed suggestions she was dancing to the tune of Germany - the EU's largest economy - and scoffed at the thought she might ever meet U.S. President Barack Obama, who accused the EU of tech protectionism this year. ""The more politics around the case, the more we have to stay on track when it comes to facts,"" she said, six weeks after having met Google's executive chairman, Schmidt, to hear his views.Google rejected her accusations. It said it has contributed to the growth of small businesses and competitors and was less  dominant in new-style mobile services -- arguments that helped fend off an investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, whose chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, Vestager will meet in Washington on Thursday.The company may hope the EU commissioner is true to her word in resisting the anti-Americanism prevalent in parts of Europe and anti-Google sentiment among U.S. rivals. But as she settles in for a five-year mandate and a string of other high-profile cases, Vestager appears confident she can avoid disappointing expectations that she will oblige Google to compromise, either through a settlement or, ultimately, via victory in the courts.

849,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Internet platforms such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo! will be the subject of a widespread inquiry by European regulators to determine whether they are transparent enough in how they display search results.The inquiry will seek to address concerns of European business and politicians about the dominance of U.S. tech giants and whether there is a level playing field for European firms.However, it is not an antitrust inquiry which can lead to fines of up to 10 percent of a company's global sales.In a draft of the Commission's strategy for creating a digital single market, seen by Reuters, it says it will ""carry out a comprehensive investigation and consultation on the role of platforms, including the growth of the sharing economy.""The investigation, expected to be carried out next year, will look into the transparency of search results - involving paid for links and advertisements - and how platforms use the information they acquire.European Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip is expected to formally announce the new strategy on May 6. The transparency of search results came under particular scrutiny this week when the European competition chief accused Google of cheating competitors by distorting web search results to consistently favor its own shopping service.There are concerns in Europe over how Internet companies such as Facebook and Amazon use the huge amounts of personal data they acquire.The inquiry will also look at how platforms compensate rights-holders for showing copyrighted material and limits on the ability of individuals and businesses to move from one platform to another. The draft ""digital single market"" strategy document cites potentially unfair terms limiting access to platforms, high fees and non-transparent or restrictive pricing policies as some of the areas of concern.""While a framework exists for business-to-consumer complaints in all EU member states, no such mechanism exists for business-to-business relations,"" the document states.The investigation follows calls from France and Germany for greater regulation of dominant Internet players which they believe are harming home-grown European web firms. In November the two countries asked the Commission to launch a public consultation on the issue, with a view to regulating Internet platforms.However, in an earlier discussion paper, seen by Reuters, the Commission concluded there was not enough evidence to justify legislation.One EU official said the Commission was assessing whether the issues raised in the Google antitrust case warranted a more systemic view of the problem.""We want to move away from case studies,"" the official said.

850,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Start small, win quick, then move on to bigger issues.That appears to be the European Union's strategy to pursue Google (GOOGL.O) in a competition dispute by choosing to push a narrow set of charges around its shopping service, while opening another investigation of Google's Android mobile phone software.Whether or not the EU succeeds in branding Google a market-abusing monopolist in web search - a big if, given that the competition authority has yet to publish its exact charges - the Internet giant could be pinned down for years to come in regulatory procedures and legal appeals.A drawn-out process is likely to embolden existing and would-be interlopers to step up assaults on Google's wide range of businesses, if the history of Microsoft's (MSFT.O) antitrust battles with U.S. and European regulators is any guide. In accusing Google of anti-competitive practices against rival shopping sites, the EU competition authority said it is continuing to investigate other areas, including alleged ""web scraping"" to copy content off of rival travel and local business review sites, and Google's restrictive practices on advertising.A quick EU finding that Google has abused its market power by favoring its own shopping services at the expense of non-Google websites, could set a precedent for new charges over how it handles hotels, flights and other services, experts say.This, in turn, could renew politically charged debates over Google's tax avoidance moved and privacy safeguards.""The concern is how broad does this investigation go?"" asked Macquarie Securities analyst Ben Schachter, who tracks Google.  Google readily acknowledges it is the most used search engine in Europe, but argues that people find information on the Internet via many avenues, including social media, mobile phone apps, shopping sites and by going directly to popular sites.""Allegations of harm, for consumers and competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark,"" Google said in a statement responding to the European Commission. ""We respectfully but strongly disagree.""So far, nothing the EU proposed in its preliminary statement of objections suggests it is ready to force Google to change its business model, any hint of which would spook investors and be a threat to its ability to innovate and compete, analysts say.""We see little long-term risk to the business model from regulators,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to investors. More likely, the EU will impose fines or set competitive restrictions on how Google features its own properties versus those of rivals, he said.  IMPASSE By contrast, Microsoft was accused of tying its web browser to its Windows software monopoly in a bid to dominate the emerging Web era and faced calls to be split in two in the course of legal battles stretching from 1998 to 2010. That created openings for Internet leaders Google, Facebook (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) to emerge.It's too early to say whether Google faces the same fate as the world moves beyond computers into the mobile Internet era. Working in Google's favor is its control over Android, the software used to power more than 80 percent of all smartphones. That positions it well for the current shift, but puts it on uncertain ground as the EU starts to probe Android as well.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said she wants a change in the ""principle"" underlying searches rather than a redesign of current Web pages or tweaks to algorithms by which Google ranks results.During the five-year inquiry leading to the accusations, Google agreed three times to settlement terms, only to be rebuffed by EU authorities who saw its proposed changes as too narrow or cosmetic. This week's crackdown on Google drew a chorus of cheers from a handful of start-up shopping sites that had filed complaints alleging Google excluded them from its search. They see the EU's action giving them a second chance, both in terms of business opportunities and the ability to attract fresh venture funding.But Google's woes are not likely to help Europe's burgeoning start-up scene, in part because Google is an active funder and serial acquirer of young companies here, but also because most firms count on Google's low-cost ads to fund their own services. Instead, Google's bigger opponents including German publisher Axel Springer (SPRGn.DE) and other European media and telecom firms with more to gain from having it on the defensive.GLOVES COME OFF The likeliest beneficiaries do not come from Europe at all. They are well-known, high-tech names that increasingly compete with Google in what is largely a single, global digital market. These include Apple and Samsung (005930.KS) in phones, Amazon.com in shopping, Facebook and Twitter in social media, and, in software, Microsoft and Oracle (ORCL.N), two active backers of the EU case against Google.Amazon, Facebook, and Apple share many similar business practices to Google in terms of favoring their own products over those of competitors, analyst Sebastian said. Each, in its way, is gaining ground on Google in realms they control. But because none of these rivals have the decisive monopoly market power that Google has over web search, they don't, at least so far, face the same scrutiny from regulators, he says.Amazon's site search uses its own “buy box” to favor either its own inventory or that of other key partners. Apple's mobile apps (iTunes, Maps, AppStore) are installed as default software on its closely controlled phones and tablets, akin to how Android phones default to Google's search, maps and app store.Facebook targets advertising using members' personal details, which gives it a distinct advantage over other online and offline media companies, including Google. From nowhere a decade ago, Facebook now ranks second behind Google in terms of advertising customers, the revenue lifeblood of both companies. Google has 4 million customers while Facebook has 2 million customers, according to Macquarie analyst Schachter's estimates.Facebook has also begun beefing up its search capabilities, posing a big challenge to Google by keeping users inside its network instead of going to the open web, where Google is king. Google is now gearing up to allow websites to target ads to their existing users, using customer email addresses, taking direct aim at a similar Facebook audience targeting advertising product, analysts say.Google may have held off from launching this product to avoid provoking regulators, which has now happened despite efforts to appease the EU, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.

851,"  * Narrow focus of Google case increases chances EU will succeed* Quick finding Google abused market could lead to further charges* Google biz model not at risk from initial EU objections-analysts* Investors must brace for years of regulatory battlesBy Eric AuchardFRANKFURT, April 17 Start small, win quick, then move on to bigger issues.That appears to be the European Union's strategy to pursue Google in a competition dispute by choosing to push a narrow set of charges around its shopping service, while opening another investigation of Google's Android mobile phone software.Whether or not the EU succeeds in branding Google a market-abusing monopolist in web search - a big if, given that the competition authority has yet to publish its exact charges - the Internet giant could be pinned down for years to come in regulatory procedures and legal appeals.A drawn-out process is likely to embolden existing and would-be interlopers to step up assaults on Google's wide range of businesses, if the history of Microsoft's antitrust battles with U.S. and European regulators is any guide.In accusing Google of anti-competitive practices against rival shopping sites, the EU competition authority said it is continuing to investigate other areas, including alleged ""web scraping"" to copy content off of rival travel and local business review sites, and Google's restrictive practices on advertising.A quick EU finding that Google has abused its market power by favouring its own shopping services at the expense of non-Google websites, could set a precedent for new charges over how it handles hotels, flights and other services, experts say.This, in turn, could renew politically charged debates over Google's tax avoidance moved and privacy safeguards.""The concern is how broad does this investigation go?"" asked Macquarie Securities analyst Ben Schachter, who tracks Google. Google readily acknowledges it is the most used search engine in Europe, but argues that people find information on the Internet via many avenues, including social media, mobile phone apps, shopping sites and by going directly to popular sites.""Allegations of harm, for consumers and competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark,"" Google said in a statement responding to the European Commission. ""We respectfully but strongly disagree.""So far, nothing the EU proposed in its preliminary statement of objections suggests it is ready to force Google to change its business model, any hint of which would spook investors and be a threat to its ability to innovate and compete, analysts say.""We see little long-term risk to the business model from regulators,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to investors. More likely, the EU will impose fines or set competitive restrictions on how Google features its own properties versus those of rivals, he said.IMPASSE By contrast, Microsoft was accused of tying its web browser to its Windows software monopoly in a bid to dominate the emerging Web era and faced calls to be split in two in the course of legal battles stretching from 1998 to 2010. That created openings for Internet leaders Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.com to emerge. It's too early to say whether Google faces the same fate as the world moves beyond computers into the mobile Internet era. Working in Google's favour is its control over Android, the software used to power more than 80 percent of all smartphones. That positions it well for the current shift, but puts it on uncertain ground as the EU starts to probe Android as well.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said she wants a change in the ""principle"" underlying searches rather than a redesign of current Web pages or tweaks to algorithms by which Google ranks results.During the five-year inquiry leading to the accusations, Google agreed three times to settlement terms, only to be rebuffed by EU authorities who saw its proposed changes as too narrow or cosmetic.This week's crackdown on Google drew a chorus of cheers from a handful of start-up shopping sites that had filed complaints alleging Google excluded them from its search. They see the EU's action giving them a second chance, both in terms of business opportunities and the ability to attract fresh venture funding.But Google's woes are not likely to help Europe's burgeoning start-up scene, in part because Google is an active funder and serial acquirer of young companies here, but also because most firms count on Google's low-cost ads to fund their own services.Instead, Google's bigger opponents including German publisher Axel Springer and other European media and telecom firms with more to gain from having it on the defensive. GLOVES COME OFF The likeliest beneficiaries do not come from Europe at all. They are well-known, high-tech names that increasingly compete with Google in what is largely a single, global digital market.These include Apple and Samsung in phones, Amazon.com in shopping, Facebook and Twitter in social media, and, in software, Microsoft and Oracle, two active backers of the EU case against Google.Amazon, Facebook, and Apple share many similar business practices to Google in terms of favouring their own products over those of competitors, analyst Sebastian said. Each, in its way, is gaining ground on Google in realms they control.But because none of these rivals have the decisive monopoly market power that Google has over web search, they don't, at least so far, face the same scrutiny from regulators, he says.Amazon's site search uses its own ""buy box"" to favour either its own inventory or that of other key partners. Apple's mobile apps (iTunes, Maps, AppStore) are installed as default software on its closely controlled phones and tablets, akin to how Android phones default to Google's search, maps and app store.Facebook targets advertising using members' personal details, which gives it a distinct advantage over other online and offline media companies, including Google. From nowhere a decade ago, Facebook now ranks second behind Google in terms of advertising customers, the revenue lifeblood of both companies. Google has 4 million customers while Facebook has 2 million customers, according to Macquarie analyst Schachter's estimates.Facebook has also begun beefing up its search capabilities, posing a big challenge to Google by keeping users inside its network instead of going to the open web, where Google is king.Google is now gearing up to allow websites to target ads to their existing users, using customer email addresses, taking direct aim at a similar Facebook audience targetting advertising product, analysts say.Google may have held off from launching this product to avoid provoking regulators, which has now happened despite efforts to appease the EU, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.""Google knows that anything that they want to do is going to met with regulatory scrutiny, so why hold back?""

853,"  * EU antitrust agent to accuse Gazprom of overcharging* Google also recently accused, of abusing market power* Vestager acts despite political ramifications-analyst   (Adds Gazprom source, expert comments)By Foo Yun Chee and Barbara LewisBRUSSELS, April 20 The European Union will launch a legal attack on Russian gas giant Gazprom  this week, ramping up tensions with Moscow, when antitrust agents will accuse it of overcharging buyers in eastern Europe, EU sources told Reuters on Monday.The state-controlled company, a vital supplier of energy to Europe despite frequent political disputes, could receive a full charge sheet from European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Wednesday, one source said.More than two years after Brussels started investigating Gazprom, the move comes just a week after the new EU antitrust chief charged U.S. tech giant Google with abusing its market power after five years of hesitation by her predecessor. Vestager has appeared determined to challenge big corporate powers since taking on the powerful post in November, regardless of past offers of compromise from both Google and Gazprom.Despite the Danish commissioner's insistence that she would look at only the legal merits of a case that focuses on Gazprom pricing policies differentiating between customers, the accusations will do nothing to ease EU frictions with Moscow over Ukraine in which gas supplies have played a major role.The sources said Vestager was likely to send the charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, to Gazprom once she returns from a trip to the United States, where she arrived within hours of charging Google. Such a document sets out concerns about possible anti-competitive practices.Gazprom and the European Commission declined official comment. A source close to the Russian company said Gazprom had always wanted to find an amicable solution, so a statement of objections now ""would not be a welcome move"".Gazprom tried to settle the case last year by offering concessions to Vestager's predecessor but talks floundered over its refusal to cut prices for eastern European customers.The EU antitrust chief is taking a tougher line than her predecessor despite the political ramifications of some cases, said Mario Mariniello, a former economist at the Commission and now an expert at Brussels think tank Bruegel. ""Vestager is sending a message that her mandate is not about settling cases. If she has a solid case, she will push ahead with charges,"" he said.""Sending a statement of objections to Gazprom now would be her way of saying that she will focus on the substance of the case regardless of the political implications.""The Russian behemoth, with annual sales of some $100 billion, supplies about 30 percent of the 28-nation bloc's natural gas. It has been under investigation since September 2012, including for hampering the flow of gas across Europe.In a speech in Washington on Thursday, Vestager did not name Gazprom but stressed she was ready to get tough with energy companies that ""harm rivals, block energy flows from one EU country to another, or threaten to close the tap"".Vestager has the power to order changes in companies' business practices as well as to levy fines of, in theory at least, up to 10 percent of their annual global turnover.European Commission officials had said in February they were close to taking the next step in the investigation.

857,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK, April 21  NEW YORK, April 21 The European Union's antitrust probe into Google sparked a big rally in Russian search engine Yandex NV  last week, even though the ""Russian Google"" still faces significant challenges, competitive and otherwise.Yandex has amassed a $6.54 billion market capitalization, mainly by selling advertising against the web browser used on 64 percent of Russian desktop computers.But it has lost market share as Russian consumers have adopted Android-based cell phones that come pre-loaded with Google products that compete directly with Yandex applications.It also saw earnings suffer as the Russian economy was hit by weak oil prices and Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.First-quarter earnings, due April 28, are seen falling 29.6 percent compared with a year earlier but revenue is seen up 11.9 percent, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.With Russian stocks recovering and the EU looking into whether Google has an unfair competitive advantage , some investors hope Yandex can win more screen space and advertising revenue. A recently announced deal with web browser Mozilla to make Yandex its default search engine in Turkey also may herald growth prospects for the company. Yandex continues to grow, even though it faces the Google threat, said Susan McDonald, an investment manager on Aberdeen's London-based global emerging markets equities team, which recently began buying Yandex shares.The stock, whose U.S. listing is on Nasdaq, rose 15.4 percent last week, the biggest one-week jump since April 2013, following the EU's Google announcement. They are up 14.4 percent year-to-date, based on their Monday closing price, less than the 31 percent rise in the Market Vectors Russia ETF's, a favorite way for U.S. investors to play the country.The pop in Yandex's stock may have been overblown, suggested Robert Lutts, president of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts, a long-term bull on Russia but skeptical about Yandex. ""There was clearly a kneejerk reaction to the idea it could help the regulatory environment, but I suspect there's no real benefit."" WAITING FOR INVESTIGATIONS The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) is also investigating Google's competitive practices in Russia after Yandex asked for such a probe.The EU probe ""supports allegations that Google abuses its dominant position on the mobile market by suppressing competition,"" Yandex told Reuters Monday via email, noting the EU requested evidence about Google's practices in Russia prior to the probe's announcement. If Google were forced to stop bundling its product suite with phones using the Android operating system, that could open the way for Yandex to expand its mobile market share and ad revenue. That could be far down the road, though, with Google fighting the charges.About 86 percent of Russian smartphones use Android, according to Gazprombank. In the fourth quarter, Yandex's Android market share was 44 percent, down from 49 percent the previous year.In citing that data in its February downgrade of Yandex stock, Gazprombank said the company's ""very limited ability to compete with Google"" would erode its total Russian search market share eroding to 56 percent in 2018.Yandex says its Russian search market share, including mobile, was 59.7 percent in the fourth quarter.The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.65 is higher than Google but well below the triple-digit ratios of some U.S. Internet stocks. To compare with another Russian Internet company, electronic payments service provider Qiwi Plc  , has a ratio of 18.35.""It's difficult for Yandex that the future of the market is in mobile devices,"" said McDonald. ""Yandex faces some challenges, but any volatility just provides the opportunity to buy a good long-term prospect while it's cheap.""

858,"  (Adds video link, share price)By Yasmeen AbutalebNEW YORK, April 22 Google Inc on Wednesday launched a new U.S. wireless service that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low.The service, Google's first entry into the wireless industry, will work only on the company's Nexus 6 phones and be hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile's  networks, Google said in a statement.The service, called Project Fi, will automatically switch between the two networks and more than 1 million open, free Wi-Fi spots, depending on which signal is strongest.The service will cost $20 a month plus $10 per gigabyte of data used. Customers will get money back for unused data. Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of products, said at a Barcelona conference last month the company was preparing to experiment with a mobile network, but that it did not intend to disrupt the wireless industry.The service will be available on only one device and has limited carrier coverage, so it will not make Google a major wireless industry player, said Brian Blau, research director at Gartner.If successful, however, Google's service could pressure wireless providers to further lower prices and better adapt to the rise of tablets and wearable devices, Blau added. Though some carriers, such as T-Mobile and AT&T Inc, allow unused data to roll over, most mobile plans require customers to pay for a set amount of data each month. But Google first has to ""test out features they think are going to differentiate themselves,"" Blau said, such as being able to transition from network connectivity to Wi-Fi.If Google is able to provide those features, ""it's very possible they could become a major wireless player in the future,"" Blau said. Phone numbers will live in the cloud so that consumers can talk and text on any connected tablet, Google said.The company already has a strong presence in the mobile market through its Android operating system, which hosts some of the most popular apps, such as Gmail and Google Maps.Google shares rose 1.27 percent to $549.81 at mid-afternoon.(Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Richard Chang)",2015-04-22,GOOGL,"Wed Apr 22, 2015 | 2:54pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Google rolls out new U.S. wireless service,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-google-wireless-idUSL1N0XJ1V420150422?type=companyNews

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $17.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The rising dollar took a toll on results at Google, which generates about half of its revenue overseas.

Google's ad revenue has been pressured as more consumers access its online services on mobiles devices such as smartphones and tablets, where ad rates are typically lower. In a conference call, Pichette highlighted mobile ads as a key source of revenue growth during the quarter. ""We are experiencing real strength in mobile search,"" he said. The contribution of ad revenue from video platform YouTube ""continues to grow at a strong rate year-over year,"" he added.

Its new record close of 5,056.06 capped a slow, unsteady climb since it touched a 2002 low of 1,114.11, that spanned an economic recession, the rise of biotech and social media and the explosive growth of mobile phones that has helped make Apple Inc  the most valuable company in the United States.     The Nasdaq traded as high as 5,073.091 on Thursday, led by shares of Apple, which has been among the biggest positive influences on the index in recent years. The index's last record close of 5,048.62 was hit on March 10, 2000.     The benchmark S&P 500 index also set an intraday high, but closed shy of a new record.     Rapid growth in biotechnology companies such as Gilead Sciences Inc and social media firms like Facebook Inc , driven by the popularity of mobile computing, also helped lift the Nasdaq to its current levels.     Strategists say there is still room for the Nasdaq to rise.     ""Now that it's making a new high, I don't think it's just going to stop. It has the potential to go up, absent some external event that I can't predict.

863,"  The Nasdaq's alter ego, the PowerShares QQQ fund, has been the go-to exchange-traded fund for individual investors, pension funds, foreign insurers, sovereign wealth funds, and just about anyone else who has ever had the desire to tap technology sector growth for a quick trade or a long hold.The QQQ exchange-traded fund, often called the ""Cubes"" or the ""Qs,"" tracks the Nasdaq 100, the index of the biggest 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq and is a proxy for the much broader Nasdaq Composite Index. It currently has about $40 billion in assets.Here is a look at how it got so big.* Since its 1999 launch with fewer than $15 million in assets, the QQQ has grown 2,645-fold in assets, making it larger now than the entire U.S. ETF industry was then. It is the sixth-largest U.S.-listed ETF in the $2 trillion ETF market.* The fund started as a side project for a handful of Nasdaq employees seeking to bring mom-and-pop investors into the dotcom boom, but it is now widely held by many large long-term investors, including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Japan's Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co Ltd. * QQQ continues to attract day traders with its strong liquidity, ranking seventh among all ETFs for its 60-day average trading volume. Its typical penny bid/ask spread was barely affected last year, when a single Middle Eastern sovereign fund pulled $10 billion out of the fund, according to John Jacobs, founding father of the QQQ and a former Nasdaq executive who retired in January.* The fund tends to turn in more extreme performances on both the upside and the downside than Nasdaq composite, perhaps because it is composed of the influential stocks atop the broader index. Between the composite index's peak on March 10, 2000 and its trough on Oct. 10, 2002, the benchmark index fell 78.4 percent, while the QQQ declined 83.6 percent between its respective peak on March 24, 2000 and trough on Oct.8, 2002. In the long run up since their respective troughs through Thursday,  the Cubes fund has gone up 454.2 percent and the composite index 356.2 percent. * Shorting activity has come down quite a bit over the past few years, with an average daily quantity on loan of 11.1 million shares from the end of 2011 to this year - about a third of the average daily 32.9 million shares on loan during the period from the end of 2009 to 2011.* Invesco PowerShares is now the QQQ's sponsor, a role it took over in 2007 from Nasdaq, which continues to license its Nasdaq-100 index for the fund's use. And while the fund was initially listed on the American Stock Exchange, it later moved to the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2004, at which point its ticker changed to ""QQQQ."" The ticker reverted back to ""QQQ"" in 2011 after a change in symbology practices, allowing Nasdaq to have tickers with fewer than four characters. * The QQQ has become less of a tech fund and more of a mainstream large-cap fund over the years: Today about 40 percent of the ETF is in consumer discretionary, healthcare and consumer staples companies. But it remains top-heavy in tech, with Apple Inc its biggest holding, accounting for 14.5 percent of the fund by itself. Other top holdings are Microsoft Corp and Google Inc.* The fund bigfoots the 14 other Nasdaq-related ETFs, accounting for 77 percent of the $52 billion they all hold together, according to ETF.com data. Even with its net expense ratio set at a low 0.2 percent of assets, it generates some $80 million in fees annually for its trustee the Bank of New York Mellon, Nasdaq and Invesco, which markets the fund and pays ALPS Distributors Inc, a flat fee each year to distribute it.For a graphic of the Nasdaq Composite Index reaching its peak, please see: link.reuters.com/byg24w (Reporting by Ashley Lau in New York; Editing by Linda Stern, David Gregorio and Nick Zieminski)",2015-04-23,GOOGL,"Thu Apr 23, 2015 | 5:29pm EDT",Factbox: Nasdaq's 'Cubes' ETF reaps Nasdaq's big run,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nasdaq-record-qqq-factbox-idUSKBN0NE2NQ20150423?type=companyNews

865,"   By Ludwig Burger | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT If customers of Germany's Harting Group, a maker of industrial plugs and sockets, want bespoke products, they can buy them -- if they're prepared to assemble them from a kit themselves. Volker Franke, the head of Harting's assembly systems and machine tools business, is working hard to change that. His team is developing an automated production line that takes orders online and makes plugs to a customer's individual specification.Harting is one of a growing number of German firms investing in software, fearing their excellence in mechanical precision and reliability -- the trademarks of ""Made in Germany"" valued by factory owners around the world -- will not be enough to guarantee them success for much longer.As computerized technology becomes an ever greater part of industrial processes, Internet companies are starting to eclipse low-cost Chinese manufacturers as German engineers' main worry.With the likes of Google investing heavily in robotics and automated driving, the fear is engineers will be relegated to selling generic hardware, while software firms make it rich with the technology that makes the machinery smart.""Right now there are makers of factory equipment and those who buy, operate and look after it. Who guarantees that it stays that way?"" asked Franke during a Reuters visit to Harting's headquarters in Espelkamp, northwest Germany. ""It could be that somebody will squeeze their way between the two, telling the equipment user he won't have to bother about what type of machines to use any more. This service provider will be from the digital world,"" he said.Companies that can master vast amounts of data such as Google, SAP, Amazon, EMC Corp's cloud-computing division Pivotal and Teradata Corp could all open up the breach, industry analysts believe. Advisory firms such as IBM and Cap Gemini and software makers such as Oracle and Microsoft could also be winners from an industrial Internet revolution, potentially to the detriment of engineers. ""Companies that provide database and analytical tools -- such as IT companies or system integrators -- could gather technical parameters in mechanical engineering regardless of the brand of the machine,"" said Michael Ruessmann, a partner at The Boston Consulting Group with a focus on information technology. INDUSTRIE 4.0 The stakes are particularly high for Germany. Europe's biggest economy depends on manufacturing for a larger share of gross domestic product than any of its western European neighbors or the United States, with tens of thousands of family-owned businesses -- the so-called Mittelstand -- the bedrock of its export-driven success. The German government is alive to the danger. In 2013, it launched its ""Industrie 4.0"" initiative, backed by the top lobby groups in engineering, electronics and high-tech, to address issues such as worker skills, data transfer standards and data security.But so far it is larger firms leading the move to adapt, with 70 percent of German industry executives in a study commissioned by consultancy CSC saying they were not sufficiently informed about potential new business models.These involve, for example, developing algorithms for how best to run a production process and packaging them into universal factory services that feed on sensor-generated data such as vibration, temperature or power consumption. ""I'm deeply concerned that there is still not enough awareness (in Germany) for the growing interconnectedness and the changes that result from it,"" said Volkmar Denner, chief executive at Robert Bosch GmbH, one of the world's largest automotive parts makers and a major player in factory equipment.German industrial gases firm Linde, which plans to hook up oxygen tanks to the Internet so they will trigger a replacement before they run empty, said big companies could show the way.

867,"   By Abhirup Roy and Tenzin Pema | April 23  April 23 It's 10 years to the day since the first clip (""Me at the Zoo"") was uploaded on YouTube, and the service - now owned by Google Inc - has dominated online video-sharing ever since.But for how long?Facebook Inc said on Wednesday that its users were watching 4 billion videos a day, compared with 3 billion in January and just 1 billion in September.That was enough for at least nine brokerages to raise their price targets on Facebook's stock on Thursday despite the company's slowest quarterly revenue growth in two years.Almost all analysts saw video advertising as one of Facebook's most promising areas for revenue growth.""The Internet is experiencing something of an inflection point in terms of demand for video and mobile advertising, and FB may well be the single biggest beneficiary of this inflection,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.Mahaney raised his price target on Facebook's stock by $17, to $105 from $88.Facebook shares were down about 1 percent at $83.92 in early trading on Thursday. Google does not disclose viewership or revenue numbers for YouTube, although the company said in January 2012 that it had reached 4 billion daily views. (reut.rs/1Fgt24e)That was almost seven years after YouTube's co-founder, Jawed Karim, posted the video of his visit to the zoo on the fledgling site. (bit.ly/1bS1ZIS)Brokerage Cowen & Co estimates that YouTube's daily views will reach 7.9 billion by the end of the year, generating $5.9 billion in revenue. The brokerage expects Facebook's revenue from video advertising to reach about $1 billion this year.Facebook launched auto-play video ads in March 2014. ""FB's video consumption growth remains explosive as it evolves into a premier digital/mobile video platform,"" Cowen analysts wrote in a client note, raising their target price on Facebook's stock to $94 from $91.Mobile ads accounted for 73 percent of Facebook's total ad revenue in the first quarter, up from 59 percent a year earlier.""Looking ahead, we believe video will play a significant role in bringing more marketers to mobile,"" Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said on a call with analysts on Wednesday.""More than 75 percent of global video views on Facebook occur on mobile, and we believe mobile video will become more important to marketers over time,"" she said. Facebook's net income attributable to stockholders fell 20 percent to $509 million in the three months ended March 31, while revenue rose 42 percent to $3.54 billion.Adjusted earnings were better than the market expected but revenue missed.Revenue from advertising rose 46 percent to $3.32 billion.""... While ad revenue growth has been robust, the company appears to only be in the early innings of fully monetizing video advertisements,"" Barclays Capital analysts said.Analysts also saw plenty of opportunity to build a revenue stream from messaging service WhatsApp, photo-sharing service Instagram and virtual reality headset maker Oculus Rift. Facebook is investing heavily in all these products.""Core Facebook continues to power results, and the well known catalysts remain on the horizon and a source of potential upside with Instagram ramping in 2016, WhatsApp in 2017, and Oculus in 2018,"" Piper Jaffray analysts wrote.Up to Wednesday's close, Facebook's shares had risen by a third in the past year.

872,"  (Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets)* Core capital goods orders fall 0.5 percent in March* Core capital goods shipments slip 0.4 percent* Durable goods orders jump 4.0 percent on transportationBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, April 24 U.S. business investment spending plans fell for a seventh straight month in March, weighed down by a strong dollar and lower energy prices, suggesting the economy was struggling to rebound from a recent soft patch.The report from the Commerce Department on Friday came on the heels of lukewarm data on retail sales, employment and housing starts that have hinted at insufficient growth momentum that could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later this year.""This is consistent with a sluggish rebound in growth. It's shedding more doubt on the Fed's willingness to raise rates mid-year,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February, which was the biggest decline since July 2013.The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1.1 percent in February. Economists had forecast these orders gaining 0.3 percent last month. The weakness mirrors other manufacturing indicators such as industrial production and various regional factory surveys.The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the report, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher as investors were cheered by strong results from Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Microsoft Corp.The Fed has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008, but a number of officials have said an increase will likely be considered at its June policy-setting meeting.MANUFACTURING STRUGGLING  Manufacturing has been undermined by the buoyant dollar, whose 12.1 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co.The world's largest household products maker on Thursday reported a 8.3 percent decline in quarterly sales.In addition, lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production, reducing demand for equipment by oil-field companies, including Schlumberger and Halliburton .Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, has cut its capital expenditure plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion. Halliburton slashed its capex by about 15 percent to $2.8 billion.""Cheap oil and a strong dollar, while beneficial to consumers, are putting serious pressure on manufacturers,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. The dollar and reduced capex spending by oil-field firms combined with a harsh winter and softer global demand to slow U.S. growth at the start of the year.In March, shipments of core capital goods - which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement - fell 0.4 percent after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in February.Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. As a result, JPMorgan lowered its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.6 percent annual pace.Barclays trimmed its forecast to a 1.1 percent rate from a 1.2 percent pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday.Pointing to prolonged weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, unfilled orders for core capital goods fell for a second straight month in March after barely rising in January.""We have not seen the full ramifications of the strong dollar and the drop in oil-related investment, so that could continue to play out,"" said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ""The focus is now on services and consumers in the hope that they are going to pick up the tab. So far we are not seeing signs of that.""A surge in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which rebounded 4.0 percent last month. That was the largest increase since July last year and followed a 1.4 percent decline in February.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-04-24,GOOGL,"Fri Apr 24, 2015 | 12:25pm EDT",WRAPUP 2-Weak U.S. business spending data hints at sluggish growth rebound,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XL0OC20150424?type=companyNews

882,"   By Foo Yun Chee and Eric Auchard | BRUSSELS/BERLIN  BRUSSELS/BERLIN The European Union's decision to take on Google last week stems from official complaints by 19 companies in Europe and the United States, including Microsoft and a number of small firms, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.The list of complainants in the European Commission's charge sheet, which includes companies not directly involved in the charges around Google's shopping service, would make it easier for the regulator to expand the case beyond its preliminary focus on price-comparison shopping sites.     Being an official party to the case gives the companies an insider track on the regulatory proceedings as they will be able to get a copy of the detailed EU charge sheet and argue their case at a hearing of competition experts should Google ask for one.While around 30 firms have since gone public with their complaints, to date no one other than the EU enforcer and Google knows exactly which parties have been included as official complainants on the charge sheet.According to one of the sources, those parties include French legal search engine eJustice (including 1plusV which runs the Ejustice.fr legal website and search engine), British price comparison site Foundem, a German association of business listings VfT, and German magazine and newspaper publishers VDZ and BDZV.The list also includes online mapping providers Euro-Cities, Hot-map and Streetmap, Italian news aggregator nnpt.it, Dutch soccer site Elfvoetbal, Microsoft, French price comparison site Twenga and U.S. consumer reviews website Yelp.      Online travel sites Expedia, Odigeo, TripAdvisor, U.S. comparison shopping website Nextag (including its German unit Guenstiger) and German publisher Axel Springer's price comparison fashion site Visual-Meta are also in the list.Lobbying group ICOMP and an anonymous complainant complete the official list. In addition British price comparison site Moneysupermarket.Com is recorded as an interested third party.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment, reiterating that it was the regulator's policy not to disclose  the names of complainants in antitrust investigations. Google did not respond to an email for comment. The EU antitrust enforcer last week accused the world's most popular search engine of cheating consumers and competitors by distorting web search results to favor its own shopping service in a move which could change the rules for online business.BDZV and VDZ have a strong case with possibly the broadest complaint against Google's actions in two areas, said Thomas Hoppner at law firm Olswang who is advising the two associations.""We would certainly like to be at the oral hearing to express our views. Being an official complainant will ensure that we may comment on the statement of objections and, more importantly, any points Google may raise in its defense."" Yelp said that U.S. rivals have been a driving force behind the EU action.""It's been clear from our meetings that U.S.-based companies have helped lead the charge by providing substantive evidence of Google's harm to consumers,"" said Luther Lowe, Yelp's public policy director.Yelp, Expedia, Foundem, ICOMP, Hot-Map, Euro-Cities and 1plusV confirmed that they are official complainants but did not know if they were named in the EU document. Other companies did not reply to requests for comment.

884,"   By Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.The move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.Microsoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.Getting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap. ""Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,"" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. ""They’ve opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls."" Speaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Executive Vice President Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem. The apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.

886,"   By Agnieszka Flak  and Bernie Woodall | MILAN/DETROIT  MILAN/DETROIT Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne on Wednesday made a plea for shrinking the number of players in the global auto industry as the company reported lower-than-expected first quarter results and outlined new plans to boost North American profit margins.Marchionne delivered a detailed presentation during a 2-1/2-hour call with analysts to argue that ""largescale integrations are required"" in the auto industry to sustain the heavy capital investments needed to meet demands for cleaner, safer vehicles.""The capital consumption of this industry is unsustainable,"" he said.   Marchionne’s campaign for automakers to combine comes as the industry’s global rivals face mounting costs to engineer vehicles that emit little or no carbon dioxide, and can avoid collisions using complex robotic driving systems. Analysts say Fiat Chrysler, the seventh-largest of the global car makers, doesn’t have the financial heft to compete long-term with larger rivals such as Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), General Motors Co (GM.N) or Ford Motor Co (F.N). But Marchionne conceded in answer to questions that there are barriers to combining big auto companies, including unions and political leaders that view car makers as national economic champions.Marchionne alluded to the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking Glass"" who bemoans that ""it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.""If traditional automakers ignore his call, Marchionne said ""it's possible"" he would discuss a deal with Silicon Valley companies, including Google Inc (GOOGL.O) or Apple Inc(AAPL.O), that are looking at ways to offer alternatives to traditional cars or car ownership. Analysts have speculated Google or Apple could turn to an existing automaker or supplier to assemble vehicles as a contractor.  ""I have always been intrigued by the notion of having technology disruptors in the marketplace to change the paradigm,"" Marchionne said. PAST CALLS  Marchionne has called for industry consolidation in the past, and he didn't outline specific ways in which Fiat Chrysler could participate in shrinking the number of competing global automakers. Marchionne got into a heated exchange with Bernstein analyst Max Warburton, who asked whether part of the problem is that Marchionne, as head of the former Fiat S.p.A, saved the former Chrysler Group LLC from going out of business during the financial crisis. ""It's incredibly naive to assume the extinction of Chrysler would have changed the behavior"" of the remaining competitors, Marchionne said.So far there has been no sign of interest from Marchionne's major rivals.  FCA's latest results illustrated Marchionne's problem. The company lost money in Latin America, which accounted for nearly a third of FCA's overall profits three years ago.  Fiat Chrysler boosted North American profits by 60 percent in the quarter. But the company's 5 percent operating margins for the first quarter lagged behind rivals General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, which reported margins of 8.8 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively. Ford has targeted North American margins of 8.5 to 9.5 percent for the year.FCA said Wednesday it is launching a push to increase North American margins to GM and Ford's levels by 2018, starting with moves this year to increase margins to 5.5 to 6 percent by the end of the year. The automaker said it expected higher sales volumes would add 1 percentage point to its North American margins, and higher prices at the consumer and wholesale level would add another percentage point. However, Fiat Chrysler's rivals have a vote in whether the company's Ram, Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands can make price increases stick.

896,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT Google Inc will begin testing self-driving cars of its own design on public roads this summer, but they will have steering wheels and brakes, which is not what the company described a year ago.Engineers will operate 25 prototype vehicles, which use the same software as Google's self-driving Lexus RX450h sport utility vehicles that have been in operation for several years, the company said on Friday.    When the Internet search company announced a year ago that it planned to build a fleet of self-driving cars, project director Chris Urmson said the prototypes ""won't have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal or brake pedal ... because they don't need them.""It turns out, however, that the prototypes will need those critical control devices after all because California requires that self-driving vehicles have manual controls during testing.Built in Detroit by auto supplier Roush Industries, the prototypes will be equipped with removable steering wheels, brake pedals and accelerator pedals so test engineers can ""take over driving if needed,"" Urmson said in a blog post on Friday. Google describes the pod-like prototype, which seats two people, as ""the world's first fully self-driving vehicle.""The company also said it would test new passenger and pedestrian protection technologies, including a foam front end and a flexible windshield. It also said the speed of the prototypes will be limited to 25 mph (40 kph) to ""decrease the likelihood of severe injury"" in a collision.As part of the rollout of the self-driving prototypes, Google said its engineers plan to test for ""rare and weird situations""  - what self-driving car proponents refer to as ""edge cases,"" or unusual situations that occur once every 100,000 miles or so. Such testing, Google said, will ""help us validate that our software handles even the rarest variations on common driving scenarios.""On Monday, Google disclosed that its self-driving Lexus vehicles had been involved in 11 accidents on public roads near its Mountain View, California, headquarters. ""Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,"" Urmson said in the blog post. No one was injured in the accidents, he added. The cars had been hit from behind seven times, mainly at traffic lights, with a majority of the accidents being on city streets rather than on freeways.Google said its self-driving cars have been logging about 10,000 miles a week and have accumulated nearly 1 million miles.Google shares were down 3.6 percent at $545.60 on Friday afternoon.

905,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc should not have to remove an anti-Islamic film from its YouTube website because a woman complained that she was duped into performing in the film that depicted the Prophet Mohammed as a pedophile, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday. In a case widely followed for its potential impact on the entertainment industry, an 11-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said an injunction prohibiting Google from broadcasting the film should be lifted.A three-judge panel had ordered Google to remove the controversial film ""Innocence of Muslims."" Billed as a trailer, it triggered anti-American sentiment among Muslims in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere in 2012. For many Muslims, any depiction of the prophet is considered blasphemous.Protests over the film coincided with an attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi that left four Americans dead, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. The court said in its ruling that, ""The film, featuring a crude production, depicts the Prophet Mohammed as, among other things, a murderer, pedophile, and homosexual."" The plaintiff, actress Cindy Lee Garcia, objected to the film after learning it incorporated a clip she made for a different movie. According to the ruling, ""Film producers dubbed over Garcia's lines and replaced them with a voice asking, 'Is your Mohammed a child molester?'""The case raised questions about whether actors may, in certain circumstances, have an independent copyright on their individual performances. The 9th Circuit said Garcia's argument ""would enable any contributor from a costume designer to an extra to claim copyright in random bits and pieces"" of a movie. Garcia said she had received death threats due to the film, and while the court sympathized with her position it found that her copyright claims were weak. ""In this case, a heartfelt plea for personal protection isjuxtaposed with the limits of copyright law and fundamentalprinciples of free speech,"" the court wrote.  Garcia's attorney, M. Cris Armenta, said in an emailed statement, ""The decision short changes the threats on the life of Cindy Lee Garcia who did not voluntarily participate in the hateful message that the controversial trailer about the Prophet Mohammed espoused around the world.""Armenta said it was ""unlikely"" Garcia would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Google said it had ""long believed that the previous ruling was a misapplication of copyright law.""Twitter, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others had urged the 9th Circuit to side with Google. Twitter argued that copyright law does not require service providers to monitor for all possible infringements. The ACLU said the case involved the public's right to access and view a video central to a political debate.

907,"  * No need to change capital alliance with Renault - Nissan's Ghosn* ""Too soon"" to consider partnership with non-automakers like Google* Nissan has set aside enough funds to cover Takata-linked recalls -Ghosn   (Adds more Ghosn quotes, context)By Maki ShirakiYOKOHAMA, Japan, May 18 Nissan Motor Co Ltd  CEO Carlos Ghosn said on Monday there was no need to change the automaker's capital alliance with Renault, after France raised its stake and voting rights in Renault last month.The French government, which owns almost 20 percent of Renault, has said it wants to safeguard French interests at the automaker, which is deepening its ties with Nissan. However, Renault has warned that the government's move could damage the alliance. Ghosn, speaking to reporters in Japan, said the capital alliance between Nissan and Renault had ""zero influence"" on the automakers' daily operations.Since Renault rescued Nissan from bankruptcy in 1999, the Japanese carmaker has outgrown its parent to account for two-thirds of their combined 8 million vehicle sales and a bigger share of profit. ""We continue to work today exactly the way we were working from the beginning, with the two teams working together, developing synergies,"" Ghosn said. ""So there's no reason for us to change.""Asked about potential partnerships with other automakers, Ghosn said the Renault-Nissan alliance had no immediate plans for any more partnerships for now.He also said it was ""too early"" to consider tie-ups with non-automakers such as Google Inc which is trying to enter the auto market. Renault-Nissan already has partnerships with Daimler AG  and Avtovaz.Nissan's rivals Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp this month launched a long-term partnership amid a push by automakers worldwide to cut costs by building scale.Last week, Nissan also expanded a recall linked to Takata Corp's faulty air bags, and Ghosn said the automaker had allocated sufficient funds to cover the recall.He declined to specify how much the automaker had put aside to cover the cost of Takata-related recalls. Some 36 million cars have been recalled worldwide since 2008 over Takata air bag inflators, which can erupt with too much force, spraying shrapnel inside the car.

This marks the firm's most significant push into a sector that has lured heavyweights from Google Inc to Intel Corp and IBM into pushing their own standards and communication protocols.Huawei executives touted Agile architecture as a free and open standard that would allow hardware designers to easily make connectable devices. Aside from its operating system, Huawei also showed off fully customisable wireless equipment that could be installed in business settings. ""Standardizing infrastructure will foster the development of Internet applications, including 'IoT' applications,"" said Huawei's chief strategy and marketing officer William Xu. Huawei's latest expansion comes at a time when consumer-oriented firms such as Xiaomi Inc and Apple Inc , anticipating an explosion of Internet-connected home appliances and consumer devices, have sought to build ecosystems around their popular handsets.

910,"   By Maria Tsvetkova and Eric Auchard | MOSCOW/FRANKFURT  MOSCOW/FRANKFURT Russia's media watchdog has written to Google, Twitter and Facebook warning them against violating Russian Internet laws and a spokesman said on Thursday they risk being blocked if they do not comply with the rules. Roskomnadzor said it had sent letters this week to the three U.S.-based Internet firms asking them to comply with Internet laws which critics of President Vladimir Putin have decried as censorship.     ""In our letters we regularly remind (companies) of the consequences of violating the legislation,"" said Roskomnadzor spokesman Vadim Ampelonsky.     He added that, because of the encryption technology used by the three firms, Russia had no way of blocking specific websites and so could only bring down particular content it deemed in violation of law by blocking access to their whole services.To comply with the law, the three firms must hand over data on Russian bloggers with more than 3,000 readers per day, and take down websites that Roskomnadzor sees as containing calls for ""unsanctioned protests and unrest"", Ampelonsky said.    Putin, a former KGB spy, once described the Internet as a project of the CIA, highlighting deep distrust between Moscow and Washington, whose ties are now badly strained.     He promised late last year not to put the Internet under full government control, but Kremlin critics see the Internet laws as part of a crackdown on freedom of speech since Putin returned to the Kremlin for a third term in 2012.    A law passed last year gives Russian prosecutors the right to block without a court decision websites with information about protests that have not been sanctioned by authorities. Under other legislation, bloggers with large followings must go through an official registration procedure and have their identities confirmed by a government agency.      Facebook says it responds to government data requests about its users that comply with company policies and local laws and meet international standards of legal process.     A company website that publishes statistics on how Facebook handles data requests shows it rejected both of two Russian government requests for information on its users last year. In contrast, it produced some data in response to nearly 80 percent of over 14,000 requests made by U.S. courts, police and government agencies in the second six months of 2014.Twitter had a similar response rate in the United States but rejected 108 Russian government requests in the second half of last year, according to data on the company's government Transparency Report site.      In its semi-annual Transparency Report, Google said it provided some information on users in response to 5 percent of 134 Russian government requests made in the second half of 2014 -- again far less than in the United States. The company says it complies with requests that follow accepted legal procedures and Google policies.    ""We realize they are registered under U.S. jurisdiction.

912,"  May 23 As part of his quest for a mega merger, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne sent an email to General Motors Co Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra in March suggesting combining the automakers but was rebuffed, the New York Times reported on Saturday.Quoting two people with knowledge of the email, the Times said it detailed how global carmakers needed to consolidate to save money and suggested a merged GM and Fiat Chrysler would cut billions of dollars in costs and create an automotive giant.Reuters first reported on April 13 that Marchionne, who leads the world's seventh-largest carmaker, was contemplating a super merger, possibly in the United States, to plug his company's weaknesses and cement his legacy before stepping down in early 2019.The New York Times said the idea of a merger did not interest Barra or any other G.M. executives. ""Instead, Mr. Marchionne's request for a meeting on the subject was flatly turned down,"" the Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.At the end of April, Marchionne publicly made a plea for shrinking the number of players in the global auto industry as his company reported lower-than-expected first-quarter results. Barra said on May 4 she had not held talks with Marchionne and that GM would continue to follow its own plan regarding investing in product development.During his presentation on April 29, Marchionne said that if traditional automakers ignored his call, he might discuss a deal with Silicon Valley companies, including Google Inc or Apple Inc, that are looking at ways to offer alternatives to traditional cars or car ownership. Marchionne said on May 9 while in Canada that he had met with the heads of Tesla Motors Inc and Apple Inc during a recent trip to California but declined to elaborate.Analysts have speculated Google or Apple could turn to an existing automaker or supplier to assemble vehicles as a contractor.Fiat Chrysler has one of the highest debt levels in the industry and barely breaks even in Europe. Analysts say it is expected to burn cash for years to revamp its neglected Alfa Romeo brand, and may struggle to find a partner.

Oracle won a federal appeals court ruling last year that allows it to copyright parts of Java, while Google argues it should be free to use Java without paying a licensing fee.Google, which used Java to design its Android smartphone operating system, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

917,"  LONDON May 26 Boston-based PureTech Health plans to raise $160 million in a London listing, filling its coffers to fund product development and delivering a vote of confidence in the British life sciences sector.The move by the U.S. health technology firm follows a similar decision by California-based drug discovery group Verseon to raise $100 million in London earlier this month.PureTech's high-profile board includes former Sanofi  chief executive Chris Viehbacher, Pearson's  one-time CEO Marjorie Scardino and John LaMattina, a past research head at Pfizer.The planned initial public offering (IPO) on the main market of the London Stock Exchange is expected to happen in June, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. The group specialises in building a portfolio of early-stage science and technology in the healthcare sector, typically from academia, and nurturing these ideas into commercially viable businesses.The focus is particularly on the convergence of new technologies in the healthcare space. Many traditional tech companies, such as Google and Apple, are now investing in health, leading to new opportunities for merging different approaches to treating patients. ""With the acceleration of scientific discovery and the convergence of new and disruptive technologies being applied to life sciences, we believe the healthcare industry is on the cusp of a major transformation,"" said CEO Daphne Zohar. PureTech currently has 12 operating companies which are actively developing technologies.The proceeds of the London fundraising will help PureTech take its most advanced product candidates to the revenue-generating stage.PureTech, which seeks to maintain high ownership in its operating companies and currently has a 76 percent average shareholding in its businesses, has already raised $250 million in past private fundraisings.

International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said there was still a lot of work to do before Greece and its international lenders could clinch a cash-for-reforms deal.Greece's government said it aims to reach an agreement with lenders by Sunday. A euro zone official said Greece will not be able to get the money still available under its current bailout plan if it does not agree to the outline of a such a deal by the end of the week.""Everybody is coming out with a different story. I'm looking for an EU-endorsed comment rather than something coming from Greece to be sort of the final arbiter on what the sentiment really is with regard to a resolution,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $67 billion in assets.

Google showed off the GoPro system at its developer conference in San Francisco. It did not say when the system will go on sale.Google also announced a new Photos app that helps users store and organize their images. Set to be released on Thursday, the app will let users back up and store unlimited photos and videos for free, said Anil Sabharwal, Google's director of product management. The app also makes it easy for users to post their photos through social media and messaging services such as Twitter and WhatsApp.""We firmly believe you should be able to share photos and videos any way you want,"" Sabharwal said.

921,"   By Tim Hepher | PARIS  PARIS May 29 Airbus Group announced the creation of a $150 million venture capital fund and said it had hired a Google executive to run a new centre in Silicon Valley as it seeks to wave a digital wand over its heavy-manufacturing culture.The planemaker said on Friday that Airbus Group Ventures would invest in ""disruptive and innovative"" technologies worldwide. It will be headed by Tim Dombrowski, 54, formerly a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.The European group also said it had recruited Google executive and former U.S. aeronautics researcher Paul Eremenko, 35, to run an innovation centre in Silicon Valley.Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders announced the centre's creation on Wednesday, saying it would provide promising avenues for technology it might otherwise miss. It is the latest evidence of efforts by planemakers to woo technologists as potential partners and comes weeks after Enders took the company's top management team to California to see what lessons could be learned from the digital revolution.Enders was quoted as saying after a previous visit to Silicon Valley last year that the aerospace industry must work more closely with high-tech companies - some of which, like Google, are encroaching on its turf through drone projects. Boeing's Chief Executive Jim McNerney said last year it wanted it to be more like Apple in the way it innovates, rather than doing a ""moonshot"" development every 25 years.Both planemakers have talked of the need to introduce improvements more quickly, without waiting for all-new plane developments that take years and cost around $15 billion. Though the highly safety-regulated and capital-intensive aerospace industry will always be conservative about the major bets that drive plane developments, Enders wants Airbus to learn to act ""more quickly and with more courage"", an aide said.Aerospace companies say they are increasingly thinking about software rather than hardware throughout their businesses.Although next month will still see hundreds of jet orders at the Paris Airshow, the focus of competition between Airbus and Boeing is shifting quickly towards the way they build planes now that each has almost a decade's worth of orders to fulfil.On Thursday, Airbus presented to journalists its plans for a futuristic factory in which humans, robots and cobots - or collaborative robots - interact to make planes more smoothly and cheaply, but acknowledged it would not happen overnight.

Google on Thursday previewed its new Android software for smartphones, tablets, watches and TVs at its annual developer conference in San Francisco. The new OS will be released later this year.Fingerprint said it had provided prototype devices, based on its FPC1020 and FPC1025 touch sensors, supporting Google in developing and integrating the capability into Android M. ""It's a big step for the industry as there will be  standardized support in phones for fingerprint sensors,"" Fingerprint Chief Executive Jorgen Lantto said. Such sensors could allow a phone user to avoid having to input a passcode while also increasing security as phones are increasingly used in retail and financial transactions.Lantto said Android M will mainly boost the market for fingerprint sensors in 2016 but could give some positive impact earlier. ""This will not impact the market in the second quarter, but might give impact in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but mainly in 2016 the market will become bigger,"" Lantto said.He repeated Fingerprint's forecast of revenue exceeding 1.5 billion Swedish crowns ($177 million) in 2015.

929,"  BERLIN, June 1 German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Monday he was worried the market power of firms like Google was hurting competition on the Internet.Gabriel, who is also economy minister, has repeatedly voiced concern about the dominance of U.S. software companies and last year suggested firms like Google should be broken up if they  abuse dominant market positions.""How can it be that in order to have Google's (mobile operating system) Android you need to pre-install Google Search, Google Browser, Google Mail, Google You-Tube and its app store on the device?"" Gabriel said at an event in Berlin. He welcomed a decision by the European Commission in April to launch an antitrust investigation into Google's Android system over concerns anticompetitive constraints imposed by the company were hampering markets.Gabriel said agreements needed to be reviewed to ensure that customers were not being barred from using competing browsers and web services and locked into ""Google Internet"". Market power should not just refer to individual services but should also be assessed according to the value chain on the Internet, he added. In Germany, fears of digital domination by firms like Google are linked with wider concerns of U.S. cyber espionage since the revelations in 2013 of mass U.S. surveillance on German citizens.A report published on Monday by the Monopolies Commission, which advises the government, advised against the need for special regulation regarding the provision of Internet search and instead recommended adjusting existing competition law.

935,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS, June 2  BRUSSELS, June 2 U.S. tech firm Disconnect has filed a complaint to EU antitrust regulators against Google's  ban on its privacy app, accusing the Silicon Valley giant of abusing its dominant market position.Disconnect, set up four years ago by former Google engineers, says its app protects users of the Android operating system from invisible tracking and malware distributed through advertisements.It said Google had abused its position by blocking the app from the Google Play store last year, and had gained an unfair advantage over competitors by integrating its own privacy and security services into its own products. ""They said we interfered with the ability of third parties to serve ads. Google was not willing to engage in a dialogue,"" Disconnect Chief Executive Casey Oppenheim told Reuters on Tuesday. Google said Disconnect's complaint was groundless.""Our Google Play policies have long prohibited apps that interfere with other apps - such as altering their functionality, or removing their way of making money. We apply this policy uniformly and Android developers strongly support it,"" spokesman Al Verney said. The European Commission, which opened a probe into Google's agreements with smartphone and tablet makers using its Android operating system in April, confirmed it had received the complaint on Tuesday and said it would assess it.The EU competition authority's Android investigation is one of two into Google's business practices. The other, more advanced, inquiry focuses on whether the company distorts web search results to favour its own shopping service.

942,"  BEIJING, June 2 Lenovo Group Ltd has replaced the head of its smartphone unit, a critical business division that has seen its China sales tumble as Apple Inc  and other high-end phone makers win over customers with sleeker product offerings.Liu Jun, one of four executive vice presidents under CEO Yang Yuanqing and a company veteran of 22 years, will be replaced by Chen Xudong, the head of ShenQi, a sub-division that sells mobile devices, the company said in a statement.Chen, 47, takes the reins of the division at a critical time. He must integrate the Motorola unit acquired from Google Inc for $2.9 billion six months ago, while trying to counter a damaging slump in phone shipments.Lenovo, the fifth largest player in the Chinese market, shipped 22 percent fewer phones in the first quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. In stark contrast, Apple's first-quarter China shipments jumped 62 percent, while Xiaomi and Huawei had  gains of 42 percent and 40 percent respectively. Lenovo did not offer a reason for Liu leaving the post but said he would continue for an unspecified period as a special consultant to Yang.Yang told reporters last week at Lenovo's Beijing conference that China's smartphone market was really competitive, becoming more saturated and had a growth rate that was moderating or even declining. He added that the company wanted to ""play a different game"" from domestic rivals who compete on low prices and have razor-thin margins.Liu, who previously headed Lenovo's China operations and founded its mobile division four years ago, said in a Weibo post he was proud to have taken Lenovo to the world No 3 spot in combined smartphone and tablet sales and had ""no regrets and boundless gratitude.""

947,"   By Sharon Begley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon.com Inc is in a race against Google Inc to store data on human DNA, seeking both bragging rights in helping scientists make new medical discoveries and market share in a business that may be worth $1 billion a year by 2018.Academic institutions and healthcare companies are picking sides between their cloud computing offerings - Google Genomics or Amazon Web Services - spurring the two to one-up each other as they win high-profile genomics business, according to interviews with researchers, industry consultants and analysts.        That growth is being propelled by, among other forces, the push for personalized medicine, which aims to base treatments on a patient's DNA profile. Making that a reality will require enormous quantities of data to reveal how particular genetic profiles respond to different treatments.     Already, universities and drug manufacturers are embarking on projects to sequence the genomes of hundreds of thousands of people. The human genome is the full complement of DNA, or genetic material, a copy of which is found in nearly every cell of the body.    Clients view Google and Amazon as doing a better job storing genomics data than they can do using their own computers, keeping it secure, controlling costs and allowing it to be easily shared.    The cloud companies are going beyond storage to offer analytical functions that let scientists make sense of DNA data. Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines are also competing for a slice of the market. The ""cloud"" refers to data or software that physically resides in a server and is accessible via the internet, which allows users to access it without downloading it to their own computer.     Now an estimated $100 million to $300 million business globally, the cloud genomics market is expected to grow to $1 billion by 2018, said research analyst Daniel Ives of investment bank FBR Capital. By that time, the entire cloud market should have $50 billion to $75 billion in annual revenue, up from about $30 billion now.    ""The cloud is the entire future of this field,"" Craig Venter, who led a private effort to sequence the human genome in the 1990s, said in an interview. His new company, San Diego-based Human Longevity Inc, recently tried to import genomic data from servers at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland.     The transmission was so slow, scientists had to resort to sending disks and thumb drives by FedEx and human messengers, or ""sneakernet,"" he said. The company now uses Amazon Web Services.    So does a collaboration between Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health Systems to sequence 250,000 genomes. Raw DNA data is uploaded to Amazon's cloud, where software from privately-held DNAnexus assembles the millions of chunks into the full, 3-billion-letter long genome.     DNAnexus's algorithms then determine where an individual genome differs from the ""reference"" human genome, the company’s chief scientist Dr. David Shaywitz said, in hopes of identifying new drug targets.     HOSTING FOR FREE     Showing how important Google and Amazon view this business, and how they hope to use existing customers to lure future ones, each is hosting well-known genomics datasets for free.    Neither company discloses the amount of genomics data it holds, but based on interviews with analysts and genomic scientists, as well as the companies' own announcements of what customers they’ve won, Amazon Web Services may be bigger.     Data from the ""1000 Genomes Project,"" an international public-private effort that identified genetic variations found in at least 1 percent of humans, reside at both Amazon and Google ""without charge,"" said Kathy Cravedi of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), one of the project's sponsors.    Other paying clients with a more specific focus are picking sides.     Google, for instance, won a project from the Autism Speaks foundation to collect and analyze the genomes of 10,000 affected children and their parents for clues to the genetic basis of autism. Another customer is Tute Genomics, whose database of 8.5 billion human DNA variants can be searched for how frequently any given variant appears, what traits it's associated with and how people with a certain variant respond to particular drugs.    Amazon is hosting the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation’s project to collect complete-genome sequences and other data from 1,000 patients to identify new drug targets. It also won the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, which has similar aims.    Amazon charges about $4 to $5 a month to store one full human genome, and Google about $3 to $5 a month. The companies also charge for data transfers or computing time, as when scientists run analytical software on stored data.     Amazon's database-analysis tool, Redshift, costs 25 cents an hour or $1,000 per terabyte per year, the company said. A terabyte is 1 trillion bytes, or 1,000 gigabytes, about enough to hold 300 hours of high-quality video.    GENETIC GOLD      Another part of the cloud services' pitch to would-be customers is that their analytic tools can fish out genetic gold - a drug target, say, or a DNA variant that strongly predicts disease risk - from a sea of data. Any discoveries made through such searches belong to the owners of the data.    ""On the local university server it might take months to run a computationally-intense"" analysis, said Alzheimer’s project leader Dr. Gerard Schellenberg of the University of Pennsylvania. ""On Amazon, it's, 'how fast do you need it done?', and they do it.""    Another selling point is security.

950,"  June 6 Google's new mobile phone payment service, Android Pay, will not garner any transaction fees from credit card companies, which may put pressure on competitor Apple to drop or lower its charges, the Wall Street Journal reported.Apple Pay, which launched last year, reached deals with big banks and other credit card issuers to receive 0.15 percent of the value of each credit card transaction, the journal said on Friday. Apple collects a half-cent per purchase on bank debit cards, it said. Google's service will not receive any fees for the transactions, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation. It said Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc have made their ""tokenization"" card-security service free, which prevents payments services from charging fees to issuers. ""There is one agreement with Visa and the banks can have confidence that there are no pass-through fees,"" Visa President Ryan McInerney told the newspaper. The Wall Street Journal said the rules may prompt changes in Apple's mobile phone payment deal with banks. It said some banks are not happy about sharing fees and could try to use Google's arrangement to effect changes in Apple's deals.

956,"  (Corrects to remove reference to Wharton School in 8th paragraph)By Herbert LashNEW YORK, June 8 Auction.com, an online marketplace for property backed by Google Inc and real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, signed a deal with a commercial real estate advisory firm to provide due diligence in a step to enhance its services and help move sales further beyond the local arena.The deal announced Monday with Houston-based Situs coincides with growing national and international interest in commercial real estate that 15 years ago was an entirely local market, the partners in the deal said.Situs will provide Auction.com clients with standardized operating statements, including expense categories and a review of rent calls. The service, which will start in August, comes as the distressed market in which Auction.com began in 2007 resides.""This is a very different market that Auction is going into now and one that's gaining market acceptance just by the sheer transaction volume that they're experiencing,"" said Steve Powel, chief executive officer of Situs, which has evaluated more than $1 trillion in commercial real estate over the past 30 years.Half of Auction.com's sales are now commercial real estate, of which 60 percent to 70 percent are out of state, said Rick Sharga, executive vice president of the Irvine, California-based company. ""The service we're going to provide here is one of the ways that the individual investor gets to play on a more level playing field with the bigger guys,"" Sharga said.Assets to receive due diligence are expected to exceed $5 billion annually, in more than 1,500 deals, the two firms said.Automated programs for commercial real estate already exist, such as those sold by Argus Software Inc, said Jesse Keenan, research director at Columbia University's Center for Urban Real Estate. Argus is unit of Altus Group Ltd. ""What really matters in these small deals is the validity of rent rolls, of abstracting leases and reviewing inspection reports for tenant improvements,"" Keenan said.""The numbers are simple. The real business decisions come from things that just can't be automated,"" he said.Terms of the transaction were not announced, but Powel said it was a standard third-party professional services contract. The deal was facilitated by Stone Point Capital LLC, a private equity fund that acquired Situs in April and has been a significant investor in Auction.com since its beginning. Stone Point is headed by two former senior partners at Goldman Sachs & Co. and has about $13 billion in committed capital.Auction.com typically takes a 5 percent commission, though it can vary, Sharga said. The firm generated more than $7 billion in sales both in 2013 and 2014. The value of deals this year is running ahead of that pace, he said.The firm's shareholders include Starwood Capital Group and Starwood Property Trust Inc - Sternlicht is chairman of both - and funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC.Google Capital, a Google Inc-backed fund, made a $50 million investment in Auction.com last year on the belief it will fundamentally change how real estate, in particular commercial, is transacted.In May, Auction.com partnered with Chinese property portal Juwai.com to reach investors in China. Auction.com's offerings have yet to be posted on Juwai.com, but Sharga said they've already seen interest from Chinese investors.

957,"  BERLIN, June 9 Volkswagen's Audi will take a stringent line on guarding customers' data, the carmaker's chief executive said on Tuesday, in a thinly veiled swipe at new rival Google Inc..The emergence of self-driving and connected cars has made software a key component in future cars, opening the market to new entrants like Google, and shaking up the pecking order between carmakers and their suppliers.Software-driven cars also throw up new questions about who should control data generated by connected cars and drivers, forcing companies to take a clear stance on data privacy.""A car is one's second living room today,"" Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler said on Tuesday at a business event in Berlin attended by Google Chairman Eric Schmidt. ""That's private. The only person who needs access to the data onboard is the customer,"" Stadler said, adding Audi ""takes that seriously.""Information about the location and speed of a car could be attractive to advertisers, insurance and communications companies who could use the data for their own commercial purposes. Germany's auto industry has lobbied regulators to take a restrictive line on data privacy, a step which could make it harder for software and telecom companies to establish a data-driven business case in the auto sector. ""The customer wants to be at the focus, and does not want to be exploited,"" said Stadler.The remarks of the CEO of VW's flagship division echo a similar stance on privacy taken by rival Daimler  which has, like Audi, developed an autonomous car.As part of their own push into software and autonomous cars, Audi, Daimler's Mercedes and BMW, together with private equity firm General Atlantic, are jointly bidding for Nokia's mapping unit HERE, sources told Reuters last month.

958,"   By Euan Rocha | TORONTO  TORONTO BlackBerry (BB.TO) is considering equipping an upcoming smartphone with Google Inc.'s (GOOGL.O) Android software for the first time, an acknowledgement that its revamped line of devices has failed to win mass appeal, according to four sources familiar with the matter.The move would be an about-face for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company, which had shunned Android in a bet that its BlackBerry 10 line of phones would be able to claw back market share lost to Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhone and a slew of devices powered by Android.The sources, who asked not to be named as they have not been authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said the move to use Android is part of BlackBerry's strategy to pivot to focus on software and device management. BlackBerry, which once dominated smartphone sales, now has a market share of less than 1 percent. It is not clear whether a move to use Android would spell the end of the company's BlackBerry 10 line of devices that were initially launched to much fanfare in early 2013. After positive early reviews, the late-to-launch BlackBerry devices haven't competed well with Android or Apple, mainly due to a lack of big name apps.""We don't comment on rumors and speculation, but we remain committed to the BlackBerry 10 operating system, which provides security and productivity benefits that are unmatched,"" said the company in an email.A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen is banking on the company's new device management system, BES12, that allows corporate and government clients to not only manage BlackBerry devices on their internal networks, but also devices powered by Android, Apple's iOS platform and Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Windows operating system.One of the hurdles it faces in that transformation is convincing big customers that its device management software works across many different platforms.  Two sources said that by launching an Android-based device of its own, BlackBerry would be sending a signal to skeptics that it is confident that the BES12 system can not only manage, but also secure smartphones and tablets powered by rival operating systems.BlackBerry will probably use Android on an upcoming slider device that is likely to be released this autumn, two sources said. The slider will combine a touch screen with a physical keyboard that users can use if they prefer.BlackBerry briefly showed off the slider device on stage at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March, but it has provided little detail on it since then. By making an Android device that boasts a large touchscreen and a physical keyboard, BlackBerry hopes to snag a niche in the touchscreen-dominated Android market. The device may attract those still using older BlackBerry keyboard handhelds but who want access to the larger app options Android offers.    HARDWARE CONUNDRUM Two sources said that if BlackBerry moves forward on a plan to launch an Android device, it could come with some of the patented features in its BlackBerry 10 operating system.In March, BlackBerry announced that it planned to deliver its patented security, productivity and communication tools to any mobile device running iOS, Android or Windows.  The company, which a while ago opened its popular BlackBerry Messaging app to those using rival operating systems, has said it plans to offer more in-house features on rival devices, including BlackBerry Hub and the predictive text capabilities of its virtual keyboard.Chen in March said the company was still committed to its own devices business.Since that time however, BlackBerry has cut headcount in its hardware unit even further. The company, which at a 2011 peak employed 17,500 people and in February was down to 6,225, said last month that it was making further cuts on the device side, without providing any numbers.

959,"  (Adds Twitch's comment)June 12 Google Inc said on Friday that it is launching a live streaming gaming service called ""YouTube Gaming"", creating a rival to Amazon.com Inc's Twitch service.The service, to be available in the form of an app as well as a website, will focus exclusively on gamers and gaming.More than 25,000 games will each have their own page on the site, bringing videos and live streams about various titles together in a single space, Google said.Users will be able to add games to their collection for quick access, subscribe to channels, and receive recommendations on new games based on the games and channels they follow. ""When you want something specific, you can search with confidence, knowing that typing ""call"" will show you ""Call of Duty"" and not ""Call Me Maybe,"" Google said in a blog post. (bit.ly/1FYRqD4)Amazon bought Twitch Interactive last year for $970 million, beating a rival bid from Google. ""We welcome new entrants into the growing list of competitors since gaming video is obviously a huge market that others have their eye on,"" said Matthew DiPietro, Twitch's vice president of marketing.Twitch also tweeted a welcome message to its rival, saying, ""@YouTubeGaming Welcome Player 2.

960,"   By Lehar Maan  Some things can't be summed up in 140 characters.Twitter Inc's announcement that Dick Costolo would exit as CEO on July 1 was long on plaudits but offered few clues on how the company will tackle its biggest problem: user growth.Twitter' shares were down 0.6 percent in early afternoon trading on Friday, after rising much as 3.9 percent just after the opening, as investors assessed the company's prospects.Analysts said Twitter has an uncertain future unless it can reverse slowing user growth by introducing new features that will help it win a bigger chunk of the digital advertising market from rivals such as Facebook Inc.Some also wondered whether Twitter, with its 300 million users, could be takeover target.""Prospective buyers have been interested in purchasing Twitter in the past, and during the interim (CEO) search period we believe the opportunity for acquisition is heightened,""  Jefferies analysts wrote in a client note.Twitter's current market value is about $23.5 billion, suggesting a bid would have to be pitched at around $30 billion.Google Inc is often mooted as the most likely suitor. However, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Peck said a deal was unlikely in the near term as that would have been an attractive alternative to a CEO change.For now the main issue for investors is the lack of clarity on the company's prospects, Macquarie Research analysts wrote. ""We believe there limited visibility into TWTR's potential, limited understanding of catalysts to drive fundamental improvements, no expectations of a change in strategy, little reason to think financials will reaccelerate (near term), and limited valuation support,"" the analysts wrote in a client note.""We certainly agree that TWTR has unmet potential and that a new CEO could help, but it is unclear if the company can reach its potential based on its current strategy and trajectory.""Twitter had a 1.6 percent share of the $50.7 billion U.S. digital advertising market in 2014, compared with Facebook's 10.4 percent, according to research firm eMarketer.WHO'S NEXT?  Analysts said the new CEO - co-founder Jack Dorsey will take over on an interim basis - will need to put monetization of the product on the backburner to focus on user growth.""We believe that a replacement CEO may be able to better define Twitter as an event-driven platform, attract larger branded advertisers, and respond more rapidly to changes in themarketplace,"" Brean Capital analyst Sarah Hindlian wrote.Much will depend on who that CEO turns out to be. The new CEO needs to be product expert, said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.""Not a sales background, not a financial background. A product background. That is essential to kind of setting the company up for the next stage of growth,"" Cakmak said.Dorsey, who was ousted as Twitter's chief executive in 2008, is staying on as CEO of mobile payments startup Square Inc for now, but analysts said he could well take the Twitter job on a permanent basis.Other possible candidates, according to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, include former Yahoo Inc CEO Ross Levinsohn; Mike McCue, the CEO of newsreader app company Flipboard; Instagram founder Kevin Systrom; and Evan Williams, CEO of blogging website Medium.Williams, who helped to launch Medium in 2012, is a co-founder of Twitter and a director of the company. Costolo took over from him in October 2010.Several analysts also mentioned Adam Bain, Twitter's head of global revenues and partnerships, as a potential candidate.Costolo took Twitter public in November 2013, and the stock closed at $44.90 on its first day of trading. Up to Thursday's close, it had fallen about 20 percent since then, and it has lost about half its value from its peak in late 2013.

961,"   By Euan Rocha | TORONTO  TORONTO BlackBerry (BB.TO) is considering equipping an upcoming smartphone with Google Inc.'s (GOOGL.O) Android software for the first time, an acknowledgement that its revamped line of devices has failed to win mass appeal, according to four sources familiar with the matter.The move would be an about-face for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company, which had shunned Android in a bet that its BlackBerry 10 line of phones would be able to claw back market share lost to Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhone and a slew of devices powered by Android.The sources, who asked not to be named as they have not been authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said the move to use Android is part of BlackBerry's strategy to pivot to focus on software and device management. BlackBerry, which once dominated smartphone sales, now has a market share of less than 1 percent. It is not clear whether a move to use Android would spell the end of the company's BlackBerry 10 line of devices that were initially launched to much fanfare in early 2013.

962,"  PARIS Google must scrub search results worldwide when it agrees to requests from users to be ""forgotten"", rather than just from European versions of its website, France's data protection regulator said on Friday.The regulator (CNIL) said in a statement that if Google does not comply within 15 days, it can launch a process leading to sanctions, ramping up pressure on the U.S. giant following a  landmark European legal ruling.In May last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that European residents can ask search engines to delete results that turn up under a search for their name when they are out of date, irrelevant or inflammatory - the so-called right to be forgotten.Since then, Google and other search engines such as Microsoft's Bing and Yahoo have begun to grant de-listing requests when they meet certain criteria.But there has been much debate over the implementation, especially of Google's decision only to scrub results from European sites, leading some to appeal to local regulators.The company maintains it should only apply the ruling across its European domains, such as Google.fr in France and Google.de in Germany. But EU data protection watchdogs, many legal experts and former German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, who has advised Google on privacy following the European ruling, think it should be global.Some individuals have taken Google to court to try to force a change.

990,"  * Group of eight investors include Virgin, Airbus, Bharti* Funds to develop key technologies, start services by 2019* OneWeb announces historic rocket launch deal   (Adds Virgin Galactic comments, details)By Aman Shah and Irene KlotzMUMBAI/CAPE CANAVERAL, June 25 Privately owned OneWeb announced what it called the world's largest commercial rocket deal on Thursday after raising $500 million from a group of global investors to support its plans to bring broadband to billions of people via satellite.The fund-raising attracted backing from Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Europe's Airbus Group, which will also build 900 ""micro-satellites"" designed to extend the reach of the Internet to remote corners of the world.OneWeb plans to put a network of 648 small satellites into orbit to provide global broadband and mobile telephone services. The rest of the satellites will be kept on the ground as spares. The company, based in Britain's Channel Islands, plans over 65 launches including 39 from Virgin's spaceflight company, Virgin Galactic, and 21 from Europe's Arianespace using Russian-made Soyuz rockets.It has estimated the cost of the project at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.Other backers in the $500 million funding include Indian billionaire Sunil Mittal's Bharti Enterprises, Qualcomm , Coca-Cola Co, Mexico's Grupo Salinas, Hughes Network Systems, a unit of EchoStar and Intelsat. Virgin Galactic expects to be able to fly two or three of OneWeb's satellites at a time on its small LauncherOne rocket, Chief Executive George Whitesides said.LauncherOne flies on a carrier jet aircraft called WhiteKnightTwo, which serves as a high-altitude launch platform. Terms of the contract were not disclosed. Virgin has said LauncherOne will cost less than $10 million per flight.OneWeb, which plans to start launching satellites from 2017 and aims to start services in 2019, must put its proposed network of low Earth orbit, geosynchronous satellites into space before 2020, or risk losing licences awarded by international radio spectrum regulators. Airbus Space and Defence has formed a joint venture with OneWeb to build a high-volume satellite production factory.OneWeb's goal is to provide affordable broadband Internet services to rural and under-served regions, enabling voice and data communications via user terminals on the ground.Before starting OneWeb, Greg Wyler co-founded satellite venture O3b Networks and briefly worked at Google Inc  on another project to beam Internet access from space.Wyler left Google in 2014 to work on his own satellite project, named WorldVu, which later became OneWeb.Google, along with Fidelity, invested $1 billion earlier this year in another Internet-via-satellite project being developed by California-based SpaceX, which was founded by Tesla Motors Chief Executive Elon Musk.

993,"   By Aman Shah | MUMBAI  MUMBAI Internet delivered globally via satellites came a step closer on Thursday after a group of global investors agreed to put $500 million into OneWeb Ltd, one of the largest corporate venture financings so far this year. OneWeb, whose backers include Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Indian billionaire Sunil Mittal's Bharti Enterprises, said it would use the funds to acquire 65 commercial rockets to launch satellite-borne Internet services to extend the reach of mobile operators to customers in remote corners of the world. Other investors include Airbus Group (AIR.PA), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Mexico's Grupo Salinas, Hughes Network Systems, a unit of EchoStar (SATS.O) and Intelsat (I.N).OneWeb, which plans to start services by 2019, must put its proposed network -- initially expected to number 648 low Earth orbit, geosynchronous satellites -- into space before 2020, or risk losing licences awarded by international radio spectrum regulators.   OneWeb, based in Britain's Channel Islands, plans to pay Virgin's spaceflight company, Virgin Galactic, for 39 launches, and has contracts with Europe's Arianespace to provide 21 Soyuz rockets.  Airbus Space and Defence has formed a joint venture with OneWeb to build a high-volume satellite production factory. The Airbus production partnership said earlier this month it planned to produce 900 satellites for the venture. The goal of the company is to provide affordable broadband Internet services to rural and under-served regions, enabling voice and data communications via user terminals on the ground.Before starting OneWeb, Greg Wyler co-founded satellite venture O3b Networks and briefly worked at Google Inc (GOOGL.O) on another project to beam Internet access from space.

Using satellites to deliver broadband Internet to hard-to-reach users remains a highly speculative undertaking that has been littered with failed investments and bankrupted ventures. The OneWeb project relies on radio frequencies abandoned by an earlier satellite project, Teledesic, which flopped after raising $1 billion from high profile investors such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) founder Bill Gates and Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Similarly, two other big satellite ventures of the 1990s, Iridium and Globalstar, ended in bankruptcy.

994,"  * German utilities see tech players as future competitors* Apple, Google, Tesla already active in energy* E.ON, RWE invest in start-ups in hope to back right horseBy Christoph Steitz and Vera EckertFRANKFURT, June 25 Germany's utilities are preparing for their next battle. While  fighting to turn a profit as energy policy hammers their businesses, energy groups now fear technology companies disrupting what has been seen as a safe if worthy sector.Amazon revolutionised retail, Apple is shaking up the music industry and RWE sees it as only a matter of time before large technology groups start eroding  market share in power, where customers would jump at the opportunity to cut their bills and increase efficiency.New businesses such as renewables, demand management and storage -- all outside the traditional comfort zone of German utilities -- could generate 26 billion euros ($29 billion) in additional profits for the European power sector by 2020, consultancy McKinsey reckons.Most of it will go to new market entrants, while the incumbent utilities will take just 15 percent -- maybe more if they cut costs and re-allocate money to new areas like grids, it said in a report.""We're not that afraid of other energy companies,"" said Thomas Birr, head of strategy at RWE, Germany's second-biggest utility. ""In the future, we'll be competing in a whole different arena, in which technology firms will play a greater role. That's the playground we have to prepare for.""CUSTOMER RELATIONS  Sitting on increasingly worthless fossil fuel-generating plants, Germany's utilities are growing nervous that tech giants will interrupt the prized customer relationships that are one of their last remaining valuable assets.The threat is not yet quantifiable and the exact direction from which it will come is unclear -- as evidenced by the bewildering variety of technology projects from robot software to security cameras at which the utilities are throwing money.What is clear is that the tech giants see huge potential in smart homes that the big utilities have been unable to tap.Google last year bought Nest, a smart thermostat maker, for $3.2 billion, aiming to lead the way on how household devices link to each other and to electricity grids.And the apps that customers will use to control such smart homes will often be installed on smartphones, in which Apple and Google have a combined global user base of over a billion - dwarfing the 56 million customers that receive electricity and gas from RWE and larger rival E.ON. In energy storage, where RWE and E.ON also hope to make a move, electric car maker Tesla has emerged as a formidable foe after it recently unveiled Tesla Energy, storage systems or batteries for homes and companies.More worryingly, Google and Apple have begun to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to fund solar energy projects, mostly in the United States so far, ranging from larger plants to panels for residential homes.This raises concerns that future moves could hit closer to Germany.""For the first time in a 120 years, consumers have a choice about where they go for their power,"" said Alex Laskey, president and founder of U.S.-based Opower, whose flashy billing software tracks how much power is consumed by households, when and at what costs. TECH SPENDING RISES Opower is one of several technology groups E.ON has invested in, hoping it will gain access to technological advancements that may at some point transform the industry.As a result, it has also bought into California-based QBotix, which builds robots that travel on rails through solar parks and adjust panels so that they constantly get most of the sunshine, saving costs by up to a fifth.E.ON declined to say how much it had invested so far in new technology companies, only saying it spends about 100 million euros ($112 million) a year on technology and innovation.RWE said it also spends a low triple-digit million euro amount on innovation and research and development, a fraction of its 2.5-3 billion in estimate capex for 2015. Birr said the focus was now shifting more heavily towards innovation.""You know what they say with disruptive technologies: it takes 10 times longer (to develop) than anticipated but the effect will be 10 times bigger,"" said Susana Quintana Plaza, senior vice president for technology and innovation at E.ON.The utilities won't say how much money they expect to make from new technologies, not least because any business generated from technology is a drop in the ocean compared to the hit to profit from Germany's policy of shutting down nuclear plants and phasing out coal and gas-fired generation.Winning over customers is one thing but doing the same with shareholders is going to be a completely different ball game.""If you ask the German utilities what exactly this business will look like, you don't get any concrete information,"" said Susana Penarrubia, portfolio manager at Deutsche Bank's asset management arm DWS. ""On the other hand, they don't have a choice but to look for growth in this area.""

1001,"  (Adds details on Uber deal)By Bill RigbySEATTLE, June 29 Microsoft Corp said on Monday it will hand over its display advertising business to AOL Inc and sell some map-generating technology to ride-hailing app company Uber, as it slims down its money-losing online operations.The moves mean Microsoft will focus on its growing search advertising business based on its Bing search engine, and displaying maps on its Windows devices rather than generating the maps themselves.Microsoft, which employs hundreds of people in its display ad business around the world, said those employees would be offered the chance to transfer to AOL and that it was not making any layoffs. The world's largest software company no longer breaks out results for its online operations, chiefly its MSN web portal and Bing, but they have  lost more than $10 billion over the past five years. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has said Bing will turn a profit next fiscal year.""Today's news is evidence of Microsoft's increased focus on our strengths: in this case, search and search advertising and building great content and consumer services,"" said Microsoft in a statement. Under a 10-year deal struck with AOL, now a unit of Verizon Communications Inc, AOL will sell display ads on MSN, Outlook.com, Xbox, Skype and in some apps in major countries. As part of the deal, Bing will become the search engine behind web searches on AOL starting next year.Microsoft also struck a multi-year extension to its existing deal with AppNexus, which provides the tech platform for buyers to purchase online ads. Microsoft and Uber did not disclose financial terms of their deal, under which Uber will take over the part of Microsoft's  mapping unit that works on imagery acquisition and map data processing. Uber will offer jobs to the 100 or so Microsoft employees working in that area, according to a source familiar with the deal.Fast-growing Uber, which is shaking up established taxi services worldwide, already uses a combination of map services from Google Inc, Apple Inc and China's Baidu  and the source said it will continue to do so.Although Microsoft will no longer collect mapping imagery itself, Microsoft said it will continue to work with imagery providers for underlying data on its own maps.

1002,"  (In June 25 story, changes attribution in last sentence to the companies, instead of the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the companies)By Paul LienertMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 25 Two self-driving prototype cars, one operated by Google Inc and the other by Delphi Automotive Plc, had a close call on a Silicon Valley street earlier this week, a Delphi executive told Reuters on Thursday.It was believed to be the first such incident involving two vehicles specially equipped for automated driving.The incident occurred Tuesday on San Antonio Road in Palo Alto, said John Absmeier, director of Delphi's Silicon Valley lab and global business director for the company's automated driving program, who was a passenger in one of the cars. No collision took place.Google declined to comment.Absmeier was a passenger in a prototype Audi Q5 crossover vehicle equipped with lasers, radar, cameras and special computer software designed to enable the vehicle to drive itself, with a person at the wheel as a backup. As the Delphi vehicle prepared to change lanes, a Google self-driving prototype - a Lexus RX400h crossover fitted with similar hardware and software - cut off the Audi, forcing it to abort the lane change, Absmeier said.The Delphi car ""took appropriate action,"" according to Absmeier. Delphi's Silicon Valley lab is based in Mountain View, not far from Google headquarters. While Delphi is running two Audi prototypes in California, Google has been testing more than 20 Lexus prototypes.On Thursday, Google started testing self-driving vehicle prototypes of its own design on local streets. The latest prototypes use the same software as the Lexus vehicles.Both companies previously have reported minor collisions of self-driving cars with vehicles piloted by people. In most of those cases, the self-driving car was stopped, typically at an intersection, and was rear-ended by another vehicle.In all cases, the self-driving prototype was not at fault, according to the companies.

1003,"   By Lawrence Hurley and Dan Levine | WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO  WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) won a major legal victory on Monday in a closely watched copyright case involving the company's Java programing language as the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) appeal. The decision upholds a ruling that allows Oracle to seek licensing fees for the use of some of the Java language. Google had said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee.The case involves how much copyright protection should extend to Java. Google, which used Java to design its Android smartphone operating system, said in court papers that an Oracle victory would obstruct ""an enormous amount of innovation"" because software developers would not be able to build freely on each others' work.The litigation now returns to a San Francisco federal court for more proceedings on Google's separate ""fair use"" defense.  ""We will continue to defend the interoperability that has fostered innovation and competition in the software industry,"" Google said in a statement on Monday. Oracle, however, has said effective copyright protection is the key to software development. General Counsel Dorian Daley said on Monday that the Supreme Court decision was a ""win for innovation.""  Google's Android operating system is the world's best-selling smartphone platform. Oracle sued Google in 2010 and is seeking roughly $1 billion on its copyright claims.The case examined whether application programing interfaces, which connect programs, can be copyrighted.

1014,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday it will hand over its display advertising business to AOL Inc and sell some map-generating technology to ride-hailing app company Uber, as it slims down its money-losing online operations.The moves mean Microsoft will focus on its growing search advertising business based on its Bing search engine, and displaying maps on its Windows devices rather than generating the maps themselves. Microsoft, which employs hundreds of people in its display ad business around the world, said those employees would be offered the chance to transfer to AOL and that it was not making any layoffs. The world's largest software company no longer breaks out results for its online operations, chiefly its MSN web portal and Bing, but they have  lost more than $10 billion over the past five years. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has said Bing will turn a profit next fiscal year.  ""Today’s news is evidence of Microsoft’s increased focus on our strengths: in this case, search and search advertising and building great content and consumer services,"" said Microsoft in a statement.Under a 10-year deal struck with AOL, now a unit of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AOL will sell display ads on MSN, Outlook.com, Xbox, Skype and in some apps in major countries. As part of the deal, Bing will become the search engine behind web searches on AOL starting next year.  Microsoft also struck a multi-year extension to its existing deal with AppNexus, which provides the tech platform for buyers to purchase online ads. Microsoft and Uber did not disclose financial terms of their deal, under which Uber will take over the part of Microsoft's  mapping unit that works on imagery acquisition and map data processing. Uber will offer jobs to the 100 or so Microsoft employees working in that area, according to a source familiar with the deal. Fast-growing Uber, which is shaking up established taxi services worldwide, already uses a combination of map services from Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and China's Baidu (BIDU.O) and the source said it will continue to do so. Although Microsoft will no longer collect mapping imagery itself, Microsoft said it will continue to work with imagery providers for underlying data on its own maps. Microsoft already gets much of its map data from Finland's Nokia NOK1V.HE.

1017,"   By Nikola Rotscheroth and Harro Ten Wolde  A German court reaffirmed on Wednesday that YouTube was only responsible for blocking copyright-infringing videos which had been brought to its attention, but the judicial panel said the Google video unit could do more to stop breaches.The Hamburg regional court rejected an appeal by German performing rights association GEMA, upholding a lower court ruling that said sites such as YouTube do not actively have to search for illegal activity by their users.The appeals court rebuffed a Google appeal on a secondary issue in the case, finding that YouTube had failed to act promptly enough to takedown infringing videos in seven of 12 cases brought before the court. For the remaining five video clips at issue YouTube had no duty to remove them, it said.A spokesman for Google in Germany said it would wait until the court's detailed reasoning is published in two weeks' time before deciding whether it would appeal aspects of the ruling. GEMA, which represents more than 70,000 composers, lyricists and music publishers who hold copyrights in Germany, also said it was waiting to see the full ruling before considering whether to mount a further appeal.The ruling centred on whether the Internet service provider was simply acting as a host for users to upload video clips and then what responsibilities it bears for policing copyright violations once it has been notified they have taken place.""If such a service provider has been made aware of a clear violation of the law, it must not only remove the content, but also must take precautions to avoid further infringements of copyrights,"" the court said in its ruling. For nearly a decade, Google has faced lawsuits by performance rights organisations in courts around the world claiming that YouTube enables wholesale copyright infringement.YouTube says it is able to block illegal video clips by using a technology it developed which adds a digital fingerprint to any copyrighted video brought to its attention. However, for the fingerprinting technology to work, copyright holders must provide YouTube with a list of illegal clips, something that Google maintains GEMA has largely refused to do.GEMA chief Harald Heker said in a statement: ""The regional court's ruling shows that YouTube cannot evade responsibility for copyright infringements.""YouTube and GEMA are fighting several legal battles.Google won a legal victory on Tuesday over GEMA, which had sought to make YouTube pay each time users watched music videos by artists it represents.",2015-07-01,GOOGL,"Wed Jul 1, 2015 | 12:39pm EDT","YouTube not liable on copyright, but needs to do more - German court",http://www.reuters.com//article/google-youtube-germany-idUSL1N0ZH0RH20150701?type=companyNews

1021,"  JERUSALEM, July 6 Google-owned online mapping company Waze is launching a carpooling pilot programme in Israel where commuters pay fellow drivers a small fee for a ride to and from work.The new application, called RideWith, will use Waze's navigation system to learn the routes drivers most frequently take to work and match them up with people looking for a ride in the same direction.Google bought Israel-based Waze, which uses satellite signals from members' smartphones to offer real-time traffic information, for about $1 billion two years ago. ""We're conducting a small, private beta test in the greater Tel Aviv area for a carpool concept, but we have nothing further to announce at this time,"" Waze told Reuters of its foray into the increasingly competitive field of ride-sharing. Drivers will be limited to just two journeys a day and will not be able to earn a salary from RideWith, a source close to the company said, differentiating it from businesses such as Uber, where drivers can turn a profit. Should RideWith be rolled out globally, this limitation could help it avoid the backlash Uber is facing in a number of countries that want to protect professional taxi drivers.Waze does not expect there to be enough drivers to meet demand at first, but as more sign on, passengers will be able to order a ride either to or from work while chipping in a bit for the cost of gas and wear and tear on the car, the source said.

1022,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT, July 7  DETROIT, July 7 Google Inc has begun testing its self-driving cars in Austin, Texas, expanding efforts to gather information on how the prototypes interact with traffic, road conditions and people, the company said early Tuesday.Google has been testing self-driving prototypes since 2009, mainly around its Silicon Valley headquarters in Mountain View, California.Google is sending a second specially equipped Lexus RX450h prototype this week to Austin. Last month, the company began testing tiny, bubble-shaped self-driving prototype vehicles of its own design on public roads around Mountain View.Google and other automotive manufacturers and suppliers have said the technology to build self-driving cars should be ready by 2020. Google executives have said the company does not want to build its own self-driving cars, but would prefer to find a development and production partner.But most major multinational automakers are developing their own so-called automated vehicles that are designed to control major functions such as steering, brakes and throttle without human effort. The Google self-driving cars have humans on board who can assume manual control of the vehicles if necessary.A Google press release on Tuesday quoted the Texas Department of Transportation as saying ""we welcome and support Google's autonomous vehicle test"" in Austin.Both Google and Apple Inc maintain offices in Austin, an emerging technology hub in the southwest United States.

1023,"   By Edward Taylor, Arno Schuetze and Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT, July 8  FRANKFURT, July 8 Germany's big car makers have reached a stand-off with Nokia in their joint bid to buy the Finnish company's maps business HERE, while rival offers appear to be unravelling, sources familiar with the process said.Talks between Nokia and BMW, Daimler  and Volkswagen over the sale are ongoing but have reached a difficult stage as important details such as price and structure are finalised, two auto industry sources and two financial sources said.German car makers are feeling less pressure to pay a high price to clinch HERE, amid signs that rival bidders such as Uber, the Silicon Valley-based taxi-hailing service, have dropped out of the race, one of the financial sources said.Analysts estimate the potential value of HERE at between 2 billion and 4 bln euros ($2.2 bln to $4.4 bln).""Talks have not broken down, but they are at a delicate stage of brinkmanship,"" said one of the auto industry sources, who declined to be named, because the talks are confidential.BMW, Daimler and Audi declined to comment. Uber also declined comment.Luxury car makers see high-definition maps as an essential tool to help them bring self-driving cars, with collision warning systems, to the market as a way to differentiate their vehicles.Germany's car makers are major clients of HERE. That gives BMW, Daimler's luxury brand Mercedes and VW's premium brand Audi some leverage in the auction process, since other buyers would see HERE's value shrink if the car makers stopped using it or switched to a rival maps supplier, such as TomTom of the Netherlands.A spokeswoman for Nokia declined comment, saying only that it continued with a strategic review of the business which may or may not result in a sale of HERE. The Scandinavian network equipment maker is reviewing its businesses as it looks to focus on its core mobile network gear business and is pursuing a 15.6 billion euro takeover of French-American rival equipment maker Alcatel Lucent.It has been soliciting indicative offers for HERE and is now demanding that interested parties submit a binding offer.At least three groups expressed interest in the asset during the process when non-binding offers were solicited: the German car makers, a consortium including Uber and China's Baidu , and a third group led by Chinese social network and online media company Tencent, people familiar with the process have said.Some parties have subsequently pulled out and the makeup of the different consortia remains in flux. Others have signalled they want to ""join the winning bid"" and are flexible about their allegiance, another financial source familiar with the matter said. ROAD AHEAD The car makers are loathe to see HERE fall into the hands of rival technology firms. That could compromise their access to high-definition maps, potentially slowing their ability to expand in the area of connected cars, which Exane BNP Paribas says could grow into a $50 billion market.Autonomous cars can navigate routes by using data gathered from cameras and laser sensors to identify obstacles and cross-reference this with data about the location of fixed points like roadside kerbs and traffic lights recorded in high-definition maps.As part of their offer for HERE, the German car makers have pledged to continue investing in the unit for a number of years, and have agreed to contribute live data gathered by sensors on board their vehicles, said the second carmaker source. The car maker consortium has been in talks with private equity firm General Atlantic to give them the option of adding financial muscle to their offer, sources familiar with the transaction previously told Reuters.While General Atlantic is currently not part of the German companies' negotiating team, it could join their consortium at a later stage to act as a ""neutral referee"" with other potential partners, one of the sources familiar with the deal said.Previously, a financial source told Reuters that private equity firm Apax had joined Uber and Baidu in a second consortium, which now appears to be unravelling.Apax and Baidu declined to comment.Last month, Microsoft agreed to sell some of its map-generating technology to Uber for undisclosed terms, under a deal in which Uber will offer jobs to the 100 or so Microsoft employees working on image acquisition and map data processing, according to a source familiar with the deal.Fast-growing Uber, which is shaking up established taxi services worldwide, already uses a combination of map services from Google, Apple Inc and Baidu, and the source said it would continue to do so.NavInfo, which linked up with the Tencent group, in late June said it was not making an offer.For Audi and BMW, beating Baidu to acquire HERE would be a delicate matter since they also have cooperation deals with the Chinese company on issues such as developing autonomous vehicles and map data in China.

That would mark an all-time high for the stock in regular trading if it closes at that level on Friday, adding roughly $40 billion to its market value.Google remains the most valuable publicly traded U.S. company after Apple Inc.Google's expenses rose 10 percent to $12.9 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 from the year-ago quarter, and remained at 73 percent of revenue, the company said on Thursday. But expenses only grew by $91 million from the first quarter, and as a percentage of revenue declined by 1 percentage point. ""The decline in quarter-over-quarter operating expenses reflects, in part, discipline in expense management and, in part, lower legal expenses than in comparable periods,"" CFO Ruth Porat told analysts on a conference call.Google's stock rally also appeared to reflect Porat's comments. The stock was up a little over 7 percent after the close of regular trading and steadily rose during the call as she talked about keeping expenses under control.Advertising revenue grew 11 percent to $16.02 billion from the year-ago quarter, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 18 percent, the company said. Advertisers pay Google only if a user clicks on one of its ads. ""Cost per click,"" or the average price of online ads, fell 11 percent, but was more than offset by the increase in ad volumes.Google's ad revenue has been under pressure as consumers access its services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, whose ad rates are typically lower.

As a result, he said the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue, having ""managed something somewhat unusual: they pled themselves out of a case."" He added: ""With no allegation of dissemination or improper receipt of information, any profit or loss made from any alleged disclosure, let alone a potential disclosure, is conjectural.""Google said $15.51 billion, or 90 percent, of its $17.26 billion of first-quarter revenue came from advertising.

The federal government is only contributing $50,000, Julian Castro, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told reporters on a conference call. The initiative will reach 275,000 households with almost 200,000 children.""While high-speed Internet access is given for millions of Americans, it's out of reach for far too many,"" Obama said at Durant High School to a crowd that included many children in traditional tribal garb. The Choctaw Tribal Nation is working with four local providers to bring the Internet to 425 homes.In Atlanta, Durham, Kansas City and Nashville, Google will provide free Internet connections in some public housing areas. In select markets, Sprint will offer free wireless broadband access to families with kids in public housing. In Seattle, CenturyLink Inc will provide broadband service for public housing residents for $9.95 a month for the first year.Cox Communications Inc is offering home Internet for $9.95 a month to families with kids in school in four cities in Georgia, Louisiana and Connecticut.The program also includes free training and technical support. Best Buy Co Inc will offer free training to the Choctaw Tribal Nation and in some cities, the White House said.

1033,"  * Nasdaq ends at record high on rally in Google shares* Mixed U.S., European corporate results hurt sentiment* Oil price drop hits energy shares* Dollar posts strongest weekly gain in two months* Spot gold hits five-year low   (Updates to close of U.S. markets)By Sam ForgioneNEW YORK, July 17 Wall Street's Nasdaq stock index ended at a record high on Friday on a rally in Google shares, while weak energy stocks and disappointing corporate results from companies such as Boeing and Volvo hit other European and U.S. indexes and the dollar rallied on strong U.S. inflation and housing data.Google surged 16.26 percent to end at an all-time high of $699.62, pushing the Nasdaq to a second straight record high. A 6.3 percent drop in Volvo shares and a halt to a Greece-driven relief rally stymied European shares, meanwhile, while a 1.1 percent drop in Boeing shares and a similar tumble in the S&P 500 energy index weighed on the Dow and limited the S&P 500's gains. Energy stocks slid on the back of a drop in oil prices, which later rebounded from their lows. In Europe, oil and gas shares ended 0.52 percent lower.""Whenever we see oil tick down, people worry about global growth,"" said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. She added that earnings ""have been a little bit of a touch-and-go situation.""Forecast-beating corporate reports from mobile network supplier Ericsson, appliance maker Electrolux  and Swiss fragrance firm Givaudan helped European shares close mostly flat. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.29 percent on Friday and notched its strongest weekly gain since May, of about 2 percent.MSCI's all-country world equity index, was last down 0.05 percent at 431.96.The S&P 500 closed up 0.11 percent, at 2,126.64 and the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.19 percent, at 18,086.45. The Nasdaq composite ended up 0.91 percent, at 5,210.14.The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed down 0.01 percent at 1,608.59. The FTSEurofirst and Euro STOXX 50 indexes both remain up nearly 20 percent in 2015. Strong U.S. consumer price index data, rebounding housing starts and surging building permits bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve was moving closer to hiking interest rates, which buoyed the dollar.""The focus is turning to the U.S. rate cycle, and (the market reckons) a September rate hike is still, if not probable, at least possible,"" RBC Capital Markets global head of FX strategy Adam Cole said.The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened on the outlook for higher rates. Yields move inversely to prices.Spot gold prices fell more than 1 percent to their lowest since April 2010 of $1,130.70 an ounce, pressured by the strong dollar and increasing bets that the Fed will hike rates. U.S. August gold futures settled down 1 percent at $1,131.90 an ounce.Brent crude rose and U.S. futures dipped in choppy trading as expectations of increased exports from Iran capped prices and helped both contracts post their third consecutive weekly losses.International benchmark Brent settled up 18 cents at $57.10 a barrel, while front-month U.S. crude futures  settled down 2 cents at $50.89.

1034,"   By Tariro Mzezewa | NEW YORK, July 17  NEW YORK, July 17 Google Inc's strong quarterly results, which unleashed a massive surge in its shares on Friday, has investors feeling upbeat heading into next week's tech-heavy slate of earnings reports.Among the numerous tech companies releasing earnings next week are International Business Machines, Microsoft Corp  and Apple, all of which are expected to show growth.Wall Street analysts expect earnings of the S&P technology sector to grow by 2.7 percent for the second quarter.So far, big-name tech companies have provided the two biggest reactions from investors in this reporting season. After Netflix reported stronger-than-expected subscriber growth on Wednesday, its shares increased 18 percent, while Google's results triggered the biggest one-day move in the stock in more than seven years, as shares surpassed $700 for the first time ever. ""Right now, investors are looking for growth and tech is one of the sectors where growth may not be as great as they want, but it's there year-after-year,"" said Dan Morgan, vice president at Synovius Trust Company in Atlanta.Investors will be looking closely at each major tech company's latest innovations to see if new platforms and tools have the potential to drive long-term growth.IBM will open the week with its second-quarter earnings on Monday. The company's recent analytics tools and cloud platform will be under investors' microscopes, to see if these segments can generate more revenue. IBM's shares have struggled of late, with the stock down more than 10 percent in the last 12 months, compared with an 8.6 percent gain in the S&P 500. Apple and Microsoft will both release their figures on Tuesday.Investors are confident that Apple's iPhone will continue to rake in profits, but analysts will be watching for the first official figures on the Apple Watch. Some investors are looking to see if the watch can make up for lower growth of the iPad, which has faced numerous tablet competitors. Yahoo Inc, Qualcomm Inc and Texas Instruments Inc will also report earnings next week.In addition to tech companies, a host of banks including Morgan Stanley will report earnings next week, following results this week from many financial companies in the S&P 500, including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Financials have been inconsistent. Bank of America exceeded expectations and Citigroup reported its largest quarterly profit since the financial crisis, while Goldman Sachs reported its smallest quarterly profit in nearly four years due to litigation expenses.Analysts expect earnings of the S&P financials sector to grow by 19.1 percent this quarter, the best year-over-year growth of any sector.

Google said it was the first such incident involving injuries in a self-driving car.The technology giant, which started developing self-driving cars in 2009, said its prototype vehicles have been struck 14 times, including 11 rear-end collisions. The Google vehicle was not at fault in any of those incidents, the company said.Google disclosed the incident in a blog post on Thursday. ""Our self-driving cars are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers who are distracted and not paying attention to the road,"" wrote Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, in the blog post. ""The clear theme is human error and inattention"" in those incidents.Google is testing a fleet of 23 specially equipped Lexus prototypes, and said it has logged more than 1 million test miles. Last month, the company began testing tiny, bubble-shaped self-driving prototype vehicles of its own design on public roads around Mountain View. The company has also started testing self-driving prototypes in Austin, Texas.Google and other automotive manufacturers and suppliers have said the technology to build self-driving cars should be ready by 2020.Urmson has said the company does not want to build its own self-driving cars, but would prefer to find a development and production partner. But most major multinational automakers are developing their own so-called automated vehicles that are designed to control major functions such as steering, brakes and throttle, without human effort.The Google self-driving cars have humans on board who can assume manual control of the vehicles if necessary.

Facebook rose nearly 5 percent to a record high of $95.39 on hopes that it could mirror Google's ad growth. Etsy  spiked nearly 40 percent thanks to a nod from Google during its conference call.Crude oil prices slipped in choppy trading due to a strong dollar and fears of increased exports, pushing the S&P 500 energy index down 1.5 percent to its lowest level since January 2013.

General Electric shares rose 0.9 percent to $27.27, the biggest among the six gainers on the Dow 30, after raising its 2015 outlook for its industrial manufacturing businesses.The technology index was the only gainer among the 10 major S&P 500 indexes.

1042,"   By Kshitiz Goliya  Shares of e-commerce website Etsy (ETSY.O) jumped 30 percent on Friday thanks to a nod from Google (GOOGL.O) during its quarterly conference call.Speaking to analysts after its second-quarter report late on Thursday, Google Chief Business Officer Omid Kordestani pointed to Brooklyn-based Etsy as a good example of web companies winning more business due to Google's recent move to index information and pages within third-party apps.""Developers like Etsy are already seeing a boost in traffic as a result of deep linking,"" Kordestani said. The jump in Etsy's shares pressured short sellers who recently increased bets against the company, which has grown from selling just wooden goods to include other crafts, vintage goods and recently, mass manufactured products.

1055,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Some of the biggest U.S. corporate names on Monday offered their support - and billions of dollars in green financing pledges - to buttress the Obama administration's quest for a global agreement on combating climate change.Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and 10 other well-known companies joined the White House in launching the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a campaign that the White House said would inject $140 billion in low-carbon investments into the global economy.Massive private sector commitments are seen by participants as essential to getting a global agreement on climate change in Paris in December. Emerging nations have demanded that any agreement include tens of billions of dollars in financing from developed nations to help their economies adapt to a low-carbon future.Although not all the corporate pledges represented new commitments, Monday's announcement showed the administration's ability to get private sector buy-in for international climate change financing. Mindy Lubber, president of environmental investor group Ceres, applauded the announcements but said the White House cannot rely solely on these pledges.""Voluntary commitments alone will not get us the meaningful reductions we need,"" she said. ""Strong carbon-reducing policies are hugely important."" None of the companies involved in Monday's announcement were from the fossil fuel sector of the economy, though the White House said there could be a second round of pledges in the fall ahead of the Paris conference.Other companies included General Motors, Bank of America, Microsoft and Coca Cola, many of which also announced measures to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions and deploy more clean energy.The White House said the companies' promises would lead to at least 1,600 megawatts of new renewable energy being brought on line. Water-use intensity would be reduced by 15 percent and the companies would target zero net deforestation in their supply chains.  Google, which claims to be the biggest corporate purchaser of renewable power globally, pledged to triple those purchases over the next decade. In a blog post on Google's website, CEO Eric Schmidt said while the private sector can play a leadership role on climate change, it needs political certainty to encourage companies to scale up their investments.""We need the world’s political leaders to confirm that investments in clean energy are sound, and that the laws and policies meant to enable such investment will be designed for the long term,"" Schmidt wrote.

1061,"  (Corrects date to July 16 from June 16 in paragraph 2)July 30 Facebook Inc's shares fell as much as 5 percent on Thursday, after the company's weak advertising sales growth outlook dampened investor expectations boosted by Google Inc's strong report earlier this month.Facebook's shares rallied 7 percent since the search giant reported a better-than-expected profit on July 16, and said it would take a disciplined approach to spending.In contrast, Facebook said it plans to keep spending heavily on its messaging services, Instagram and its virtual reality headset business. Costs soared 82 percent in the second quarter.""The number one reason (for the share price fall) is that ... some investors looking at these results are deciding to take their profits,"" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said. The stock is expensive compared with that of its peers, according to Thomson Reuters data. It trades at 40.4 times forward earnings, well above the sector median of 25.6 and Google Inc's multiple of 20.9.However, Wall Street analysts think the stock has more room to grow and expect Facebook's strong investments to boost long-term growth. Of the 50 brokerages covering the stock, at least 24 raised their price targets. Piper Jaffray was the most bullish with a $146 target - 50 percent over Facebook's Wednesday close of $96.99.Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish on Facebook - only one analyst a ""sell"" rating on the stock. ""While newer initiatives may have a less pronounced impact on near-term revenue growth, we believe management's focus on optimizing the user experience will bear significantly more financial fruit long term,"" Baird analysts wrote in a note, raising its price target to $110 from $96.Facebook's monthly active users hit 1.49 billion globally as of June 30, up 13 percent from a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue jumped 39 percent to $4.04 billion, but beat estimates by just 1 percent.""I think that the underlying expectation was that revenue could be a bit stronger than that, especially given that we have seen quite a lot of strength at Google and even Twitter's ad revenue was better than anticipated,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said.Facebook shares pared some of their losses to trade down 2.5 percent at $94.55 by afternoon.

Google sold the Motorola handset business to Lenovo (0992.HK) last year but kept its patents. The court also upheld $14.5 million awarded to Microsoft for Motorola's breach of contract to license its patents fairly. Both Microsoft and Google declined to comment on the decision. The case has been broadly followed by the technology industry because it could affect how Google and others negotiate royalty rates on their technology. Microsoft sued Motorola in 2010, alleging Motorola had breached its obligation to offer licenses to wireless and video patents used in Xbox game consoles and Windows products at a reasonable cost. After a 2012 trial, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said the appropriate royalty rate was $1.8 million, far less than Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year. A jury later found Motorola in breach of contract. Google appealed the verdict and the royalty rate to the 9th Circuit.The dispute highlighted a debate over how much patent owners should be able to ask others to pay to use inventions that have become widely adopted in certain technologies.  Apple (AAPL.O), Intel (INTC.O) and other companies filed court papers in support of Microsoft's position, while major patent licenser Qualcomm (QCOM.O) opposed Robart's calculation, saying it will devalue patents and cause ""incalculable damage"" to innovation.The case in the 9th Circuit is Microsoft Corp vs. Motorola Mobility Inc et al, 14-35393.

1070,"  * Apple denies report it plans to launch mobile service* Says has not discussed and has no plans for MVNO* Mobile network service could undermine telecom operators   (Adds context, details on Google network project, share action)By Eric Auchard and Leila AbboudFRANKFURT/PARIS, Aug 4 Apple Inc, the world's most profitable mobile phone maker, has denied working on a plan to market communications services directly to consumers and bypass the telecom companies on which it has long relied to sell its products.Business Insider had on Monday reported that the iPhone maker was testing a so-called mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service in the United States, which would involve it renting capacity from one or more network operators to sign up customers to its own phone and data plans. The mobile phone maker is also in talks with European operators about such an arrangement, the website reported.""We have not discussed nor do we have any plans to launch an MVNO,"" said an Apple spokeswoman in a statement on Tuesday.Since it first launched the iPhone in 2007, carriers ranging from AT&T Inc and Deutsche Telekom AG to China Mobile Ltd have been a key part of ensuring the success of Apple's move into the mobile phone business. The carriers buy huge numbers of mobile phones from Apple, then resell them to customers who sign long-term contracts, often at a discount. Any move to sideline the carriers by going direct to consumers is therefore risky for Apple.Apple recently reported that it sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter through June, raking in $31.4 billion in revenue, or 63 percent of its total sales. In order to ensure maximum coverage to its customers, Apple has moved away from an early focus on exclusive deals with single operators in key markets to work with as many operators as possible.Last year, the company launched an own-branded Apple SIM card that allows consumers using its iPad tablet devices, but not its phones, to switch services between network operators. Several top operators in the United States and Europe support the Apple SIM.By contrast, Silicon Valley rival Google Inc  earlier this year unveiled an MVNO service in the United States.The Google service, known as ""Project Fi"", is being run in conjunction with U.S. operators Sprint and T-Mobile USA . It connects customers to the fastest available service by seeking out available local Wi-Fi hotspots before, as a backstop, connecting to the telecom networks of its partners.Apple shares, which fell as much as 4.4 percent in the first 90 minutes of Nasdaq trading on Tuesday, steadied after the denial to be down 3.1 percent by 1642 GMT.

1071,"   By Julia Fioretti  Internet firms such as Cisco, Google  and Amazon will be subject to a new EU cybersecurity law forcing them to adopt tough security measures and possibly report serious breaches to national authorities, according to a document seen by Reuters.The so-called Network and Information Security Directive has been stuck in talks between member states and EU lawmakers  because of disagreements over whether to include digital platforms such as search engines, social networks, e-commerce sites and cloud computing providers.Members of the European Parliament want the law to only cover sectors they consider critical, such as energy, transport and finance.But after months of negotiations, digital platforms will now fall under the law's remit, albeit with less onerous security obligations, according to the document, which did not provide details of the obligations. The paper from Luxembourg, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, suggests adopting a lighter approach for digital service platforms which typically do not have direct links to physical infrastructure such as, for example, a nuclear power company.Any firm meeting the law's definition of a digital service platform -- which is still under discussion -- would automatically be covered to avoid member states taking different approaches and causing fragmentation across the 28-nation EU.A cloud computing provider or any other digital firm providing a service for an infrastructure operator would be subject to the same rules applying to that operator, according to the document, which could still change in discussions after the summer. Internet firms will also be subject to notification requirements in cases of security breaches, although there is no agreement yet on whether these should be mandatory or voluntary.The paper asks member states to express their preferences at a meeting in September, after which drafting of a full legal text will start. Firms in the digital sphere oppose being included in the law's scope.""We're pleased to see digital service platforms subject to a different regime but we're disappointed at the lack of recognition that it is the use of cloud that determines the security risk not the service itself,"" said Chris Gow, Senior Manager, Government Affairs at Cisco.The European Commission -- the EU executive -- and some member states reckon that because of the widespread use of Internet services and the number of businesses that rely on the web they should also be subject to security rules and reporting requirements.Currently there is no pan-European cybersecurity law and only telecoms operators are subject to the incident-reporting requirements.",2015-08-06,GOOGL,"Thu Aug 6, 2015 | 12:48pm EDT",Internet firms to be subject to new cybersecurity rules in EU,http://www.reuters.com//article/eu-cybersecurity-idUSL1N10H2CS20150806?type=companyNews

1074,"   By Joseph Menn | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS Google Inc and Samsung Electronics Co will release monthly security fixes for Android phones, a growing target for hackers, after the disclosure of a bug designed to attack the world's most popular mobile operating system.The change came after security researcher Joshua Drake unveiled what he called Stagefright, hacking software that allows attackers to send a special multimedia message to an Android phone and access sensitive content even if the message is unopened.""We've realized we need to move faster,"" Android security chief Adrian Ludwig said at this week's annual Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas.Previously, Google would develop a patch and distribute it to its own Nexus phones after the discovery of security flaws.But other manufacturers would wait until they wanted to update the software for different reasons before pushing out a fix, exposing most of the more than 1 billion Android users to potential hacks and scams until the fix.Ludwig also said Google has made other security changes. In an interview, he told Reuters that earlier this year the team broke out incidence rates of malicious software by language. The rate of Russian-language Androids with potentially harmful programs had spiked suddenly to about 9 percent in late 2014, he said. Google made its roughly weekly security scans of Russian phones more frequent and was able to reduce the problems to close to the global norm.Ludwig said improvements to recent versions of Android would limit an attack's effectiveness in more than nine out of 10 phones, but Drake said an attacker could keep trying until the gambit worked. Drake said he would release code for the attack by Aug. 24, putting pressure on manufacturers to get their patches out before then.Nexus phones are being updated with protection this week and the vast majority of major Android handset makers are following suit, Ludwig said. Samsung Vice President Rick Segal acknowledged that his company could not force the telecommunications carriers that buy its devices in bulk to install the fixes and that some might do so only for higher-end users.""If it's your business customers, you'll push it,"" Segal said in an interview. Samsung is the largest maker of Android phones.Ludwig said many Android security scares were overblown. He added that only about one in 200 Android phones Google can peer into have any potentially harmful applications installed at any point. Drake noted that those figures exclude some products, including Fire products from Amazon, which use Android.As with Apple's iPhones, the biggest security risk comes with apps that are not downloaded from the official online stores of the two companies.Stolen files from Hacking Team, an Italian company selling eavesdropping tools to government agencies around the world, showed that a key avenue was to convince targets to download legitimate-seeming Android and iPhone apps from imposter websites.

Google co-founder Larry Page will step down as Google's chief and Pichai was appointed as head of a ""slimmed-down"" version of the company.Pichai joined Google just before its 2004 initial public offering and several colleagues who worked with him in the years following said he never seemed anointed for the top job. Instead names that came up as potential future Google chiefs included longtime product executives Salar Kamangar, Marissa Mayer and Susan Wojcicki.Back then, he was one of a small group of product managers, but his responsibilities escalated from working on new versions of the Google tool bar to overseeing the building of Chrome.Chrome's rise since its 2008 launch to become the world's dominant browser made Pichai's reputation, and he started overseeing apps like Gmail.

1083,"   By Mari Saito and Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a surprise overhaul of its operating structure on Monday, creating a holding company called Alphabet to pool its many subsidiaries and separate the core web advertising business from newer ventures like driverless cars.The move appeared to be an attempt by the search engine giant to focus on its more creative and ambitious projects, while investors cheered the potential for more financial disclosures of its disparate business segments. ""It suggests that in all likelihood, Google is not going to slow the pace of their experimental processes like self-driving cars,"" said Michael Yoshikami, head of Destination Wealth Management, which has $1.5 billion under management.The surprise news sent shares of Google up as much as 7 percent to $708 in after hours trading.The new structure could also give Wall Street better insight into Google's investment in moonshot projects like Google X, a secretive lab that produced the unpopular Google Glass wearable device. ""They are aware that they've got this hodgepodge of companies,"" said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates. ""Maybe it's better to sort them out a bit and make it clearer which ones are bringing in the bacon and which ones are science projects and which ones are long-term bets."" The Mountain View-based company co-founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998 has grown from an Internet search engine to a far-reaching conglomerate that employs more than 40,000 people worldwide. Google's planned structure resembles the way companies like Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and General Electric (GE.N) are organized, with a central unit handling corporate-wide activities such as finance and relatively independent business units focused on specific areas.Under the new corporate structure, the Google unit will encompass the core search engine as well Google Maps and YouTube. In addition to Google X, the company's new ventures such as Calico, which focuses on longevity, and connected home products maker Nest will be managed separately. Other units that are part of the new structure include Fiber, for its high-speed Internet efforts, venture capital arm Google Ventures, and Google Capital, which invests in larger tech companies. NEW STRUCTURE Alphabet Inc will replace Google as the publicly traded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all the same rights.  ""This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google,"" Page, the current CEO of Google, said in a blogpost. (googleblog.blogspot.in/) Page will become CEO of AlphabetAnalysts said the new structure could herald a new era of fiscal discipline and transparency in some of Google's more experimental and opaque business units. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Google said the new arrangement will take effect later this year and that it will likely result in two reportable, financial segments. ""For example, if a unit is doing well or badly they can dial it up or down, they can form partnerships or different companies,"" said Kay of Endpoint Technologies.Some other analysts were cautious, saying the new holding company would need to provide more details on cash flow of the experimental business segments.  ""Breaking up into two different segments - well, it's not a terrible thing. It's better than not doing it but on the other hand, you're going to have a ton of businesses buried inside of a legacy Google,"" said Brian Wieser, an analyst for Pivotal Research Group. The shuffle also looked to have the markings of Ruth Porat, who joined Google as its chief financial officer in March from Morgan Stanley. In Google's recent quarterly conference call, Porat, will serve as CFO of both Alphabet and Google, repeatedly emphasized keeping expenses under control.With Page heading up Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, a long-time Google executive who most recently served as the company's senior vice president of products, will head Google. Pichai, a well-liked executive who oversaw Google's Android and Chrome units, is respected in Silicon Valley for attracting top engineers. Google co-founder Brin will become president of Alphabet, and Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, will be executive chairman. The company's current directors will become directors of Alphabet.Analysts said the move could be followed by more structural changes in the future. ""This may be step one of several steps,"" said Morningstar analyst Rick Summer.

1090,"   By Lehar Maan  Google Inc's overhaul of its operating structure is an acknowledgement of the lack of transparency surrounding its disparate businesses and projects, analysts said, but it remains to be seen how much more the company will actually disclose.Analysts and investors have long sought more granular detail on Google's capital spending and cash flow, as well as the financial performance of YouTube and Android.Google said on Monday it would split into two reporting companies under a new holding company called Alphabet.One will hold its core search and Web advertising business, and the other its newer ventures such as driverless cars and Internet-connected thermostats made by its Nest business.Google shares were up 5.4 percent at $698.74 in early trading on Tuesday as investors anticipated - as MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson put it - ""a new era of shareholder friendliness"".Still, Google did not say what details it would disclose. ""Should Google move to 'segment reporting' as referenced in its filing, we would expect to get revenues and expenses for the core and non-core businesses, which should help bring clarity to any profitability drag caused by its non-core assets and their trajectory,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini.J.P. Morgan analysts said fuller disclosure could make the market more accepting of Google's heavy non-core investments.Some analysts also expect the split to mark the start of a more aggressive approach to expense management. ""While there are many details to be worked out, this could lead to a much nimbler and aggressive Google that can take on additional risks to compete with upstarts and existing Internet platform companies,"" Mizuho Securities analysts wrote in a client note, raising their rating to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said capex and cash flow were particularly critical for Google.But he noted that companies with multiple reporting segments usually did not break out such detail. He also said it was ""highly unlikely"" that Google would end up as two publicly trading companies.At least 14 brokerages reiterated their top ratings on the stock. Apart from Mizuho Securities, Stifel Nicolaus and Monness, Crespi, Hardt also raised their ratings to ""buy"".Several analysts likened Google's decision to break into two reporting entities to Amazon.com Inc's move to start reporting revenue from its cloud-computing unit. Amazon's shares have risen by about a third since the company first broke out results for its cloud business in April.Of 50 analysts covering Google, 43 have a ""buy"" or higher rating on the stock and seven rate it ""hold.""

1092,"  (Adds comment in 10th paragraph; data on growth in Facebook pages by small and medium businesses in 18th paragraph.)By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Nivedita BhattacharjeeSAN FRANCISCO/MUMBAI, August 12 Facebook is trying to lure skeptical advertisers in India with features such as free email support for questions about advertising and advice on increasing sales in a bid to boost revenue from its second biggest market.Facebook has 132 million users in India, trailing only the 193 million in the United States, according to the company, and the country is critical for the Menlo Park, California, social network's global expansion.But so far, the payoff has been small: Facebook earns 15 cents per user in India every quarter, compared to the $7 to $8 it makes on each U.S. user, according to analysts.Facebook does not break out its revenues in India, but Neil Shah, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, a Hong Kong-based technology consulting firm, estimates it brings in $15 million a quarter, far behind the $350 million he estimates Google earns there per quarter.Google, which set up in India in 2004, has been in the Indian market six years longer than Facebook, and its search ads are more familiar to advertisers there than the display ads Facebook offers.The business-boosting features, described to Reuters by company executives and Indian business people, are aimed at advertisers such as Mohit Khattar, managing director at online grocery company Godrej Nature's Basket, one of the roughly 60 to 65 million small- and medium-sized businesses in the country.He said he began advertising on Facebook about two months ago as the company ramped up its online presence.

TV ADS But Indian advertisers still overwhelmingly flock to television ads and remain skeptical of the value of advertising on social media, analysts and business executives said.""Advertisers in India are not warmed enough to social media as a concept of marketing,"" said Shah, the Counterpoint analyst.""We really need to help them see how Facebook pages and advertising will help grow their businesses,"" said Andy Hwang, Facebook director of small- and medium-sized businesses for Asia Pacific.For instance, the company advises businesses to create interactive Facebook pages and use Facebook Messenger to interact with customers as a way of increasing sales. Facebook says it has more than 1.5 million pages created by small and medium businesses in India, a figure that grew 70 percent over the last year. Technology companies have turned to India and other markets in Asia for growth because the region contains two-thirds of the world's population. Asia is Facebook's fastest-growing region, with 57 percent year-over-year growth in monthly active users.India alone has 1.3 billion people, second only to China, and Facebook increased the number of users there by 22 percent last year. On the other hand, only 252 million people in India have Internet access.Expansion in India is also important because of the ""China factor."" Facebook, like Google Inc and Twitter Inc , is shut out of the biggest market of all due to the Communist government's concerns over control of information. Other tech companies, such as eBay and Yahoo, have struggled to crack the Chinese market.Getting more Indian users ""drives success, or at least the perception of success,"" said Jaideep Mehta, vice president and general manager for International Data Corporation Southeast Asia.Facebook said it plans to use its strategy in India for other emerging markets such as Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, which are Facebook's third-, fourth- and fifth-largest markets by users.That makes success in India even more important for its global expansion. For the second quarter of this year, 51.3 percent of Facebook's $4 billion in revenue came from outside the U.S. and Canada.In addition to efforts to attract more Indian advertisers, Facebook is working to make it easier for users to get on the service.More than 90 percent of Facebook's Indian users access it through mobile phones, but the Facebook app uses more data than most are able to pay for and Internet connections can be patchy.

1096,"  (Chana R. Schoenberger is a business journalist in New York. The opinions expressed are her own.)By Chana, R. and SchoenbergerAug 13 With the launch of its new holding company, Alphabet, Google is trying its hardest not to be Microsoft. And Chief Executive Officer Larry Page is signaling that he does not want to be Bill Gates.The software startup that Gates founded morphed into a tech giant and gradually took over nearly every computer desktop in the world. Its core products - Windows, still the dominant desktop operating system, and productivity software like Office, which made computers invaluable to office workers - minted money. With this cash flow, Microsoft funded a research arm that attracted the smartest engineers and scientists looking to do blue-sky projects. Then the Internet took over. Bill Gates went off to fight malaria and to save the world. Microsoft receded slightly into a comfortable existence as an industry behemoth that did extremely well but no longer pulled in the brightest minds. Those computer scientists were accepting jobs somewhere else: Google.A tech CEO told me this week that hiring the best engineers creates a network effect. They want to work with the smartest people on the best projects, and the more of them a company attracts, the better projects it can tackle - leading to more top people joining the company. That's one reason why Seattle became a hub of tech companies like Amazon; Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Washington, had done the groundwork by luring so many techies to town. Google remains one of the coolest companies on earth, measured by the number of people clamoring for jobs there. For the last six years it's ranked number one on Fortune's list of the best companies to work for. The company has set the bar for perks that techies in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and elsewhere now consider standard, like the legendary free cafeterias that offer chef-designed meals for all employees. But Google is not the only hot company, and it faces hiring competition from Facebook, Twitter, and a phalanx of newer startups. This is especially true as Googlers leave to start their own new companies.Keeping a company on the cutting edge is about more than making workers happy. They have to feel relevant, heard and purposeful. One of the best ways to imbue work with a sense of purpose is to make people feel as though they are changing the world. Google's wackier projects have the potential to be earth-shaking: driverless cars could reinvent the way we get around; even the much-mocked Google Glass might turn out to be amazing in the next iteration. The Calico life-extention project - which focuses on aging and age-related diseases - represents a push toward the holy grail of all technological research. Commentators have noted the silliness of the name Alphabet and its abc.xyz domain. That's not the point; Google is a pretty silly name as well. The message behind the reorganization is that Google is trying its hardest not to become irrelevant or complacent. Page and his co-founder Sergey Brin are aiming to prevent the company from missing out on the next major tech trends. If it puts too much focus on its search and advertising businesses, which make money, to the exclusion of new products, Alphabet risks failing to invent the next amazing product or service that will change the way we live the way Google search did.The concept behind the reorganization seems to be anointing several non-search divisions as equally important as the core Google business. That's just optics, because the company will continue to make its money in the same way for the near future. The most important change is in Page's role, which is shifting to a spot at the top, with Brin, of the new Alphabet entity.By formalizing a structure that gives weight to its most out-there, passion-project research, Page is inviting the coolest and most innovative engineers to come work for him. He's saying that he does not know, as no executive ever does, what his company's next big product will be. Prioritizing and separating old-school Google from the idea-factory divisions of the company may help ensure he gets the people he needs to make that next idea as big as his search breakthrough.

Registrations on the .xyz domain have increased by more than 27,000 since Google's announcement, according to ntldstats.com.CentralNIC is the exclusive wholesaler for .xyz, by far the most popular of the new domains.

1105,"   By Noor Zainab Hussain  Daniel Negari could not be clearer - his company is not for sale. XYZ.com LLC's founder and CEO Negari says he was literally shaking with excitement when he read Google Inc's announcement that .xyz would host the website of the tech giant's new company, Alphabet Inc.""I walked over to my team and said this is the biggest thing that could have ever happened to us. I read the message again because it was so surreal,"" Negari said.The 29-year-old entrepreneur, who has offices in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas, told Reuters on Monday that XYZ had seen a very large increase in interest for strategic investments as well as total buyout after Google unveiled its new face. Negari, however, insists that his company is not for sale.  ""I believe I was put on the earth to do .xyz, and to bring it to the market. My work is nowhere near done,"" Negari said.He added that the company had seen interest from large technology players amongst others. The young CEO, who paid the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) $185,000 to apply for .xyz, told Reuters that while an initial public offering could not be ruled out, the company did not have any immediate plans for it. Google's validation of the .xyz domain has helped the number of domains the company registers grow many fold, ICANN'S youngest registry operator Negari said.  While the company normally registers 3,000 domains a day on average, 30,000 .xyz domains were registered in the week of Google's announcement.  ""This (Google's announcement) raises the profile to a level that all the marketing and advertising we do all over the world couldn't have taken us to,"" Negari said.XYZ also owns .college and .rent and plans to launch domains such as .security, .protection, .theatre, .car, .cars and .auto by the end of this year.

1128,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Paul Lienert and Joseph WhiteDETROIT, Sept 4 From his laboratory at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University, automated vehicle pioneer Raj Rajkumar says self-driving cars will evolve step-by-step, with humans staying in charge for a long time to come.More than 2,500 miles west in Mountain View, California, Chris Urmson, head of Google Inc's self-driving car program since 2009, has a different view: A fully automated vehicle that requires no input or intervention from humans is a safer choice, and one that could be ready for production by 2020.Partially automating a car can reduce certain accident risks, but can also create new safety challenges not easily solved by current technology. Urmson, one of Rajkumar's former colleagues at Carnegie Mellon, said he worries that drivers could muff the handoff when an automated system suddenly demands they start making decisions about where to steer.""The better the technology gets,"" he said, ""the less reliable the driver is going to get.""Google's all-in approach differs from the auto industry's strategy on autonomous vehicle technology that will manifest itself in vehicles consumers can buy over the next two to three years.Mainstream automakers General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG and newcomer Tesla Motors Inc  are pushing down the road to automation outlined by Rajkumar. They are accelerating plans to bring automated driving to the market in stages, starting as early as this year. A small group of Tesla owners is testing its ""Autopilot"" system that will allow hands-free highway cruising and automated parking. Tesla said it expects to offer the technology more widely later this year.Technology that allows a car to park itself is already on the market, and a growing number of vehicles are equipped with systems that automatically apply the brakes, correct the steering or maintain a set distance from a vehicle ahead in the lane. The automakers' rush to partially automated driving is moving faster than regulators can prescribe new rules of the road. Some experts - Urmson is one - are concerned that drivers may not respond well to cars that let them surrender control for long stretches.Alerting a driver to retake control during an emergency is one of the biggest safety challenges for manufacturers of partially automated cars, industry officials and scientists said.Depending on the level of automation and intensity of alert, some drivers took an average of 17 seconds to respond to a takeover request and regain control of the vehicle, in a study just released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and supported by Google and several leading automakers and suppliers. In that time, a car traveling at 60 miles per hour would travel more than a quarter of a mile.Time to respond and regain control was reduced to just a few seconds when visual and audible warnings were accompanied by non-visual alerts such as a nudge from a mechanism in the seat.But ""there were alerts that were missed"" by some study participants, NHTSA said. When drivers shift their attention to other tasks in a self-driving vehicle, such as sending an e-mail, ""their readiness to respond to driving-related prompts and alerts can be delayed."" There's value in ""driver assistance"" features such as brakes that engage automatically when the car's sensors detect an imminent crash, Urmson said. But a fully automated vehicle ""can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be.""The behavior of drivers in automated cars is one issue. Another is the interaction between robot cars and those piloted by people. Google's Urmson has highlighted that issue in dissecting the causes of a series of incidents in which the company's self-driving cars were hit by conventional vehicles.REAR-ENDED  In an August 20 incident, a Google self-driving prototype was rear-ended while stopped for a pedestrian in a crosswalk near the company's Mountain View headquarters. At the time, the driver of the Google vehicle had taken manual control after the car had begun to automatically brake for the pedestrian. Urmson speculated that the driver of the other vehicle may have glanced away while changing lanes.Unresolved questions aren't stopping automakers and automotive suppliers from cashing in on partial automation, in part because the incremental approach promises more revenue in the near term than keeping technology in the lab.Automotive technology companies such as Continental AG  and Silicon Valley names such as chipmaker Nvidia Corp  are working with automakers on semi-automated systems as well as supporting Google's project. Last month, Delphi Automotive Plc, a global auto supplier in the forefront of automated vehicle development, acquired Ottomatika, a CMU spinout that originated in Rajkumar's lab.Semi-automated driver assistance systems are expected to add $3,000 or more to the cost of cars. There are no consistent estimates on the cost of a fully automated vehicle.The entire auto industry is waiting for highway safety regulators at NHTSA to clarify their position on Tesla's Autopilot and similar technology.""The agency is in regular contact with the many companies that are developing such technologies, and we are working with all of them to help ensure that these innovations realize their safety potential,"" NHTSA said in a statement Aug 31.In July, NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind said the agency is reviewing federal vehicle safety rules that could affect self-driving vehicles.""We are trying to figure out if innovation will run up against regulations,"" Rosekind said.

Partially automating a car can reduce certain accident risks, but can also create new safety challenges not easily solved by current technology. Urmson, one of Rajkumar's former colleagues at Carnegie Mellon, said he worries that drivers could muff the handoff when an automated system suddenly demands they start making decisions about where to steer.""The better the technology gets,"" he said, ""the less reliable the driver is going to get."" Google's all-in approach differs from the auto industry's strategy on autonomous vehicle technology that will manifest itself in vehicles consumers can buy over the next two to three years.Mainstream automakers General Motors Co (GM.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and newcomer Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) are pushing down the road to automation outlined by Rajkumar. They are accelerating plans to bring automated driving to the market in stages, starting as early as this year. A small group of Tesla owners is testing its ""Autopilot"" system that will allow hands-free highway cruising and automated parking. Tesla said it expects to offer the technology more widely later this year. Technology that allows a car to park itself is already on the market, and a growing number of vehicles are equipped with systems that automatically apply the brakes, correct the steering or maintain a set distance from a vehicle ahead in the lane.The automakers' rush to partially automated driving is moving faster than regulators can prescribe new rules of the road. Some experts - Urmson is one - are concerned that drivers may not respond well to cars that let them surrender control for long stretches.Alerting a driver to retake control during an emergency is one of the biggest safety challenges for manufacturers of partially automated cars, industry officials and scientists said. Depending on the level of automation and intensity of alert, some drivers took an average of 17 seconds to respond to a takeover request and regain control of the vehicle, in a study just released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and supported by Google and several leading automakers and suppliers. In that time, a car traveling at 60 miles per hour would travel more than a quarter of a mile.Time to respond and regain control was reduced to just a few seconds when visual and audible warnings were accompanied by non-visual alerts such as a nudge from a mechanism in the seat.But ""there were alerts that were missed"" by some study participants, NHTSA said. When drivers shift their attention to other tasks in a self-driving vehicle, such as sending an e-mail, ""their readiness to respond to driving-related prompts and alerts can be delayed."" There's value in ""driver assistance"" features such as brakes that engage automatically when the car's sensors detect an imminent crash, Urmson said. But a fully automated vehicle ""can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be."" The behavior of drivers in automated cars is one issue. Another is the interaction between robot cars and those piloted by people. Google's Urmson has highlighted that issue in dissecting the causes of a series of incidents in which the company's self-driving cars were hit by conventional vehicles.REAR-ENDED In an August 20 incident, a Google self-driving prototype was rear-ended while stopped for a pedestrian in a crosswalk near the company's Mountain View headquarters. At the time, the driver of the Google vehicle had taken manual control after the car had begun to automatically brake for the pedestrian. Urmson speculated that the driver of the other vehicle may have glanced away while changing lanes. Unresolved questions aren't stopping automakers and automotive suppliers from cashing in on partial automation, in part because the incremental approach promises more revenue in the near term than keeping technology in the lab. Automotive technology companies such as Continental AG (CONG.DE) and Silicon Valley names such as chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) are working with automakers on semi-automated systems as well as supporting Google's project. Last month, Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N), a global auto supplier in the forefront of automated vehicle development, acquired Ottomatika, a CMU spinout that originated in Rajkumar’s lab.Semi-automated driver assistance systems are expected to add $3,000 or more to the cost of cars. There are no consistent estimates on the cost of a fully automated vehicle.The entire auto industry is waiting for highway safety regulators at NHTSA to clarify their position on Tesla's Autopilot and similar technology. ""The agency is in regular contact with the many companies that are developing such technologies, and we are working with all of them to help ensure that these innovations realize their safety potential,"" NHTSA said in a statement Aug 31.In July, NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind said the agency is reviewing federal vehicle safety rules that could affect self-driving vehicles.""We are trying to figure out if innovation will run up against regulations,"" Rosekind said.

Since then, it has maintained a limited presence in the world's biggest Internet market, but most of its services, including Play, have been rendered borderline inaccessible.""Google needs to be in China, period,"" says Andy Tian, CEO of Asia Innovations, a Chinese app developer and former Google executive. ""Once in China, they can expand into other services. They need a beachhead, and the beachhead is Google Play.""Google declined to comment on reports it plans to ramp up its Play store in China this year. Instead, it pointed to comments Pichai has made about exploring how to bring Google Play to China.But Tian and others say Google has lost basically all ground in most of its major services, especially search and video streaming, to Chinese players such as Internet giants Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba and Qihoo 360. All have built their own products and services to replace or even surpass Google's offerings. In China and elsewhere in Asia, the centers of gravity in mobile have shifted away from app stores as the point of control to applications like messaging, which act as gateways for third parties to provide services.Tencent's WeChat, a messaging app originally similar to WhatsApp, has become a digital Swiss army knife, allowing its 600 million monthly active users to play games, book cabs and make payments, among many other things.     TOO BIG TO IGNORE  But China is too big a market for Google to ignore. Apple Inc complies with local laws and made $13.2 billion last quarter in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, making it its second-biggest market.Some in the industry doubt whether Google can use the Play store to help get its other services into China as domestic rivals are now well established and Google would have to comply with Chinese law. That would mean storing all data in China, and meeting information access and censorship requests, a thorny issue, particularly if the U.S. government gets involved.Others say focusing on Google Play may make things easier. Chris MacDonald, a business ethics expert at Ryerson University in Toronto who oversaw a case study about Google’s operations in China while at Duke University, says Chinese regulators will see Play as less threatening than Search and Gmail, reducing the frequency of government-led probes.""It's highly unlikely the Chinese government is going to come asking, 'Did anyone download Tetris?'"" he said. ""If Google doesn't have any highly private information, it can't be asked for highly private information."" BACK IN THE GAME? China will this year become the world's largest mobile gaming market by revenue, earning more than $6 billion, says Peter Warman, CEO of Dutch mobile analytics company Newzoo, which analyses data from its Chinese partner TalkingData. Up to 90 percent of money spent on mobile goes to games, he said.Google Play is available in China, but reaches only 21 million of an estimated 800 million Chinese mobile users, Warman said. The primary app stores of Internet giants Qihoo, Tencent and Baidu account for two thirds of the market.These players are unlikely to give away that advantage. And handset manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi  have their own app stores which not only bring in revenue but enable them to control how their devices look and feel, at least in China.

1136,"   By Anastasia Teterevleva and Anastasia Lyrchikova | MOSCOW  MOSCOW Russia's anti-monopoly agency said on Monday Google Inc was abusing its market position in the country and would face penalties, in a case launched by local competitor Yandex .The FAS anti-monopoly body said Google had violated the law by pre-installing certain applications on mobile devices and could face penalties totalling up to 15 percent of its 2014 revenue in this part of the Russian market.FAS declined to specify the revenue in question, saying it was a trade secret, but said it would decide on the exact value of the fine after Sept. 28. It added Google must then pay and change its ways, or risk more fines if violations continue.Google Russia said it would analyse the decision and declined further comment until then. Shares in Yandex, which rivals Google as Russia's biggest internet search engine, rose as much as 9 percent before stabilising around 7 percent higher.Yandex, which filed a complaint against Google with FAS in February, welcomed the decision.""We believe the FAS decision will serve to restore competition on the market,"" the company said. It added the complaint included the practice of bundling applications from the Google Mobile Services with the Google Play store, requiring pre-installation of the Google search engine as the default one, and giving Google application icons preferential placement on the screen of mobile devices.""In addition, the investigation confirmed the existence of agreements on prohibition of pre-installation of competitors' apps,"" Yandex said. Yandex is ahead of Google in Russia but has seen competition stiffen in mobile phones as consumers have adopted Android-based handsets that come pre-loaded with Google products that compete directly with Yandex applications.Google's total 2014 revenue stood at $66 billion. The company's website does not provide a separate revenue figure for Russia, or the exact segment involved in the case.Analysts at App Annie say Russia was Google's No.4 market in the world in the second quarter of 2015 in terms of Google Play downloads.The European Union is conducting its own anti-trust case against Google.

The FAS anti-monopoly body said Google had violated the law by pre-installing certain applications on mobile devices and could face penalties totaling up to 15 percent of its 2014 revenue in this part of the Russian market.FAS declined to specify the revenue in question, saying it was a trade secret, but said it would decide on the exact value of the fine after Sept. 28. It added Google must then pay and change its ways, or risk more fines if violations continue.Google Russia said it would analyze the decision and declined further comment until then.       Shares in Yandex, which rivals Google as Russia's biggest internet search engine, rose as much as 9 percent before stabilizing around 7 percent higher.  Yandex, which filed a complaint against Google with FAS in February, welcomed the decision. ""We believe the FAS decision will serve to restore competition on the market,"" the company said.It added the complaint included the practice of bundling applications from the Google Mobile Services with the Google Play store, requiring pre-installation of the Google search engine as the default one, and giving Google application icons preferential placement on the screen of mobile devices. ""In addition, the investigation confirmed the existence of agreements on prohibition of pre-installation of competitors' apps,"" Yandex said.Yandex is ahead of Google in Russia but has seen competition stiffen in mobile phones as consumers have adopted Android-based handsets that come pre-loaded with Google products that compete directly with Yandex applications.  Google's total 2014 revenue stood at $66 billion. The company's website does not provide a separate revenue figure for Russia, or the exact segment involved in the case. Analysts at App Annie say Russia was Google's No.4 market in the world in the second quarter of 2015 in terms of Google Play downloads.

1147,"   By Euan Rocha | TORONTO  TORONTO Tech giants such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and upstarts like Shopify Inc (SH.TO) (SHOP.N) are rapidly expanding their presence in and around BlackBerry's (BB.TO) hometown of Waterloo, Ontario, even as the smartphone maker further pares back some of its teams.Canada's newest tech darling Shopify, which went public this year and is valued at $2.75 billion, will soon announce a major expansion in the region, according to three sources familiar with the matter.The sources, who asked not to be named as the plans have not yet been made public, said the e-commerce facilitator has just leased space in Waterloo that would let it boost its presence from about 20 people to potentially a few hundred in the region.A spokeswoman for Shopify declined to comment on the plan.Shopify, which has roughly 800 employees spread across its home base in Ottawa and satellite offices in Toronto, Montreal and the adjoining cities of Kitchener-Waterloo, saw its shares jump 23 percent on Thursday after it announced a tie-up with Amazon.com (AMZN.O).The major e-commerce company named Shopify as its preferred partner, making it the go-to company for smaller vendors to work with if they want to sell products on Amazon.com, and need to integrate inventory and payment systems with those of the e-commerce site. The sources said the new space in Waterloo will mainly be used for expanding the Shopify Plus developer and sales teams. Shopify Plus is the company's premium product aimed at larger merchants.The move comes as Google gets set to move into a new 185,000-square-foot space in Kitchener this fall. The office, some three times the size of its current space, will allow Google to vastly expand its 300-person workforce in the region.A spokeswoman for Google said the company has not outlined any specific growth targets and the new space is being developed in a phased manner. Smaller startups based in the Kitchener-Waterloo region such as Kik Interactive, whose chat platform is popular with U.S. teens; and Vidyard, which creates video marketing and analytics tools, have also outlined plans to roughly double their workforces.BLACKBERRY CUTS  The moves come as BlackBerry further pares back some of its non-core teams in the region. Sources familiar with the matter said that BlackBerry last week laid off roughly 200 staff on its hardware and design teams.""Our intention is to reallocate resources in ways that will best enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities while driving toward sustainable profitability across all facets of our business,"" said a spokeswoman for BlackBerry in an email.The sources added the moves come after BlackBerry has completed all major hardware and design work on its widely anticipated new handset, code-named Venice. The device is widely expected to arrive in November and run on Google's Android platform, but come layered with BlackBerry security and productivity features.BlackBerry, which is pivoting to focus more on software as it outsources more of the work around its hardware, declined to comment on the device.

1148,"   By Leila Abboud | PARIS  PARIS French data privacy regulators took a step towards sanctioning Google (GOOGL.O) by rejecting the company's request to drop a case against it for refusing to clean up information from its search engine results. Under Europe's so-called right to be forgotten, individuals can ask search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing (MSFT.O) to remove information that appears under a search of their name if it is incorrect, out of date, irrelevant or inflammatory. Since the European Court of Justice ruling last year that granted this right to European residents, Google has fielded nearly 320,000 requests, granting about 40 percent of them. But it only de-lists the links on European versions of its sites, such as Google.fr or Google.de not globally, meaning the information remains available.The French authority, the CNIL, in June ordered Google to de-list on request search results appearing under a person's name from all its websites, including Google.com.The company refused in July and requested that the CNIL abandon its efforts, which the regulator officially refused to do on Monday.""The President of the CNIL rejects Google's informal appeal against the formal notice requesting it to apply delisting on all of the search engine's domain names,"" the watchdog said. France is the first European country to open a legal process to punish Google for not applying the right to be forgotten globally. But an umbrella group of European data protection watchdogs took a similar position in December on the issue of cleaning up search results globally, saying that it was the only way to ensure the ""effective and complete protection of data subjects' rights and that EU law cannot be circumvented"".A CNIL spokesman said Google was required to comply immediately and begin de-listing information about French residents from all of its sites.  If it refused, the CNIL will spend the next two months preparing sanctions that can include up to 150,000 euros  ($169,000) in fines, climbing to 300,000 euros for repeat offences. Google said it had worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten ruling ""thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe"" and would continue to do so.""But as a matter of principle, we respectfully disagree with the idea that a single national Data Protection Authority should determine which webpages people in other countries can access via search engines,"" said a spokesman for the company. In July, Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, called France's request to clean up global results ""troubling"" and said it could risk ""serious chilling effects on the web"".""While the right to be forgotten may now be the law in Europe, it is not the law globally,"" Fleischer wrote.

The FTC had previously investigated Google for allegedly breaking antitrust law in a separate case but that probe ended in a settlement.Reuters reported in April that some technology companies had complained to the U.S. Department of Justice about Google's anti-competitive practices and urged the regulator to investigate allegations that Google unfairly uses its Android system to hurt rivals.The FTC and the Justice Department conferred, and decided that the FTC would take the case, one source said. The probe is in its very early stages, according to sources.Both Google and the FTC declined comment. In a blog post in April, a top Google executive defended the way the company handles Android, saying other firms could use Android without Google but that working with Google benefits consumers by giving them a better experience with their phone.The FTC probe focuses on Google's requirements that its search, maps and other products be given a prominent place on handsets. The demands make it impractical for handset makers to put Google rivals on their smartphone's home screen.Android is the top smartphone platform with 51.6 percent U.S. market share, according to an August report from analytics from comScore. Apple is in second place with 44.1 percent. Fairsearch, a technology trade group, said it welcomed the FTC probe, adding that Google ""has used a range of anticompetitive tactics.""""The stakes are extremely high, because Google's behavior impacts the entire mobile ecosystem, including map and location services, and app developers,"" the group said in a statement.App makers offering alternatives to Google's popular products, such as HERE for maps or Microsoft for search, would benefit if the Mountain View tech giant's hold on Android is weakened, though a slow legal process means they likely will not see relief anytime soon, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.  ""If they said, as of tomorrow, 'Google, you cannot bundle all these services,' it would be a huge deal,"" he said. ""But that's not what going to happen – it's going to drag on."" Google shares closed down 2.3 percent at $640.15 on Friday.The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg.Google previously tangled with the FTC over Web search allegations and reached a settlement in 2013 that required the company to stop ""scraping"" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. The FTC also required Google to allow advertisers to export data to evaluate advertising campaigns independently. After that settlement, the FTC was embarrassed by the inadvertent release of documents that showed key staff members argued that Google broke antitrust law. Google dropped some of the worst practices and commissioners opted to settle.The European Union has accused Google of distorting Web search results to favor its own shopping service as well, and is now probing the Android mobile operating system.To go after Google, the FTC would have to show that it has a big enough share of the market to be dominant and that they prevent rivals from being able to compete for consumers' attention, said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.""Right now you're clearly in the early stages and you don't know if any of this is true,"" said Barlow.

The FTC had previously investigated Google for allegedly breaking antitrust law in a separate case but that probe ended in a settlement.Reuters reported in April that some technology companies had complained to the U.S. Department of Justice about Google's anti-competitive practices and urged the regulator to investigate allegations that Google unfairly uses its Android system to hurt rivals. [ID:nL2N0XB338]The FTC and the Justice Department conferred, and decided that the FTC would take the case, one source said. The probe is in its very early stages, according to sources.Both Google and the FTC declined comment. In a blog post in April, a top Google executive defended the way the company handles Android, saying other firms could use Android without Google but that working with Google benefits consumers by giving them a better experience with their phone.The FTC probe focuses on Google's requirements that its search, maps and other products be given a prominent place on handsets. The demands make it impractical for handset makers to put Google rivals on their smartphone's home screen.Android is the top smartphone platform with 51.6 percent U.S. market share, according to an August report from analytics from comScore. Apple is in second place with 44.1 percent. Fairsearch, a technology trade group, said it welcomed the FTC probe, adding that Google ""has used a range of anticompetitive tactics.""""The stakes are extremely high, because Google's behaviour impacts the entire mobile ecosystem, including map and location services, and app developers,"" the group said in a statement.App makers offering alternatives to Google's popular products, such as HERE for maps or Microsoft for search, would benefit if the Mountain View tech giant's hold on Android is weakened, though a slow legal process means they likely will not see relief anytime soon, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.  ""If they said, as of tomorrow, 'Google, you cannot bundle all these services,' it would be a huge deal,"" he said. ""But that's not what going to happen – it's going to drag on."" Google shares closed down 2.3 percent at $640.15 on Friday.The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg.Google previously tangled with the FTC over Web search allegations and reached a settlement in 2013 that required the company to stop ""scraping"" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. The FTC also required Google to allow advertisers to export data to evaluate advertising campaigns independently. After that settlement, the FTC was embarrassed by the inadvertent release of documents that showed key staff members argued that Google broke antitrust law. Google dropped some of the worst practices and commissioners opted to settle.The European Union has accused Google of distorting Web search results to favour its own shopping service as well, and is now probing the Android mobile operating system.

1184,"   By Toby Sterling | AMSTERDAM  AMSTERDAM After its rapid ride to dominance in online travel in Europe over the past decade, Booking.com is seeking to expand in China and the U.S., its CEO said in an interview.Darren Huston, who heads both Booking.com and its U.S. parent company Priceline Group, said Booking.com is targeting a 20 percent increase in bookings going through its website in the third quarter and still has years of growth ahead.""Travel is growing at twice the rate of GDP. Do-it-yourself travel is growing faster than packaged travel. And online is growing faster than offline. So we've got three tail winds,"" Huston told Reuters from Booking.com's Amsterdam offices.""If you can't grow double digits (in this industry) then you're not keeping up.""Priceline, once a dotcom wipeout, revived its fortunes in 2005 by buying Dutch online hotel reservation service Booking.com for $133 million. The deal proved a masterstroke. By 2010, Priceline had eclipsed major rival Expedia, which is still larger in the United States, in global sales.Today, Priceline's market capitalization of $66 billion is four times Expedia's. Booking.com realized the potential that lay in Europe's fragmented market. Small hotels without the resources to build their own websites needed a way to be visible to customers. Europeans with five weeks of vacation a year found Booking's listings and telephone support in their native languages a useful tool.Soon the company was controlling the market in European hotel rooms. It takes a 15 percent cut to connect buyers and sellers, a margin Huston said is not under pressure.""That's become the market clearing take rate in this industry."" In the second quarter of 2015, Booking.com accounted for around 85 percent of Priceline Group's $2.28 billion in revenues.Priceline, which doesn't break out earnings for Booking.com, reported $517 million in net profit for the quarter.That compares to Expedia's $1.65 billion in revenues and $82.2 million in profit.Huston said he hasn't seen much evidence of a Chinese or global slowdown in the online travel business, noting that Booking's big European growth spurt came after the 2008 crash.""I don't think there's any change in the medium to long term trends in China,"" he said. ""It's not that travel is immune: people might go shorter distances, they might trade down...but they still move,"" he said.""We're growing our property count there really fast.""COMPETITORS Expedia remains the company's biggest competitor in what is frequently called a duopoly. Expedia has an estimated 75 percent market share among on-line travel agents in the United States after acquiring both Travelocity and Orbitz. Priceline's businesses -- Booking and the original Priceline, which sells discounted travel packages -- have around 20 percent. ""We have a lot more to do in the U.S.,"" Huston said, adding that the company only began branded Booking.com advertisements in 2013, one reason it has a relatively low profile there.But there are other competitors, including Google and travel review site TripAdvisor, though Huston says ultimately both have more to gain from cooperating with them as a customer than a competitor.Booking.com devotes much of its $2.7 billion marketing budget to buying advertisements on TripAdvisor and to place ads linked to Google searches, such as ""hotels in Paris."" Many analysts believe Booking.com is Google's biggest customer.""We are one of their largest partners,"" Huston said.Huston described Airbnb as an innovative competitor, but said overlap between the companies was limited.Booking.com wants to attract owners who are willing to let customers book a property instantly, while in Airbnb's more social model, people renting out their own homes take time to vet guests.Booking.com is also keen to attract more business travelers, which make up half the online travel market but only 20 percent of the firm's current business, Huston said.    The site currently has 700,000 hotels and rental properties compared to Expedia's 257,000. Huston expects Booking.com to pass a million ""sometime next year"".

1185,"   By Abhirup Roy and Yasmeen Abutaleb | BENGALURU/SAN FRANCISCO  BENGALURU/SAN FRANCISCO Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) lured Google Inc executive Omid Kordestani to become the social media company's executive chairman, the latest step in the company's turnaround efforts under Jack Dorsey, who last week was named permanent CEO.Kordestani's extensive sales experience could prove a good counterpoint to Twitter co-founder Dorsey's product knowledge and vision, analysts said. ""It's rare you get to be at a company with an amazing business that's also transforming the world,"" Kordestani tweeted. ""I've had good fortune to be at three: Netscape, @google, and now @twitter.""Kordestani, most recently senior adviser at Google, will join Twitter's board and will have an operational role at the company, a Twitter spokeswoman said. That will include help with board and employee recruiting and advising executive leadership. Twitter said last week it would hire an outsider as chairman to allay concerns about Dorsey's dual role as head of mobile payments company Square Inc, which is reportedly planning an IPO. ""It's quite a coup,"" said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.

1194,"  (Adds details of deal, comments of Mobvoi co-founder)* Google invests as it tries to re-establish China presence* Funding values Mobvoi at $300 mln - co-founderBy Paul CarstenBEIJING, Oct 20 Google will take a minority stake in Beijing-based artificial intelligence firm Mobvoi as part of a $75 million fundraising round, the start-up said on Tuesday, as the U.S. search giant tries to rebuild its presence in China. Mobvoi works on artificial intelligence (AI) voice-controlled software, like that used in Google's Android products for mobile search, and also develops hardware like smart watches. Google's parent company is now named Alphabet Inc .The Google-led Series C fundraising values Mobvoi at $300 million, with the start-up maintaining a controlling stake, said co-founder Li Yuanyuan in a telephone interview. The size of the U.S. firm's investment was not disclosed by Li or in Mobvoi's e-mailed statement on Tuesday.The deal, not Google's first in China but one of few, comes as the company seeks to re-establish itself in the world's largest Internet market by population of users. Because services like its search, e-mail and mapping are blocked in China, the U.S. firm is trying to cement partnerships with domestic providers like Mobvoi, which offers technology similar to Apple Inc's Siri and Google's own version.Mobvoi previously partnered with Google to provide Chinese-language voice search for the latter's Android Wear smartwatch operating system. The Chinese firm will use the money from its fundraising to invest in AI and robotics research. Mobvoi is also developing voice search to be integrated into vehicles and a robot for families in China, said Li.When contacted, a Singapore-based Google spokesman declined to elaborate on how the Mobvoi investment fit with its China strategy.Although Google has maintained an engineering and sales presence in China, it largely withdrew its services out of China five years ago after refusing to continue self-censoring search results.CEO Sundar Pichai has made no secret that he wants to get back into China, with his bet riding on Google Play, the app store for its Android mobile operating system, despite it currently being borderline inaccessible in China. He faces an uphill struggle.

1198,"  Oct 23 New revenue streams such as mobile and video advertising should continue to propel earnings of Google parent Alphabet Inc, whose shares were set to open at a record high on Friday following better-than-expected results, analysts said.The company's search traffic on mobiles surpassed desktop traffic worldwide for the first time in the latest quarter.Alphabet's shares were up nearly 10 percent at $746.95 in premarket trading, far above the $713.33 record high set by Google - the company's former name - in regular trading in July.A 10 percent rise equates to about $46 billion in market value. This would give Alphabet a market cap of about $519 billion, cementing its position as the second-most valuable   stock after Apple Inc, worth about $660 billion.Shares of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp , which also posted better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday, also jumped in premarket trading, pushing up U.S. stock index futures. At least 14 brokerages raised price targets on Alphabet's stock on Friday. J.P. Morgan and Jefferies were the most bullish, both raising their targets to $900.""We think it's not long before mobile clicks surpass desktop, which we expect will provide a nice tailwind to cost-per-clicks, magnified by a tighter gap between mobile and desktop ad pricing,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said. Alphabet said the number of paid clicks, which require advertisers to pay only if a user clicks on the ad, rose 23 percent, compared with 18 percent in the previous quarter.With rivals such as Facebook Inc nipping at its heels, Alphabet had been trying to pump up advertising revenue from its mobile and video businesses, which have been much less profitable than its desktop business. In a sign the company was becoming more sensitive to shareholders, Alphabet also announced on Thursday a $5.1 billion share buyback, its first ever.Alphabet's new transparent reporting structure, to come into effect in the current quarter, also shows the company is becoming more shareholder-friendly, analysts said.""The market has wanted four things from GOOGL - consistent revenue growth, margin stabilization, greater disclosure and cash back.

Revenue and profit well above analysts' average forecasts, along with the unexpected buyback, was welcomed by Wall Street, which is now betting on further growth.""They're in a great position in the overall advertising space, whether it's search, display or mobile,"" said Kerry Rice, a Needham & Co analyst. ""They've got the right programme to continue to grow at a solid pace and be dominant in those spaces."" The results come at a pivotal time for the company as it navigates the transition from desktop to mobile, where ads are generally less profitable, while facing growing competition from rivals like Facebook Inc (FB.O).At the same time, it is moving into a new corporate structure that will put more visibility on parts of Alphabet such as its secretive research arm, Google X.

""Search traffic on mobile phones have now surpassed desktop traffic worldwide,"" said Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google Inc.Shares of Alphabet rose almost 9 percent in after-hours trading to $741, easily a record. At that level, the company's market value would be around $500 billion, making it the second-most valuable company in the S&P 500 after Apple Inc (AAPL.O).On a strong day for technology companies, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) shares also rose sharply after hours, following better-than-expected results.      Analysts generally welcomed Alphabet's performance.""They seem to have a better hold on mobile and are navigating the transition to mobile usage better than expected,"" said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.Still, Cakmak questioned how Google's internet-based business  will fare in the long term in an app-based world. ""Their primary strength in apps is YouTube and that's pretty much it,"" he said. Investors have been pressing the company to return more of its $72 billion cash pile, but the announcement that Alphabet would buy back up to $5.09 billion of its Class C shares came as a surprise. Mature technology companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have come under intense pressure in recent years to give back more cash to investors.Third-quarter revenue rose 13 percent to $18.68 billion, above the $18.53 billion that Wall Street expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Excluding one-time items, the company earned $7.35 per share, up 17.6 percent from the year before. That was ahead of analysts' average estimate of $7.21 per share.Expenses rose 9.1 percent to $13.97 billion but were 74.7 percent of total revenue, compared to 77.4 percent in the same quarter last year, reflecting new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat's tight rein on spending.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), the new holding company for Google, has teamed up with three Indonesian telecommunications companies to expand Internet access in that country using solar-powered balloons.Alphabet officials, including co-founder Sergey Brin, and representatives from Indonesian companies Telkomsel, XL Axiata Tbk PT (EXCL.JK) and Indosat Tbk PT (ISAT.JK) signed an agreement Wednesday to bring so-called Project Loon to the nation of 250 million people.The project sends solar-powered balloons 16,000 feet (5,000 meters) into the air to deliver Internet access through radio frequency signals to antennae connected to buildings on the ground. The balloons use algorithms to find the best winds to carry them along their charted course.Project Loon is part of Alphabet's secretive X division, where the company experiments with far-off technologies dubbed ""moonshots"" such as its self-driving car technology.Alphabet and its partners will deploy hundreds of balloons in 2016 over the country of more than 17,000 islands in an effort to determine where gaps in service lie as part of the tests before full-scale service is launched. The U.S. tech company has already tested the project in Brazil, New Zealand and Australia but with only a single carrier.Project Loon Vice President Mike Cassidy said the Indonesian partnership marks the first time it will send signals from multiple telecommunications companies through a single balloon, and that it will be the service's largest deployment to date and could eventually reach 100 million users. ""We've been kind of having an increasing succession of tests: tests for getting balloon flights to work, tests to test connectivity. It's super exciting that this is going to serve actual communities,"" said Brin.He added that it is a cheaper way to offer Internet service, especially in areas that have ""jungles or where you have to reach islands,"" such as Indonesia.Cassidy said the effort is also a model for how Alphabet will move the product into the commercial market. He said the telecommunications companies will use the trial period to determine pricing and billing while Google works out technical issues. Indonesian President Joko Widodo was scheduled to attend the announcement on a trip to Silicon Valley that also included a stop at Apple, but he canceled this week to deal with a haze crisis at home stemming from smoldering forest fires.The visit aimed to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in tech investments into his nation, Southeast Asia's largest economy and the fourth-most-populous country in the world.

Google and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies that intend to make package delivery by drone a reality. But drone deliveries are not expected to take flight until after the FAA publishes final rules for commercial drone operations, which are expected early next year.Vos, who is co-chair of an FAA task force charged with coming up with a drone registry, said a system for identifying drone operators and keeping UAV away from other aircraft could be set up within 12 months. ""We're pretty much on a campaign here, working with the FAA, working with the small UAV community and the aviation community at large, to move things along,"" he said.""We think we can accomplish a lot in the next three, six, 12 months. And we're hoping to get some strong support to make this happen."" Vos said a drone registry, which the Obama administration hopes to set in place by Dec. 20, would be a first step toward a system that could use wireless telecommunications and Internet technology including cellphone applications to identify drones and keep UAV clear of other aircraft and controlled airspace.He said Google would like to see low altitude ""Class G"" airspace carved out for drones, saying it would keep UAV away from most manned aircraft aside from low-flying helicopters, while enabling drones to fly over highly populated areas.""There's a lot that can be done in this market space,"" Vos said.He said the FAA and other stakeholders are looking at the possibility of controlling Class G airspace through for-profit airspace service providers, which would use wireless communications to coordinate drone flights and liaise with the air traffic control system for manned aircraft.

Two years after initial research began, Project Wing was announced in August 2014 with a YouTube video showing a field test of its most viable prototype in Australia.The prototype flown in Australia, 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) wide and 0.8 meters (2.6 feet) tall, shares the same four-propeller quad copter design as popular consumer drones, but the company said consumers can expect to see new vehicle types and shapes as the project unfolds.Inside the United States, Project Wing has conducted testing with NASA. Vos, who is co-chair of an FAA task force charged with coming up with a drone registry, said a system for identifying drone operators and keeping UAV away from other aircraft could be set up within 12 months. ""We're pretty much on a campaign here, working with the FAA, working with the small UAV community and the aviation community at large, to move things along,"" he said. Vos said a drone registry, which the Obama administration hopes to set in place by Dec. 20, would be a first step toward a system that could use wireless telecommunications and Internet technology including cellphone applications to identify drones and keep UAV clear of other aircraft and controlled airspace.He said Google would like to see low altitude ""Class G"" airspace carved out for drones, saying it would keep UAV away from most manned aircraft aside from low-flying helicopters, while enabling drones to fly over highly populated areas.

The carrier says the move is so that it can make more tailored offers directly to customers.

1226,"  STOCKHOLM Swedish telecoms network gear maker Ericsson raised its forecast for mobile data traffic, in a further boost to companies that benefit from rising numbers of consumers viewing online videos on platforms such as YouTube and Netflix.      Ericsson, the world's top mobile network equipment maker, expects a tenfold surge in mobile data traffic globally between 2015 and 2021 as the number of smartphone subscriptions rise. In its mobile industry report in June it forecast that growth would be eightfold between 2014 and 2020. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, which invests in telecom and IT shares globally, said Ericsson is aiming to attract telecoms operators to invest in its networks by showing how much data traffic is expected to grow.     Heydorn said the inexorable rise in mobile data benefits telecoms operators more than it does Ericsson, which reported a 7 percent drop in sales this year despite the growth in smartphones.    But content providers, such as Netflix, Facebook and YouTube owner Google are the biggest winners from the increase in data traffic, he added.      Ericsson last week trimmed its market growth forecast for the next few years, indicating no clear correlation between mobile traffic and telecoms operators' investments.      ""Technology development and price pressure move faster than the increase in data traffic,"" said Bengt Nordstrom, head of telecoms consultancy Northstream.     YouTube accounts for up to 70 percent of all video traffic in many mobile networks, while Netflix's share of video traffic can reach up to 20 percent in markets where it is available, Ericsson said.      Video is expected to grow by around 55 percent annually through 2021, increasing its share of total mobile traffic in 2021 to 70 percent, up from around 50 percent in 2015, Ericsson said.       In it twice-yearly Mobility Report, Ericsson said it expected there to be 6.4 billion smartphone subscriptions globally by the end of 2021, up from 3.4 billion in 2015, due to greater affordability in developing markets.     It repeated its expectation that fifth-generation mobile telephony, which will facilitate self-driving cars, will be commercially deployed in 2020.     ""In 2021, South Korea, Japan, China and the U.S. are expected to have the fastest uptake of 5G subscriptions,"" Ericsson said, predicting 150 million 5G mobile subscriptions by 2021.     The new generation of mobile phone technology is expected not only to bring higher data speeds, but also to better accommodate a wide variety of connected devices.

In its mobile industry report in June it forecast that growth would be eightfold between 2014 and 2020.Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, which invests in telecom and IT shares globally, said Ericsson is aiming to attract telecoms operators to invest in its networks by showing how much data traffic is expected to grow.Heydorn said the inexorable rise in mobile data benefits telecoms operators more than it does Ericsson, which reported a 7 percent drop in sales this year despite the growth in smartphones. But content providers, such as Netflix, Facebook  and YouTube owner Google are the biggest winners from the increase in data traffic, he added.Ericsson last week trimmed its market growth forecast for the next few years, indicating no clear correlation between mobile traffic and telecoms operators' investments.""Technology development and price pressure move faster than the increase in data traffic,"" said Bengt Nordstrom, head of telecoms consultancy Northstream. YouTube accounts for up to 70 percent of all video traffic in many mobile networks, while Netflix's share of video traffic can reach up to 20 percent in markets where it is available, Ericsson said.Video is expected to grow by around 55 percent annually through 2021, increasing its share of total mobile traffic in 2021 to 70 percent, up from around 50 percent in 2015, Ericsson said. In it twice-yearly Mobility Report, Ericsson said it expected there to be 6.4 billion smartphone subscriptions globally by the end of 2021, up from 3.4 billion in 2015, due to greater affordability in developing markets.It repeated its expectation that fifth-generation mobile telephony, which will facilitate self-driving cars, will be commercially deployed in 2020.""In 2021, South Korea, Japan, China and the U.S. are expected to have the fastest uptake of 5G subscriptions,"" Ericsson said, predicting 150 million 5G mobile subscriptions by 2021.The new generation of mobile phone technology is expected not only to bring higher data speeds, but also to better accommodate a wide variety of connected devices.

1239,"  * Hackers use Dropbox, Google Drive for attacks* Other sophisticated tactics are hallmark of China, Russia* Some experts say China would have most to gain* HK police say drop in reported ""unauthorised access"" casesBy Clare Baldwin, James Pomfret and Jeremy WagstaffHONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Nov 30 Almost a year after students ended pro-democracy street protests in Hong Kong, they face an online battle against what Western security experts say are China-sponsored hackers using techniques rarely seen elsewhere.Hackers have expanded their attacks to parking malware on popular file-sharing services including Dropbox and Google Drive  to trap victims into downloading infected files and compromising sensitive information. They also use more sophisticated tactics, honing in on specific targets through so-called 'white lists' that only infect certain visitors to compromised websites.Security experts say such techniques are only used by sophisticated hackers from China and Russia, usually for surveillance and information extraction.The level of hacking is a sign, they say, of how important China views Hong Kong, where 79 days of protests late last year brought parts of the territory, a major regional financial hub, to a standstill. The scale of the protests raised concerns in Beijing about political unrest on China's periphery.""We're the most co-ordinated opposition group on Chinese soil, (and) have a reasonable assumption that Beijing is behind the hacking,"" said Lam Cheuk-ting, chief executive of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, which says it has been a victim of cyber attacks on its website and some members' email accounts.U.S.-based Internet security company FireEye said the attacks via Dropbox were aimed at ""precisely those whose networks Beijing would seek to monitor"", and could provide China with advance warning of protests and information on pro-democracy leaders. The company said half its customers in Hong Kong and Taiwan were attacked by government and professional hackers in the first half of this year - two and a half times the global average.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Public Security Bureau and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region did not respond to requests for comment. The Defence Ministry said the issue was not part of its remit. China has previously denied accusations of hacking, calling them groundless, and saying it is a victim. The Hong Kong police said its Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau works with other law enforcement agencies to combat cross-border crime, but did not respond to questions on how much information it shares with mainland Chinese authorities, the origin of the Hong Kong cyber attacks, or whether these might be a source of instability or concern.Police data show a drop in reported ""unauthorised access"", which includes Internet or email account abuse and hacking, over the past two years. Many of the victims Reuters spoke to said they hadn't bothered to report being hacked.SWITCHING TACTICS Like other groups taking on the might of Beijing - from Uighurs and exiled Tibetans to some Taiwanese - Hong Kong activists, academics and journalists have become more savvy and adopted tactics that, in turn, force hackers to get savvier still.When Tibetan exile groups stopped clicking on files attached to emails, to avoid falling victim to a common form of 'spear phishing' attack, hackers switched their malware to Google Drive, hoping victims would think these files were safer, said Citizen Lab, a Canada-based research organisation which works with Tibetans and other NGOs. Hackers also recently used Dropbox to lure Chinese language journalists in Hong Kong into downloading infected files. FireEye, which discovered the attack, said it was the first time it had seen this approach.""We don't have any arrogance to think we can beat them,"" said Mark Simon, senior executive at the parent company of Hong Kong's Apple Daily, a media group on the front line of the attacks.STRANGE WORDS Trying to stay ahead of the hackers, activists and others use multiple mobile phones with different SIM chips, encrypted messaging apps, apps that automatically delete tweets, and code words to set up meetings. If someone thinks they may be arrested, they remove themselves from group chats.

1240,"  * Hackers use Dropbox, Google Drive for attacks* Other sophisticated tactics are hallmark of China, Russia* Some experts say China would have most to gain* HK police say drop in reported ""unauthorised access"" cases   (Adds TV link.)By Clare Baldwin, James Pomfret and Jeremy WagstaffHONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Nov 30 Almost a year after students ended pro-democracy street protests in Hong Kong, they face an online battle against what Western security experts say are China-sponsored hackers using techniques rarely seen elsewhere.Hackers have expanded their attacks to parking malware on popular file-sharing services including Dropbox and Google Drive  to trap victims into downloading infected files and compromising sensitive information. They also use more sophisticated tactics, honing in on specific targets through so-called 'white lists' that only infect certain visitors to compromised websites.Security experts say such techniques are only used by sophisticated hackers from China and Russia, usually for surveillance and information extraction.The level of hacking is a sign, they say, of how important China views Hong Kong, where 79 days of protests late last year brought parts of the territory, a major regional financial hub, to a standstill. The scale of the protests raised concerns in Beijing about political unrest on China's periphery.""We're the most co-ordinated opposition group on Chinese soil, (and) have a reasonable assumption that Beijing is behind the hacking,"" said Lam Cheuk-ting, chief executive of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, which says it has been a victim of cyber attacks on its website and some members' email accounts.U.S.-based Internet security company FireEye said the attacks via Dropbox were aimed at ""precisely those whose networks Beijing would seek to monitor"", and could provide China with advance warning of protests and information on pro-democracy leaders. The company said half its customers in Hong Kong and Taiwan were attacked by government and professional hackers in the first half of this year - two and a half times the global average.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Public Security Bureau and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region did not respond to requests for comment. The Defence Ministry said the issue was not part of its remit. China has previously denied accusations of hacking, calling them groundless, and saying it is a victim. The Hong Kong police said its Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau works with other law enforcement agencies to combat cross-border crime, but did not respond to questions on how much information it shares with mainland Chinese authorities, the origin of the Hong Kong cyber attacks, or whether these might be a source of instability or concern.Police data show a drop in reported ""unauthorised access"", which includes Internet or email account abuse and hacking, over the past two years. Many of the victims Reuters spoke to said they hadn't bothered to report being hacked.SWITCHING TACTICS Like other groups taking on the might of Beijing - from Uighurs and exiled Tibetans to some Taiwanese - Hong Kong activists, academics and journalists have become more savvy and adopted tactics that, in turn, force hackers to get savvier still.When Tibetan exile groups stopped clicking on files attached to emails, to avoid falling victim to a common form of 'spear phishing' attack, hackers switched their malware to Google Drive, hoping victims would think these files were safer, said Citizen Lab, a Canada-based research organisation which works with Tibetans and other NGOs. Hackers also recently used Dropbox to lure Chinese language journalists in Hong Kong into downloading infected files. FireEye, which discovered the attack, said it was the first time it had seen this approach.""We don't have any arrogance to think we can beat them,"" said Mark Simon, senior executive at the parent company of Hong Kong's Apple Daily, a media group on the front line of the attacks.STRANGE WORDS Trying to stay ahead of the hackers, activists and others use multiple mobile phones with different SIM chips, encrypted messaging apps, apps that automatically delete tweets, and code words to set up meetings. If someone thinks they may be arrested, they remove themselves from group chats. Some things are kept offline.""If we want to talk, we have some signal,"" said Derek Lam, a member of student group Scholarism that helped organise the protests. ""It's a few words ... if I say some words that are really strange it means we have to talk somewhere privately.""Law professor and protest organizer Benny Tai stores personal data, such as names, email addresses and mobile numbers, on an external hard drive that he says he only accesses on a computer without an Internet connection.The pro-democracy Apple Daily, which says it is hacked on an almost weekly basis, has tightened its email security software, and has its lawyers use couriers rather than email.

1250,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Johnson & Johnson and Alphabet Inc's life sciences unit have formed an independent company to create far smaller, smarter and less costly robotic-assisted systems for surgery than those sold now by other companies, J&J said on Thursday.Creation of the new company, Verb Surgical Inc, follows an announcement in March by J&J and Google Inc of their plans to pool their technologies and expertise to create robotics for the operating room. Google has since changed its name to Alphabet, and its life sciences unit is now called Verily.J&J's Ethicon division, world leader in equipment for general surgery, designed a basic prototype of the robot last year and expects it to be a ""disruptive"" alternative to existing products, Gary Pruden, global chairman of J&J's medical devices group, said in an interview. Current robotic systems, including those sold by market leader Intuitive Surgical Inc, are the size of a compact car and require the surgeon to sit at a control panel about 10 feet from the patient, Pruden said.Verb's robot will be about 20 percent the size, allow the surgeon to work closer to the patient and likely be considerably less expensive than current systems, which can cost $2 million or more, he said. And while robots today are used largely to remove cancerous prostate glands and in gynecological surgery, Verb's system would be designed for wider use, including thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and bariatric weight loss procedures, J&J said.It would come loaded with technologies from Alphabet, including ""machine learning,"" in which the robot could analyze a video library of images from hundreds of previous surgeries in order to instruct the surgeon where to cut. Pruden said further development of Verb's robot will take a few more years. ""Our goal is to have a lower-cost product, with the smallest footprint, with greater capability, that helps to raise the standard of care,"" Pruden said. ""That would be a market disruption.""Scott Huennekens, former chief executive of medical imaging company Volcano Corp, has been named CEO of Verb, which will be headquartered in Mountain View, California. Verily already has several projects in the works, including the development of a smart contact lens in partnership with  Swiss drugmaker Novartis that has an embedded glucose sensor.

1256,"  (Corrects name of Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio in paragraph 3)By David RandallNEW YORK Dec 22 Top stock-picking fund managers won 2015 by aiming for brand name companies and avoiding the sector bets that brought down biotech and energy investors.Now, as they look ahead to 2016, these active investors expect to be even more defensive, picking companies like Hersheys Co and General Electric that they say will be able to weather the combination of slow global growth and the first U.S. interest rate hike in a nearly decade.""We're looking for companies that have some competitive advantage that makes them the standard in their industry,"" said Dennis Lynch, a co-portfolio manager of both the Morgan Stanley Institutional Advantage fund and the Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio fund - the fifth and sixth best performing large cap funds of this year with returns of 11.5 percent through Monday's close.Lynch's Institutional Advantage fund, for instance, added positions in consumer companies including Hershey, Estee Lauder Companies Inc and Colgate-Palmolive Co in the quarter ending Sept. 30.These types of consumer companies with strong brands tend to withstand volatile markets, Lynch said. At the same time, he trimmed positions in top holdings Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc that rallied this year. Other active fund managers that are looking for big names with lots of downside protection in 2015 include Daniel Davidowitz, co-portfolio manager of the $804 million Polen Growth fund - the year's top performer in the large cap category - and Douglas Rao, portfolio manager of the $2.4 billion Janus Forty fund.""There's a lot of noise and volatility in the market right now, and we're in the position of trying to find companies that are less sensitive to the macro environment,"" said Rao.Rao's fund gained 10.7 percent for the year through Monday, a performance that was the 10th best among large-cap funds tracked by Lipper during a time when only 24 percent of large-cap funds have been able to outperform the 0.1 percent gain in the index this year, according to Lipper data.Much of Rao's performance came from his top holding, Google parent Alphabet Inc, which has gained 44 percent for the year to date, and Amazon, which more than doubled this year and accounts for his 8th-largest position. Yet Rao is not searching for the next stock to hit out the lights in 2016. Instead, he expects GE to once again outperform in the coming year as it sheds its GE Capital assets faster than analysts expect and turns more of its focus to segments such as expanding its line of industrial software.""The fact is that we have an opportunity to build a position in what we think will be a best of breed industrial company during a period where the U.S. is going through an industrial recession,"" he said. 'WHEN THE SEAS GET ROUGH' The Polen fund is aiming straight at all-weather stocks: All  20 companies in its portfolio generate high levels of cash flow, return 20 percent or more on capital and show increasing profit margins and organic revenue growth.Along with Facebook, Adobe was the only company Davidowitz added this year to his portfolio, which bested all large-cap funds tracked by Lipper with a gain of 13.4 percent through Monday.

1257,"  (Adds background on Google's and automakers' self-driving car efforts, Krafcik comments)By Joseph WhiteDETROIT Jan 12 Alphabet Inc's Google  wants to form more partnerships with established automakers and suppliers this year to accelerate its work on self-driving cars, the head of the Google project said on Tuesday.John Krafcik, the newly hired president of the Google self-driving car project, did not mention any automakers by name. However, appearing at a media conference at the Detroit auto show, Krafcik surveyed a room packed with hundreds of auto industry executives and said: ""We hope to work with many of you guys."" Google officials have said previously the internet search company does not want to build vehicles, but instead supply the software and mapping to allow a car to safely navigate busy streets and highways.""No one goes this alone,"" Krafcik said. ""We are going to be partnering more and more and more."" He said he hopes to form more alliances this year. Google has worked with automotive suppliers and contract manufacturers to build a small fleet of prototype self-driving cars - small, light pod-cars that look nothing like the sport utility vehicles and pickups on display at the Detroit show.Google, major global automakers and several auto technology companies such as Delphi Automotive Plc, Continental AG  and Mobileye NV are jockeying to define and lead development of vehicles that use machine vision, sophisticated maps and artificial intelligence to take over for error-prone human drivers. Krafcik said he believed partially automating the operation of a car, requiring drivers to take command under certain conditions, can create safety problems, a key point on which Google and most automakers differ.The car ""has to shoulder the whole burden,"" he said.Most automakers, including General Motors Co, Tesla Motors Inc, Daimler AG, and Nissan Motor Co, are pushing to get cars on the road that allow hands-free driving under certain conditions, but require the driver to take over in more complex situations such as city driving.

1258,"   By Joseph White | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chairman Bill Ford said on Monday the automaker is open to more than one approach to building its businesses based on mobile internet connections and alternatives to traditional car ownership, including mergers and acquisitions, partnerships and going it alone.“M&A may be a part of what we do, so could partnerships and so could proprietary” efforts the automaker undertakes on its own, Ford told Reuters in an interview at the Detroit auto show.“We are in an experimental stage,” Ford said. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields, in a separate interview, also said the automaker is exploring various options to boost its move into car-sharing, self-driving technology and services built on staying connected with customers during the 900 or so hours a year they are behind the wheel. Neither Ford nor Fields would comment on speculation that Ford is pursuing some form of alliance with internet leader Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google to collaborate on development of self-driving cars, or what the industry calls autonomous vehicles.Ford is pursuing its own efforts to develop autonomous driving technology, and said last week it would triple the size of its self-driving car test fleet to 30 vehicles.“The technology may be ready before society is,” the chairman said, referring to autonomous cars.  As the U.S. No. 2 automaker builds its new mobility and connected vehicle businesses, Ford the chairman said his company may consider new management structures. The automaker’s capital-intensive core business of building cars and trucks operates with different rates of return on investment, and different levels of risk, from investing in rapidly changing technologies or service businesses.  Ford’s previous CEO, Alan Mulally, pushed the automaker to operate as “One Ford,” with executives from different operations meeting weekly to share information and resolve problems. ""We’ve managed ourselves well with One Ford,” said the chairman. ""We want make sure we do this thoughtfully and not create separate companies that aren’t aligned.” (Reporting By Joseph White; Editing by Bill Rigby)",2016-01-12,GOOGL,"Mon Jan 11, 2016 | 7:07pm EST",Ford Chairman: 'We are in an experimental stage',http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autoshow-detroit-billford-idUSKCN0UQ00P20160112?type=companyNews
1259,"   By Anya George Tharakan  Rupert Murdoch's News Corp said rumors about the company's interest in buying microblogging site Twitter Inc or building a stake in it were untrue.Twitter's shares, which rose as much as 14 percent on Wednesday, pared some gains and closed up 4.1 percent at $17.38.The stock rose from a record low after unconfirmed chatter about News Corp's interest in Twitter circulated on Wednesday. The rumors intensified after a CNBC segment, tech website Re/code said.The social media site was evaluated as a takeover target because of the company's shrinking stock price, Re/code said. (on.recode.net/1QeVuHw) In the few months since co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as the chief executive, Twitter has been trying to make the site more engaging. The company said in December it was testing a feature to show ads to people who read tweets without logging in as it tries to monetize non-active users.  ""Twitter inside a larger organization definitely makes theoretical sense, whether its another internet company or a media company,"" Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co Inc analyst James Cakmak said.A News Corp spokesman said there was no truth to the rumors.Twitter already has several high-profile investors. Former Microsoft Corp CEO Steve Ballmer reported a 4 percent stake in October, making him the third-biggest shareholder after Twitter co-founder Evan Williams and Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Twitter has been the subject of takeover rumors in the past, including a fake report attributed to Bloomberg that claimed the company had received an offer to be acquired for $31 billion.

1261,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Google has agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($185 million) in back taxes to Britain, prompting criticism from opposition lawmakers and campaigners who said the ""derisory"" figure smacked of a ""sweetheart deal"".Google, now part of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), has been under pressure in recent years over its practice of channeling most profits from European clients through Ireland to Bermuda, where it pays no tax on them.In 2013, the company faced a UK parliamentary inquiry after a Reuters investigation showed the firm employed hundreds of salespeople in Britain despite saying it did not conduct sales in the country, a key plank in its tax arrangements.Google said late on Friday the 130 million pounds would settle a probe by the British tax authority, which had challenged the company’s low tax returns for the years since 2005. It said it had also agreed a basis on which tax in the future would be calculated.""The way multinational companies are taxed has been debated for many years and the international tax system is changing as a result. This settlement reflects that shift,"" a Google spokesman said in a statement.The deal comes as governments around the world seek to clamp down on multinational companies shifting profits overseas to reduce their tax bills.  EU competition authorities have investigated arrangements used by Amazon (AMZN.O) and a unit of Fiat (FCAU.N) in Luxembourg, Apple (AAPL.O) in Ireland and Starbucks (SBUX.O) in the Netherlands, and may start new probes.British finance minister George Osborne welcomed the deal, saying on Twitter it reflected new rules that he had introduced, but others were less impressed. John McDonnell, finance spokesman for the opposition Labour party, said the tax authorities needed to explain how they had settled on the figure of 130 million pounds, which he described as relatively insignificant. ""It looks to me ... that this is relatively trivial in comparison with what should have been made, in fact one analysis has put the rate down to about 3 percent, which I think is derisory,"" he told BBC Radio on Saturday.   ""This looks like another sweetheart deal."" Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at Essex University, agreed. He said that for a company that enjoyed UK turnover of around 24 billion pounds over the period and margins of 30 percent, the settlement represented an effective tax rate in the low single digits for Google. “This is a lousy number and we need to know more,” he said.    Richard Murphy, a tax expert who has advised the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on economic policy, said the deal was “a disaster” and that, based on the turnover and margins Google enjoyed, “They should have been paying 200 million pounds a year.”Between 2005 and 2013, Google had UK turnover of 17 billion pounds and its main UK unit reported a tax charge of 52 million pounds, filings showed. In 2014, it had UK revenues of around 4 billion pounds, according to its annual report, but has not yet  published its UK tax charge.(This version of the story corrects spelling of Prem Sikka) (Additional reporting by Steve Trousdale in San Francisco and Kate Holton in London; Editing by Dale Hudson)",2016-01-23,GOOGL,"Sat Jan 23, 2016 | 10:13am EST","Google to pay $185 million UK back taxes, critics want more",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alphabet-tax-idUSKCN0V02NG?type=companyNews

1265,"   By Deborah M. Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google's secretive drone delivery project could include a component designed to store packages securely.A patent filed Tuesday in the United States by the company, a unit of Alphabet Inc, describes a ""delivery receptacle"" designed to take packages from an ""aerial delivery device"" for deposit to a secure location. The receptacle would use infrared beacons to connect with drones in the air and then guide them for delivery. The delivery receptacle would then take the package to a safe location such as a garage, according to the patent. The patent did not provide any details on the nature of the delivery receptacle.A spokesman for the company's Google X research arm declined comment.    The filing provides a glimpse into a plan Google has been exploring since 2012. The project's leader, Dave Vos, said last November it could start delivering packages by 2017.Dubbed 'Project Wing', the initiative was announced in August 2014 with a YouTube video showing a field test conducted in Australia. In the United States, the company has conducted testing with NASA's AMES Research Center.    Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies that are trying to make package delivery by drones a reality. But drone deliveries are not expected to take flight until after the Federal Aviation Administration publishes final rules for commercial drone operations, expected this year.An FAA task force on drones has initiated a system requiring anyone who owns drones heavier than half a pound and lighter than 55 pounds to register before flying outdoors. By early January, 181,061 drones were registered.  Vos, who is co-chair of the task force, said during a Consumer Electronics Show workshop earlier this month that existing regulations are sufficient to allow the operation of drones.  ""I would advocate strongly that the need for additional regulation is very, very small. That in fact, if you allow people to do things and replicate what manned aviation pilots in this airspace do it already works,"" he said. ""We don't need new regulation, we need to just be allowed to go do it,"" Vos said.  (Editing by Stephen R.

1266,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON British Prime Minister David Cameron came under increasing pressure on Wednesday over a back tax deal agreed by Internet group Google that was hailed by his finance minister as a major success but dismissed as ""derisory"" by the opposition Labour Party.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged Cameron to defend the deal, which he said represented a tax rate of just 3 percent on 6 billion pounds ($8.5 billion) of profits that Google, now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, has earned in Britain since 2005.""Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary small businesses and self-employed workers?"", he asked the prime minister in his weekly parliamentary question session.Cameron did not comment on the 130 million-pound settlement, which covers 2005 to 2015 and which brings the company’s total tax bill to around 200 million pounds for the period, during which it had UK revenues of around 24 billion pounds. However, he said he had been genuinely angry over Google’s failure to pay much tax, adding that this largely occurred when Labour was in power from 1997 to 2010.""We’ve done more on tax evasion and tax avoidance than Labour ever did,"" he said. Finance minister George Osborne, seen as a possible successor to Cameron, has said the settlement was ""a victory for the action we've taken"" against corporate profit-shifting. Google has said it paid all the tax that was due. It says it declares little profit in the UK because most of its profits are derived from innovations invented in the United States.""We pay tax based on the value added by the economic activity of our staff here,"" a Google spokesman said.Profits from European sales are reported in Bermuda, which has a zero tax rate. Domestic media have roundly criticized the tax deal and even vociferous opponents of Corbyn such as the tabloid Sun have backed Labour on the issue.Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc[NWSNA.UL], criticized the deal, tweeting that ""Google et al broke no tax laws. Now paying token amounts for p r purposes. Won't work. Need strong new laws to pay like the rest of us.""His tweets set off a Twitter storm, with others criticizing Murdoch for meetings with the Conservatives, wondering about the taxes paid by Murdoch's companies, and even referring to some of the reporting tactics at his papers. ""Can't you get some journalists on this instead of hacking celebrities' phones and the like,"" tweeted a user under the handle @tradercoach.Tax avoidance has become a hot political issue in Britain, where people question whether the burden of fixing the public finances has been fairly shared.Since the deal was announced on Friday, Labour has called for an investigation by the National Audit Office, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has said it will investigate the deal and the Treasury Committee said it would examine the whole corporate tax system.Google said it was prepared to testify at the PAC hearing, the date for which has yet to be confirmed.

1270,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Jan 27 British Prime Minister David Cameron came under increasing pressure on Wednesday over a back tax deal agreed by Internet group Google that was hailed by his finance minister as a major success but dismissed as ""derisory"" by the opposition Labour Party.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn challenged Cameron to defend the deal, which he said represented a tax rate of just 3 percent on 6 billion pounds ($8.5 billion) of profits that Google, now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, has earned in Britain since 2005.""Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary small businesses and self-employed workers?"", he asked the prime minister in his weekly parliamentary question session.Cameron did not comment on the 130 million pound settlement which covers 2005 to 2015 and which brings the company's total tax bill to around 200 million pounds for the period, during which it had UK revenues of around 24 billion pounds.However, he said he had been genuinely angry over Google's failure to pay much tax, adding that this largely occurred when Labour was in power from 1997 to 2010. ""We've done more on tax evasion and tax avoidance than Labour ever did,"" he said.Finance minister George Osborne, seen as a possible successor to Cameron, has said the settlement was ""a victory for the action we've taken"" against corporate profit-shifting. Google has said it paid all the tax that was due. It says it declares little profit in the UK because most of its profits are derived from innovations invented in the United States.""We pay tax based on the value added by the economic activity of our staff here,"" a Google spokesman said.Profits from European sales are reported in Bermuda, which has a zero tax rate. Domestic media have roundly criticized the tax deal and even vociferous opponents of Corbyn such as the tabloid Sun have backed Labour on the issue.Tax avoidance has become a hot political issue in Britain, where people question whether the burden of fixing the public finances has been fairly shared.Since the deal was announced on Friday, Labour has called for an investigation by the National Audit Office, the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has said it will investigate the deal, and the Treasury Committee said it would examine the whole corporation tax system.Google said it was prepared to testify at the PAC hearing, the date for which has yet to be confirmed.

1271,"   By Deborah M. Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google's secretive drone delivery project could include a component designed to store packages securely.A patent filed Tuesday in the United States by the company, a unit of Alphabet Inc, describes a ""delivery receptacle"" designed to take packages from an ""aerial delivery device"" for deposit to a secure location. The receptacle would use infrared beacons to connect with drones in the air and then guide them for delivery. The delivery receptacle would then take the package to a safe location such as a garage, according to the patent. The patent did not provide any details on the nature of the delivery receptacle.A spokesman for the company's Google X research arm declined comment.    The filing provides a glimpse into a plan Google has been exploring since 2012. The project's leader, Dave Vos, said last November it could start delivering packages by 2017.Dubbed 'Project Wing', the initiative was announced in August 2014 with a YouTube video showing a field test conducted in Australia. In the United States, the company has conducted testing with NASA's AMES Research Center.    Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies that are trying to make package delivery by drones a reality. But drone deliveries are not expected to take flight until after the Federal Aviation Administration publishes final rules for commercial drone operations, expected this year.An FAA task force on drones has initiated a system requiring anyone who owns drones heavier than half a pound and lighter than 55 pounds to register before flying outdoors. By early January, 181,061 drones were registered.  Vos, who is co-chair of the task force, said during a Consumer Electronics Show workshop earlier this month that existing regulations are sufficient to allow the operation of drones.  ""I would advocate strongly that the need for additional regulation is very, very small. That in fact, if you allow people to do things and replicate what manned aviation pilots in this airspace do it already works,"" he said. ""We don't need new regulation, we need to just be allowed to go do it,"" Vos said.  (Editing by Stephen R.

1276,"  SYDNEY Internet search giant Google has added Australian slang and language recognition to its applications, addressing complaints that its software had difficulty in understanding thick local accents and complex place names.Long accustomed to having their distinctive slang misunderstood, Australians can now substitute ""footy"" for football, ""arvo"" for afternoon and find directions to Mullumbimby or Goondiwindi, a spokesman told Reuters on Friday.The extended vocabulary came after Google, which is now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, added an Australian accented voice to its Google Maps and search applications last week.""People are starting to talk to their phones much more regularly now. Mobile voice searchers have doubled in the last year,"" Google Australia spokesman Shane Treeves said. ""Particularly all those tricky Aussie place names, they just sound much better in an Aussie voice that can get them right."" Google and its chief competitor, Apple Inc, have saturated the United States and Western Europe with their devices, leaving foreign language markets as some of the prime places to grow.In December, Apple released a version of its virtual personal assistant, Siri, for Arabic speakers in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Google's Android phones' search function already offered some support in Arabic. Google's Android operating system was used by roughly 54 percent of mobile devices sold in Australia in December, placing it ahead of Apple iOS at 38 percent, according to data published by research firm Kantar Worldpanel.The addition of Australian language features to Google's software could carry with it a sense of vindication for local users, who have long groused about its inability to understand them. In 2004, Google bought mapping company Where 2 Technologies, which formed the basis for its hugely popular Google Maps software. The company was based in Sydney.

The market has wanted four things from Alphabet: consistent revenue growth, margin stabilization, greater disclosure and share buybacks, and they will get all of them this quarter, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.The reading may not be pretty.A Raymond James survey showed that 72 percent of investors expect ""Other Bets"" lost more than $1.5 billion in 2015. ""We believe revenues from Other Bets will be fairly immaterial for Alphabet given the early stages of most of these businesses,"" Raymond James analysts wrote in a note.To be sure, almost all of Alphabet's revenue comes from its Google unit.The unit houses its Internet and related businesses such as search, ads, maps, YouTube and Android as well as hardware products such as its Chromebooks. Google's revenue has been bolstered by its efforts to drive sales from its mobile and video advertising as well as Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat's increased discipline on expenses.Ad sales to mobile users is going to be the main driver to Google's results, just as it was at Facebook.Analysts on average are expecting Alphabet's profit to rise to $8.10 per share from $6.88 and revenue to rise 14.7 percent to $20.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Alphabet shares closed at $761.35 on Friday, valuing the company at about $517 billion, 4.4 percent shy of Apple's valuation of about $540 billion.

Revenue for Other Bets was $151 million, up 29.8 percent from $106 million in the same quarter last year, primarily from its smart-home monitoring unit Nest, Google Fiber, which provides high-speed Internet access, and its life sciences business Verily.Adjusted earnings of $8.67 per share handily beat analysts' average estimate of $8.10 per share.In a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat attributed the strong earnings to ""increased use of mobile search by consumers,"" as well as ""ongoing momentum"" in YouTube and programmatic advertising, referring to the automatic buying of ads. Kelly at Recon Capital said he would not be surprised if YouTube saw a surge in advertising revenues beyond the 17 percent increase it saw during the 2015 fiscal year. Total operating losses on the Other Bets – which include glucose-monitoring contact lenses and Internet balloons - increased to $3.57 billion in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter.

Microsoft in turn eclipsed International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) two decades ago. It is not without piquancy for Apple and Alphabet, which worked hand-in-hand to develop mobile computing, but fell out bitterly after Google launched its own Android mobile operating system in 2008. Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt left Apple's board the following year.The two companies' operating systems and apps are in direct competition with each other and Apple is still in litigation with Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), the biggest Android smartphone maker.Alphabet shares jumped 6 percent on Monday after reporting strong quarterly earnings after the bell, making its combined share classes worth $554 billion, compared with Apple, which had a value of about $534 billion. Apple shares dipped last week after reporting the slowest-ever increase in iPhone shipments and forecasting its first revenue drop in 13 years. Alphabet will officially overtake Apple in market value if the two companies' shares open around current levels on Tuesday. The Internet powerhouse's stock has surged in the last year, helped by increasing sales of advertising on mobile devices, while Apple has struggled due to signs of softening demand for its signature phone, especially in China, and the lack of another blockbuster product in its pipeline.""This makes Alphabet an even stronger bellwether for investors to watch,"" Scott Fullman, chief strategist at Revere Securities Corp, after the earnings on Monday. ""The company has been tracking very well given the volatility in the market, dominated by falling energy prices and weakness from China.""  The latest spurt in Alphabet’s stock price growth started around July last year. Since then the company has restructured, forming a new holding company and splitting into two parts. Google includes its search engine, YouTube and related parts of the company, while a unit called 'Other Bets' includes its 'moonshots' such as self-driving cars, and encompasses Google Capital, the secretive X research division and Nest, which offers smart-home accessories.Investors have appreciated the company’s new discipline on costs, which started with the arrival of new Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat. For a time it looked as if Apple would never relinquish the top spot in terms of market value. Bolstered by success of the iPhone, an enormous cash hoard, Apple took over the top U.S. spot in 2012 from Exxon Mobil, and at one point in early 2015 was worth more than $760 billion. Alphabet shares are much more expensive, relatively speaking, than Apple's, trading around 38 times earnings for the last 12 months, compared to about 11 times for Apple. Alphabet pays no dividend, whereas Apple's dividend currently yields about 2 percent of the stock's value annually. Alphabet's move into the top spot makes it the 12th company to be recognized as the largest publicly traded U.S. name since 1928, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Past No. 1 names include General Electric, General Motors and IBM. (Additional reporting by Stephen R.

Revenue for Other Bets was $151 million, up 29.8 percent from $106 million in the same quarter last year, primarily from its smart-home monitoring unit Nest, Google Fiber, which provides high-speed Internet access, and its life sciences business Verily.Adjusted earnings of $8.67 per share handily beat analysts' average estimate of $8.10 per share.In a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat attributed the strong earnings to ""increased use of mobile search by consumers,"" as well as ""ongoing momentum"" in YouTube and programmatic advertising, referring to the automatic buying of ads. Kelly at Recon Capital said he would not be surprised if YouTube saw a surge in advertising revenues beyond the 17 percent increase it saw during the 2015 fiscal year. Total operating losses on the Other Bets – which include glucose-monitoring contact lenses and Internet balloons - increased to $3.57 billion in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, and $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The Google unit houses its Internet and related businesses such as search, ads, maps, YouTube and Android as well as hardware products such as its low-cost Chromebook laptops.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on the call that its Gmail service crossed one billion monthly active users last quarter, joining Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube and Google Play in topping that mark.He also touted the company's performance during the holiday shopping season, saying that programmatic video impressions doubled this season compared to last, and that 60 percent of them came from mobile devices.But Porat, without providing figures, said the company planned to accelerate capital expenditures in 2016 compared to the previous year. Google's shares rose almost 5 percent in after-hours trading. Alphabet's combined share classes were worth $549 billion, compared with Apple, which had a value of about $534 billion.Alphabet will officially overtake Apple in market value if both companies' shares open around current levels on Tuesday.Google's advertising revenue increased nearly 17 percent to $19.08 billion, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 31 percent, the company said. Analysts had expected paid clicks to increase 21.8 percent.Advertisers pay Google only if someone clicks on their ad.Net income in the fourth quarter rose to $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, from $4.68 billion, or $6.79 per share.

1287,"  HONG KONG Feb 3 The world's largest personal computer (PC) maker Lenovo Group Ltd said on Wednesday its third-quarter revenue fell 8 percent to $12.9 billion due to slower global PC demand and weaker smartphone sales.The company said net profit reached $300 million, from $253 million in the same period a year prior.The results compared with the average $13.21 billion revenue and $237.7 million net profit estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates. Beijing-based Lenovo continued to consolidate its hold on the slowing PC market. Its PC shipments fell 4.2 percent during the quarter versus 8.3 percent in the broader industry, with growth strong in North America, according to market researcher Gartner. Lenovo in 2014 made two multi-billion-dollar acquisitions to diversify away from the shrinking PC market. It bought Alphabet Inc's Motorola handset unit and International Business Machines Corp's low-end server business.

Google's self-driving car unit on Nov. 12 submitted a proposed design for a self-driving car that has ""no need for a human driver,"" the letter to Google from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Chief Counsel Paul Hemmersbaugh said.""NHTSA will interpret 'driver' in the context of Google's described motor vehicle design as referring to the (self-driving system), and not to any of the vehicle occupants,"" NHTSA's letter said.  ""We agree with Google its (self-driving car) will not have a 'driver' in the traditional sense that vehicles have had drivers during the last more than one hundred years."" Major automakers and technology companies such as Google are racing to develop and sell vehicles that can drive themselves at least part of the time. All participants in the autonomous driving race complain that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and eventual deployment of such vehicles. California has proposed draft rules requiring steering wheels and a licensed driver in all self-driving cars.Karl Brauer, senior analyst for the Kelley Blue Book automotive research firm, said there were still significant legal questions surrounding autonomous vehicles. But if ""NHTSA is prepared to name artificial intelligence as a viable alternative to human-controlled vehicles, it could substantially streamline the process of putting autonomous vehicles on the road,"" he said.If the car's computer is the driver for legal purposes, then it clears the way for Google or automakers to design vehicle systems that communicate directly with the vehicle's artificial pilot. In its response to Google, the federal agency offered its most comprehensive map yet of the legal obstacles to putting fully autonomous vehicles on the road. It noted existing regulations requiring some auto safety equipment can not be waived immediately, including requirements for braking systems activated by foot control.""The next question is whether and how Google could certify that the (self-driving system) meets a standard developed and designed to apply to a vehicle with a human driver,"" NHTSA said. Google is ""still evaluating"" NHTSA's lengthy response, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday. Google executives have said they would likely partner with established automakers to build self-driving cars.WORRIES ABOUT PEOPLE UNDERMINING SAFETY Google told NHTSA that the real danger is having auto safety features that could tempt humans to try to take control. Google ""expresses concern that providing human occupants of the vehicle with mechanisms to control things like steering, acceleration, braking... could be detrimental to safety because the human occupants could attempt to override the (self-driving system's) decisions,"" the NHTSA letter stated.NHTSA's Hemmersbaugh said federal regulations requiring equipment like steering wheels and brake pedals would have to be formally rewritten before Google could offer cars without those features.For example, current federal rules require alerts on dashboards if tire pressure runs low. NHTSA said a test would need to be created that shows the vehicle computer is informed of the problem. NHTSA raised the question of whether humans in the vehicles should also be made aware.In January, NHTSA said it may waive some vehicle safety rules to allow more driverless cars to operate on U.S. roads as part of a broader effort to speed up development of self-driving vehicles.NHTSA said then it would write guidelines for self-driving cars within six months. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the administration may seek new legal authority to allow deployment of autonomous vehicles ""in large numbers,"" when they are deemed safe, the department said.The process of rewriting federal regulations governing the design, placement and operation of vehicle controls could take months or years.

1294,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Google (GOOGL.O) will start scrubbing search results across all its websites when accessed from a European country to soothe the objections of Europe's privacy regulators to its implementation of a landmark EU ruling, a person close to the company said.The U.S. company has been at loggerheads with several European Union data protection authorities since the European Court of Justice ruled in May 2014 that people could ask search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing (MSFT.O) to remove inadequate or irrelevant information that appears under searches for their name - dubbed the ""right to be forgotten"".The French data protection authority in September threatened to fine Google if it did not scrub search results globally across all versions of its website, such as Google.com.But the company has stuck to its position that it should clean up search results only on European domains such as Google.fr or Google.de because to do otherwise would have a chilling effect on the free flow of information.To address the concerns of European authorities, the Internet giant will soon start polishing search results across all its websites when someone conducts a search from the country where the removal request originated, a person close to the company said. That means that if a German resident asks Google to de-list a link popping up under searches for his or her name, the link will not be visible on any version of Google's website, including Google.com, when the search engine is accessed from Germany.The company will filter search results according to a user's IP address, meaning people accessing Google from outside Europe will not be affected, the person added. Since the ruling in 2014, Google has received 386,038 requests for removal, according to its transparency website. It has accepted about 42 percent of them.The company has notified all EU data protection authorities of the upcoming changes.A spokeswoman for Britain’s data protection watchdog said the change proposed by Google appeared to address concerns it had previously expressed “on the scope of the requirement to de-list”. A spokeswoman for the French CNIL - which chairs a working group of EU privacy regulators - said authorities had been informed of Google's plans, which showed that the ""issue of territorial scope requires careful thought.""""These elements are currently the object of an inquiry by the services of the CNIL,"" she said.

1296,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON UK lawmakers accused Google on Thursday of trying to fool Britons into believing it was a proponent of tax reform while remaining a prime beneficiary of loopholes in existing rules, and said if it was sincere the company would be more  transparent over its tax affairs.Google's president for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Matt Brittin, told the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee that the company had paid all the tax that it should but wanted the international tax system reformed.But Stewart Jackson, a Conservative member of the committee,  questioned claims that the company was trying to be open about its affairs and supported a rewriting of antiquated tax rules which allow it to shift its profits into Bermuda.“You sort of pose as an enlightened helper to the public debate ... And that the wicked awful tax system across the world somehow just happened to Google, whereas actually you’ve made a choice to avoid tax and set up structures specifically so to do,” he said.Brittin was appearing before the committee for the third time in four years, just weeks after Google had announced a controversial 130 million-pound ($187 million) backtax deal with the UK. News of the deal met with a public outcry, with critics saying the payment of 130 million pounds to cover the last 10 years of earnings was too little, even though finance minister George Osborne initially described the settlement as a major success for the government's work on tackling tax avoidance.The opposition Labour party and some members of Osborne's own Conservative party criticized the settlement, which brought Google’s total tax bill for 2005 to 2015 to around 200 million pounds whereas its UK revenues amounted to 24 billion pounds.Tom Hutchinson, Google's vice president for tax, also told the committee the dispute with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) reflected the complexity of tax law, rather than any attempt not to pay the right amount and that this was echoed in the fact the settlement included no penalty. Google pays an effective tax rate of around 5 percent on non-U.S. profits by channeling earnings from clients in EMEA and Asia into a Bermuda-based, Irish registered company, a Reuters analysis of company filings shows. Meg Hillier, a Labour member of parliament and chair of the committee, said Google should follow the examples of companies like Norway's Statoil and UK bank Barclays which itemize their earnings and tax payments by country.  The European Union is debating whether to make such country-by-country reporting mandatory across all industry sectors.In the course of increasingly heated questioning on Thursday, Hillier asked Brittin several times to say how much he was paid.He declined, saying he didn't know the exact figure but would provide the figure to the committee later, prompting laughter.

Meanwhile, tax authorities in some countries, including  Italy, are also trying to use existing tax rules to force companies to pay more tax on the profits generated by sales in their countries.In response to a request for comment on the investigation, Google said in a statement, ""Google complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate.

It made the same statement in response to reports last month that the Italian authorities were accusing the company of evading paying 227 million euros in taxes between 2009 and 2013.

Finance police also suspect the company should have disclosed some 600 million euros of royalties which would have led to a tax demand for some 200 million euros.During a parliamentary hearing in London on Thursday, Google declined to confirm Italy's tax claims and a similar discussion in France.  Google has based its regional headquarters in Dublin, where corporate tax rates are much lower than in Italy.

1299,"  MILAN Feb 11 Italian prosecutors are investigating at least three managers at Alphabet Inc's Google  as part of a probe into the company's suspected evasion of taxes worth 227 million euros ($257 million), investigative sources said on Thursday.Lawmakers across Europe are looking for ways to change tax rules which allow multinationals to shift untaxed profits into low-tax jurisdictions.Meanwhile, tax authorities in some countries, including  Italy, are also trying to use existing tax rules to force companies to pay more tax on the profits generated by sales in their countries.In response to a request for comment on the investigation, Google said in a statement, ""Google complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities.""It made the same statement in response to reports last month that the Italian authorities were accusing the company of evading paying 227 million euros in taxes between 2009 and 2013. The individuals under investigation by a prosecutor in Milan sit on the board of Google Ireland, the company's regional base, the sources said.Italy believes the company failed to declare some 100 million euros in revenues over five years which would have fallen into a 27 percent corporate tax bracket, investigative sources said in January. Finance police also suspect the company should have disclosed some 600 million euros of royalties which would have led to a tax demand for some 200 million euros.During a parliamentary hearing in London on Thursday, Google declined to confirm Italy's tax claims and a similar discussion in France. Google has based its regional headquarters in Dublin, where corporate tax rates are much lower than in Italy.

1301,"   By Toby Sterling and Tom Bergin | AMSTERDAM/LONDON  AMSTERDAM/LONDON Google moved 10.7 billion euros ($12 billion) through the Netherlands to Bermuda in 2014, as part of a structure which allows it to earn most of its foreign income tax free.Accounts for Google Netherlands Holdings BV published on Thursday show the unit transferred almost all its revenue, mainly royalties from an Irish affiliate through which most non-U.S. revenue is channeled, to a Bermuda-based, Irish-registered affiliate called Google Ireland Holdings.The tax strategy is known to accountants as the ""double Irish, Dutch Sandwich'. It allows Google, now part of holding company Alphabet Inc, to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes or European withholding taxes on the funds, which represent the bulk of the group's overseas profits.A Google spokesman said the company follows the tax rules in all the countries where it operates. The decade-old arrangement allowed Alphabet to enjoy an effective tax rate of just 6 percent on its non-U.S. profits last year, around a quarter the average tax rate in its overseas markets.Bermuda charges companies no income tax. Corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the political agenda in European in recent years and Google in particular has been under pressure for the low tax it pays on profits generated from sales in the continent.Last week Google was called to testify to a UK parliamentary committee about a 130 million pounds ($186 million) back tax bill, agreed with the British tax authority in January, that the Opposition Labour party described as ""derisory"". The deal brought Google’s total British tax bill for 2005 to 2015 to around 200 million pounds, whereas its UK revenue amounted to 24 billion pounds.Google Netherlands Holdings NV, which has no employees, had a Dutch tax bill of just 2.8 million euros, its accounts showed. (Reporting by Toby Sterling in Amsterdam and Tom Bergin in London; Editing by David Holmes)    GALLERY: ZIKA: MOTHER AND CHILD ",2016-02-19,GOOGL,"Fri Feb 19, 2016 | 8:20am EST",Google accounts show 11 bln euros moved via low tax 'Dutch sandwich' in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/google-tax-idUSL8N15X5PG?type=companyNews

1303,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Facebook FB.0 said it would ditch a corporate structure that helps minimize its UK tax bill, prompting lawmakers and campaigners to ask whether the arrangement had ever complied with UK tax rules.    Facebook said on Friday it would stop booking sales to major UK clients via an Irish subsidiary and in future report sales agreed by UK staff in Britain.    ""In light of changes to tax law in the UK, we felt this change would provide transparency to Facebook's operations in the UK,"" the company said in a statement.    The change follows the British government's introduction last year of a new tax on profits shifted offshore.    ""From the start of April ... UK sales made directly by our UK team will be booked in the UK, not Ireland,"" Facebook added.    The California-based company declined to say if it currently booked sales made by UK-based staff, to UK clients, in Dublin.     If it did, this would break UK and international tax rules, which require companies to book sales where they are made.    Caroline Flint, member of parliament (MP) with the opposition Labour party, said the statement ""raises more questions than it answers"".    ""Facebook are trying to improve their corporate reputation but, in so doing, they appear to have confirmed that UK-based staff were conducting UK sales in the UK, but artificially diverting that income as though it was generated by Facebook Ireland,"" she said.    Labour MP Nick Smith said the UK tax authority, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), should have challenged Facebook's arrangement before now.      ""Both HMRC and Facebook need to be brought to book over this,"" he said.“HMRC should not just give Facebook a wrap over the knuckles over this,” he added.     A Facebook spokesman said ""we are compliant with UK tax law"".A spokesman for the tax authority said ""HMRC ensures that all multinationals pay the tax due under UK law"".ECHO OF GOOGLE In 2013, the parliamentary public accounts committee (PAC) investigated Google over the way it reported revenues from UK clients in Ireland, following a Reuters investigation which showed Google employed dozens of UK salespeople, despite denying staff in Britain made sales to UK clients. Google said then and now that UK customers transacted directly with the company’s Irish staff.    A PAC report said in 2013 that Google’s structure was ""contrived"" and criticized HMRC for being too lenient on big businesses. Google says it complied with all tax rules and HMRC said it treated all taxpayers equally.    Google, now part of holding group Alphabet, in January agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($184 million) in UK back taxes and interest and said it would also start to report more revenue in Britain.    Crawford Spence, Professor of Accounting at Warwick Business School, said Facebook’s new arrangements lacked sufficient transparency to tell if they would result in the company paying a “fair share” of tax.Prem Sikka, Professor of Accounting at Essex University, said Facebook could easily use alternative arrangements, such as inter-group charges to shift profits out of Britain as effectively under the new arrangement as it does under the current system.    HMRC has previously downplayed the potential that increased reporting of revenue in Britain would lead to higher tax bills. The tax authority says it assesses how much value a multinational creates in the UK and assesses its tax bill on that basis, rather than simply following the company’s own accounts of where profits are generated.    Facebook's main UK subsidiary said it had a 28 million pounds loss in 2014, the most recent year for which accounts are available, and a tax charge of just 4,327 pounds. The group does not report UK revenue but analysts said it was likely to run to hundreds of millions of pounds.    The company declined to answer questions about its potential future UK tax bills.    A spokeswoman for Prime Minister for David Cameron said on Friday the government was ""committed to making sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax"".    Facebook declined to say whether it planned to change its structure in other European countries.    Unlike Google, which shifts non-U.S. profits to Bermuda, a territory with no corporate income tax, Facebook moves profits from overseas back to the United States which has the highest corporate income tax rate in the world.However, this does not lead to big tax payments since it has billion of dollars in tax losses related to investments from earlier years, a Reuters analysis of its filings shows.

1304,"   By Ann Saphir | SAN RAMON, Calif.  SAN RAMON, Calif. What does a nice meal out say about the U.S. economy? Quite a lot, as it turns out, and the Federal Reserve is taking note, especially after a whopping 40,200 food service and drinking establishment jobs were created last month. That represented nearly 17 percent of overall job gains reported by the Labor Department on Friday.Spending at restaurants is also surging and prices are up, reflecting strength in the services sector, which accounts for more than 80 percent of U.S. economic output.If the $16 trillion American economy keeps adding jobs and the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis takes hold more broadly, it will allow the U.S. central bank to make good on its plan to lift interest rates gradually this year. Although waitstaff and line cooks do not generally make big salaries, they are part of a broader story: dollars spent in restaurants are going directly into the pockets of other Americans, and for the Fed, that may point to sustainable economic growth and the beginning of a long-awaited rise in inflation. With a slowing global economy and a strong dollar weighing on U.S. exports and manufacturing, the services sector ""is going to be the driver, not only of jobs and growth for the next year or so, but also for inflation,"" San Francisco Fed President John Williams said after a speech earlier this week in San Ramon, an affluent city in northern California. Williams knows a thing or two about restaurants: he once managed a well-known San Francisco pizza joint called Blondies. Chef and restaurant owner Rodney Worth sees the driving force of dining out first-hand.  ""We're killing it,"" he says, of sales at his seven restaurants in the San Francisco area, where he is seeing more guests ordering $11 sloppy joes and $18 brisket as well as desserts, good wines and specialty cocktails. That jump in business has a downside that reflects a tighter job market and lends support to Fed Chair Janet Yellen's argument that falling unemployment - now at 4.9 percent nationally - and rising wages will push inflation higher.""It's very hard to find catering managers, servers, cooks, and it's almost impossible to hire chefs right now,"" Worth says, adding that he has had to offer bonuses and higher pay to compete for staff against technology giants like Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, which have their own on-campus kitchens. He's had to increase prices, in part because of higher minimum wages, but he also felt comfortable enough to recently open a new restaurant, Worth Ranch, in San Ramon, some 35 miles (56 km) east of San Francisco. 'DO IT BIG' The growth is not confined to California's booming, tech-driven corner of the U.S. economy. What one Dallas Fed economist refers to as the ""dining out"" price index gained an annualized 4.4 percent nationally in January, according to government data released last week. Weekly earnings in the leisure and hospitality sector, which includes restaurants, dropped about $2 to $380.80 in February, a smaller dip than for overall wages, according to Friday's jobs report. The decline was largely driven by a statistical quirk.Cheaper gas, which is putting extra cash in American wallets, is one of the tailwinds driving growth at restaurants and other eateries, says Hudson Riehle, head of research at the National Restaurant Association. Sales within the industry are expected to rise 5 percent to $783 billion this year, with growth in quick-service outlets outpacing fine dining, Riehle says. That would represent a roughly 20 percent jump from 2012.Shares of restaurant companies such as El Pollo Loco (LOCO.O) and Cosi COSI.O are slowly rebounding after sharp sell-offs last year. Bakery-cafe chain Panera Bread (PNRA.O), which forecasts as much as 4.5 percent sales growth in 2016 for its company-owned outlets in North America, has seen its shares rise about 13 percent since the start of the year. Restaurant sales reflect stronger job growth in the overall economy and as workers on low incomes tend to spend, ""the economic multiplier effect of that on both employment and economic growth overall is substantial,"" Riehle said.For Worth, it's all connected. His catering business all but dried up after the Great Recession, but in the past year he has had to buy an extra van to handle the surge in business from both local firms and households.""They used to ask for pricing on sandwich platters,"" Worth said. ""Now they are saying 'show up and do it big - we are not really looking at pricing.'""

The government keeps a large part of the difference.The FCC said 69 applications are complete and 35 are incomplete. The incomplete applicants have until April 6 to finish their application.The applicants include subsidiaries of Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc  and Liberty Global Plc  and many U.S. rural carriers. Some applications were filed by individuals, partnerships, consortiums or other corporate entities and ownership of the entities will not be publicly known until Monday. Also applying to bid is Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a firm owned by Mexican telecom giant America Movil SAB, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim.In an FCC filing from February seen by Reuters, Liberty's subsidiary ""Liberty Spectrum Inc"" told the agency that it may bid on one or more blocks of low-frequency spectrum in the auction to potentially provide mobile wireless services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Global, headquartered in London and backed by cable pioneer John Malone, could not be immediately reached for comment.Malone's Liberty Broadband Corp. backs U.S.-based pay-TV provider Charter Communications Inc, which appeared on Friday to be absent from the FCC's list although more details could emerge on Monday once the agency releases the auction applications.

1316,"   By Deborah M. Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is ready to make a bid for Yahoo's web business, and hopes to make a merger more successful by also making an offer for a stake in Yahoo's Japan subsidiary, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter.The telecom giant is planning to make a first-round bid for Yahoo's web business next week, the news organization said.  Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unit is also mulling a bid for Yahoo's core business, Bloomberg reported, citing a source.However, Bloomberg said many companies that had been seen as likely investors in Yahoo were not planning a bid, including AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).Shares of Yahoo fell just over 1 percent to $36.17. Verizon, Yahoo and Google declined to comment for this story. AT&T, Comcast and Microsoft could not be reached immediately for comments.Verizon showed interest in Yahoo's core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would ""see if there is a strategic fit"" for its holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).The offer to purchase Yahoo's 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan could put Verizon one step ahead of any rival bidders.The offer will also likely leave Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer out of the mix, since Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said in a recent television appearance that merging Yahoo's assets with AOL assets under the leadership of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong ""would be a good thing for investors.""  The New York Post reported last month that Mayer has been working to team up with private equity firms to create a ""package deal"" that sells the company and keeps her at the helm.  Verizon shares were down 2.84 percent.

1319,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON, April 7  BOSTON, April 7 Adobe Systems Inc  issued an emergency update on Thursday to its widely used Flash software for Internet browsers after researchers discovered a security flaw that was being exploited to deliver ransomware to Windows PCs.The software maker urged the more than 1 billion users of Flash on Windows, Mac, Chrome and Linux computers to update the product as quickly as possible after security researchers said the bug was being exploited in ""drive-by"" attacks that infect computers with ransomware when tainted websites are visited.Ransomware encrypts data, locking up computers, then demands payments that often range from $200 to $600 to unlock each infected PC.Adobe's new patch fixes a previously unknown security flaw. Such bugs, known as ""zero days,"" are highly prized because they are harder to defend against since software makers and security firms have not had time to figure out ways to block them. They are typically used by nation states for espionage and sabotage, not by cyber criminals who tend to use widely known bugs for their attacks. Use of a ""zero day"" to distribute ransomware highlights the severity of a growing ransomware epidemic, which has disrupted operations at a wide range of organizations across the United States and Europe, including hospitals, police stations and school districts.Last week, the U.S. and Canadian governments issued a warning about the growing threat as a ransomware attack shut down computer systems at MedStar Health, the largest hospital chain in the Washington, DC, area. Ransomware schemes have boomed in recent months, with increasingly sophisticated techniques and tools used in such operations.""The deployment of a zero day highlights potential advancement by cyber criminals,"" said Kyrk Storer, a spokesman for FireEye Inc, which helped analyze the vulnerability and attacks. ""We have observed ransomware and crimeware deployed via 'zero-day' before; however, it is rare."" FireEye said that the bug was being leveraged to deliver ransomware in what is known as the Magnitude Exploit Kit. This is an automated tool sold on underground forums that hackers use to infect PCs with viruses through tainted websites.Exploit kits are used for ""drive-by"" attacks that automatically seek to attack the computers of people who view an infected website.Adobe said the issue was brought to its attention by researchers with FireEye, Alphabet Inc's Google and email security provider ProofPoint Inc.

1320,"   By Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON, April 15  WASHINGTON, April 15 The Obama administration on Friday weighed into the debate over allowing consumers to switch pricey cable television boxes for less expensive devices, urging an agency to set an example for other parts of government to boost competition.Consumers can spend nearly $1,000 over four years for renting cable set top boxes. Opening the business to competition and allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, an official said.""You could have a set a standards such that anyone could connect any box to their cable and those boxes could compete for lower prices and greater innovation,"" Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers told reporters in a teleconference. The Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, in February proposed a rule opening competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. It set a 60 day comment period on the rule that could cost major cable companies.The rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications . It is unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office next January. Cable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal saying it could stifle innovation.The administration entered the debate through a rare filing into the FCC's comment period. ""When the President personally gets involved is when it's of real great importance, in his mind, to consumers, to competition, and to the economy more broadly,"" Furman said. Obama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on specific areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition.Furman would not venture a guess on what kind of pro competition measures that order could spur. The administration is looking to add to actions it has already taken for consumers on cell phones, net neutrality and retirement advice.""This is going to be a whole of government effort to empower consumers, workers and small businesses,"" Furman said.

Todd and Narottam MedhoraApril 21 Google's parent Alphabet Inc  missed Wall Street targets for first-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday, driving shares of the Web search company down more than 4 percent in late trading on Thursday.Alphabet, the world's No.2 publicly traded company by market capitalization, said consolidated revenue rose to $20.26 billion from $17.26 billion. That was slightly below the $20.37 billion analyst consensus, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings per share of $7.50, excluding one-time items, missed the analyst target of $7.97.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen said the effect of foreign currency was worse for Alphabet than expected. ""If there had been a little better foreign currency translation, it would have been better than the Street consensus,"" he said.On a conference call after the earnings announcement, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said, ""As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $762 million, or $593 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23%"" year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially reflecting holiday seasonality."" Cost-per-click, or the average price of online ads, fell 9 percent in the quarter ended March 31, although Pyykkonen said some analysts had been expecting a decline of 10 percent.Google's advertising revenue increased 16.2 percent to $18.02 billion, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 29 percent, the company said. Losses increased at the company's Other Bets business, which includes its broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving cars and X - the company's research facility that works on ""moon shot"" ventures.The loss widened to $802 million, up from $633 million a year earlier.

1327,"   By Noel Randewich  Wall Street finished flat on Friday after disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft and Alphabet slammed tech stocks, while a surge in oil prices lifted energy shares.The S&P technology sector dropped 1.9 percent, its worst decline since early February, with Facebook down 2.5 percent and Intel falling 1.03 percent.Microsoft dropped 7.17 percent, contributing the biggest drag to the S&P 500, and Google-parent Alphabet lost 5.41 percent as investors punished both companies for missing profit and revenue estimates. It was Alphabet's worst day since 2012.Helped by a softer dollar and a recovery in oil prices, the S&P 500 has rebounded from a steep selloff earlier this year and is only about 2 percent short of last May's record high. Wall Street has rock-bottom expectations as companies post their first-quarter results over the next few weeks, with S&P 500 companies on average seen reporting a 7.1-percent fall in profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Crude rose over 1 percent on signs of strong U.S. gasoline consumption, declining production around the world and oilfield outages.Oil prices have moved in lockstep with U.S. stocks for several months and some investors expected more gains next week.  So far, 77 percent of first-quarter earnings have exceeded expectations, which is superior to the 63-percent beat rate in a typical quarter.""What's driving the market right now is earnings and oil,"" said Thomas Wilson, Managing Director of Wealth Advisory at Brinker Capital.

1333,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Alphabet Inc's Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), the ride-sharing service Uber [UBER.UL] and two other companies said on Tuesday they are forming a coalition to push for federal action to help speed self-driving cars to market.Sweden-based Volvo Cars, which is owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co GEELY.UL, and Uber rival Lyft also are part of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The group said in a statement it will ""work with lawmakers, regulators and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles.""The coalition said David Strickland, the former top official of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the top U.S. auto safety agency that is writing new guidance on self-driving cars, will be the coalition’s counsel and spokesman.""What people are looking for is clear rules of the road of what needs to be done for (fully autonomous) vehicles to be on the road,"" Strickland said in an interview Tuesday, emphasizing the companies want to deploy them safely. ""Nobody wants to take a shortcut on this.""Strickland, who has advised Google on self-driving car issues, said the group is ""a full policy and messaging campaign and movement"" and not just about lobbying lawmakers or regulators. In 2014 there were 32,675 fatalities and 2.3 million injured in 6.1 million crashes on U.S. roads. NHTSA says about 94 percent of all traffic crashes are caused by human error.On Wednesday, NHTSA is holding the second of two public forums on its self-driving car guidelines that will feature comments from tech companies and automakers at Stanford University.NHTSA did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the coalition. Ford said in a statement the group will ""work together to advocate for policy solutions that will support the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles.""NHTSA hopes to release its guidance to states, policymakers and companies on self-driving vehicles in July.California has proposed barring self-driving cars that do not have steering wheels, pedals and a licensed driver ready to take over in an emergency, which Google has opposed. Under current regulations, fully autonomous vehicles without human controls are not legal. NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind has said policymakers should avoid a ""patchwork"" of state regulations on self-driving cars but has not taken a position on California's proposal.In February, NHTSA said the artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, a major step toward winning approval for autonomous vehicles.The five companies, which all are working on self-driving cars, say one of the group's first tasks is to ""work with civic organizations, municipalities and businesses to bring the vision of self-driving vehicles to America’s roads and highways.""

1335,"   By Julia Love and Anya George Tharakan  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday posted its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market.The company's sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues.Its shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple's share buyback and  dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors.Apple's results followed disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and microblog Twitter (TWTR.N) also on Tuesday reported results that missed expectations.Apple said it sold 51.2 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down from 61.2 million in the same quarter a year ago but above analysts' estimates of about 50 million devices. While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop  represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise.After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple's exponential growth.""Apple needs to come up with a radical new innovation or product rather than just the current incremental improvements to existing products. This is the only way in which it will reinvigorate sales growth,"" said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. ""The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,"" he said.  But Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that the smartphone market was not growing, reinforcing wider concerns of saturation. Cook also conceded that the iPhone 6S was driving customers to replace phones at a much lower rate than the 6. ""I don't mean just a hair lower; it's a lot lower,"" he said. ""If we'd had the same rate on 6S as 6, it would be time for a huge party.""He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales.Cook also hinted that Apple had more gadgets to come.     ""The future of Apple is very bright,"" he said. ""Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store."" Earnings of $1.90 per share fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $50.56 billion missed expectations of $51.97 billion.  Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion. Apple also said it was raising its capital return program by $50 billion through a $35 billion increase in its share buyback authorization and a 10 percent rise in the quarterly dividend.iPHONE SE DEMAND STRONG In March, Apple released the iPhone SE, a smaller, 4-inch-screen phone featuring much of the company's latest technology. Although sales of the phone were not captured in the second quarter, the device is off to a strong start, particularly in emerging markets, Maestri said. ""The situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,"" he said. ""The demand has been very, very strong."" Although Apple's revenue in Greater China fell 26 percent from the year-ago quarter, Maestri stressed that the company was ""extremely optimistic"" about China. ""We continue to make a lot of investment there,"" he said.Cook said that mainland China sales were down only 7 percent in constant currency, attributing much of the Greater China drop to Hong Kong, where strength in the local dollar, which is pegged to U.S. currency, deterred tourist shopping. The company did not comment on prospects for its iBooks Stores and iTunes Movie service, which were shut down last week in China.The drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). In reaction to Apple's results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), Qorvo (QRVO.O), Broadcom (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday.

1337,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Anya George Tharakan  Facebook Inc's (FB.O) quarterly revenue rose more than 50 percent, handily beating Wall Street expectations as its wildly popular mobile app and a push into live video lured new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to boost spending.The company's shares rose 9.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $118.39, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday, at nearly triple its initial public offering four years ago. Facebook also announced it will create a new class of non-voting shares in a move aimed at letting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg give away his wealth without relinquishing control of the social media juggernaut he founded.The company plans to create a new class of non-voting shares, which would be given as a dividend to existing shareholders. That would allow Zuckerberg, who wants to give away 99 percent of his wealth, to sell non-voting stock to fund philanthropy and keep the voting stock that assures his control.Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) passed a similar proposal in 2014 that ensured its founders' control by creating new non-voting shares. Some 1.65 billion people used Facebook monthly as of March 31, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, a huge amount of time given the millions of apps available to users.Advertisers are shifting money from television to web and mobile platforms, and Facebook is one of the biggest beneficiaries. It faces fierce competition in the mobile video market, where rivals Snapchat and YouTube also garner billions of video views every day.Facebook recently expanded its live video product, rolling out several new features and making it more prominent on the app to encourage users to create videos and share them. The quarterly results showed success attracting advertisers with the move, and the company was able to expand its operating profit margin to 55 percent from 52 percent a year earlier. ""The company consistently 'warns' about higher spending, but they consistently manage their spending to deliver earnings upside. They're an impressive company, and they leave very little room for criticism,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who called the operating margin a good surprise.Facebook did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact 2016 revenue.The results come after disappointments for investors from several major Silicon Valley firms.""After Intel and IBM last week, and then Twitter and Apple yesterday, this is by far the best number I’ve seen in technology,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company which owns about $40 million worth of Facebook shares, commenting specifically about Facebook ad revenue.Facebook has not begun advertising on some of its most popular apps. ""They haven't yet turned on the monetization spigot for Messenger or WhatsApp, so there should be significant headroom still,"" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. The company's net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter from $509 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating Wall Street's 62-cent consensus.Total revenue rose to $5.38 billion from $3.54 billion, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.20 billion. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 percent a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.26 billion. If the stock proposal is approved - and Zuckerberg has a majority of voting stock - the company will effectively carry out a 3-for-1 stock split, issuing two shares of non-voting Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend for each share of Class A and Class B common stock.Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced last year that they would give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to fund charitable endeavors. Investors said they were not concerned that Zuckerberg would have increasing control, pointing to the company's consistent ability to grow and exceed expectations. ""I honestly don't think anyone cares if he has more power, since he's done everything right since they went public,"" said Pachter.

1339,"   By Ludwig Burger   (Corrects May 4 story to show AgFunder is an online investment platform, not a market research firm, paragraph 19.)By Ludwig BurgerIRLBACH, Germany Global pesticides, seeds and fertilizer companies may be forced to re-engineer their business models as farmers adopt specialist technology that helps maximize harvests while reducing the use of crop chemicals. New businesses are springing up that promise to tell farmers how and when to till, sow, spray, fertilize or pick crops based on algorithms using data from their own fields. Their emphasis on reducing the use of chemicals and minerals known as farming inputs is a further challenge for an industry already struggling with weak agricultural markets worldwide. ""If our only goal is to sell as much inputs as possible by the liters of chemicals, I think we would have a real problem going forward,"" said Liam Condon, head of Crop Science at Bayer, the world's second-largest pesticides supplier. Bayer bought proPlant, a developer of software for plant health diagnostics, earlier this year. Rivals are also investing in digital farming with the aim of generating service revenues that could offset any future drop in chemicals volumes.""If you only spray half of the field that's much less inputs,"" Condon added. ""The knowledge to get to the fact that you only spray that part of the field -- that, you can sell.""After an aborted takeover move for Syngenta, U.S. seeds giant Monsanto says data science and services are the ""glue that holds the pieces together"" of its strategy for future growth.Monsanto's $1 billion purchase in 2013 of the Climate Corporation, which analyses weather conditions, was the digital farming sector's biggest deal to date.DuPont is investing in digital farm management services under its Encirca brand, which it said in March had customers representing more than 1 million acres of farmland.Monsanto's failed swoop on Syngenta triggered a bout of M&A activity that has left the global seeds and pesticides industry in turmoil. The sector has annual sales of more than $100 billion, while fertilisers are worth around $175 billion. Dow Chemical and DuPont are set to merge in the second half of this year while state-owned ChemChina agreed a takeover of Syngenta in February.     ON THE GROUND At the 970-hectare farm in Bavaria where Juergen Schwarzensteiner rotates corn, potatoes and grains, satellite maps and software supplied three years ago by a unit of farming goods distributor BayWa have prompted many changes.These include reducing the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer -- a risk to drinking water quality and the environment -- and cutting down on other fertilisers.    ""This plot has had top yields consistently over the years, where I used to just say, that's great,"" says the farmer, eyeing a red and green patterned computer map showing big discrepancies in how well plants are growing just half a mile apart.""Then we got the digital maps and differences became apparent that were not clear to the eye before."" Schwarzensteiner's experiences using the technology have secured him a side job advising a farm in Siberia that is about 100 times the size of the one he manages at Irlbach, near the river Danube in Germany.As well as BayWa's FarmFacts, farm management software startups include Iowa-based Farmers Business Network Inc, backed by Alphabet Inc and investor Kleiner Perkins, and Missouri-based FarmLink LLC.All aim to provide farmers with individualized prescriptions on how to work each field down to a fraction of an acre, using data they have collected on soil and weather conditions, the use of crop chemicals and crop yields. Feedback from the farmers they have advised in turn allows the companies to fine-tune their computer models of plant growth.RISKS AND CHALLENGES     According to online agriculture investment platform AgFunder, venture capital investments in food and agriculture technology nearly doubled to $4.6 billion last year, with ""precision agriculture"" startups raising $661 million in 2015, up 140 percent from 2014.  Syngenta bought seven agricultural technology firms last year alone, AgFunder said. For now, the main aim of these companies is to help farmers using their drones, field robots, decision support software and smart irrigation systems to boost yields, said Carsten Gerhardt, a chemicals industry specialist at advisors A.T. Kearney.""But in the mid- to longer-term, I also expect there to be a reduction in the use of input factors by about 30 to 40 percent,"" he added.""There's a risk for established players if digital services providers can convince farmers that they can settle for the second-best herbicide and show what really counts is a more precise way of using it.""Eric Bartels, a partner at McKinsey who focuses on the agricultural industry, said developing new pesticides would help companies hedge against any drop in sales, however, because farmers will pay a premium to keep their fields pest-free.Another question is whether today's chemicals and farm nutrients giants can capture the farm management software market for themselves. Gerhardt said digital startups would struggle to catch up with established players' knowledge of plant biology and the farm business, and to build a global sales network.  But Rabobank's farm sector analyst Harry Smit says crop chemicals and seed players diversifying into such services will struggle to be seen as providers of impartial advice.That was one of the reasons why German grain and sugar beet seed maker KWS Saat, among the world's top five seed makers, decided not to invest in digital farming platforms. ""Farmers want independence,"" KWS finance chief Eva Kienle said. ""They don't want to get the impression they are being recommended a product just because the supplier is earning a profit on it.""

1346,"   By Deborah M. Todd | MOUNTAIN VIEW, California  MOUNTAIN VIEW, California Alphabet's Google Inc (GOOGL.O) unveiled its answer to Amazon's (AMZN.O) Alexa virtual assistant along with new messaging and virtual reality products at its annual I/O developer conference on Wednesday, doubling down on artificial intelligence and machine learning as the keys to its future.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai introduced Google Assistant, a virtual personal assistant, along with the tabletop speaker appliance Google Home.He also unveiled Allo, a new messaging service that will compete with Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger products and  feature a chatbot powered by the Google Assistant. Allo, like WhatsApp, will also have end-to-end encryption when it is rolled out this summer. Amazon's Echo, a surprise hit that has other tech giants racing to match it, uses a virtual assistant called Alexa, a cloud-based system that controls the Echo speaker and responds to voice-controlled commands by users.Like Alexa, Google Assistant can search the internet and adjust your schedule. However, Pichai said Google Assistant can use images and other information to provide more intuitive results. ""You can be in front of this structure in Chicago and ask Google who designed this and it will understand in this context that the name of that designer is Anish Kapoor,"" said Pichai, pointing toward a photo of Chicago's Cloud Gate sculpture.For Google Home, the Google Assistant merges with Chromecast and smart home devices to control televisions, thermostats and other products. Google did not offer a specific release date or pricing for Google Home, saying only that it will be available later this year. VIRTUAL REALITY Google's other big announcement at Wednesday's event, held at an outdoor amphitheatre near Google's headquarters, was a virtual reality platform called Daydream designed to work with the Android mobile operating system.Daydream addresses latency and other issues affecting playback on smartphones, according to Clay Bavor, Google's vice president of virtual reality. Bavor also announced a virtual reality headset powered by a smooth, two-button controller with orientation sensors that help determine positioning in virtual environments. Facebook is also making a big push in virtual reality with its Oculus headset, and Apple has indicated its interest in VR technology as well. Bavor also said the division has ""rebuilt YouTube from the ground up"" to feature improved audio to support virtual reality screening.    Google offered no timetable on the VR headset, but said Daydream-ready phones would likely hit the market by autumn.   (Reporting by Deborah M.

1347,"   By Michel Rose and Chine Labbé | PARIS  PARIS Dozens of French police raided Google's (GOOGL.O) Paris headquarters on Tuesday, escalating an investigation into the digital giant on suspicion of tax evasion.Google, which said it was fully complying with French law, is under pressure across Europe from public opinion and governments angry at the way multinationals exploit their presence around the world to minimize the tax they pay.Investigators from the financial prosecutors office and France's central office against corruption and tax fraud, accompanied by 25 IT specialists, took part in the raid.""The investigation aims to verify whether Google Ireland Ltd has a permanent base in France and if, by not declaring parts of its activities carried out in France, it failed its fiscal obligations, including on corporate tax and value added tax,"" the prosecutor's office said in statement.        Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, pays little tax in most European countries because it reports almost all sales in Ireland. This is possible thanks to a loophole in international tax law but it hinges on staff in Dublin concluding all sales contracts.If staff in countries like France finalize contracts with local clients, then the company would be obliged to report the revenues nationally and pay taxes in each country.Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Europe, said in an email: ""We are cooperating with the authorities to answer their questions. We comply fully with French law.""  Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, approached for a reaction at a conference in Amsterdam, declined to comment.""HEAVY OPERATION"" Tuesday's raid was carried out as part of an investigation into aggravated tax fraud and the organized laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud. The probe, triggered by a complaint by the French tax authorities, started in June last year but was only made public on Tuesday. ""This is a heavy operation,"" the judicial source said, referring to how many people took part in the raid. ""It's quite an unusual one.""  Should it be found guilty, Google faces either up to 10 million euros ($11.14 million) in fines or a fine of half of the value of the laundered amount involved.Budget Minister Christian Eckert, who declined to confirm or deny the sums involved in the Google case on Public Senat television, said France had raked in 3.3 billion euros in back taxes and penalties from just five multinationals in 2015.Separately, French tax authorities are seeking some 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in back taxes from Google, a finance ministry source said in February. It wasn't clear to what extent the judicial investigation made public on Tuesday was related to the tax authorities' case or was part of a larger probe into Google's tax practices.A Reuters investigation in 2013 found that while Google said it didn’t sell in countries like Britain and France, it advertised ""sales"" jobs in London and Paris which it said would involve ""negotiating deals"" and meeting ""sales quotas"". (reut.rs/1RnJZe2)The group agreed in January to pay 130 million pounds in back taxes to Britain, prompting criticism from opposition lawmakers and campaigners that the sum was too low.According to the last available statutory financial filing, Google France posted a profit of about 12.2 million euros on revenues of 225.4 million euros ($251.14 million)in 2014 and employed 534 people in the country.Parent company Alphabet posted net profits of $14.1 billion in 2014 on revenues of $66 billion and had a total headcount of  53,600.

1348,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A small but growing number of companies are starting to target Generation Z - the 69 million high school-age kids and younger who will soon outnumber the millennials before them - and they are not just pitching typical teen products such as acne creams and video games.Companies ranging from Macy's Inc to Campbell Soup Co to Charles Schwab Corp are talking to investors about their long-term plans to appeal to the post-millennial generation, a group that Pew Research expects to make up 40 percent of the U.S. workforce by 2020 and ultimately surpass the 75.4 million millennials and 74.9 million baby boomers.""It's a matter of survival to get new customers. Today's 18 year old is only 10 years away from being someone with a job and savings and trying to figure out a 401(k) for the first time,"" said Peter Tuz, portfolio manager of the $84 million Chase Growth Fund. He is shying away from mall-based  retailers as teens increasingly shop online.Gregg Fisher, portfolio manager of the Gerstein Fisher Multi-Factor Growth Equity fund, said that he is buying shares of Google-parent Alphabet and Apple IncO> in part because he expects that they will be able to adapt and continue to appeal to Generation Z, a group that he is familiar with by watching the habits of his 13 year old son.“It’s like someone in the U.S. who was investing in China in the early 90s. There’s a huge opportunity here for companies that are willing to take some risk and bet on the future,” he said.  Generation Z differs from previous generations in that its members have grown up with smartphones and the internet, making them more focused on speed of service. Many also saw their parents struggle during the Great Recession, making them more risk-averse, said Sean Mahoney, editorial director at advertising agency Sparks and Honey.   Ten major companies have specifically addressed Generation Z in earnings calls and investor presentations since the start of the year, according to a Reuters analysis of transcripts, more than the previous number of mentions by all companies over the last six years combined. Campbell cited Generation Z's focus on transparency as part of its decision to stop opposing labeling for foods containing genetically modified ingredients.Charles Schwab said that its financial advisers would transition more to becoming ""life coaches"" rather than making specific investment decisions as technology-trusting Generation Z comes of age and places more faith in computer models than humans when investing. All of the companies mentioning Generation Z are consumer-focused, suggesting that they are the most pressed to demonstrate to investors that they have a pipeline of future customers, investors say. SIGNS OF A NEW GENERATION   Companies have targeted teens for generations, but what makes this effort different is that the majority of the 10 companies talking about Generation Z now are not traditional teen marketers. They are instead focused on making their products appealing to customers years away from their typical customers. Food is increasingly viewed as an entertainment choice, with teens spending 20 percent more of their dollars at restaurants than millennials were in 2003, according to a report from Piper Jaffray.Restaurant-equipment maker Middleby Corp, for instance, told investors that with smartphones and apps such as that of food-delivery service Seamless, Generation Z now expects all restaurants to offer delivery. That should lead to increased demand for its high-speed ovens to handle greater volumes, the company said. ""When I look at the next five to 10 years, Middleby is so well-positioned with this generation,"" the company's chief executive, Selim Bassoul, told analysts.

1349,"  Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc have agreed to jointly build a subsea cable across the Atlantic Ocean to meet growing demand for high-speed cloud and online services. The construction of the new ""MAREA"" cable will begin in August and it is expected to be completed in October 2017, the companies said in a statement on Thursday.The 6,600 kilometer cable, the first to connect the United States with southern Europe, will be operated and managed by Telefonica SA's telecoms infrastructure unit Telxius. The cable is initially designed to carry 160 terabits of data per second, the companies said. The move comes nearly two years after Google Inc, now Alphabet Inc, agreed with five Asian companies to invest about $300 million to develop and operate a trans-Pacific cable network connecting the United States to Japan.

1355,"  Tony Fadell, a well-known Silicon Valley executive who was once  expected to play a central role in Alphabet Inc's hardware efforts, has stepped down as chief executive of the search giant's Nest unit, the company said.Fadell will remain an adviser to Alphabet and Google co-founder Larry Page. He will be replaced at Nest, which makes smart thermostats and smoke detectors, by Marwan Fawaz, who had prior stints at Motorola Mobility and Charter Communications Inc. Google bought Nest in 2014 for $3.2 billion, one of the company's largest acquisitions ever.In a blog post announcing his departure, Fadell said Nest's revenue is growing 50 percent a year and boasted that ""the connected home went mainstream because of Nest."" ""We’ve created a hardware + software + services ecosystem, which is still in the early growth stage and will continue to evolve to move further into the mainstream over the coming years,"" Fadell wrote.    Fadell started Nest in 2011 after a high-profile run at Apple Inc, where he was an important player in the development of the iPod and the iPhone. Top-tier venture capital investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers and Google Ventures backed Nest, which set out to build a smart thermostat and related products.But Fadell and Nest have had a bumpy ride under Alphabet.Nest had to recall a smoke detector in 2014 for a software defect that caused a safety risk, and critics said it was slow to roll out new products. The $555 million acquisition of webcam startup Dropcam did not go well, with Fadell openly criticizing the quality of the team in a news report earlier this year in the trade publication The Information. The story aired numerous complaints about Fadell's allegedly abrasive leadership.Dropcam co-founder Greg Duffy responded with a blistering blog post in which he accused Fadell of ""blatant scapegoating"" and said he regretted selling the company. Duffy also said there had been a huge exodus of employees from Nest. Fadell said in his blog that he had been planning to leave since late last year. He did not say what he intended to do next, though he recently unveiled a new company, Actev Motors, that makes a smart go-cart for kids.In a statement Friday, Page called Fadell a ""true visionary"" and praised his accomplishments at Nest.

Senators Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who chairs a panel on investigations and Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said in a statement Thursday that they will hold a June 23 hearing that will include testimony from Comcast Corp, Charter Communications, DirectTV, a unit of AT&T Inc and Dish Network Corp.The pair said in a joint statement the panel has been investigating the largest cable and satellite TV companies for more than a year, looking at potential barriers to competition in the industry, ""including the difficulties faced by companies attempting to create innovative new television delivery models."" The committee has also been examining billing, fees, refunds and other customer service issues. ""We believe our hearing will be a big step forward for consumers, allowing them to understand how their TV providers really work and make informed decisions about their video service,"" the pair said. Comcast declined to comment. Charter, which completed its acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in May, said in a statement ""our overall customer satisfaction ratings are trending in the right direction. Call volume into our call centers is declining, as are service calls."" The senators noted that a recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey found pay television service ranked near the bottom of the 43 industries surveyed - a year after the pay-TV industry tied for the lowest score among all industries ranked.The hearing follows a Federal Communications Commission proposal to allow consumers to swap pricey cable and other pay TV boxes for cheaper devices and apps, a change that would boost competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market.The proposal would let customers get video services from providers like Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo Inc. It set off a lobbying battle between tech companies eager to tap into the market and cable and TV companies which could lose billions of dollars in rental fees. The FCC says 99 percent of U.S. customers now must get their boxes from their cable companies, and they pay on average $231 a year to lease the devices.Cable companies say the video marketplace is already evolving as more customers replace traditional pay TV services with streaming internet video.

1363,"   By Julia Love | June 13  June 13 Apple Inc is expected to show off new abilities for its Siri digital assistant on Monday by debuting tools to let developers work with the company's artificial intelligence.Apple's iPhone sales have begun to level off and it is turning increasingly to services for growth. Key to that is satisfying developers of apps, who want more from Apple: high on their list is better use of Siri.Apple has been working on letting Siri work directly with applications created by outside developers and hopes to have such tools ready in time for its Worldwide Developer Conference, technology publication The Information has reported.Apple hopes to expand Siri's capabilities well beyond Apple apps and searching the Web. An example might be to allow the personal assistant to book a ride through a ride-hailing app listed in Apple's App Store. ""What you are seeing is just a lack of enthusiasm around apps,"" said analyst Brian Blau of tech research company Gartner. ""If a developer can get access to their customer wherever they are, whatever device they are on, that would be the best situation.""Siri is the most visible aspect of Apple's artificial intelligence program, or AI. Rivals such as Microsoft Corp  and Alphabet Inc's Google are investing heavily in their own digital assistants, analysts say. The Worldwide Developers Conference gives Apple a chance to show off its technical prowess. ""Apple just can't stand still in light of this competition,"" said analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies.A spokesman for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple acknowledged a number of developers' grievances this month by allowing ads in App Store search results, which gives them a way to stand out in a sea of apps. And it will give developers a bigger cut of revenues on subscription apps.In addition to mending fences with developers, Apple may use the conference to unveil a makeover for Apple Music, the music streaming product it released last year, analysts say.The service has attracted millions of paying subscribers, but many customers complain that the interface is confusing, and it has few features to differentiate it from rival services, said analyst Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies.

1364,"   By Naomi Tajitsu | TOKYO  TOKYO Toyota Motor Corp is targeting developing in the next five years driver assistance systems that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) to improve vehicle safety, the head of its advanced research division said.Gill Pratt, CEO of recently set up Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the Japanese automaker's research and development company that focuses on AI, said it aims to improve car safety by enabling vehicles to anticipate and avoid potential accident situations.Toyota has said the institute will spend $1 billion over the next five years, as competition to develop self-driving cars intensifies.Earlier this month, home rival Honda Motor Co said it was setting up a new research body which would focus on artificial intelligence, joining other global automakers which are investing in robotics research, including Ford and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). ""Some of the things that are in car safety, which is a near-term priority, I'm very confident that we will have some advances come out during the next five years,"" Pratt told reporters late last week in comments embargoed for Monday.  The concept of allowing vehicles to think, act and take some control from drivers to perform evasive maneuvers forms a key platform of Toyota's efforts to produce a car which can drive automatically on highways by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.While currently driver assistance systems largely use image sensors to avoid obstacles including vehicles and pedestrians within the car's lane, Pratt said TRI was looking at AI solutions to enable ""the car to be evasive beyond the one lane"".   ""The intelligence of the car would figure out a plan for evasive action ... Essentially (it would) be like a guardian angel, pushing on the accelerators, pushing on the steering wheel, pushing on the brake in parallel with you.""As Japanese automakers race against technology companies to develop automated vehicles, they are also grappling with a rapidly graying society, which puts future demand for private vehicle ownership at risk.Pratt said he saw the possibility that Toyota may one day become a maker of robots to help the elderly. Asked of the potential for Toyota to produce robots for use in the home, he said: ""That's part of what we're exploring at TRI.""Pratt declined to comment on a media report earlier this month that Toyota is in talks with Google's parent company Alphabet to acquire Boston Dynamics and Schafts, both of which are robotics divisions of the technology company.

1369,"   By Costas Pitas | LONDON  LONDON An Uber [UBER.UL] driver told a British tribunal on Wednesday he had earned less than the minimum wage, despite the firm saying he received nearly three times as much, in a case that could threaten the app's business model.Lawyers are representing two drivers at an employment tribunal, arguing that Uber is acting unlawfully by not offering rights such as holiday and sick pay.Uber, which allows users to book and pay for a taxi by smartphone, says its more than 30,000 London drivers enjoy the flexibility of being able to work when they choose and receive on average much more than the minimum wage.The case could hit Uber's reliance on using self-employed drivers.  James Farrar, a driver with the firm since December 2014, said that last August he earned less than the 6.70 pounds  ($8.80) an hour for those aged 21 and older which was then the rate for the minimum wage in Britain.  ""They claim that, based on the total number of hours logged into the app, I have been paid 13.77 pounds on an average hourly basis,"" he wrote in a witness statement. ""I calculated my net earnings for August 2015 after the expenses I set off and they came to 5.03 pounds an hour.""Uber's lawyer David Reade said that Farrar had picked a month in which he had logged onto the app for the longest period of time but canceled or not accepted the most amount of jobs, thereby reducing his hourly pay. Most employees in Britain are entitled to the minimum wage but the self-employed are among those who do not qualify. The issue of low pay and a lack of job security has sparked a public outcry in Britain in recent years with firms such as sports retailer Sports Direct facing a backlash over their use of zero-hour contracts.  Last year Uber, whose investors include Goldman Sachs and Alphabet Inc unit Google, said its drivers received average payments of 16 pounds an hour in October after the firm's service fee. The former start-up has grown rapidly and is valued at $62.5 billion but has faced protests, bans and restrictions in several cities, including in London where traditional black-cab drivers tried to have the app ruled illegal. The case is due to last until next Tuesday and a decision on whether Uber is acting unlawfully is unlikely to be given by the judge for several weeks.

1371,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker  Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) is focusing on U.S. telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) as the buyer of its core business after reviewing final bids that it received this week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.A deal would boost Verizon's AOL internet business, which the company acquired last year for $4.4 billion, by giving it access to Yahoo's advertising technology tools, as well other assets such as search, mail, messenger and real estate. These synergies have made Verizon the favorite among industry analysts to prevail in the auction.The sale would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company, leaving it only as the owner of a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 percent interest in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). Those two stakes account for most of Yahoo's $37 billion market capitalization.Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no agreement has yet been reached, the sources said. Yahoo would like to have a deal for the core assets by the end of July, one of the sources added.Bloomberg News, which reported earlier that Verizon was nearing an agreement to buy the Yahoo assets, cited an anonymous source as saying the companies were discussing a price close to $5 billion. Yahoo shares were up 0.6 percent at $39.09 in morning trading, while Verizon rose 1.3 percent to $56.09.The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Verizon and Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment.""Verizon has always been the favorite because it has the largest potential synergies and therefore can pay the most,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""The price negotiations still can be tough because it also doesn't need Yahoo. It can put its money into its AOL franchise.""  Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its go90 ad-supported mobile video service targeted at millennials. The app, which was introduced in October, offers videos from Comedy Central, Vice and other programmers, as well as basketball and football games.Other bidders for the Yahoo assets include Verizon rival AT&T (T.N); a consortium led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital LP; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners, sources have said previously.AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community. Analysts say it is unlikely that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer who has struggled to turn her internet company around, would join him at AOL. LOSING GROUND TO COMPETITORS In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis. It instead decided to explore a sale of its core assets, spurred on by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP.Yahoo said in April that Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him would join its board immediately. All four were on a slate that Starboard had proposed to oust Yahoo's entire board. Started in 1994 by Stanford graduate students Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the World Wide Web. The company soared and then crashed in the first dot-com bubble before emerging as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits. By 2008, Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and struggling to define its mission. That question was never really answered, leading to years of management instability and shifting priorities. Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O. and a host of new companies, meanwhile, claimed much of the territory that might have been Yahoo's.(This version of the story has been refiled to remove extraneous word ""to"" in first paragraph) (Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Liana B.

1374,"   By Anya George Tharakan and Sweta Singh  Google parent Alphabet Inc and e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc capped a blockbuster June quarter for the five biggest U.S. tech companies as their dominance in key markets helped them defy the ""law of large numbers"".Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc, as well as Alphabet and Amazon, all blew past Wall Street expectations for both profit and revenue.""The results are further indications that the leaders in their respective spaces are taking market shares and it is very much a microcosm of the internet as a whole,"" Benchmark Company analyst Daniel Kurnos told Reuters.At some point, Kurnos said, the fact that the companies have grown so large will catch up with them.""But I think people still continue to underestimate how large the addressable opportunity is,"" he said.Alphabet's Class A shares rose 4.9 percent in early trading on Friday, boosting the company's market value by about $23 billion to $542 billion. Amazon rose 1.8 percent, pushing up its market capitalization by about $6 billion to around $361 billion.Together, the five companies would add about $346 billion to their combined value - roughly the gross domestic product of Egypt - if they were to trade at analysts' median price targets.Alphabet - which competes with all of the other four companies in either advertising, cloud computing, or operating systems - showed that efforts to push its vast ad business toward mobile were paying off, calming fears that the company's best days were behind it.""How many other almost $100 billion revenue companies are accelerating growth rates to their strongest level in years?,""  Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter said in a research note.Ad revenue from its Google business, which accounts for 89 percent of total revenue, jumped 19.5 percent to $19.14 billion. Google also houses the company's Android business that competes with iOS from Apple, which sold more iPhones than analysts expected in the latest quarter.Alphabet's ad sales numbers, and the stellar ad revenue growth that Facebook reported on Wednesday, underscored the shift in ad dollars to mobile devices from television.The leading social media company's wildly popular mobile app and push into video attracted new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to spend more.SMOKIN'  While Google still controls nearly a third of the roughly $187 billion global digital-ad market, Facebook's share has risen to 12 percent so far this year, from 8.6 percent in 2014, according to market research firm eMarketer.Alphabet's other businesses, including cloud, through which it competes with Microsoft and Amazon, also held their own.""Alphabet smoked Q2 expectations, including revenue upside and a further exhibition of its new passion for expense control,"" Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said in a note.Wilson, who has an ""overweight"" rating on the company's stock, raised his price target to $960 from $910.Of 50 analysts covering the company, 19 raised their price targets on Alphabet's class A stock, which has a median price target of $907.Goldman Sachs was the most bullish, raising its target by $120 to $930. All but three of the brokerages covering the stock rate it ""buy"" or above. None has a sell. Alphabet's non-ad revenue jumped 33 percent to $2.17 billion, largely driven by cloud. While the pace of growth in Amazon's cloud business slowed, revenue jumped 58 percent to $2.9 billion.Microsoft's revenue in what it calls its ""intelligent cloud"" businesses, which includes the Azure cloud platform and server software, rose 7 percent to $6.7 billion.Amazon remains the undisputed leader in cloud computing, although Microsoft, under Satya Nadella, and Alphabet are both nipping at its heels.Amazon's global retail sales also beat estimates in the quarter.""The long-term growth outlook is upbeat, as Amazon slowly takes away traditional retail's last competitive advantage - instant gratification - and rides the AWS cloud secular growth theme,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray.Munster, who raised his price target on Amazon by $100 to $900, has an ""overweight"" rating on the stock.Nineteen analysts raised their price targets on Amazon, which has a median price target of $850.

1375,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON GlaxoSmithKline and Google parent Alphabet's life sciences unit are creating a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, jump-starting a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics.Verily Life Sciences - known as Google's life sciences unit until last year - and Britain's biggest drugmaker will together contribute 540 million pounds ($715 million) over seven years to Galvani Bioelectronics, they said on Monday.The new company, owned 55 percent by GSK and 45 percent by Verily, will be based at GSK's Stevenage research center north of London, with a second research hub in South San Francisco.It is GSK's second notable investment in Britain since the country voted to leave the European Union in June. Last week it announced plans to spend 275 million pounds on drug manufacturing.Galvani will develop miniaturized, implantable devices that can modify electrical nerve signals. The aim is to modulate irregular or altered impulses that occur in many illnesses.GSK believes chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis and asthma could be treated using these tiny devices, which consist of a electronic collar that wraps around nerves.Kris Famm, GSK's head of bioelectronics research and  president of Galvani, said the first bioelectronic medicines using these implants to stimulate nerves could be submitted for regulatory approval by around 2023.""We have had really promising results in animal tests, where we've shown we can address some chronic diseases with this mechanism, and now we are bringing that work into the clinic,"" he told Reuters. ""Our goal is to have our first medicines ready for regulatory approval in seven years.""GSK first unveiled its ambitions in bioelectronics in a paper in the journal Nature three years ago and believes it is ahead of Big Pharma rivals in developing medicines that use electrical impulses rather than traditional chemicals or proteins.The tie-up shows the growing convergence of healthcare and technology. Verily already has several other medical projects in the works, including the development of a smart contact lens in partnership with the Swiss drugmaker Novartis that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes.  GRAIN OF RICE Famm said the first generation of implants coming to market would be around the size of a medical pill but the aim eventually was to make them as small or smaller than a grain of rice, using the latest advances in nanotechnology.Patients will be treated with keyhole surgery and the hope is that bioelectronic medicine could provide a one-off treatment, potentially lasting decades.Major challenges including making the devices ultra low-power so that they function reliably deep inside the body.  The idea of treating serious disease with electrical impulses is not completely new.Large-scale electrical devices have been used for years as heart pacemakers and, more recently, deep brain stimulation has been applied to treat Parkinson's disease and severe depression, while EnteroMedics last year won U.S. approval for a device to help obese people control their appetite.Galvani, however, is taking electrical interventions to the micro level, using tiny implants to coax insulin from cells to treat diabetes, for example, or correct muscle imbalances in lung diseases.Galvani will initially employ around 30 scientists, engineers and clinicians.The company will be chaired by Moncef Slaoui, GSK's vaccines head, who pioneered the drugmaker's drive into the bioelectronics field. Slaoui is retiring from GSK next March but will continue to steer Galvani after that date, a spokesman said.Galvani will be fully consolidated in GSK's financial statements, following the model of the group's majority-owned ViiV Healthcare business, which sells HIV medicines.

GV, previously known as Google Ventures, was founded in 2009 and has invested in more than 300 companies including Uber Technologies Inc and online retailer Jet.com, according to GV's website. Alphabet's projects have seen some high-profile departures in recent months. Chris Urmson, chief technical officer for its self-driving car project, left last week, while Anthony Levandowski, product manager for the program, left earlier this year to co-found a startup. Tony Fadell, a well-known Silicon Valley executive who was once expected to play a central role in Alphabet's hardware efforts, stepped down as chief executive of its Nest unit in June.

1379,"   By Heather Somerville and Shalini Nagarajan  Alphabet Inc venture capital arm GV said Bill Maris, a leading voice in the venture industry, is leaving the   investment firm he founded and ran as chief executive for close to eight years.GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, said Friday that Maris would be replaced by managing partner David Krane.""Bill Maris has decided to step down to take a break with his family and tackle something new,"" GV said in a statement.Krane has been at Google for nearly 17 years, starting as the company's first communications director.   GV, founded in 2009, pioneered a new style of corporate venture capital, making big bets on bleeding-edge technology such as commercial drones and 3D printing, and new business models such as ride-services company Uber and genetics testing firm 23andMe. Unlike many corporate venture arms, GV rarely invests in a startup that is acquired by its corporate affiliate. Just six of GV's 320 or so investments have been acquired by Google, a spokeswoman said.It has roughly $1.4 billion under management, with many companies now worth several billions of dollars. Its investment in online retailer Jet.com paid off this week when Wal-Mart announced it would acquire the company for about $3 billion. It has also had its share of failures, such as messaging app Secret's demise last year.But GV has slowed its pace of investments dramatically over the last year and a half. The firm made just 34 investments in 2015 compared to 63 in 2014, a 46 percent drop, according to venture capital database CB Insights. Maris had been vocal in encouraging richly valued startups to go public rather than continuing to exploit the booming private markets, and depriving employees and early investors the chance to cash out their shares.Alphabet has added other investment vehicles since GV. Google Capital, a growth-stage investment fund, launched in 2014, and Google began making investments from its balance sheet over the last couple of years. However, GV's pace of investments still outpaced the others, according to CB Insights.Maris's exit is the latest in a string of high-profile departures from Alphabet.

The fund has wide latitude to invest across stocks, bonds and other assets.""During the month of July, we added to Japanese equities as we view the reappointment of (Japanese Prime Minister) Shinzo Abe's coalition combined with attractive valuations and corporate governance trends as a positive for risk assets in Japan,"" a note from the funds' managers said.""Looking across the broad array of asset classes globally, few are unambiguously cheap. Investors with a strong U.S. bias may become particularly disappointed."" The note argues that U.S. stocks are priced at ""valuations"" that are ""extended by most measures,"" meaning they likely are not a bargain.U.S. equities nonetheless represent nearly a third of the fund's portfolio, consisting of stocks the note says are a good ""long-term value."" The fund's top holdings include Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Marathon Petroleum Corp. By contrast, the note said Japanese equities are below their historical averages, citing an internal BlackRock analysis, and seem especially cheap compared to emerging markets, U.S. and European stocks.In U.S. dollar terms, the MSCI Japan Index is up 8.6 percent since the end of June. Abe and his ruling coalition won a landslide victory last month in an election for parliament's upper house. The prime minister is known for promoting an ambitious stew of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and other economic reforms.New York-based BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager. Institutional shares of its Global Allocation Fund have returned -0.57 percent over the last year, through July, trailing its longer-term record and 66 percent of its peers, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters research service.

1385,"   By Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google has suspended Project Ara, its ambitious effort to build what is known as a modular smartphone with interchangeable components, as part of a broader push to streamline the company's hardware efforts, two people with knowledge of the matter said.The move marks an about-face for the tech company, which announced a host of partners for Project Ara at its developer conference in May and said it would ship a developer edition of the product this autumn.The company’s aim was to create a phone that users could customize on the fly with an extra battery, camera, speakers or other components.  A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment on the matter. While Google will not be releasing the phone itself, the company may work with partners to bring Project Ara’s technology to market, potentially through licensing agreements, one of the people with knowledge of the matter said. Axing Project Ara is one of the first steps in a campaign to unify Google’s various hardware efforts, which range from Chromebook laptops to Nexus phones. Former Motorola president Rick Osterloh rejoined Google earlier this year to oversee the effort. Google sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo Group in 2014.  Modular smartphones have generated great enthusiasm in the tech community for their potential to prolong the lifespan of a device and reduce electronic waste. But the devices are difficult to bring to market because their interchangeable parts make them bulky and costly to produce, said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research, adding that he was not surprised to see Google halt the project. “This was a science experiment that failed, and they are moving on,” he said. Project Ara was one of the flagship efforts of Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group, which aims to develop new devices, but it had various stops and starts. Last year, the company shelved plans to sell the modular phone in Puerto Rico with Latin American carriers.

""On Android, the last deadline set by the Commission for Google's reply, after an extension request by Google, is Sept. 20,"" a European Commission spokesman said in an email.Google can be fined up to $7.4 billion or 10 percent of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules.

During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google's momentum. ""Our customer lists are extremely complimentary,"" she said.

Google Asia Pacific's spokesman did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call seeking comment.Indonesia is pursuing Alphabet Inc's Google for five years of back taxes, and the U.S. search giant could face a bill of more than $400 million for 2015 alone if it is found to have avoided payments, a senior tax official told Reuters last week. Singapore's low tax regime and its generous tax incentive programs make it a big draw for multinationals like Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp  to Google, and also from other sectors, to employ regional teams there. They justify booking large revenue and profits in Singapore as they usually run main business functions such as finance and operations, hold intellectual property rights there or base regional executives in the city state.Singapore's finance ministry said in an emailed statement last week that ""profits should be taxed where activities giving rise to the profits are performed and where value is created"" and that it does not condone the ""artificial shifting of profits"". INVESTOR PRESSURE American business groups in the region warned that the tax crackdown risks slowing planned investments by multinationals.Investment worth millions of dollars could become stalled due to disputes with the country's tax office, which has taken an ""aggressive"" approach, Lin Neumann, managing director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia, said.""There's just been a feeling for some time among big taxpayers that they're like the low-hanging fruits because they're in the system,"" Neumann said, noting that many multinational companies are accountable to public shareholders. The Financial Times reported on Saturday that four UK fund houses - Legal & General Investment Management, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, Royal London Asset Management and Sarasin Partners - had written to the board of Alphabet to raise concerns about its tax arrangements.In December last year, Australia's tax office published the tax rates of every company with annual earnings over A$100 million, a move it said it would repeat annually in the hope of pressuring entities with ""overly aggressive"" tax structures.Apple Inc paid A$74 million tax on its A$247 million taxable income, in line with the country's 30 percent tax rate but a small fraction of the total A$6.1 billion it made in the country that year.Google paid A$9 million tax on A$91 million in taxable income, a third of the company tax rate and dwarfed by the A$357 million it made in the country.The Australian government has since passed laws requiring consumers to pay a goods and services tax on all online purchases - not just online purchases from Australian retailers - from next year.

1398,"  Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) shares plunged on Thursday as fears mounted that a much-anticipated auction of the social media company will draw minimal interest from potential buyers.With stagnant user growth and continuing losses, Twitter's board agreed last month to consider a sale, and has told potential acquirers it wants such deliberations to conclude by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, Reuters reported on Wednesday.Technology website Recode reported later on Wednesday that Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O), long considered the most logical buyer for Twitter, and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) would not bid for the social network, leaving cloud software company Salesforce.com (CRM.N) as the only known suitor.Twitter shares fell as much as 19.2 percent to $20.10, valuing the company at about $14.2 billion. They closed 20.1 percent lower at $19.87.Salesforce Chief Executive Mark Benioff has publicly expressed his interest in Twitter in recent days, but stopped short of saying the company had decided on a bid. Analysts said he downplayed the possibility in a meeting with investors on Wednesday, sending Salesforce shares up about 4 percent.  ""I'm not saying I'm buying it, but I'm not saying I'm not buying it,"" Benioff said on Wednesday in an interview with the New York Times.Even at $20, Twitter shares are well above the $14 they were trading at before speculation about a possible acquisition began to emerge this spring. Many investors and analysts believe Twitter remains expensive for most potential buyers, but the company does not have a clear back-up plan if it is not acquired.Product initiatives under CEO Jack Dorsey, who returned to the company a year ago but also remains CEO of payment company Square, have borne little fruit. Large amounts of employee stock and options are also considered an obstacle for some potential bidders.The rationale for Salesforce bidding on Twitter is not clear, said Jefferies analyst John DiFucci in a note to clients. Buying Twitter would reduce the value of Salesforce shares by about $11 through dilution, while increased debt could cut another $9.50 from the stock.  Other potential bidders beyond Salesforce are taking a look at Twitter, CNBC said, citing sources.Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has also been rumored as a possible bidder, though Recode reported that Apple would not move forward.

1401,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B. Baker  Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) is still deliberating whether it should make an offer for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) in the face of resistance from Salesforce shareholders over the strategic merits and valuation of such a deal, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.Twitter shares have lost as much as a third of their value since Oct. 5 on concerns the company has attracted less interest from potential acquirers than previously envisaged. It now has a market capitalization of $12 billion.Salesforce is deliberating whether it is worth making a lowball offer for Twitter in the coming days based on Twitter's stock performance and any news of other bidders, the people said.Other potential acquirers such as Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) have backed away from making offers for the Internet company, the people said. There may however be other companies contemplating offers for Twitter whose identity has not yet been reported, some of the sources suggested. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Salesforce declined to comment while Twitter, Google and Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Reuters previously reported that Twitter aimed to conclude deliberations about selling itself by Oct. 27, when it reports its third-quarter earnings.Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software. Unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at business users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships. A potential acquisition of Twitter has weighed down Salesforce's stock since news broke on Sept. 23 that it was vying for Twitter. Its shares rose as much as 7 percent on Monday after a weekend report by Bloomberg News suggested Salesforce was unlikely to make an offer.Some analysts and investors have questioned why Salesforce would need to own Twitter, when it already licenses the Twitter ""firehose"" for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. At Salesforce's annual client conference last week, Benioff said Salesforce considers buying many companies but maintains discipline, and wished Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ""well."" These comments tamped out expectations that Salesforce would be an aggressive bidder for Twitter. Since its founding a decade ago, Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news.

1406,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Anjuli Davies | LONDON  LONDON Headhunters are trying to lure Italian bankers in London back to jobs at home, hoping to use Britain's vote to leave the EU as leverage to fill a string of vacancies at investment banks in Europe's fourth largest economy.American, British, French and Japanese investment banks are looking for a total of six dealmakers to head their businesses in Italy after a number of senior bankers jumped ship for top jobs at Italian corporates.Bank of America's (BAC.N) chief executive in Italy Marco Morelli, Nomura's (8604.T) top Italian banker Francesco Mele and Barclays' (BARC.L) Italy head Alessandra Pasini have all ditched investment banking for executive corporate jobs.Senior staff in Italy have also left Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and HSBC (HSBA.L) in recent months, sources told Reuters, while BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is interviewing candidates to head the corporate division of its Italian subsidiary Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).The banks declined to comment on their hiring plans.Since the start of the financial crisis, life in companies outside the financial sector has become increasingly attractive for senior bankers, whose jobs now involve dealing more with restructuring plans, cutting costs and compliance work.""At a certain stage in your career, if you're being offered a prestigious corporate role, it's hard to refuse,"" said Anna Marietta, a partner at executive search firm DHR International.Goldman Sachs rainmaker Simon Dingemans joined British drug firm GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) as chief financial officer (CFO) in 2011, Goldman's Anthony Noto left the bank in 2014 to become Twitter's (TWTR.N) CFO while Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Ruth Porat became CFO at Google's holding firm Alphabet (GOOGL.O) in 2015.MUSICAL CHAIRS The vacancies in Italy come at a crucial time for investment banks in the country as they battle for lucrative work helping lenders Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) raise billions of euros in capital.""There is an unprecedented game of musical chairs in the Italian investment banking industry,"" said a senior Italian banker who is in the running for some of the top jobs.""We're seeing a high number of talented investment bankers moving on to corporate life but big banks remain committed to Italy,"" he told Reuters. Still, finding the right people for such senior roles in Italy can be tough, as many Italian bankers tend to base themselves in London where there is a wider variety of work, as well as better tax rates.For example, just 1 percent of the top five U.S. banks' European workforces were based in Italy in 2014, according to think-tank Bruegel, despite the country being the fourth biggest fee-earner in Europe for banks. For those major U.S. lenders, 88 percent of their European staff were based in Britain.But with investment banks expected to start moving staff across Europe following the Brexit vote, recruitment consultants say there may now be more incentives for Italians to relocate to the country's financial capital in Milan.""Brexit could be a facilitating factor,"" said DHR International's Marietta. ""The UK is changing, psychologically it could play a role.""Italy is home to some of the biggest fee payers in Europe. Ailing lender Monte dei Paschi paid banks more than 400 million euros ($438 million) for two capital increases in as many years and is now working on an expensive rescue plan.Bankers say this means Italy remains an attractive market to enter and U.S. investment bank Jefferies [JGLL.UL] recently started operations in Milan. It has just hired Mauro Premazzi from Bank of America and is seeking to establish a foothold before expanding its Italian team, the sources said. A spokeswoman at Jefferies declined to comment.CHALLENGING TIMES Headhunters will, nevertheless, have their work cut out as the list of recent departures in Italy is long.     Societe Generale's group country head in Italy Patrizia Micucci stepped down in July while HSBC's head of global banking for Italy, Stefano Giudici, who was responsible for investment and corporate banking in the country, left in September.A Societe Generale spokesman confirmed Micucci was no longer with the bank, adding that Roberto Pecora, head of Societe Generale's market activities in Italy, has been managing its corporate and investment banking activities in the country on an interim basis since July 28. French rival BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) is looking to hire a new head for BNL's corporate division as it wants to develop closer ties with small- and mid-sized corporate clients served by BNL, the sources said. Bank of America and Nomura, whose top bankers Morelli and Mele became Monte dei Paschi's chief executive and chief financial officer, have instructed headhunters to find candidates for their Italian businesses, the sources said.Societe Generale is also working with headhunters and its recruitment process is more advanced than at Barclays, which is still digesting the departure of Alessandra Pasini, who became CFO at Italian utility Snam (SRG.MI) on Sept. 27.Earlier this year, Barclays hired veteran Italian dealmaker Carlo Calabria as chairman of mergers and acquisitions for Europe, Middle East and Africa, bringing eight of his colleagues from CMC Capital, the boutique advisory firm he set up.Two of the sources said the British bank may select its new Italy head from Calabria's team but cautioned that no final decision had been made.Bank of America's Diego De Giorgi, who was recently made sole head of global investment banking, will have the final word on the selection of its new Italy chief, which is seen as the most prestigious job with possibly an additional role up for grabs as head of investment banking Italy.Still, running the Italian franchise of a large international bank comes with the challenge of delivering ambitious growth targets in a largely flat market, even if there is money to be made with lenders such as Monte dei Paschi.Investment banking fees in Italy were down nearly 30 percent last year to $1.28 billion, reflecting a more general slump in banking fees worldwide.So far this year, banks have earned $863.9 million from Italian deals, mostly from mergers and acquisitions, as opposed to $3.7 billion in Britain, $2.1 billion in France and $1.4 billion in Germany, according to Thomson Reuters data.    ""Banking is just a harder industry right now to be in,"" said Logan Naidu, chief executive at recruitment firm Dartmouth Partners, pointing to regulatory pressures, lower compensation and competition from specialized boutique outfits.($1 = 0.9137 euros) (Editing by David Clarke)",2016-10-20,GOOGL,"Thu Oct 20, 2016 | 11:04am EDT",Investment banks scramble to fill top jobs in Italy,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-italy-banks-idUSKCN12K1XD?type=companyNews

1409,"   By Julia Love  Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff spoke on Wednesday about a pair of key acquisitions that got away, suggesting his vision for LinkedIn Corp (LNKD.N) was different from Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) and that he would have pursued Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) if shareholders had not learned of his plans.Speaking at a technology conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal in Laguna Beach, California, Benioff declined to elaborate on what he had hoped to do with micro-blogging site Twitter. Twitter hired bankers earlier in October to explore selling itself. Technology and media companies including Salesforce.com, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google looked at the company but passed on buying it.Some regarded Twitter as an unlikely fit for Salesforce.com, whose platform is popular among sales teams. Benioff said he was forced to drop the deal when investors began voicing concerns.  “We’ve never had a deal leak before; we don’t really understand that dynamic,” said Benioff, who is an avid Twitter user. “We had to stop because I’m running the business in partnership with my shareholders.”  Benioff was also effusive about his interest in professional social networking site LinkedIn, which Microsoft agreed to buy for $26.2 billion in June. Benioff told technology news website Recode in June that Salesforce.com made a bid for LinkedIn and was primarily interested in its recruiting business.Benioff on Wednesday said he saw parallels between Salesforce.com’s business model and LinkedIn’s.“We really liked some of the business fundamentals,” he said, adding few details on his vision for an acquisition of LinkedIn. He contrasted that vision with Microsoft’s, which he said centered on mingling the companies' data streams to make it difficult for other companies to compete. Salesforce.com has raised concerns about the deal to European antitrust regulators.“Last time I checked, that was illegal,” he said of Microsoft's plans for LinkedIn's data.  Microsoft said it was confident it would gain final regulatory approval for the LinkedIn acquisition by the end of 2016.""We’re committed to continuing to work to bring price competition to a CRM (customer relationship management) market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices,” a Microsoft spokesman said in an emailed statement.

1414,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Google (GOOGL.O) on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines.The U.S. technology giant's rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and a host of European and U.S. rivals.The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time.Google's general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company's actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals.""We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn't 'favoring' - that's listening to our customers,"" Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon (AMZN.O), merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook (FB.O) and Pinterest.The EU executive said it had received Google's response.""In each case, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,"" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School.""Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,"" he said.Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive.The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company's global turnover for each case.Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so.

1416,"  STOCKHOLM Swedish firm Tobii on Monday announced plans to raise 450 million crowns ($50 million) in a rights issue to invest in technology for virtual reality and smartphones.The company's eye-tracking technology helps disabled people use computers by identifying where they are looking on their screens. ""The interest for eye tracking in various consumer applications has developed at a substantially more rapid pace than we anticipated at the time of the IPO in April 2015,"" it said in a statement.It said it would use the money to build up market-leading positions in virtual reality and smartphones.Dell, Acer and MSI have already released computers that integrate Tobii's eye-tracking sensors, and some 40 games with support for Tobii's technology have been launched. The firm said a large smartphone maker has chosen its technology for one smartphone model. Tobii's system uses invisible infra-red light to illuminate the eyes. Camera sensors capture the reflection off the retina and cornea to gauge where the eye is, and where it is looking. In a sign of the technology's increasing importance, Alphabet Inc's Google bought eye-tracking firm Eyefluence last month.Tobii said shareholders representing approximately 40 percent of its voting rights have already expressed support for the rights issue. Assuming it is approved, Tobii plans to invest approximately 150 million crowns in virtual reality and another 150 million in smartphone technology between 2017 and 2019.Shares in Tobii are trading roughly flat year to date but are up almost 170 percent since going public.
