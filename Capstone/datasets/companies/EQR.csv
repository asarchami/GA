0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a credit rating of 'BBB+'  to the following notes issued by ERP Operating Limited Partnership, a subsidiary  of Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR):  --$450 million aggregate principal amount of 2.375% senior unsecured notes due  2019; --$750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior unsecured notes due  2044.  The 2019 notes were issued at 99.900% of par value to yield 2.396% or 70 basis  points over the benchmark rate, and the 2044 notes were issued at 99.297% of par  value to yield 4.543% or 115 basis points over the benchmark rate. EQR expects  to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and general company  purposes, including repayment of all or a portion of the outstanding balance  under its unsecured revolving credit facility and all or a portion of the  outstanding balance under its unsecured term loan facility.  Fitch currently rates EQR as follows: Equity Residential --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+'; --Unsecured revolving term loan 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock 'BBB-'.  ERP Operating Limited Partnership --IDR 'BBB+'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS EQR's rating is supported by the company's focus on high-quality properties in  strong markets and sound financial management. The company is the largest  multifamily REIT in the U.S. by market capitalization and is a leading  owner/operator in many of the top markets in the U.S. including New York, San  Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston. The company is focused on markets that have  historically experienced above average growth and are expected to continue to  exhibit strong growth in the future.  The company's ratings are further supported by its strong access to capital  which has been demonstrated in multiple forms throughout various market cycles.  In 2013, EQR greatly improved the quality of its portfolio by acquiring $9  billion of assets from Archstone Enterprise LP (Archstone) and selling almost  $4.5 billion of non-core assets in secondary markets. CREDIT METRICS NORMALIZED EQR's leverage was temporarily elevated as a result of funding the Archstone  transaction which closed in the first quarter of 2013 (1Q'13), but leverage has  subsequently returned to normalized levels via asset sales and same-store net  operating income (SSNOI) growth. Leverage as of March 31, 2014 was 6.8x,  consistent with Fitch's expectations pre-Archstone transaction. Fitch expects  the company's leverage to remain relatively steady from 2014 through 2016. Fitch  defines leverage as net debt divided by recurring operating EBITDA.  EQR's fixed-charge coverage for the trailing 12 months (TTM) ended March 31,  2014 was 2.7x which is strong for the rating and flat from 2.7x at year-end 2013  and up from 2.4x at year-end 2012. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as  recurring operating EBITDA less recurring capital improvements divided by cash  interest incurred and preferred distributions. EQR has benefited in recent years  by refinancing debt at historically low interest rates while achieving strong  SSNOI growth. Fitch expects the company's fixed-charge coverage will increase to  approximately 3.0x from 2014 through 2016. IMPROVED PORTFOLIO EQR closed on the acquisition of $9 billion of assets in core markets during the  1Q'13 via the Archstone transaction at a 4.9% capitalization rate. In 2013, the  company sold 94 apartment properties for an aggregate price of $4.5 billion at a  weighted average capitalization rate of 6%. The Archstone transaction bolstered  EQR's ownership of Class A properties in top markets such as San Francisco, New  York, Seattle and Boston, among others. These markets tend to exhibit relatively  strong long-term demand, limited buildable land and high construction costs,  curtailing potential supply growth.  Dispositions were focused on non-core markets including Phoenix, Atlanta and  suburban Maryland. The activity in 2013 accelerated what may have otherwise been  a multi-year process, as the company has historically been active in pruning its  portfolio. The higher quality portfolio is evidenced by an average rental rate  per unit of $2,138 in 1Q' 14 versus $1,737 in 4Q' 12, a 23.1% increase. EQR  purchased $149 million of properties and land in 1Q'14 and did not sell any  assets.  POSITIVE SAME-STORE RESULTS SSNOI growth remains strong relative to historical performance, although it has  been decelerating. EQR's SSNOI growth was 7.6% in 2012, 5% in 2013 and 4.4% in  1Q'14. Fitch anticipates that fundamentals will remain solid, but continue to  decelerate towards the longer term historical average of 2% to 3% SSNOI growth.  Fitch expects occupancy to remain in the 95%-96% range as the company continues  its focus on utilizing its industry-leading operational platform and technology  to optimize NOI. WEAK WASHINGTON DC EXPECTATIONS Washington, DC is EQR's largest market at 18.6% of stabilized NOI and may  continue to weigh on the overall portfolio performance. SSNOI decreased by 2.8%  in 1Q'14 versus 1Q'13. Although Washington, DC was one of the strongest real  estate markets during the global financial crisis, the metro has been hurt by an  abundance of new supply coupled with tepid job growth and uncertainty  surrounding near-term government job growth. UPTICK IN DEVELOPMENT EQR acquired several strong development sites through the Archstone transaction,  which should provide growth opportunities over the next several years. The  unfunded development pipeline as a percentage of gross assets was 4.1% as of  March 31, 2014, up from 2.8% at year-end 2013. The development projects are  focused in strong markets including New York, Seattle and Los Angeles. APPROPRIATE CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY EQR's unencumbered cash NOI stressed at a 7% capitalization rate covered its net  unsecured debt by approximately 2.8x as of March 31, 2014, pro forma the June  2014 bond deal. The company has consistently maintained adequate net UA/UD above  2.5x. The quality of the unencumbered portfolio is consistent with the quality  of the overall portfolio. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY; SUPPORTED BY CAPITAL ACCESS Fitch calculates that EQR's sources of liquidity (unrestricted cash,  availability under its unsecured revolving credit facility, expected retained  cash flows from operating activities after dividends and distributions) divided  by uses of liquidity (debt maturities, developments and recurring capital  expenditures) results in a liquidity coverage ratio of 1.3x for the period April  1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2015, pro forma for the June 2014 bond offerings. Over the  projected period, approximately $1.55 billion of unsecured debt will mature, and  Fitch expects nearly $1.4 billion of unfunded developments and recurring capital  expenditures will be incurred, which largely offset sources of liquidity.  Assuming EQR refinances 80% of its maturing secured debt liquidity coverage  would be 1.4x. Fitch notes EQR's demonstrated access to a variety of capital  channels including public unsecured debt, bank facilities, life insurance  company mortgage debt, agency-mortgage debt and equity, which mitigates  refinance risk.  AFFO PAYOUT RATIO POLICY REVISED EQR's annual dividend is based on 65% of the midpoint range of normalized funds  from operations (FFO) guidance. Prior to 2014, EQR had a policy in place in  which the company made three fixed dividend payments during the first three  quarters and one variable dividend payment in the fourth quarter. Under the  prior policy, the annual payout was also targeted to equal 65% of normalized  FFO. Fitch-calculated adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio was 70%  over the TTM ended March 31, 2014, indicative of strong internally generated  capital. PREFERRED UNIT NOTCHING The two-notch differential between EQR's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB+'.  Based on Fitch Research on 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis, dated Dec. 23, 2013 and available on Fitch's  Web site at www.fitchratings.com, these preferred securities are deeply  subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor  recoveries in the event of a corporate default. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that multifamily operating  fundamentals will continue to revert toward its long-term average. The company's  leverage should remain approximately at current levels in the short term, and  range between 6.5x and 7.5x over the longer term due to the timing of  developments. In addition, EQR has good access to capital, and should be able to  refinance maturing obligations due to strong coverage ratios.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on EQR's ratings or Outlook:  --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 7.0x (leverage was 6.8x for  the TTM ended March 31, 2014 and Fitch expects leverage to sustain between 6.5x  - 7.5x on a longer-term basis); --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 2.5x (coverage  was 2.7x for the TTM ended March 31, 2014 and is projected to improve); --Unencumbered asset coverage of net unsecured debt sustaining above 2.5x (pro  forma coverage as of March 31, 2014 was 2.8x).  The following factors may have a negative impact on EQR's ratings or Outlook:  --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 8.0x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 2.0x; --A liquidity coverage ratio sustaining below 1.0x.

6,"  * Kenya bank closures sparked merger talk* Rival snaps up bank in receivership* Equity bought Congo bank in 2015   (Adds details on expansion focus)By Duncan MiririNAIROBI, May 10 Kenya's Equity Group Holdings , the country's second largest bank by assets, reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter pretax profit and said growth would come from expanding its subsidiaries rather than new acquisitions.The failure of three small and mid-sized banks in Kenya in the past year has fueled talk of consolidation, with Equity's rival Kenya Commercial Bank planning to buy one of the institutions now under administration. But Equity Group Chief Executive James Mwangi said he would focus on expanding his bank's existing subsidiaries in the region. After acquiring a lender in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equity has already added a dozen new branches.""We will focus on these subsidiaries and make them substantial actors in the markets they are in,"" he told an investor briefing. Alongside Congo, his bank also has units in Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and South Sudan.Equity reported a pretax profit for the first quarter of 2016 of 7.3 billion shillings ($72.71 million), as it secured cheaper funds from shareholders and creditors while increasing lending to customers.The bank increased its borrowed funds by 76 percent to 46.0 billion shillings. The extra funds came with an interest rate of Libor plus one, or about 4 percent, and was lent to customers at prevailing double-digit rates, he said. Net loans increased by 22 percent from the same period last year to 275.0 billion shillings. Total costs grew 17 percent during the period as staff costs and loan loss provisions rose.Non-performing loans stood at 3.8 percent of the total, below the 8 percent recorded for the industry in March.($1 = 100.4000 Kenyan shillings)   (Reporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Edmund Blair and Louise Heavens)",2016-05-10,EQR,"Tue May 10, 2016 | 4:28am EDT",UPDATE 2-Kenya's Equity Group rules out acquisitions for now,http://www.reuters.com//article/eghl-results-idUSL5N1871M5?type=companyNews

11,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to the  senior unsecured notes due 2026 issued by ERP Operating, L.P., the operating  partnership of Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR). Net proceeds are expected to be  used for working capital and general corporate purposes. A full list of Fitch's  ratings for EQR follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect EQR's high-quality portfolio focused in core, coastal  markets as well as the company's market-leading capital access.  Portfolio Consolidated Within Core, Coastal Markets EQR disposed of non-core, primarily suburban assets, to Starwood completing the  exit from two markets and consolidating the portfolio within the markets that it  wishes to focus on long term. EQR's portfolio is now contained (98%) within  Boston, Los Angeles (including Orange Country), New York, San Diego, San  Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. markets, which generally have  above-average growth and liquidity through-the-cycle. Appropriate Credit Metrics For the trailing 12 months (TTM) ended June 30, 2016, EQR's leverage was 4.9x  and fixed charge coverage (FCC) was 3.3x; both of which are good for the rating.  Fitch assumes that EQR continues to maintain a robust development pipeline, such  that, combined with the company's special dividend to be paid in October 2016,  leverage will sustain in the 6.5x-7.0x range over the long term. Good Contingent Liquidity Fitch expects EQR will maintain unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt in  excess of 2.5x, consistent with prior periods. Based on location and age, the  quality of the unencumbered portfolio is consistent with that of the overall  portfolio. Preferred Unit Notching The two-notch differential between EQR's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and  preferred stock rating is consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate  entities with an IDR of 'A-'. Based on Fitch criteria in 'Treatment and Notching  of Hybrids in Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis, dated Feb. 29,  2016 and available at www.fitchratings.com, these preferred securities are  deeply subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result  in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate default. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that EQR's leverage should  sustain within the expected 6.5x-7x range over the longer term.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for EQR in our base case include: --SSNOI growth is in the low single digits for 2016-2017; --$500 million of annual acquisitions at a 5% capitalization rate and $500  million of annual dispositions at a 6% capitalization rate; --$600 million of development completions in each of the three years of the  forecast period;  --Adjusted funds from operations payout ratio between 69%-77%; --Secured debt is refinanced dollar-for-dollar in all three years of the  forecast period. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on EQR's ratings or Outlook: --Combined with EQR management's commitment, Fitch's expectation of leverage  sustaining below 6.5x throughout cycles (Fitch expects leverage to sustain  between 6.5x-7.0x on a longer-term basis; leverage was 4.9x as of June 30,  2016); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 3.5x (coverage was 3.3x for TTM  ended June 30, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on EQR's ratings or Outlook: --A deviation from EQR's current portfolio, capitalization or financing strategy  that could result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to  capital on an absolute or relative basis; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 7.5x; --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2.5x; --A liquidity coverage ratio sustaining below 1.0x. FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch currently rates EQR as follows: Equity Residential --Long-Term IDR 'A-'; --Unsecured revolving term loan 'A-'; --Preferred stock 'BBB'. ERP Operating Limited Partnership --Long-Term IDR 'A-'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'; --Commercial paper notes 'F2'.

As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and  distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to  three days earlier than to print subscribers.
