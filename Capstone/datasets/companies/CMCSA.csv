3,"  By Liana B. BakerLAS VEGAS Jan 8 Time Warner Cable Inc  shed 215,000 video subscribers in the fourth quarter but added about 40,000 high-speed Internet home customers, its chief financial officer said on Wednesday.That marked an improvement from the third quarter for a cable company that's the subject of takeover speculation. It lost 304,000 video customers, almost double the number Wall Street investors had expected, and 24,000 Internet users during that period. Chief Financial Officer Arthur Minson said the company has seen favorable trends so far in January, after having added 60,000 subscribers in December - 40,000 more than it managed in the same month a year earlier.""Seven of the last eight weeks have been a little bit better than last year so we have our mojo back on the subscriber side, and we're very optimistic as we head into the year,"" Minson told an investor conference held on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Liberty Media Corp, which has a large stake in cable operator Charter Communications Inc, has made no secret of its pursuit of No.2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, which is being circled by other suitors such as Comcast Corp  and privately held Cox, industry sources have said.Liberty Chairman John Malone argues new managers such as Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge could do a better job running the company, which has suffered some of the industry's worst subscriber losses in past years. Malone, whose Liberty Media owns 27 percent of Charter Communications, the country's fourth largest cable operator, is expected to make a bid to buy Time Warner Cable in coming weeks. Comcast, the nation's largest, is mulling a bid as well.If a company comes along with an offer that is better than the value the company can create on its own, ""that's something we need to take a hard look at,"" Minson said on Wednesday.But he added any deal would have a ""high bar.""",2014-01-08,CMCSA,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 12:12pm EST",UPDATE 1-Time Warner Cable staunched subscriber bleed in Q4,http://www.reuters.com//article/ces-timewarnercable-idUSL2N0KI1H820140108?type=companyNews

6,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 9 The U.S. Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether to take up closely watched cases involving moldy odor-emitting washing machines that may let the justices clarify when big-money class action cases can proceed.The nine justices are set to consider during their private conference on Friday three similar cases brought by consumers against Sears Roebuck and Co, Whirlpool Corp and BSH Home Appliance Corp over faulty front-loading washing machines.In recent years the court has issued a series of rulings making it harder for plaintiffs to bring big-money class actions. The washing machine cases could give the justices another opportunity to weigh under what circumstances courts should allow such cases to go forward.The lawsuits claimed that Kenmore-brand high-efficiency washers, manufactured for the Sears Holding Co  subsidiary by Whirlpool; Whirlpool's own brand washers; and those manufactured by BSH, a subsidiary of Germany-based BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgerate GMbH, were defective in part because they sometimes emitted unpleasant odors.Appeals court rulings allowing the claims against Whirlpool and Sears to proceed were thrown out by the Supreme Court last year after the justices ruled in March in favor of Comcast Corp  in a class action based on claims over how much the cable company charged a group of subscribers.Both the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then ruled in favor of consumers for a second time, saying the Comcast decision did not change the outcome. In the BSH case, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused a company request to appeal a district court judge's decision allowing the suit to proceed and, after the Comcast ruling was issued, declined to revisit the case.The legal issue before the justices is whether the individual claims are sufficiently similar to warrant class action certification, meaning that they can all be heard together in one big case.The Whirlpool case alone concerns 200,000 customers. It is one of 10 similar lawsuits consolidated before the same federal district court judge that Whirlpool is facing. If all those lawsuits are allowed to proceed, they would involve more than 4 million individual claims, Whirlpool says. Similar lawsuits against other manufacturers are also pending.Tim Bishop, a lawyer at Mayer Brown who represents Sears and Whirlpool, said in an interview that the vast majority of consumers experienced no problems with their washers. ""What's critical here is that the court not allow classes predominantly made of people who never suffered any problem,"" Bishop said.Scott Nelson, an attorney at consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said class certification in such cases is vital because it is the most efficient way to resolve mass actions. ""It would significantly impair the ability of consumers to pursue class remedies against widespread product defects if certification were not permitted in these kinds of cases,"" Nelson said in an email.A majority of the justices are viewed as being generally hostile to class actions, which are driven by specialist plaintiffs' lawyers who file claims on behalf of groups of consumers over such issues as defective products and unfair business practices.In the 2012-2013 term that ended in June, corporate defendants lost in only one of seven class-action-related cases the court took action on.If the court agrees to hear one or more of the washer cases, a ruling would be expected by the end of June.The cases are Sears v. Butler, 13-430, Whirlpool Corp v. Glazer, 13-431 and BSH v. Cobb, 13-138.",2014-01-09,CMCSA,"Thu Jan 9, 2014 | 4:48pm EST",Moldy washers cases put class actions in U.S. top court's spotlight,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-court-washers-idUSL2N0KJ1CS20140109?type=companyNews

9,"  By Alina Selyukh and David Ingram     WASHINGTON, Jan 14 A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday rejected federal rules that required Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally, a decision that could allow mobile carriers and other broadband providers to charge content providers for faster access to websites and services.     The Federal Communications Commission's open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, required Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges.     But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the rules, which were passed in late 2010 and have been challenged by Verizon Communications Inc.      Two judges, with partial support from a third, said the commission has the authority to regulate broadband access but had failed to show that it has a mandate to impose the anti-discrimination rules on broadband providers.     The ruling is a victory for Verizon and other broadband providers, who saw the FCC rules as government overreach into how they operate their networks.      The largest providers on Tuesday pledged that they would not restrict customers on the web, but consumer advocacy groups worry that Internet network owners may begin charging content providers such as Netflix Inc, Facebook Inc or sports broadcaster ESPN for faster Internet speeds.     President Barack Obama, whose 2008 campaign platform included net neutrality, will continue to work with the FCC, Congress and the private sector ""to preserve a free and open Internet,"" the White House said on Tuesday.     ""The President remains committed to an open Internet, where consumers are free to choose the websites they want to visit and the online services they want to use, and where online innovators are allowed to compete on a level playing field based on the quality of their products,"" the statement said.          POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS     This was the second time the court struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules. The FCC had classified broadband providers as information service providers as opposed to telecommunications service providers, and that distinction created a legal hurdle for the FCC's authority.     The FCC could appeal the ruling to the full appeals court or to the U.S. Supreme Court, something FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said he is considering as among ""all available options"" to ensure Internet networks remained free and open.      The FCC could also reclassify broadband providers to establish clear authority over them. Public interest groups have urged the FCC to do so, but the move would face opposition from Republicans and broadband providers.     ""Unless Congress acts, we should stay our hand and refrain from any further attempt to micromanage how broadband providers run their networks,"" Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said.     Democratic leaders in Congress on Tuesday urged the FCC to take advantage of the oversight power the court did recognize the FCC has over broadband and offered support in rewriting the rules. Republicans urged the FCC to stay hands-off.     Wheeler, who took helm at the FCC in November, recently has also suggested he could use existing FCC power to go after particular Internet service providers who violate the open Internet principles on a case-by-case basis.          PLEDGE TO OPEN INTERNET     Supporters of the FCC rules worry that now Internet providers such as Verizon or Comcast Corp would begin to charge content providers for faster access or slow down or even block access to particular sites.     ""That's just not the way the Internet has worked until now,"" Matt Wood, policy director at public interest group Free Press, told Reuters.     Video-streaming is by far the heaviest bandwidth hog on the Internet. Netflix and Google Inc's YouTube alone are estimated to account for more than half of all downstream Internet traffic at peak hours.     The debate is expected to intensify as American viewers increasingly take to the Internet for bandwidth-intensive media consumption, through services such as Pandora, Amazon Instant Video or Hulu.      Some worry that giving Internet providers more power to charge for heavy use of their networks could penalize startups and other less cash-flush companies, who might be unable to get their product in front of users, thwarting competition.     But opponents of the FCC's open Internet rules also argue the regulations inhibit investments and are not necessary to ensure unrestricted access to Internet content.     ""Today's decision will not change consumers' ability to access and use the Internet as they do now,"" Randal Milch, Verizon's general counsel and executive vice president for public policy, said in a statement.      ""Verizon has been and remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want. This will not change in light of the court's decision,"" Milch said.     In the case against the FCC, Verizon had argued the open Internet order violated the company's right to free speech and stripped control of what its networks transmit and how.     Prominent Internet providers Comcast and Time Warner Cable Inc also issued reassurances of their commitment to open Internet principles on Tuesday, as did the Broadband for America coalition representing various Internet service providers and CTIA, the wireless industry association.     But content providers remained uneasy.     ""Trust but verify,"" said Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association that represents content providers including Netflix, Google, Facebook and Amazon.com Inc .     ""With the Internet and our member companies growing and changing and startups constantly popping up, protections do need to be placed for consumers.""

10,"   By Liana B. Baker and Nicola Leske | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Charter Communications Inc on Monday formally offered to acquire larger rival Time Warner Cable for $37.3 billion, sparking what is likely to be a contentious battle for control of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.Charter, the No. 4 cable operator, proposed paying $132.50 per share - barely higher than where Time Warner Cable shares closed on Monday - consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock.Monday's offer is the boldest sign yet that cable billionaire and dealmaker John Malone thinks that new managers could do a better job running the company, which has fallen behind by not investing enough in taking on competitors and shifting to digital technology. Malone's Liberty Media Corp owns 27 percent of Charter.Including debt, the deal is worth $62.35 billion. Time Warner Cable shareholders would get 45 percent ownership in the combined company.The letter was Charter's third attempt to buy the company, according to its executives, and within a few hours of receiving it, Time Warner Cable's board rejected the offer as ""grossly inadequate.""""In essence, these guys are just trying to get a premium asset at a bargain basement price,"" said Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Rob Marcus in an interview. ""This makes the job of fending it off rather straightforward. Our shareholders will see it as what it is, an attempt to steal the company.""Marcus, who took over the top post on January 1 after eight years, said the board told Charter it was open to a price of $160 per share, consisting of $100 in cash and $60 per share of Charter's stock.Charter now plans to take the deal directly to Time Warner Cable shareholders, said Charter's CEO Tom Rutledge in an interview.""(Time Warner Cable) came back to us with a design to be dismissive. They have not engaged with us.

Rutledge said Time Warner Cable shareholders should be happy with the $83 per share cash component of the deal, since it is not that far off the stock price before the takeover speculation began six months ago.""The purpose of going to the public is to talk to Time Warner shareholders and to ask them to consider how valuable this deal is and to ask management and the board to engage,"" he said. He added that a proxy contest in which Time Warner Cable shareholders could vote in new directors friendly to a Charter bid was a possibility. The season for naming such rival board slates starts this week.Time Warner Cable's Chief Financial Officer Arthur Minson said he doubted Charter could launch a viable proxy fight.""Essentially what you'd have to do is try to get new board members who would have to breach their fiduciary duty by trying to sell the company to Charter cheaply,"" Minson said.Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said she expects Charter to raise its bid.""This is just the opening round of the negotiations,"" Yong said. ""This was Charter sending notice that they won't overpay."" Charter CEO Rutledge wouldn't comment on whether the company would consider a higher offer, and said the company would be disciplined about raising the bid.The letter was necessary, he said, because talks with the board had not progressed in the past six months. A hostile move is unusual, he admitted, in the clubby cable industry, where companies do not directly compete with each other.Rutledge said Charter had financing was in place and banks could sign commitment letters ""in a matter of days.""Charter stock was up 1.3 percent in after-hours trading while Time Warner Cable shares were up 1.8 percent at $135.ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said that ""we think an ultimate consolidation of the two companies would be beneficial for both sets of shareholders.""Rutledge declined to give an estimate on potential cost savings from a deal but said they were ""significant"" and his company had told Time Warner Cable what they were. Reuters has previously reported that Liberty management had told investors that synergies could be as high as $700 million.Liberty Media, Charter's largest stockholder, has the option to invest more equity in the company and wants to maintain its current 27 percent stake in the company.In a statement, a Liberty spokeswoman said, ""We support Charter's efforts and look forward to participating.""Rutledge said he was not in talks with Comcast Corp to get the No. 1 U.S. cable provider involved in the bidding process. Marcus at Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Comcast.""This is Charter bidding for Time Warner. That's the only discussion we have going,"" he said.Comcast, which has been seen as a candidate to bid alone or jointly for Time Warner Cable, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Time Warner has become one of the industry's weakest performers. Leichtman Research Group estimates that over the past two years, the company lagged rivals by losing nearly 10 percent of nearly 13 million video customers.Minson, the finance chief, said Time Warner Cable would increase its capital investment this year to improve the company's product and reliability.Charter said Goldman Sachs and Liontree Advisors were lead advisers. Guggenheim Securities was also a financial adviser to Charter.BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc are also financial advisers to Charter, and together with Goldman Sachs, are leading the financing for the transaction.

One possibility is that Charter buys all of Time Warner Cable and sells off some of its markets and subscribers to Comcast, one of the people said.It was not immediately clear which geographic markets are under discussion, but analysts have said that Comcast would be interested in Time Warner Cable's largest markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Dallas.The two companies held similar discussions late last year but those talks did not progress at that time. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter declined to comment.A successful tie-up would take out Comcast from the bidding for Time Warner Cable. Comcast, which has also evaluated a takeover bid for all of Time Warner Cable, was seen as the only likely suitor besides Charter. Analysts have said any attempt to merge the two largest cable operators, however, would face tough scrutiny from U.S. regulators.Securing backing from Comcast could also allow Charter, with a market capitalization of around $14 billion, to pay more for Time Warner Cable, which has a much larger market value of $38 billion.Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp, formally announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Monday, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low. Time Warner Cable instead made a counter proposal worth $160 per share, including $100 in cash and the rest in stock. A number of large Time Warner Cable shareholders would support a deal with Charter if the company sweetens its bid to $145 to $150 per share, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday.Charter has said the combined company may have to do ""swaps and divestitures"" of cable systems to serve regions more efficiently, according to its investor presentation on Wednesday.Comcast is not interested in doing swaps, but is seeking to buy systems, one of the people said.(Reporting by Soyoung Kim and Liana Baker in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Richard Chang)",2014-01-16,CMCSA,"Wed Jan 15, 2014 | 7:37pm EST","Exclusive: Charter, Comcast in renewed talks on Time Warner Cable bid",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-charter-comcast-idUSBREA0E1RX20140116?type=companyNews
15,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Any expansion by cable provider Comcast, including a deal with Charter Communications to split provider Time Warner Cable between them, would get a tough review from U.S. regulators, who might use the proposal to force Internet providers to treat all traffic equally, antitrust experts said.Charter Communications Inc reached out to Comcast Corp this week about teaming up to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, according to people familiar with the matter.Comcast is the top U.S. cable provider and video provider, Time Warner Cable is No. 2 and Charter is the fourth largest.The Federal Communications Commission and U.S. antitrust authorities will closely scrutinize any deal between the companies since it would involve a vast range of content, video, cable and telephony.But ultimately the government would be unlikely to try to stop a deal, said Robert Doyle, an antitrust expert at Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, who argued that some antitrust concerns could probably be remedied by strategic asset sales.""We don't think this is one that rises to the level of a challenge,"" he said, referring to a lawsuit that the Justice Department could file to stop a deal. Antitrust experts agreed, however, that any approval - particularly for Comcast - would almost certainly come with strings attached.In particular, the FCC could require the companies to treat all traffic the same, which means that companies such as Comcast with lots of content would be deterred from charging customers more if they watch movies or shows owned by other providers, such as Netflix Inc.That is no small matter. Netflix's share price fell following Tuesday's decision by U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to reject federal ""net neutrality"" rules that required Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally.Antitrust expert Jacqueline Grise of the law firm Cooley LLP said there was no guarantee a deal would be approved. The merger proposal would get a careful look from antitrust regulators, but the companies might craft a ""creative solution"" to satisfy the government, she said. The net neutrality condition is similar to one that Comcast was required to agree to in order to win approval for a $30 billion deal to take control of NBC Universal in 2011. Those conditions expire in 2018.Or, again echoing a condition in the 2011 deal, regulators could require Comcast to make content available to online providers, said Grise.Harold Feld of the group Public Knowledge, which campaigns for the preservation of an open Internet, agreed that the 2011 agreement could lead to similar conditions should the Time Warner transaction go ahead.

34,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The top U.S. communications regulator said on Tuesday he planned to set broad principles to guide how Internet service providers manage consumers' access to the Web and would pursue abuse or anti-competitiveness on a case-by-case basis.""The Internet is evolving so rapidly that we want to look at case sets as well as generic concept rules, so that what we don't want to do is to say that somehow we're smarter than the net, because I can stipulate to that, we aren't,"" said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler.""Case-by-case is a dynamic approach rather than, 'well, everybody's got to go through the eye of this needle.' And that's how we look to approach this,"" Wheeler said at the State of the Net conference in Washington.Two weeks ago a U.S. appeals court struck down the FCC's so-called open Internet rules that required Internet services providers to give consumers equal access to any Web content or applications without restrictions or varied charges. The ruling raised concerns among consumer advocates that it would start a practice among broadband providers, such as Verizon Communications Inc or Comcast Corp, to charge content providers, such as Netflix Inc or sports ESPN, for faster Internet speeds to access their websites and services.Verizon, which had brought the case to the court, and other large Internet providers have pledged not to restrict their customers' use of the web.Verizon had argued that the FCC rules, passed in late 2010, represented government overreach into how they operate their networks. Opponents of the rules also see them as government micro-managing of how the companies handle bandwidth-guzzling processes on their own networks. Video-streaming is by far the heaviest bandwidth hog on the Internet. Netflix and Google Inc's YouTube alone are estimated to account for more than half of all downstream Internet traffic at peak hours.""We believe that markets should be innovative and at the same point in time, we are not reticent to say, 'Excuse me, that's anti-competitive. Excuse me, that's self-dealing. Excuse me, this is consumer abuse,'"" Wheeler said.

35,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 28 The top U.S. communications regulator said on Tuesday he planned to set broad principles to guide how Internet service providers manage consumers' access to the Web and would pursue abuse or anti-competitiveness on a case-by-case basis.""The Internet is evolving so rapidly that we want to look at case sets as well as generic concept rules, so that what we don't want to do is to say that somehow we're smarter than the net, because I can stipulate to that, we aren't,"" said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler.""Case-by-case is a dynamic approach rather than, 'well, everybody's got to go through the eye of this needle.' And that's how we look to approach this,"" Wheeler said at the State of the Net conference in Washington.Two weeks ago a U.S. appeals court struck down the FCC's so-called open Internet rules that required Internet services providers to give consumers equal access to any Web content or applications without restrictions or varied charges. The ruling raised concerns among consumer advocates that it would start a practice among broadband providers, such as Verizon Communications Inc or Comcast Corp, to charge content providers, such as Netflix Inc or sports ESPN, for faster Internet speeds to access their websites and services.Verizon, which had brought the case to the court, and other large Internet providers have pledged not to restrict their customers' use of the web. Verizon had argued that the FCC rules, passed in late 2010, represented government overreach into how they operate their networks. Opponents of the rules also see them as government micro-managing of how the companies handle bandwidth-guzzling processes on their own networks.Video-streaming is by far the heaviest bandwidth hog on the Internet. Netflix and Google Inc's YouTube alone are estimated to account for more than half of all downstream Internet traffic at peak hours. ""We believe that markets should be innovative and at the same point in time, we are not reticent to say, 'Excuse me, that's anti-competitive. Excuse me, that's self-dealing. Excuse me, this is consumer abuse,'"" Wheeler said.The appeals court decision was the second time that the rules were struck down by the court, which on Jan. 14 ruled the FCC had failed to show that it has a mandate to impose the anti-discrimination rules on broadband providers, although it reaffirmed the FCC's authority to regulate broadband access.""I interpret what the court did as an invitation to us and that I intend to accept that invitation,"" Wheeler said on Tuesday.

""It's amazing.""The deal seems to have foiled the hopes of cable pioneer John Malone, who had waged a bitter eight-month battle to acquire TWC by Charter Communications, whose biggest shareholder is his Liberty Media Corp.Bondholders had feared a takeover by double-B rated Charter would have over-leveraged the new entity and sent some US$25bn of TWC bonds into junk-ratings territory.""Comcast is just a much better credit than Charter,"" said one syndicate manager. ""Simple as that."" Comcast is rated A3/A-/A- by Moody's, S&P and Fitch.""This deal won't change Comcast's rating,"" said Begley from Moody's, which announced it was taking TWC's Baa2 rating off review for downgrade and putting it on review for upgrade.""It's more a question of whether we would raise the TWC rating,"" he said.The deal still needs regulatory approval. CDS BETTER TOO TWC's credit default swaps - the cost, in other words, of insuring the company's debt against default - also tightened dramatically on Thursday in response.Its five-year CDS tightened around 108bp - a whopping 60% - to around 74bp in another sign of the favorable reaction to the deal, which caught many in the market by surprise. Malone's Charter Communications had been dialling up the pressure to get TWC in recent days.Charter offered US$132.50 per share in a deal that would have seen the combined company's leverage soar from around 3.5 times earnings to seven times.After TWC chairman and chief executive Robert Marcus and his management team rejected the Charter offer outright, Charter effectively declared war by nominating 13 independent directors to wipe out TWC's existing board.That move would have meant a full-scale proxy battle at TWC's shareholder meeting in May.Begley of Moody's said the tie-up with Comcast would likely generate more than double the cost savings of a deal with Charter.""We think the combined company could benefit from as much as US$1bn of cost savings, because Comcast's cable operating cash flow margins were about 500bp greater than TWC's last year,"" he said.The Comcast-TWC deal could also reap major commercial opportunities, as it will create a customer reach that would rival that of telecom giants AT&T and Verizon.Because Comcast's acquisition is intended to be an all-cash deal, some leveraged finance bankers will miss out on the fees from the debt that likely would have been needed to push through a deal with Charter.",2014-02-13,CMCSA,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 12:43pm EST",UPDATE 2-Time Warner Cable bonds snap tighter on Comcast deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/timewarnercable-credit-idUSL2N0LI10C20140213?type=companyNews

48,"   By Natalie Harrison  Feb 13 (IFR) - The cost of insuring Time Warner Cable's  debt against default fell sharply Thursday on news that Comcast Corp will buy the company for USD45.2bn.TWC's five-year credit default swaps (CDS) tightened 107bp to 74bp, while the company's bonds also rallied. One banker said TWC's 4.5% 2042 bonds were trading at a G-spread of 155bp from around 275bp before the Comcast news broke late on Wednesday. Time Warner Cable bonds have been trading more like a junk- rated company due to speculation that Charter Communications  would buy the business instead and load it up with debt.

56,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Diane BartzWASHINGTON Feb 13 Consumer advocates and U.S. lawmakers are worried that Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc will create a company with too much power to decide what Americans can watch on television and do online, and they expect intense regulatory scrutiny of the deal.Their concerns are intertwined with a recent court decision to overturn U.S. open Internet rules, which enforced the principle that Internet service providers should treat all Web traffic equally and should not give preferential treatment to their own movies, websites and content. Comcast, a major provider of Internet services, is committed to network neutrality until 2018.Separately, some media companies are concerned that Comcast would attempt to pay them less for their television shows, movies and other content, and have scheduled discussions with their attorneys with an eye toward lobbying regulators in Washington, said an antitrust attorney who spoke privately to protect business relationships.Comcast's proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable would combine the country's top two cable providers into a colossus that could reshape the U.S. pay television and broadband Internet industry. The deal would put Comcast in 19 of the nation's 20 largest TV markets.The deal will be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission and either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, the two agencies that share antitrust oversight in the United States.Eight antitrust experts interviewed by Reuters were split  on whether the merger would be approved. While Comcast has agreed to divest 3 million Time Warner Cable subscribers to keep their combined share of the U.S. pay television market at under 30 percent, it is unclear if that is enough to satisfy antitrust regulators, the experts said.A Comcast-Time Warner combination could be especially troubling in light of the court ruling that struck down FCC rules aimed at preventing broadband service providers from favoring one website over another, said Bert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute.""I hope it (the deal) is going to be fought tooth and nail,"" said Foer. ""You're creating this giant and you're doing it in the absence of a network neutrality rule. That's dangerous to democracy.""Foer said that agreements between Comcast and federal agencies that were put in place at the time of the Comcast and NBC Universal merger in 2011 to assure network neutrality would end in 2018 and were nothing more than a ""short-term bandage."" NOTHING BUT NET The advocacy group Consumer Watchdog bluntly called on the FCC and Department of Justice to block the creation of ""an unjustifiable monopoly"" that could raise prices to customers and would have ""no incentive to improve broadband service.""Antitrust authorities often challenge mergers or extract concessions when head-to-head competition would be diluted, although there are few areas of the United States where two cable companies compete directly.Reed Hundt, FCC chairman during the Clinton administration, said the current spotlight on the issue of open internet principles meant the commission would carefully examine the size and power of the new combined company.""The FCC will look at that broadband market share and they will say, 'Chairman Wheeler promised an open internet, what does this deal mean for that?'"" he said. ""The FCC will take a hard look at what is the durable, long-lasting, truly open internet commitment,"" Hundt said.Robert McDowell, a former FCC commissioner who voted to approve Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal, said the company could be asked to extend its net neutrality commitment, and if they do so, chances of approval are good. ""Comcast understood going into this that they'll have to agree to at least all of the same merger conditions that were put into the NBC merger deal plus some other things too. They will probably see an extension of the term of those conditions,"" McDowell said.HEARINGS AHOY Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, promised a hearing ""to carefully scrutinize the details of this merger and its potential consequences."" No date has been set so far.The Republican-run House Judiciary Committee is also expected to hold a hearing ""to ensure that the interests of American consumers and overall competition in the marketplace is protected.""Senator Al Franken was a critic of Comcast's previous deal with NBC Universal. On Thursday he wrote to both FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and top U.S. antitrust officials with ""serious reservations"" about Comcast's latest move. ""A handful of cable providers dominate the market, leaving consumers with little choice but to pay high bills for often unsatisfactory service. I am concerned that Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner would only make things worse,"" wrote Franken, a Minnesota Democrat.The Justice Department has stopped a couple of notable deals recently, particularly a proposed merger of AT&T with T-Mobile USA. Other deals it sued to stop - like the Anheuser-Busch InBev  deal to buy Grupo Modelo and US Airways merger with American Airlines - were allowed to go ahead after the companies pledged big asset sales.The companies maintain that customers will benefit from the merger as services and technology improves.""This transaction is pro-consumer, pro-competitive and approvable,"" said Comcast executive vice president David Cohen. However, ""we're certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or even increase less rapidly,"" he added.NEGOTIATING BEHEMOTH Wall Street analysts said the deal would give Comcast a stronger hand in negotiations with content providers such as Walt Disney Co, CBS Corp and Fox. Media companies collectively receive billions of dollars a year from pay TV operators for their programming.""Content providers would face a negotiating behemoth with close to 30 million subscribers that, oh by the way, is vertically integrated with a direct competitor (NBC Universal),"" Moffett Nathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note to clients. ""Expect them to complain vehemently.""A Disney spokesman did not respond to requests for comment, and Fox had no comment. CBS' chief executive Les Moonves said in a CNBC interview that ""if you have the right content, you're always going to have the (pricing) power.""The deal has generated ""considerable opposition"" among programmers who fear they will be offered less money for their content, said the antitrust attorney.""This is a very problematic deal. ...

57,"  (Repeats with no changes (By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK Feb 13 Talks between Comcast Corp  and Charter Communications Inc over how they could together buy Time Warner Cable Inc quickly soured as the two bickered over price and the feasibility of engineering a split of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp, had been pursuing Time Warner for months, but was not making any headway as its larger rival - nearly three times its size by market value - asked for $8 billion more than what it had offered.But Comcast actually believed Time Warner Cable's $160 per share counter to Charter's $132.50 per share bid was reasonable, several people familiar with the situation said on Thursday. At the same time, it worried that splitting a public company with assets in multiple markets and millions of subscribers would be tough, made even harder by the acrimony that had built up over the past eight months between Charter and Time Warner Cable.On Feb. 4 Comcast and Charter met in a last-ditch attempt to see if they could work out their differences, the sources said. They could not.So later in the day, Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts called Time Warner Cable's Rob Marcus to say that he was ready to make a bid for all of Time Warner Cable at a figure close to the asking price, according to the sources.On Thursday, the two announced a $45.2 billion all-stock deal to create a cable behemoth, with an empire stretching from New York to Los Angeles. The deal is the largest M&A transaction so far this year and the third-largest in the media and entertainment sector of all time, according to Thomson Reuters data.If the deal closes, it could give Comcast unprecedented leverage in negotiations with content providers and advertisers. For that reason it is also likely to come under keen regulatory scrutiny.Representatives for Time Warner Cable, Comcast and Charter declined to comment on details of the negotiations. All the sources asked not to be named because the conversations were private.Interviews with several people who were intimately involved in negotiations, however, paint a picture of what went on behind the scenes over the last few days as the deal came together and how Charter lost a prize that it had worked so hard to win.In some ways, these sources said, the two companies have Charter to thank for the deal. Although Comcast, the top U.S. cable operator, had always been intrigued by the idea of buying Time Warner Cable, a deal was not on its list of priorities until Charter put it in play last summer. In the end, one of the sources said, all Charter did was ""wake up the sleeping beast.""John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co hedge fund is one of Time Warner Cable's top 10 shareholders, said of Comcast in an interview with Reuters: ""They're gentlemen, old school businessmen. But they're also aggressive.""Charter's next steps were not clear on Thursday. It had nominated a slate of directors to replace the entire board of Time Warner Cable on Tuesday, but was kept in the dark as its prize was slipping away to another buyer. Time Warner Cable CEO Marcus, in the job for just 44 days, said in an interview that the deal, while good for his shareholders, is bittersweet for him.""I was looking forward to thousands of days, not tens of days doing this job,"" Marcus said.Still, the former Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP M&A lawyer who over the past eight years had served in various roles at Time Warner Cable, including its top dealmaker and chief operating officer, just pulled off one of his largest deals ever. And thanks to his tenure at the company, he could take home some $50 million after it closes.""Sometimes you don't have control over how things unfold,"" Marcus said.THE FINAL DAYS Things moved quickly over the last 10 days, the sources said. After months of pursuing Time Warner Cable without success and speaking informally with Comcast last year, Charter approached Comcast once again in the middle of January about teaming up.The idea was for Charter to buy all of Time Warner Cable and later sell off select systems to Comcast.Comcast, with a $138 billion market value, dwarfs Charter's $13.43 billion, as well as Time Warner Cable's $40 billion market capitalization as of Thursday.But as the two discussed options, Comcast became increasingly uncomfortable with Charter's hostile approach and more skeptical that Charter would be able to win Time Warner Cable's blessing with its offer, the sources said.Comcast also became increasingly excited about the prospect of buying Time Warner Cable on its own.Comcast felt that it could pay between $150 and $160 per share for Time Warner Cable, the sources said. Initially it was also willing to put cash along with stock into the deal. But one of the sources said Time Warner Cable wanted an all-stock deal and for Comcast to use the cash instead to initiate a large share buyback program after the transaction closed to boost the share price of the combined company.That meant Time Warner Cable shareholders would end up owning 23 percent of the combined company and also not have to pay taxes as a result of the transaction.In return for paying the price, however, Roberts had one demand: Comcast would not pay a reverse break-up fee, or the penalty that a buyer pays to the seller if it fails to close a deal, typically because of regulatory reasons, the sources said.The request was unusual for a deal that was sure to face regulatory scrutiny. A few years ago, for example, AT&T Inc  agreed to pay as much as $6 billion as reverse breakup fee, paid in cash and spectrum, as part of its deal to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion. The deal was shot down by regulators, and AT&T had to pay the fees.Some lawyers said such fees are rare in the cable industry, however.""These businesses operate fairly independent enough and if this deal does not get approved, there is not going to be that much damage to Time Warner Cable,"" said Robert Townsend, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster's global M&A practice.Comcast CEO Roberts said he did not recall ever agreeing to a reverse termination fee, not even in its $30 billion buyout of majority of NBC Universal in 2009.Time Warner Cable's board determined that the proposed transaction should get regulatory approval because the companies do not operate in the same markets, the sources said. They agreed to Comcast's condition.Talks were further aided by the fact that executives from the two companies knew each other and were friendly, the sources said. They also had worked together on a deal previously.In 2006, the two split up bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications in a complicated $17.6 billion transaction. Marcus was Time Warner's lead negotiator on the deal at that time.This time around, the two chief executives, along with Comcast Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis and Time Warner Cable's Arthur Minson, negotiated key points of the deal by phone as well as in-person meetings in New York, without relying much on advisers.The two sides agreed a final deal price of $158.82 per share on Monday morning, and the board of each company approved the transaction on Wednesday evening.""Throughout the whole process with Charter, I consistently said one thing - insufficient value. They didn't value the unique asset that was Time Warner Cable,"" Marcus said.

59,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Consumer advocates and U.S. lawmakers are worried that Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc will create a company with too much power to decide what Americans can watch on television and do online, and they expect intense regulatory scrutiny of the deal.Their concerns are intertwined with a recent court decision to overturn U.S. open Internet rules, which enforced the principle that Internet service providers should treat all Web traffic equally and should not give preferential treatment to their own movies, websites and content. Comcast, a major provider of Internet services, is committed to network neutrality until 2018.Separately, some media companies are concerned that Comcast would attempt to pay them less for their television shows, movies and other content, and have scheduled discussions with their attorneys with an eye toward lobbying regulators in Washington, said an antitrust attorney who spoke privately to protect business relationships.Comcast's proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable would combine the country's top two cable providers into a colossus that could reshape the U.S. pay television and broadband Internet industry. The deal would put Comcast in 19 of the nation's 20 largest TV markets.The deal will be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission and either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, the two agencies that share antitrust oversight in the United States.Eight antitrust experts interviewed by Reuters were split on whether the merger would be approved. While Comcast has agreed to divest 3 million Time Warner Cable subscribers to keep their combined share of the U.S. pay television market at under 30 percent, it is unclear if that is enough to satisfy antitrust regulators, the experts said.A Comcast-Time Warner combination could be especially troubling in light of the court ruling that struck down FCC rules aimed at preventing broadband service providers from favoring one website over another, said Bert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute.""I hope it (the deal) is going to be fought tooth and nail,"" said Foer.

61,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Comcast Corporation's (Comcast) benchmark size, senior unsecured notes maturing  2024 and 2044. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general  corporate purposes which may include the repayment of amounts outstanding under  the company's commercial paper program and a portion of NBCUniversal's $900  million principal amount of 2.1% notes due April 2014. The notes will be  guaranteed by Comcast's subsidiaries included in the company's cross-guaranty  structure. The Rating Outlook for all of Comcast's ratings is Stable. As of Dec.  31, 2013 Comcast had approximately $48.6 billion of debt outstanding, including  $11.2 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal). KEY RATING DRIVERS --Comcast's pending merger with TWC is strategically sound and creates  significant opportunity to realize operating and capital spending efficiencies  with minimal execution risk and enables the combined entity to effectively  compete on a national scale for incremental commercial segment business.   --The all-stock consideration structure of the merger with TWC is not expected  to have a material impact on Comcast's credit protection measures. --Comcast's capital structure and financial strategy remains intact and centered  on reducing leverage to its target of between 1.5x and 2.0x.  --Fitch does not expect any material change to Comcast's capital allocation  strategy over the near term and believes there is sufficient capacity within the  ratings to accommodate a contemplated expansion of Comcast's share repurchase  authorization. Comcast's ratings reflect its strong competitive position as one of the largest  video, high-speed Internet and phone providers to residential and business  customers in the U.S. and the company's compelling subscriber clustering  profile. In Fitch's view, NBCUniversal's size, scale, leading brand positions,  and diversity of operations and business risk as one of the world's leading  media and entertainment companies, all lower the business risk attributable to  Comcast's credit profile. These factors also create new avenues for revenue and  cash flow growth while limiting the near-term impact on Comcast's balance sheet  and credit profile.  The pending merger with TWC enables Comcast to extend its operating strategies  and technology roadmap into TWC's operations, creating the opportunity to  realize material operating cost and capital spending efficiencies.  Fitch points  out that Comcast's cable-segment EBITDA margin was nearly 500 basis points  higher than the comparable TWC EBITDA margin during the year ended 2013.   Comcast's ability to successfully establish its key operating strategies within  TWC's legacy operations creates a potential $1 billion EBITDA benefit for the  combined entity.  Additionally, the national scope of the combined entities'  cable infrastructure will position the company to effectively compete for a  higher tier commercial business.  Combined commercial-segment revenues totaled  approximately $5.5 billion during 2013, representing the second-fastest growing  business segment of the combined entity.  Fitch anticipates the merger with TWC  will close by the end of 2014.   Fitch estimates that approximately $73.6 billion of debt and preferred stock was  outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2013 on a pro forma basis translating into pro forma  leverage of 2.5x.  The pro forma leverage represents a modest increase relative  to Comcast's actual leverage of 2.2x (Fitch calculation).  Fitch expects  Comcast's credit profile will strengthen on a pro forma basis with consolidated  pro forma leverage of 2.2x by year-end 2014, approaching 2x by the end of 2015  in the absence of significant cost or operating synergies. Comcast's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong based  on Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of free cash flow (FCF). Fitch acknowledges that Comcast's share  repurchase program represents a significant use of cash; however, Fitch believes  that the company would reduce the level of share repurchases should the  operating environment materially change, in order to maximize financial  flexibility. The liquidity position is further supported by cash on hand (which  totaled $1.7 billion on a consolidated basis as of Dec. 31, 2013) and $4.7  billion of collective available borrowing capacity (as of Dec. 31, 2013) from  Comcast's two revolving credit facilities. Commitments under Comcast's $6.25  billion revolver will expire during June 2017 while the commitments related to  NBCUniversal Enterprise's $1.35 billion revolver expire during March 2018.  Comcast's debt maturity profile is well-laddered and within Fitch's FCF  expectation. Maturities total approximately $1.9 billion during 2014 (including  $900 million at NBCUniversal Media) excluding outstanding commercial paper,  followed by $3.4 billion during 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES: --A positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast achieving and  committing to a financial policy consistent with an 'A' rating, including  maintaining its leverage below 1.5x on a sustained basis. Comcast would need to  demonstrate that its operating profile will not materially decline in the face  of competition and less than robust housing and employment conditions.  --Negative rating actions would likely coincide with discretionary actions of  Comcast's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a more  aggressive financial strategy, or event-driven merger and acquisition activity,  that drive leverage beyond 2.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan.

62,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Comcast Corp said on Thursday it plans to submit documents on its proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc to U.S. regulators by the end of March, when antitrust and public interest reviews will be launched.The proposed merger between the two biggest U.S. cable service providers is expected to draw intense scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, which reviews whether deals are in the public interest, and either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, which share antitrust oversight.The deal has drawn concern from consumer advocates and some lawmakers who worry that the new company's size would give it too much power to decide what Americans can watch on TV and do online.Comcast is targeting the end of March to submit its application to the FCC, spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said. Companies usually have 30 business days to file with the FCC after a deal's announcement.Around the same time, Comcast will also submit documents asking antitrust regulators for approval, she said. The FTC and Justice Department will then determine which agency will take the lead on the review. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Justice Department antitrust chief William Baer sent a rare public signal of skepticism earlier this month on a potential deal between wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc. No deal has been officially proposed yet between those companies.On Thursday, Wheeler was asked whether he had similar concerns about the proposed tie-up between Comcast and Time Warner Cable.""It was an interesting situation in that Sprint/T-Mobile actually came to us and said: 'We're thinking about this, what do you think about it?' Comcast never did,"" Wheeler said. ""So I'm in a position right now of sitting and waiting for Comcast to file their requisite documents so that we can begin our consideration. ""We'll wait to give it a full, fair, open hearing,"" he added.Comcast, which pledged upfront to several concessions that federal regulators were likely to request, has maintained that customers will benefit from the merger as services and technology improve. ""All we can ask for is a full, fair, and open hearing - and I think Chairman Wheeler's message is that is what we will get,"" Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen said on Thursday.""In the broadband space and in the video space, we're not depriving a single consumer in America of a choice that he or she has today,"" Cohen told reporters after the deal was announced last week.The chief executive officer of DirecTV, which competes against Comcast and Time Warner Cable in the pay TV market, on Thursday urged careful regulatory scrutiny of their proposed deal, saying it might create an ""effective broadband monopoly"" in two-thirds of the United States.Mike White, the DirectTV CEO, said his company, the nation's largest satellite TV provider, was still determining what position to take with regulators who will review the merger.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh in Washington; Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Cooney, Jonathan Oatis and Leslie Adler)",2014-02-20,CMCSA,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 6:41pm EST",Comcast filings with regulators expected at end of March,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-comcast-timewarner-idUSBREA1J2AX20140220?type=companyNews

65,"  By Jack Shafer  Feb 20 Set aside for a moment everything you've read about the $45 billion bid Comcast made for Time Warner Cable last week. Blank from your mind Paul Krugman's prediction that the deal will result in a Comcast monopoly. Pretend you didn't read the New York Times piece about the acquisition presaging further consolidation in the cable market, with Charter Communications picking off Cox Communications. Thump yourself with a neuralyzer, if you can, and remove from your memory the protest against the transaction by Michael Copps, former Federal Communications Commission commissioner.  Finally, purge from your bile ducts the seething hatred you hold for Comcast and Time Warner Cable, those hurtful memories of rising bills, rotten service, and phone-tree purgatory and allow me to persuade you that we're having the wrong telecom argument when we quarrel about mergers and acquisitions. Instead of blocking mergers or beating concessions out of the telecom giants, let's give them the treatment they really fear: Policies that encourage the entry of competitors, which are the bane of every monopolist.  If you hate your cable television company - to simplify a half-century of history - blame it on the government. In the founding days of the industry, local municipalities mistakenly insisted that cable TV was a ""natural monopoly"" that must be regulated like telephone service. In nearly every case, the selection of a cable operator was a political one, with the most flattering supplicant winning the right from city councils to string wire on utility poles and cross right-of-ways to sell cable service. The municipalities collected franchise fees from the cable companies, shook them down for sweeteners like municipal channels and public access studios, regulated their rates, and required the operators to wire all if not most of their jurisdiction.  Of course, cable TV wasn't a natural monopoly but a government-made one. By the time Congress and the courts reduced the power of the municipalities to regulate cable in the 1980s and the 1990s, the die was cast. Sure, new cable operators could apply to compete, but they still had to run the regulatory maze and face well-entrenched government-made monopolists. In many cases, the new entrants have been companies that already provide the area with telephone service and know how to play the regulatory game, such as Verizon (Fios) and AT and T (U-Verse).  By legislating local cable monopolies, the municipalities inadvertently helped create national oligopolies. Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and the other large cable firms grew to market dominance by purchasing existing franchises, market by market. Such a quick roll-up would not have been possible if regulators had pursued policies easing the way for new entrants. The unfettered growth created huge valuations. Indeed cable companies currently sell for $4,000 to $5,000 per subscriber (the Time Warner Cable deal is just under that). That's right Comcast customer, your cable TV and Internet subscription is worth at least $4,000 to them! But just as New York City taxi-cab medallions could not sell for $1 million if new cabs could freely enter the market, cable TV companies would not sell for such premiums if they were competing in a freer market. New entrants would progressively batter their power to price. In the cable industry, the regulatory scheme has been captured by the regulated, which is an old story.  The picture isn't as disparaging as I paint. Since some of the barriers to entry have been removed, the telephone companies have captured about 10 percent of the pay-TV market, according to the Wall Street Journal. (Oh, you hate Verizon's Fios? It's been pretty good to me since I switched from Comcast: Faster Internet, more channels, better picture, lower price, and better customer service. But go ahead and hate Fios if you want to.) Satellite broadcasting - a lightly regulated enterprise - commands about 35 percent of all customers, leaving conventional cable with about 52 percent, down from about 69 percent in 2007. All have gained Internet subscribers since 2007, the Journal reports.  Rather than drag Comcast around by the ear, demanding this concession and that concession for the right to devour Time Warner Cable, policymakers would be smarter to remove the regulatory barriers that benefit Comcast and other legacy cable providers. In Kansas City, Provo, Utah, and Austin, Texas, regulators have done just that, trimming red tape to allow Google to bring super-high-speed Internet and TV service to the choice neighborhoods it covets at competitive prices. (The cities were seduced by the promise of Internet speeds that will be 100 times greater than what the average American consumer gets when he buys something billed as ""high-speed."") Yesterday, the company announced similar expansion to nine more cities.  The brilliant thing for consumers about Google's entry - dare I use the I-word and the D-word in one sentence? - is its penchant for innovation and disruption. Where the traditional cable companies have traditionally dithered about improving their services, Google has routinely leapfrogged its competitors, sometimes destroying previously lucrative businesses like GPS navigation by turning them into ""free"" (advertising-supported) services. One example of Google's forward thinking is that it's not offering telephone service to customers, thinking they'll use their mobile phones or attach VOIP hardware to their connections if they want a land-line replacement. Given a freer rein than traditional cable companies, Google is more likely to bring imaginative new products to its customers. My guess is that Google looks at those $4,000-per-subscriber valuations and sees a market ripe for their brand of capitalistic pillage.  Obviously, Google can't combat the cable companies in every market, but the Google approach can. If Google succeeds in its pilot cities - and I have no doubt it will - others will imitate its red-tape cutting maneuvers, possibly beating it to the choice markets it has selected. The products and services Google introduces will be imitated, creating a spillover effect in markets it doesn't enter. Existing cable companies will, one hopes, get their competitive acts together to counteract Google and its imitators. We all win! (Except the current shareholders of the legacy cable companies.)  Beyond the Google example, cable and Internet customers could be better served by the radical allocation of spectrum to wireless broadband users, as former FCC Chief Economist Thomas W. Hazlett has written. We should applaud entrepreneurs like Barry Diller and Chet Kanojia for Aereo, which is billed as a way to get clear reception of broadcast channels but is really Diller's way of providing original TV programming to viewers without having to negotiate with cable companies. (Remember, Diller created the Fox network for Rupert Murdoch and built out the USA network.)  While we're at it, we should applaud inventors like those working for Steve Perlman, who year after year find new ways to milk more radio bandwidth out of the same spectrum. Perlman, profiled in yesterday's New York Times, promises to bring faster wireless to mobile devices with his new technology. Conceivably, Perlman's wireless technology could replace the cable that provides your TV and Internet service.  So let Comcast spend $4,000 per subscriber to purchase Time Warner Cable. As long as policymakers encourage new entrants into the company's markets, Comcast will come to regret it.

69,"   By David Ingram | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON If U.S. antitrust enforcers decide to challenge the proposed $45 billion merger of Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc, it may be because of an idea with a funny-sounding name that has been gaining currency in government offices.The idea is monopsony power, the mirror image of the better-known monopoly power but a concept that is just as old.A monopoly is one seller with many buyers, while a monopsony (pronounced muh-NOP-suh-nee) is one buyer with many sellers. A textbook example is a milk processor that is the only option for dairy farmers to sell to, and that then forces farmers to sell for less.The U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division is all but certain to examine the potential monopsony power, or buying power, that a combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would have over media companies that provide TV programming, according to lawyers with expertise in antitrust law.The combined company would have a near 30 percent share of the U.S. pay television market, Comcast has said, as well as be a major provider of broadband Internet access.""It's a potential concern,"" said Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who is now a University of Tennessee professor and of counsel at the law firm GeyerGorey.""It's not as much in the limelight as monopoly, but monopsony has always been part of the antitrust laws,"" he said.Monopsony concerns tend to have a lower profile because they may not directly affect consumers. The harm to the market comes if suppliers go out of business, which reduces society's overall output, or if suppliers have less money to invest in new technology, equipment and expansion.Consumers may even benefit from monopsony if a company cuts its prices, although the savings are not always passed along. In the case of Comcast-Time Warner Cable, it could be argued that a more powerful pay TV operator may be able to lower fees if it can negotiate lower programming costs with the TV studios.""It's a monopsony problem when it threatens to decrease output. If all it does is reduce cost, it's a good thing,"" said Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa law professor.He added: ""Monopsony is one of those things that is frequently claimed and rarely proven."" GETTING BETTER DEALS Princeton University economist Paul Krugman criticized the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger in a February 15 post on his New York Times blog titled, ""Monopsony Begets Monopoly, And Vice Versa.""Comcast ""is able to extract far more favorable deals from content providers than smaller rivals,"" Krugman wrote. ""And if it's allowed to acquire (Time Warner Cable), it will be even more advantaged.""Others say it is hard to see how a media conglomerate like Walt Disney Co, or even smaller content providers, would feel much pain from slightly lower payments or from one fewer way to distribute shows.""Given the rapidly increasing number of avenues for distributing content, I think that's far-fetched,"" said Jeffrey Eisenach, an economic consultant who has done work for Comcast in the past but is not working on the merger.Asked about the possibility of a monopsony challenge, a spokeswoman for Comcast pointed to a 2009 federal appeals court ruling that said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that the communications marketplace was competitive. The ruling threw out a regulation designed to limit market share among companies such as Comcast to 30 percent. ""Today there are even more types of video competition than when the court threw out the case,"" Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice wrote in an email.She said TV networks can distribute their programs to consumers in many ways, such as DirecTV's satellite service or Verizon's FiOS video service. There are also video streaming sites, such as Netflix and Hulu.Antitrust experts said Comcast and Time Warner Cable may be able to address some government concerns by extending the terms of a settlement that Comcast signed with the Justice Department in 2011 to secure approval to buy NBC Universal. For instance, Comcast promised to make programming, such as cable news channel CNBC, available to competing pay-TV companies.ANTITRUST STANDARD Review of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal is expected to take several months. Either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission will examine it for antitrust compliance, while the Federal Communications Commission will rule on whether it is in the public interest.The antitrust standard is whether the deal would substantially lessen competition. If government lawyers believe it would, they could sue in federal court. Sometimes even the threat of a suit is enough to scuttle a deal. Monopsony has been getting more attention within the Justice Department. A senior staff economist, Gregory Werden, wrote a paper in 2007 arguing that the original U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, was designed to protect sellers as well as end-user consumers.In 2010, the department drew attention to monopsony concerns when it released revised guidelines for corporations considering mergers. The guidelines replaced a document from 1997 and included an expanded discussion of monopsony.When suppliers do not have ""numerous attractive outlets for their goods or services,"" the two agencies ""may conclude that the merger of competing buyers is likely to lessen competition in a manner harmful to sellers,"" the guidelines said.Wal-Mart Stores Inc has routinely faced criticism that it has monopsony power because of its ability to drive down the prices it pays suppliers. But the retail giant's defenders say there is little evidence that suppliers are hurt, and Wal-Mart's low prices for customers also make it popular.Monopsony is most often an issue in agriculture.In 1999, the Justice Department feared that Cargill Inc's plan to acquire part of Continental Grain Co would concentrate the market for buying corn, soybeans and wheat, and it approved the acquisition only after the global commodities trader agreed to sell off grain elevators.The Justice Department sued in 2008 to block the combination of two of the top four U.S. beef packers, JBS SA and National Beef Packing Co, saying it would have hurt both cattle suppliers and consumers. The companies abandoned the deal four months later.In the context of the pay TV market, a key question is how a channel would fare if it were not carried by a merged Comcast-Time Warner Cable.""If you're told you can't reach 30 percent of a potential market, how significant is that for a competitor who wants to produce? That's a technical question,"" said Peter Carstensen, a University of Wisconsin law professor.""You've got to put the data together. You've got to come up with a plausible story, with witnesses, with the econometrics, to make that case,"" he said, ""and whether that can be done convincingly, I don't know.""(Additional reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Howard Goller and Tiffany Wu)",2014-02-21,CMCSA,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 3:21pm EST","Not a typo, monopsony in spotlight in U.S. cable deal",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-comcast-monopsony-analysis-idUSBREA1K1VI20140221?type=companyNews

79,"   By Lawrence Hurley and Jonathan Stempel | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The Supreme Court gave consumers a victory on Monday by allowing them to proceed with class-action lawsuits alleging that millions of front-loading washing machines they bought suffered from mold or musty odors.By refusing to hear the appeals in three lawsuits, the court allowed claims against Whirlpool Corp, Sears Holdings Corp and a unit of Germany's BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete GmbH to move forward as class actions in lower courts.Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers had urged the Supreme Court to hear the companies' appeals.The court has in recent years cut back on the ability of plaintiffs to pursue class actions, which can lead to bigger jury awards and settlements than individual lawsuits, in cases against AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.At issue in the washing-machine cases was whether claims about alleged defects in Whirlpool washers, Kenmore-brand washers made for Sears by Whirlpool, and BSH Home Appliance Corp washers were similar enough to be heard at the same time.Consumers said that the machines did not clean themselves properly, while the companies said only a small number of machines had problems.Whirlpool said in a statement that it would keep vigorously defending against the lawsuits, which it called an ""attack"" on American manufacturing. ""The facts remain unchanged: the vast majority of class members have not been harmed and never will be,"" it said.Sears said in a statement that it disagreed with the decision and that an ""overwhelming majority"" of owners of its Kenmore front-loading washers were pleased with them.BSH declined to comment.

85,"  By Liana B. Baker and Lisa RichwineFeb 24 Netflix Inc, which agreed to pay Comcast Corp for faster video delivery, may have to make similar arrangements with other broadband providers to ensure customers get trouble-free access to its streaming movies and TV shows.Verizon Communications' chief executive said on Monday he expects Netflix will pay the telecom company for faster speeds after Netflix customers complained about slow connections to Verizon's FiOS service.AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said in a statement on Monday that ""we're in discussions with Netflix to establish a more direct connection between our networks, similar to agreements we have with others, so that AT&T broadband customers who use Netflix can enjoy an even better video experience.""Talks with telecom companies that provide broadband Internet access gained momentum after Sunday, when Netflix agreed to pay Comcast Corp for faster speeds.Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould said the agreement with Comcast removed uncertainty and likely involved small payments since Netflix agreed voluntarily to the arrangement. ""This is probably a template for the deal that will get done with other broadband providers,"" said Gould, who has an ""equal weight"" rating on Netflix shares. ""We are assuming the payments are not going to materially change the business model.""Netflix shares rose 3.4 percent to close at a record $447 on Nasdaq.Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said on CNBC, where he discussed Verizon's talks with Netflix, that the two companies have been in negotiations for a year.These deals hinge on whether Netflix can set up direct access to Verizon, known as an ""interconnect agreement,"" rather than go through a third party. Verizon provides millions of U.S. customers with its FiOS broadband service and Netflix speeds have slowed on that network in recent months, leading to complaints. Interconnect deals have been common in the broadband industry for years. Comcast has agreements in place with Google Inc and Yahoo Inc, according to a source familiar with the matter.Many providers including Cox, Cablevision and Google Fiber directly connect to the Netflix network through a service the streaming company developed called Open Connect. Those providers have not seen their speeds deteriorate in recent months.But others, including AT&T and Verizon, have opted not to use Open Connect. Shares of Cogent Communications, one of the companies that took care of the Internet traffic exchange between the Comcast and Netflix networks, fell 7 percent on Monday as investors worried that these deals would take away Cogent's business.Cogent's chief executive Dave Schaeffer played down the effect of the Comcast-Netflix agreement on its business and reaffirmed the company's annual revenue forecast.""It doesn't mean that revenue goes away from Cogent. It just means that some of the growth in revenue may not occur through us,"" he said.McAdam, the Verizon CEO, spoke out in favor of telecom companies signing deals with Netflix.""It shows you don't necessarily need a lot of regulation in a dynamic market here. Doing these commercial deals will get good investment and good returns for both parties,"" McAdam said.Asked about discussions with Verizon or other providers, Netflix spokesman Joris Evers said ""we talk to all major ISPs all the time to make sure Netflix users get the best possible experience.""",2014-02-25,CMCSA,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 8:19pm EST","UPDATE 2-Netflix may need to pay AT&T, Verizon for faster speeds",http://www.reuters.com//article/verizon-fios-idUSL1N0LT1TK20140225?type=companyNews

93,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 27 U.S. Senator Al Franken warned telecommunications regulators on Thursday that Comcast Corp's proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc  could mean ""higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service for consumers.""Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, said on Feb. 13 it had agreed to acquire No. 4 Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion. The proposal faces reviews from U.S. regulators who will study its effect on competition.In a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, said Comcast had failed to live up to a long list of promises made when its 2011 agreement to acquire NBC Universal won U.S. approval.Comcast responded that it was ""proud of our track-record on complying with the conditions from our past transactions.""""We've gone above and beyond in compliance with most conditions, including our low-income broadband program, the amount of local news programming and investment in local stations, the amount of on-demand programming, especially children's programming,"" said spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice.Franken complained that Comcast had interfered in 2007 with BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer network that Comcast viewed as a competitor to its cable offerings. The FCC subsequently passed rules requiring all data be treated equally by Internet providers, although those rules were struck down by a federal appeals court. Comcast agreed, however, in 2011 to net neutrality provisions to win approval for the NBC Universal deal. Net neutrality requires that all data be treated equally by Internet providers.Still, Franken said, ""The underlying merits of the dispute and the conduct at issue remain relevant to the FCC's consideration of Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable.""Franken also cited a study by the Free Press consumer advocacy group, which found Comcast had failed to live up to promises to increase local news and programming. ""The FCC should scrutinize whether these allegations have merit,"" Franken wrote. He also questioned whether Comcast had lived up to promises to provide reasonably priced broadband to customers who did not take cable.Franken noted that the advocacy group Public Knowledge, had petitioned the FCC in 2012 to look into Comcast's use of data caps for some users. ""The FCC should examine this issue in connection with Comcast's proposed acquisition,"" he wrote. COMCAST DEFENDS DEAL A source close to Comcast said on Thursday the company had no data caps, which limit Internet use, outside of a few test areas. The source was not authorized to speak on the record and requested anonymity.In an early 2013 report that Comcast did on its merger with NBC Universal, the company said it had introduced three independent networks, was investing in news and children's programming and had donated broadband access to schools, libraries and areas with many low-income residents.Comcast has argued that the combination would not reduce competition because the two cable providers do not compete in any markets. The company pledged to divest 3 million subscribers, so the combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market.An FCC spokesman declined to say whether the agency was looking any of the allegations made by Franken.",2014-02-28,CMCSA,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 7:54pm EST",U.S. Sen.

99,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK, March 4  NEW YORK, March 4 Verizon Communications  is in talks with content providers to deliver web-based TV services to mobile platforms, chief executive Lowell McAdam, said at an investor conference on Tuesday.A day earlier, Dish Network Corp and Walt Disney Co  announced a landmark deal that will allow the No. 2 satellite TV provider to deliver Disney-owned network content online, outside of a traditional TV subscription.Verizon's goal ""is to work with the content providers,"" said  McAdam at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference. ""I have personally had discussions with the CEOs of the large content companies, and we would love to partner with them to see how we can take FiOS contact mobilely across the country."" he said.McAdam said the company could also look at providing a service delivered over wireless airwaves and not just broadband. According to PwC's annual entertainment and media forecast, North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from services such as Netflix that are offered over the top, meaning they are utilized over a network but not offered by the network operator.""I think you can actually get a virtuous cycle where broadcast viewing goes up and over-the-top viewing goes up, if you time this properly,"" McAdam said. In January, Verizon acquired Intel Corp's OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with Verizon's FiOS fiber-based Internet and TV service that has more than 5 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households. The company said it was open to providing over-the-top content to any device.McAdam also stressed that Verizon expects Netflix to pay for faster video delivery as part of a so-called interconnect deal,  in an arrangement similar to the one the video provider has made with Comcast Corp.""I have spoken live and via email with (Netflix CEO) Reed Hastings, and I believe that we will get some sort of an arrangement with them as well,"" said McAdam.",2014-03-04,CMCSA,"Tue Mar 4, 2014 | 4:24pm EST",Verizon in talks with content providers for online video service,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-onlinetv-idUSL1N0M11PV20140304?type=companyNews

TWC is the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Both companies are major broadband Internet providers.On March 26, the panel will discuss the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act, known as STELA, which expires at the end of 2014 and tackles, among other issues, the retransmission of broadcasting content by satellite companies.

116,"   By Ronald Grover and Liana B. Baker | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Media companies plan to press Comcast Corp for higher fees in the coming year, seeing an opportunity to squeeze better terms from the U.S. cable company as regulators review its planned takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc.Comcast and Time Warner Cable paid nearly $14 billion to content companies last year for rights to distribute their films, television shows and sporting events.Broadcasters and cable television networks have ""assignment clauses"" in their contracts with Time Warner Cable that require the networks to sign off before Comcast can merge the two cable operators' agreements, according to people who have negotiated agreements in the past.Media executives say most programmers will push for higher rates in return for expanding their deals to cover digital distribution of their content. They declined to give specifics, citing confidential contracts.""Media companies selling programming can be expected to leverage the policy and politics surrounding the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger to extract sizeable and unusual concessions,"" said Jimmy Schaeffler, chairman of pay TV consultant firm The Carmel Group.Comcast is expected in March to formally request a Federal Communications Commission review of the $45.2 billion Time Warner Cable deal. The combined company will control almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market and about a third of the high-speed Internet market.While content providers are broadly concerned about the long-term negotiating clout of the new company, many of them are looking for immediate ways to benefit from the merger, according to media executives who requested anonymity because their negotiations with Comcast will be private.Media companies see increased value for their content following a recent deal by satellite operator Dish Network Corp to pay Walt Disney Co for the rights to stream ESPN, ABC and other programs over the Internet. Analysts say Disney likely pocketed higher subscriber fees from Dish for channels such as ESPN and Disney Channel. In 2013, ESPN was paid an industry average fee of $5.54 per subscriber per month while Disney Channel received $1.15 per subscriber per month, according to SNL Kagan.CBS Corp CEO Leslie Moonves hinted at an investor conference this week that he would push for better terms from Comcast.""There's going to be a lot of discussions going on about how you get those two contracts together,"" he said, referring to the melding of Comcast and Time Warner Cable's licensing agreements.""There are certain things that we want to stay out of that deal and there are certain things probably that Comcast doesn't want,"" Moonves said.ADDING DIGITAL RIGHTS  Comcast currently pays the industry's lowest rates because of its size. Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus has dismissed the notion that the merged company will bully programmers.""I just find that whole line of concern to be totally ironic,"" Marcus said on Wednesday, ""given the experience that we have all had over the last dozen years or so where programming costs have risen at a level that far exceeds the price that customers will actually bear.""Time Warner Cable's programming costs have increased in the last five years by 42 percent, from $23.60 a subscriber in 2008 to $33.62 a subscriber in 2013, according to financial filings. Its overall programming costs will increase to $5.2 billion in 2014, an 8.3 bump percent from 2013.Some programmers are looking at adding digital rights to their contracts with Comcast to push for better terms. The model is Disney's long-term deal with Comcast in 2012 that included added payments for WatchESPN and WatchDisneyChannel apps and other digital content. Since then, Disney announced a video streaming agreement with Dish and is negotiating a similar one with DirecTV, under which the satellite provider would pay more for the rights to use ESPN, the Disney Channel and content from its ABC stations in an Internet-delivered video service.Media executives say most of their contracts are outdated and they see an opening as Comcast and other cable operators beef up their digital and on-demand offerings to compete against the likes of Netflix Inc.CBS signed a 10-year agreement with Comcast in 2010, that ""greatly expanded on-demand access"" to its CBS and Showtime programming, according to a press release at the time.But that deal does not give Comcast the ability to stream video online or to offer video outside the home, and limits the amount of video on demand, said a person with knowledge of the arrangement.A spokesman for CBS declined to comment. A Comcast spokeswoman had no immediate comment.Analysts say Comcast could eventually institute ""usage based pricing"" to charge its subscribers for the broadband they use.

The company pledged to divest 3 million subscribers, so the combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. A combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable would also have roughly one-third share of the high-speed Internet market.Comcast, which is the No. 1 U.S. cable provider, said on February 13 it had agreed to acquire No. 4 Time Warner Cable.Shares of Time Warner Cable were down 0.4 percent at $135.98 near midday. The deal generated criticism from some lawmakers and consumer groups concerned that there were already too few options for Americans signing up for broadband or cable service.Content providers, the producers of television shows and movies, also worry that a merger of the two cable giants will mean too few buyers for their products, and that those buyers will be able to push their fees down.Comcast, which owns large amounts of content after its 2011 merger with NBC Universal, and Time Warner Cable paid nearly $14 billion to content companies last year for the rights to show their films, television shows and sporting events.The involvement of states typically gives the Justice Department additional resources - and sometimes creates additional pressure - to ensure that a proposed transaction complies with antitrust law.The Federal Communications Commission must also approve the deal before it can close.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; editing by Ros Krasny, Doina Chiacu and Leslie Adler)",2014-03-19,CMCSA,"Wed Mar 19, 2014 | 12:17pm EDT",Exclusive: States to probe Comcast plan to buy Time Warner Cable,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-timewarnercable-comcast-idUSBREA2I0XL20140319?type=companyNews

Shares of Time Warner Cable were down 0.4 percent at $135.98 near midday.The deal generated criticism from some lawmakers and consumer groups concerned that there were already too few options for Americans signing up for broadband or cable service.Content providers, the producers of television shows and movies, also worry that a merger of the two cable giants will mean too few buyers for their products, and that those buyers will be able to push their fees down.Comcast, which owns large amounts of content after its 2011 merger with NBC Universal, and Time Warner Cable paid nearly $14 billion to content companies last year for the rights to show their films, television shows and sporting events.The involvement of states typically gives the Justice Department additional resources - and sometimes creates additional pressure - to ensure that a proposed transaction complies with antitrust law.The Federal Communications Commission must also approve the deal before it can close.

123,"  March 20 Netflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Thursday said internet service providers should give content companies adequate network connections for free, and singled out Comcast Corp for supporting ""weak"" internet traffic rules.In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service.Hastings called interconnection fees an ""arbitrary tax"" that the company would pay in certain cases to protect its customers' experience.""Instead, they must provide sufficient access to their network without charge,"" Hastings wrote on the Netflix blog. He said free interconnection was key to ensuring ""net neutrality,"" which requires that internet providers treat data from different content companies equally.Comcast is seeking approval from U.S. regulators for its proposed $45.2 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc . Treatment of internet traffic is one issue expected to receive scrutiny during the government's review. Hastings said Comcast ""has been an industry leader in supporting weak net neutrality, and we hope they'll support strong net neutrality as well.""Comcast, in a statement from executive vice president David Cohen, said no other company had a ""stronger commitment to openness of the Internet."" The company is the only broadband provider currently bound by the government's net neutrality, or ""Open Internet,"" rules. An appeals court struck down the rules in January, but Comcast committed to following them under an agreement with the government when it purchased NBC Universal.Cohen said those rules were not meant to cover interconnection arrangements. He added that providers like Netflix had always paid for interconnection and had ""ample options"" to ensure that customers enjoyed optimal performance at a fair price.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Stephen Coates)",2014-03-21,CMCSA,"Thu Mar 20, 2014 | 9:35pm EDT","Netflix CEO calls for free interconnection, criticizes Comcast",http://www.reuters.com//article/netflix-comcast-idUSL2N0MI01S20140321?type=companyNews

(link.reuters.com/reb87v)Apple, which wants its TV service's traffic to be separated from public internet traffic over the ""last mile"" for faster transmission, is looking for special treatment from Comcast's cables to bypass congestion, the report said.Comcast and Apple declined to comment on the report. Apple has been in talks for a faster TV set-top box with Time Warner Cable Inc, which recently agreed to be bought by Comcast. Apple's $99 TV box competes with similar streaming devices from Roku and Google Inc.Netflix agreed last month to pay Comcast Corp for faster speeds, throwing open the possibility that more content companies will have to shell out for better service.

135,"   By David Ingram | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A majority of Americans are skeptical about the proposed merger of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, and they are not convinced the U.S. government is doing enough to prevent monopolies generally, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online poll released on Wednesday.The poll found that 52 percent of those surveyed believed that mergers such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal result in less competition and are bad for consumers, while 22 percent believe they allow cable and internet providers to be more efficient and provide better service to consumers.The two rivals said last month they were planning a $45 billion combination that would have just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market and a similar share of the high-speed Internet market. The deal is expected to draw close scrutiny from antitrust enforcers and communications regulators, as well as from members of the U.S. Congress.""These types of mergers give people pause. They make them a little bit nervous about how it will affect them as consumers,"" Ipsos pollster Julia Clark said.The sentiment surrounding another recent U.S. merger, the tie-up of American Airlines (AAL.O) and US Airways into the world's biggest airline, was not quite as cold. The poll found that 42 percent believed it was bad for consumers, while 29 percent felt the opposite way.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online from Thursday to Monday. Its results were based on answers from 1,368 Americans.The data were weighted to the U.S. population by factors such as gender and age. The poll is precise to plus or minus 3 percentage points, based on a measure of accuracy that statisticians call a credibility interval.Skepticism of the mergers varied significantly based on education level, according to the poll.For Comcast-Time Warner Cable, 62 percent of people with a college degree or more took a negative view of the deal, but that number fell to 57 percent among people with some college experience and 42 percent among those with none. The two companies defended their merger, saying it would not remove a competitor from any market because they do not currently overlap.""In fact, the scale of our combined company will help us to innovate even faster and accelerate the deployment of services such as increased broadband speeds and expanded TV options,"" Time Warner Cable said in a statement to Reuters.Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said in a separate statement that the transaction would bring consumers benefits such as faster Internet speeds, better programming choices and lower costs, ""all things that we think consumers will like.""The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on the cable merger for April 9.American Airlines said in a statement: ""We are taking the best of both US Airways and American Airlines to create a formidable competitor with an expanded network that provides a real choice for global and domestic travel."" MANY WITH NO OPINION The poll found a significant share of people who did not state a strong opinion about the mergers. For the cable deal, 26 percent said they did not know how they felt, while for the airline deal, 28 percent said they did not know.Clark said those numbers were above average for a poll about public affairs.""People are acknowledging that this isn't something that they have enough knowledge about to have a strong opinion,"" she said.Although mergers receive significant media attention, antitrust enforcement has not regularly been in the U.S. headlines since a long-running government battle with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) beginning in the 1990s. U.S. mergers and acquisitions above a certain size must be submitted for review to antitrust enforcers, who may seek to block a deal if they believe it would be anticompetitive.The enforcers at the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) try to promote competition in other ways, including criminal investigations into cartel price-fixing or civil inquiries into alleged collusion.Asked in the poll to evaluate how the federal government was doing preventing monopolies and ensuring competition, 30 percent said they approved and 42 percent said they disapproved. Twenty-eight percent said they did not know.The answers revealed a significant partisan split, as Democrats approved of the government's job by a 45-33 margin and Republicans disapproved by a 56-23 margin. Enforcement policy has been under the control of Democratic appointees of President Barack Obama since 2009.An FTC spokesman and a Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.Despite the dissatisfaction, the poll found no consensus about companies that ought to be broken up.Asked to name a company or industry in the United States where there was an illegal monopoly, common answers included none, government, cable, oil, Microsoft and banking.Thousands of lawyers, economists and other antitrust experts are converging in Washington, D.C., this week for what is billed as the largest conference on competition law in the world. The meeting of the American Bar Association's antitrust section runs through Friday at a hotel two blocks from the White House.(Editing by Howard Goller and Ken Wills)",2014-03-26,CMCSA,"Wed Mar 26, 2014 | 1:04am EDT","Americans take dim view of Comcast, Time Warner Cable deal",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-antitrust-idUSBREA2P0BD20140326?type=companyNews

143,"   By Liana B. Baker  The 3 million subscribers that Comcast Corp plans to divest as part of a proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc might be worth roughly $18 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter.The company has received strong interest from other cable companies and investors, the source added. While the subscribers could be sold off, Comcast is also considering a spinoff of the assets into a separate publicly traded company.At $18 billion, the 3 million subscribers would be valued at approximately $6,000 each. The value of the subscribers can change, depending on their location and the financial health of their cable network, the source added.ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said $6000 per subscriber would only be a reasonable valuation for a top tier cable market, and would represent a premium to other publicly listed cable companies that average between $4000-$5000 per subscriber.

144,"  (Adds analyst comment)By Liana B. BakerMarch 31 The 3 million subscribers that Comcast Corp plans to divest as part of a proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc might be worth roughly $18 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter.The company has received strong interest from other cable companies and investors, the source added. While the subscribers could be sold off, Comcast is also considering a spinoff of the assets into a separate publicly traded company.At $18 billion, the 3 million subscribers would be valued at approximately $6,000 each. The value of the subscribers can change, depending on their location and the financial health of their cable network, the source added.ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said $6000 per subscriber would only be a reasonable valuation for a top tier cable market, and would represent a premium to other publicly listed cable companies that average between $4000-$5000 per subscriber. ""We don't know which markets these are, but if these are contiguous subscribers in smaller markets and not New York for example, I don't know if Comcast can get $6000 per subscriber,"" he said.

Santa Clara, California-based Arista listed Morgan Stanley and Citigroup as lead underwriters to the offering in its IPO filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.The company, whose competitors include Cisco Systems Inc , said it would raise $200 million from the offering, but the final size of the IPO could be different. The company, led by former Cisco executive Jayashree Ullal, builds switches that handle traffic at large internet data centers for companies including Facebook Inc, Yahoo Inc , Comcast Corp and Citigroup Inc.Ullal has been CEO since October 2008 and is also Arista's largest individual shareholder, according to the IPO filing.Cloud technology distributes large amounts of data and applications across multiple servers, allowing companies to cut costs by outsourcing data management and computing needs. Reuters reported in November that Arista had selected banks for a possible IPO. Industry analysts have estimated that the company could be valued at about $2.5 billion.Arista said it would list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ANET"". It did not reveal how many shares it planned to sell or their expected price.The company was started in 2004 by Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton, a computer science professor at Stanford University, with $100 million in funding.The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filing is used to calculate registration fees.

147,"   By Liana B. Baker  Selling Internet and phone service to businesses is hardly the sexiest part of the cable industry, but it has got a definite allure for the architects of the $45.2 billion merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable.The two companies' sales to businesses of broadband Internet, voice lines and network services already total more than $5 billion, with the growth rate of 20 percent or more expected to be kept up at both the companies' business units.If the merger is approved, the two companies' networks will run through 23 of the 25 largest cities - including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas - giving the merged company a reach that rivals AT&T and Verizon in the $60 billion market for core telecom services such as Internet access and voice services, according to IDC.The push to grab more business clients also reflects how cable companies are searching for new growth avenues as their traditional business, selling TV services to residential clients, matures.""If the Time Warner Cable deal is meant to come about, and therefore we have a bigger footprint, then it opens up a great landscape to bring customers business solutions they never had before,"" Comcast's president of business services Bill Stemper said in an interview.Unlike fickle residential customers who often defect for satellite and telephone competitors, businesses tend to sign long-term contracts with at least six months lead time.Equally important, these contracts have richer margins than serving home customers. Comcast, for example, can bring in more than $50,000-$100,000 per month and potentially millions in revenue per year from a single customer like a large hospital. Last year, Comcast generated $3.2 billion in business service sales, growing at a 26 percent rate, while revenue for residential cable increased 3 percent. The 22 percent growth in Time Warner Cable's $2.3 billion business service sales helped to offset a small 1.2 percent increase in its residential sales. That being said, this remains a small slice of revenue - about 10 percent for Time Warner Cable, and about 8 percent of Comcast's cable unit.Both companies have a diverse roster of clients, with Comcast's ranging from potato chip maker Utz to Grady Health, a public health system in Georgia. Time Warner Cable's clients include Hospital Corporation of America and energy holding company SCANA Corp.With Time Warner Cable's top markets New York and Los Angeles in the mix, Comcast can now serve new branches of clients it already has in Philadelphia and Chicago.""That allows us to go to a business whether they're headquartered in New York or have a key linchpin site in New York, and speak to them about how these same services can serve more of these sites,"" Comcast's Stemper said. So far, both cable operators generate most of their sales in small-to-medium sized businesses, companies with 20 or fewer employees. However, in the past few years they have made a push for bigger companies with as many as 500 employees.Indeed, executives at both companies have said the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger will give it an entry to bigger customers, and a chance to get more business from the largest Fortune 500 companies, which could steal market share served by telecom providers such as AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink.""The combined entity offers a very compelling value proposition to large enterprise companies that require a nationwide provider of communication services,"" said Phil Meeks, Time Warner Cable's executive vice president and chief operating officer of business services.Meeks said Time Warner Cable is also already serving some Fortune 500 companies through its cloud computing arm it acquired in 2011 called NaviSite. Still, the combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable could face some major obstacles in moving beyond the small businesses clientele.""The higher you move upmarket, the tougher it's going to be. The combined company will have a bigger regional footprint than AT&T and Verizon but AT&T and Verizon have developed a national structure that'll be hard to crack,"" IDC analyst Matt Davis said.Verizon spokeswoman Janet Brumfield said the company has amassed what it believes is the greatest set of assets in the enterprise business, serving 96 percent of Fortune 1000 companies. AT&T declined to comment.Meanwhile, Comcast and Time Warner Cable are looking at developing a presentation to existing and potential clients, but they can only start actually selling the services once the deal closes, Meeks said. They are also in pursuit of the same three sectors: healthcare, government and education.The executives leading the business units, Stemper and Meeks, have similar backgrounds, both having worked at Cox Communications, one of the first cable companies to get into business services two decades years ago, and AT&T, which they are both now competing with.Even without the deal, Stemper from Comcast said of annual business services revenue: ""we see the ability to grow to the $4 billion, $5 billion and $6 billion-plus (range) in the road ahead.""(Reporting by Liana B.

150,"   By Alina Selyukh and Liana B. Baker | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Comcast Corp sought to rebut critics of its planned $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc, arguing that newcomers like Google Inc and Apple Inc would ensure competition in both Internet and video markets.In a 175-page filing with the Federal Communications Commission that kicks off the FCC's review of the deal, Comcast argues that combined with Time Warner Cable, it will compete with an ""array of sophisticated companies with national or even global footprints"" such as Google, Netflix Inc or Verizon that have gained ground against Comcast.""In the evolving video marketplace in which these companies have thrived, there is no reason why a cable company should be limited in evolving as well,"" Comcast's filing said.""Over the last few years, our competitors have evolved into being much larger companies by revenue, by cash flow and or by customers than we are to all have a larger geographic scope than we have,"" Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen told reporters after the filing was made public on Tuesday.If approved by the Justice Department and the FCC, the merger would result in a company that would serve just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market, after Comcast's plan to divest 3 million subscribers.The merged provider would also serve between 20 percent and 40 percent of U.S. broadband subscribers, depending on whether wireless broadband offered by telecom companies is included, Comcast said.Opponents have raised concerns that the sheer size of the merged company would give it too much control over what Americans can watch on television and do online as Comcast boosts its power as a buyer of web and pay-TV content. ""The great equalizer is that for many of those companies, they don't own the network in the high-speed video marketplace,"" said Chris Lewis, vice president for government affairs at consumer interest group Public Knowledge, referring to Google, Apple, Netflix and other content providers Comcast cited as its growing competitors.Cohen and Time Warner Cable's finance chief Arthur Minson are expected to hear about these concerns when they testify at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.A Reuters/Ipsos online poll last month found a majority of Americans skeptical about the proposed merger, with 52 percent of the 1,368 surveyed people saying that mergers such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal result in less competition and are bad for consumers. Comcast shares on Tuesday traded at their lowest level since the Time Warner deal was announced in February, a four-month low of $48.24 per share, and were 0.3 percent lower in the session.BROADBAND COMPETITION Since announcing its bid, Comcast has underscored that the merger combines two companies that do not directly compete in any markets, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider. It has argued that Time Warner Cable's customers would see a boost in quality of their services and the speed of their Internet.However, while lack of direct competition does away with major antitrust concerns that could trigger a block from the Justice Department, the FCC gets much broader leeway in examining whether the deal is in the public interest. Cohen said in more than 98 percent of the broadband markets served by Comcast and Time Warner Cable, customers have another Internet service choice offered by a top-ten telecom provider, delivered through fiber or new-generation DSL, plus newer entrants such as Google Fiber.Comcast also made the case that its sales of service including broadband to small and large businesses could present companies with an alternative to telecom providers such as Verizon and AT&T.The company also reaffirmed its commitment to so-called network neutrality rules, which ban Internet providers from slowing down or blocking access to content online, and that have been struck down by a court as formal FCC rules in January.Comcast, thanks to a condition placed on its 2011 merger with NBC Universal, is now the only company bound to uphold net neutrality for the next five years and has promised to apply it post-merger when it becomes larger.The FCC is now reviewing how to rewrite the net neutrality and the treatment of web traffic, including the fees content companies pay Internet service providers in so-called interconnection deals, is likely to be part of the agency's review of the merger.(Editing by Andrew Hay, Bernard Orr)",2014-04-08,CMCSA,"Tue Apr 8, 2014 | 5:37pm EDT",Comcast defends Time Warner Cable deal as U.S. review kicks off,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-comcast-timewarnercable-fcc-idUSBREA3717820140408?type=companyNews

The Federal Communications Commission will examine whether the deal is in the public interest while the Justice Department will determine whether it complies with antitrust law.Smaller channels worry that since Comcast also owns NBC Universal, which has its own rich trove of movies and television shows, they will have little chance of being added to a cable network's lineup.

155,"   By Alina Selyukh and Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc executives sought to reassure lawmakers on Wednesday that their planned merger would not send cable TV prices skyrocketing but found a fair amount of congressional skepticism.The Senate Judiciary Committee held the first public hearing on the proposed $45.2 billion merger between the two largest U.S. cable companies, a deal that has raised eyebrows among public interest groups and some lawmakers. Comcast promises that it will benefit consumers without eliminating any choices.""My concern is that as Comcast continues to get bigger, it will have even more power to exercise its leverage and squeeze consumers,"" said Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat who has often opposed media concentration.""I'm against this deal,"" Franken added.

156,"  (Add sports, content, bundling controversies)By Alina Selyukh and Diane BartzWASHINGTON, April 9 Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc executives sought to reassure lawmakers on Wednesday that their planned merger would not send cable TV prices skyrocketing but found a fair amount of congressional skepticism.The Senate Judiciary Committee held the first public hearing on the proposed $45.2 billion merger between the two largest U.S. cable companies, a deal that has raised eyebrows among public interest groups and some lawmakers. Comcast promises that it will benefit consumers without eliminating any choices.""My concern is that as Comcast continues to get bigger, it will have even more power to exercise its leverage and squeeze consumers,"" said Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat who has often opposed media concentration.""I'm against this deal,"" Franken added. ""I believe this deal will result in fewer choices, higher prices, and even worse service for my constituents.""Lawmakers can be a powerful voice on merger deliberations although they will have no formal role in deciding whether the Comcast deal gets the green light from the Justice Department, which ensures the merger complies with antitrust law, and the Federal Communications Commission, which has a broader public-interest standard.In a bid to make the merger more palatable, Comcast has pledged to divest 3 million subscribers, keeping the combined company's customer base just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television market. The merged company would also serve between 20 percent and 40 percent of the high-speed Internet market, Comcast said in a filing on Tuesday with the FCC.""If this transaction is approved, it will give us the scale and reach to innovate and compete against our national and global competitors. ...

The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.U.S. stocks had advanced in the prior session to snap a three-day losing streak as investors bought beaten-down social media and Internet shares. Despite the three-day selloff, the benchmark S&P 500 index  managed to hold above its 50-day moving average around 1,840, a key support level. The index has successfully defended the 1,840 area several times over the past month.The day's gains were gain led by Internet and biotechnology stocks that had tumbled recently.The Nasdaq biotechnology index was up 2.2 percent at 2,409.72 and the Global X social media index was up 1.8 percent at $18.83.""In recent days, in general, large caps outperformed small caps, and low-beta companies outperformed those with higher betas,"" said U.S. Bank Wealth Management's equity research team, in a note to clients. Low beta refers to less volatile stocks that also offer less potential return. ""While investor sentiment remains fragile, we continue to maintain a constructive outlook for equities, believing that the path of least resistance is still up.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.81 points or 0.34 percent, to 16,311.95, the S&P 500 gained 5.55 points or 0.3 percent, to 1,857.51 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 28.137 points or 0.68 percent, to 4,141.123.Year-to-date, five of the ten S&P 500 Index sectors are up and five are down, according to Wells Fargo Advisors. The utility sector leads the rest with a 9.5 percent increase, while the consumer discretionary sector has been the greatest laggard with a 5.5 percent decline.The Fed is expected to release the minutes from its March meeting at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT). The Fed needs to be more specific about what economic conditions would prompt it to raise interest rates from current rock-bottom levels, a pair of top Fed officials normally at odds on policy said on Tuesday. Earnings season gets under way this week, with results due from retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond after the close, while financials JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co  close out the week with results on Friday.Investors will be looking at the impact of harsh winter weather on first-quarter earnings, and signs of optimism for the second-quarter.U.S. wholesale inventories rose at a slower 0.5 percent pace in February, in line with expectations, after a revised 0.8 percent gain in January, which could support views that restocking did not help the economy in the first quarter.General Motors Co shares lost 2 percent to $33.83. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the automaker is being fined $7,000 a day for missing an April 3 deadline to provide information about its recall of 2.6 million cars for defective ignition switches. Morgan Stanley subsequently cut the stock to ""underweight.""Intuitive Surgical Inc estimated first-quarter revenue well below analysts' average expectation, mainly due to a 60 percent drop in sales of its flagship da Vinci robot system. Its shares slumped 7 percent to $455.27. The PHLX medical device index lost 0.3 percent.Constant Contact Inc surged 27.8 percent to $28.02 after the online marketer said it expects quarterly revenue to rise by more than 15 percent.Shares of Blackstone-backed hotel chain La Quinta Holdings Inc made a subdued market debut as investors took the view the stock was fully priced in a crowded IPO market. La Quinta's shares, which priced below the expected range at $17, fell as much as 4 percent in early trading but rose nearly 3 percent to $17.50 by midday.

163,"   By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Executives from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N are expected to defend their plan to merge as they go before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the first hearing since the $45.2-billion deal was announced in February.The proposed merger has stirred the ire of public interest groups who worry that a bigger Comcast would have too much clout over fast-growing broadband, free rein to raise cable rates and more power over what Americans watch on television.David Cohen, executive vice president of Comcast, and Arthur Minson, TWC's finance chief are expected to argue that their cable and broadband services do not compete with each other. Time Warner customers also stand to get faster Internet speeds and better cable service, the companies have said.Further, they are likely to reiterate that Comcast faces competition in both Internet and video markets from the likes of Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) - an argument Comcast made in filings with the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday. A primary concern for Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and chair of the committee, is ""diverse and independent video programming.""""Cable companies play a dominant role in how many people in this country get information. Consumers deserve to know how a merger between two of the largest companies in this industry will impact them,"" Leahy said in prepared testimony.Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of the committee's antitrust panel and a Minnesota Democrat, is worried about both cable and broadband. ""I will specifically be looking at how the proposed merger will impact prices and service, how it would affect Comcast's control over programming and what people are able to watch, and how it would change Comcast's control over people's access to the Internet,"" she said in a statement. Also due to appear on Wednesday is Gene Kimmelman, head of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and a vocal opponent of the merger. Kimmelman was at the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in 2011 when it approved the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal but stopped AT&T's (T.N) proposed purchase of T-Mobile USA (DTEGn.DE).""The merger will even more firmly entrench Comcast as the gatekeeper at the crossroads of Internet, television, and communications innovation,"" Kimmelman's testimony says. In an effort to win approval Comcast has pledged to divest 3 million subscribers so the combined company's customer base of 30 million would be just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television market. The combined company would also serve between 20 and 40 percent of the high-speed Internet market, Comcast said in Tuesday's filing.Rounding out Wednesday's panel are James Bosworth from Back9Network, an independent golf channel; Richard Sherwin from Spot On Networks, a managed Wi-Fi provider; and Christopher Yoo, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.The Justice Department will review the merger to ensure it complies with antitrust law. The Federal Communications Commission has a broader public interest standard.

168,"  April 21 Video streaming service Netflix on Monday became the most visible company with a business relationship with Comcast to oppose the No. 1 cable operator's $45.3 billion merger with Time Warner Cable.""It's more in the public interest to either not have them merge or if the government goes ahead with it, to at least put some significant merger agreements, settlements in there,"" Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said in a webcast following the company's quarterly results.Netflix added in a quarterly letter to shareholders that Comcast would control access to broadband in a majority of U.S. homes while also having ""anticompetitive leverage"" to charge arbitrary fees on companies that rely on its Internet service.Until now, the only vocal advocates calling for an outright rejection of Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger had been public interest and consumer groups such as Public Knowledge and the Consumers Union, as well as Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat who has often opposed media concentration.Netflix has tussled with the cable operator in recent months over the speed Comcast delivers the online streaming service to its cable customers. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service.While Netflix and Comcast announced the news in a joint statement that sounded friendly at the time, just a month later, Netflix's Hastings blasted Comcast for charging these interconnection fees in a blog post.In an interview with Reuters on Monday, the Netflix executive said he favors the federal government imposing ""some enduring form of no-fee interconnect"" if the merger is approved by regulators. Comcast quickly responded with a lengthy statement.""Netflix's opposition to our Time Warner Cable transaction is based on inaccurate claims and arguments,"" the cable operator said. ""There has been no company that has had a stronger commitment to openness of the Internet than Comcast.""The cable operator noted that, as part of its 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal, it is the only Internet provider that is legally bound to follow the U.S. Federal Communications Commission' net neutrality rules. Comcast charged that Netflix is using the interconnection argument to ""shift its costs from its customers to all Internet customers, regardless of whether they subscribe to Netflix or not.""A DEAL HURDLE?  Netflix's decision to publicly oppose Comcast's plan to merge with Time Warner Cable may give the company headaches when it makes its case to the Justice Department that their deal is legal under antitrust law, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust expert with Geyer Gorey LLP law firm.""The significance here is that we know from the (2011) Comcast NBCU deal that DOJ (Justice Department) was worried about Netflix,"" said Grunes.

The company's shares jumped 6.7 percent in after-hours trading to $371.97, after the company released plans for a price hike and posted a rise in first-quarter profit that beat Wall Street expectations.Chief Executive Reed Hastings said Netflix had improved its selection of TV shows and movies and added original series like critically acclaimed Kevin Spacey thriller ""House of Cards.""With added revenue from higher prices, ""we will be able to license much more content and deliver it in very high quality video,"" Hastings said on a webcast. The company, in a quarterly letter to shareholders, said it plans to impose ""a one or two dollar increase, depending on the country, later this quarter for new members only."" It did not name the countries. Existing customers would keep their current price ""for a generous time period,"" it said.Netflix has ""room to raise prices,"" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said, because ""they're still seeing a lot of demand"" for the service.The company said in its earnings report it added 2.25 million customers to its U.S. streaming business during the quarter that ended in March, in line with the company's earlier guidance, for a total of 35.7 million. In international markets, its customer base reached 12.7 million, a gain of 1.8 million during the quarter. Net income for the quarter reached $53 million, an increase from $3 million a year earlier. Earnings-per-share came in at 86 cents, topping the average forecast of 83 cents, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.During the quarter, it released the second season of critically acclaimed Kevin Spacey drama ""House of Cards."" Netflix is investing in original series, such as ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" to attract and keep subscribers. If faces competition from online video players like Amazon.com Inc and Hulu, as well as on-demand content from cable operators.Netflix also said it opposed Comcast Corp's  proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc. In March, Netflix reluctantly agreed to pay ""interconnection"" fees to Comcast for faster delivery of its TV shows and movies.""Comcast is already dominant enough to be able to capture unprecedented fees from transit providers and services such as Netflix,"" the company said in its letter.

170,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK, April 21  NEW YORK, April 21 Netflix Inc, the video streaming service, on Monday criticized AT&T's high-speed fiber network as inadequate and slow, while renewing its call for AT&T to interconnect directly with Netflix.Netflix made the remarks in a letter to shareholders on its first-quarter results. The company has been calling for greater protections for open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, which require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges.Netflix, in a letter signed by its chief executive, Reed Hastings, and chief financial officer, David Wells, said AT&T's fiber-based U-verse service has ""lower performance than many DSL"" Internet service providers.The letter came hours after AT&T said it expects to expand its fiber network and TV services to up to 21 U.S. cities.AT&T did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a March blog post, AT&T dismissed Netflix's call for free interconnection as an ""arrogant"" and unfair attempt to force others to pay for the content provider to gain access to faster broadband speeds and better services.""The 249 customer comments on AT&T's anti-Netflix blog post indicate that AT&T customers expect a good quality Netflix experience given how much they pay AT&T for their Internet service,"" the Netflix letter said. Netflix added that AT&T can connect directly with Netflix for free, saying that doing so would ""quickly improve their customers' experience.""Netflix also adressed wider tensions with the Internet service providers it relies on to distribute its services. The company said it opposes the proposed merger between Comcast  and Time Warner Cable because it would give Comcast a monopoly over high-speed broadband and allow it to charge ""unprecidented fees"" from transit and service providers like Netflix.AT&T, which is fighting rivals such as Google Inc  as well as cable companies with its fiber-based product, on Monday said it is considering providing broadband Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and its U-verse television service in some metropolitan areas, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. Before the company can enter these markets, it must make  agreements with local leaders in each city.The services are currently available in Austin, Texas, and some surrounding communities, and will be rolled out in parts of Dallas this summer, the company said.AT&T said it may consider expanding its reach to 100 cities eventually.U-verse launched in 2006 and currently has 10.7 million combined Internet and TV customers.

178,"  Video streaming service Netflix on Monday became the most visible company with a business relationship with Comcast (CMCSA.O) to oppose the No. 1 cable operator's $45.3 billion merger with Time Warner Cable TWC.N.""It's more in the public interest to either not have them merge or if the government goes ahead with it, to at least put some significant merger agreements, settlements in there,"" Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said in a webcast following the company's quarterly results.Netflix added in a quarterly letter to shareholders that Comcast would control access to broadband in a majority of U.S. homes while also having ""anticompetitive leverage"" to charge arbitrary fees on companies that rely on its Internet service.Until now, the only vocal advocates calling for an outright rejection of Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger had been public interest and consumer groups such as Public Knowledge and the Consumers Union, as well as Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat who has often opposed media concentration.Netflix has tussled with the cable operator in recent months over the speed Comcast delivers the online streaming service to its cable customers. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service.While Netflix and Comcast announced the news in a joint statement that sounded friendly at the time, just a month later, Netflix's Hastings blasted Comcast for charging these interconnection fees in a blog post.In an interview with Reuters on Monday, the Netflix executive said he favors the federal government imposing ""some enduring form of no-fee interconnect"" if the merger is approved by regulators. Comcast quickly responded with a lengthy statement.""Netflix's opposition to our Time Warner Cable transaction is based on inaccurate claims and arguments,"" the cable operator said. ""There has been no company that has had a stronger commitment to openness of the Internet than Comcast.""The cable operator noted that, as part of its 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal, it is the only Internet provider that is legally bound to follow the U.S. Federal Communications Commission' net neutrality rules. Comcast charged that Netflix is using the interconnection argument to ""shift its costs from its customers to all Internet customers, regardless of whether they subscribe to Netflix or not.""A DEAL HURDLE? Netflix's decision to publicly oppose Comcast's plan to merge with Time Warner Cable may give the company headaches when it makes its case to the Justice Department that their deal is legal under antitrust law, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust expert with Geyer Gorey LLP law firm. ""The significance here is that we know from the (2011) Comcast NBCU deal that DOJ (Justice Department) was worried about Netflix,"" said Grunes. ""I suspect that Netflix has a whole bunch of information and concerns that could support DOJ bringing a case because this is the person whose business is placed at risk.""Critics of the merger say that a bigger, more powerful Comcast would have the power to throttle Internet traffic.Since announcing its bid for Time Warner Cable in February, Comcast has underscored that the merger combines two companies that do not directly compete in any markets, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider.It has argued that Time Warner Cable's customers would see a boost in quality of their services and Internet speeds.(Reporting by Liana B.

198,"   By Jennifer Saba and Lisa Richwine | NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES Technology powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase in New York next week.With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called ""Every Street United."" Sony Corp's digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld's ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee"" and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called ""Connected.""This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long ""NewFronts"" event - modeled after the annual ""upfronts"" where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue.Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized.Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo's earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content.""We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars,"" said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos.But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said.""Online video just doesn't offer nearly the reach that broadcast does,"" said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio's films on the AOL network for free, but with ads.""Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space,"" Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. ""But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens.""At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company's Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet's strengths.""The challenge TV has is it's not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components,"" said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. ""We have very engaged, high-quality audiences."" Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week.""There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television,"" Naylor said. ""Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers.""But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV.The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to $40. ""There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives,"" said Wieser. ""The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget.""Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Interactive Advertising Bureau which hosts the event.Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry's annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online.However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars.Until then, the NewFronts ""is more of a showcase for what's new and exciting,"" Bluman said.

200,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) assigned to Comcast Corporation (Comcast) and its wholly owned  subsidiaries included in Comcast's cross-guaranty structure. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'A-' IDR assigned to NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. (Enterprise).  The Rating Outlook on all of these ratings remains Stable.   Approximately $48.1 billion of Comcast's consolidated debt and preferred stock,  including $11.2 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal Media, LLC (NBCUniversal  Media) as of March 31, 2014, is affected by Fitch's action. Fitch's action follows the company's announcement that it has entered into a  series of agreements with Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter) whereby Comcast  will divest approximately 3.9 million video subscribers following the closing of  the Comcast and Time Warner Cable, Inc. (TWC) merger.  The divestiture  transaction is expected to enhance Comcast's ability to secure required  regulatory approval in connection with its pending merger agreement with TWC.  The Charter agreements consist of three separate transactions including: (1) an  asset sale transaction, (2) a contribution and spin-off transaction, and (3) an  asset exchange transaction.  These transactions are subject to several closing  conditions including closing the previously announced merger agreement between  Comcast and TWC and the receipt of required regulatory and shareholder  approvals.  Comcast anticipates the merger with TWC will close by the end of  2014 and that the transactions with Charter and the spin-off transaction will be  reviewed in parallel by the FCC and Department of Justice.    KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch expects the asset divestiture transactions will not have a material  impact on Comcast's operating profile pro forma for the TWC merger and will be  executed in a leverage-neutral manner.  --Proceeds from the asset divestitures will total approximately $14 billion.   Fitch expects Comcast to use the proceeds to reduce outstanding debt and to  repurchase shares of its common stock.   --The transactions should lead to an improved subscriber clustering profile  enabling the company to deliver improved technology deployments, greater  operating efficiencies, and enhanced customer service. --Comcast's merger with TWC remains strategically sound after considering the  asset divestitures, creates significant opportunity to realize operating and  capital spending efficiencies with minimal execution risk and enables the  combined entity to effectively compete on a national scale for incremental  commercial segment business. Fitch remains confident that Comcast can deliver  operating efficiencies of $1.5 billion through its merger with TWC.   --Comcast's capital structure and financial strategy remain intact and centered  on reducing leverage to its target of between 1.5x and 2.0x.  --Fitch does not expect any material change to Comcast's capital allocation  strategy over the near term and believes there is sufficient capacity within the  ratings to accommodate a contemplated expansion of Comcast's share repurchase  authorization.    Fitch continues to believe that Comcast's leverage as of year-end 2014 pro forma  for the TWC merger and the asset divestitures will approximate 2.2x, unchanged  from previous expectations, and approach 2x by the end of 2015 in the absence of  significant cost or operating synergies.  The cable systems to be divested  generate approximately $3 billion of EBITDA.  The loss of EBITDA generation will  be offset with approximately $9 billion of debt reduction.   Fitch's expectation that shareholder returns as a percentage of pre-dividend  cash flow will increase over the medium term is incorporated into the ratings.   Comcast previously indicated that share repurchases should total $5.5 billion  during 2014 including $3 billion within its current plan and an additional $2.5  billion when shareholder approval of the TWC merger is obtained.  Furthermore,  the company expects to expand the share repurchase authorization by an  additional $10 billion upon closing of the merger with TWC.  The asset  divestment transactions create additional capacity for share repurchase  activity. The pending merger with TWC enables Comcast to extend its operating strategies  and technology roadmap into TWC's operations, creating the opportunity to  realize material operating cost and capital spending efficiencies.  Fitch points  out that Comcast's cable-segment EBITDA margin was nearly 500 basis points  higher than the comparable TWC EBITDA margin during the year ended 2013.   Comcast's ability to successfully establish its key operating strategies within  TWC's legacy operations creates the potential for a significant EBITDA benefit  for the combined entity.  Additionally, the national scope of the combined  entity's cable infrastructure will position the company to effectively compete  for a higher tier commercial business.         Comcast's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong based  on Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of free cash flow (FCF). Fitch acknowledges that Comcast's share  repurchase program represents a significant use of cash; however, Fitch believes  that the company would reduce the level of share repurchases should the  operating environment materially change, in order to maximize financial  flexibility. Comcast's liquidity position is further supported by cash on hand  (which totaled $3.1 billion on a consolidated basis as of March 31, 2014) and  $6.3 billion of collective available borrowing capacity (as of March 31, 2014)  from Comcast's two revolving credit facilities. Commitments under Comcast's  $6.25 billion revolver will expire June 2017 while the commitments related to  Enterprise's $1.35 billion revolver expire March 2018.  Comcast's debt maturity profile is well-laddered and within Fitch's FCF  expectation. Maturities total approximately $1.9 billion during 2014 (including  $900 million at NBCUniversal Media) excluding outstanding commercial paper,  followed by $3.4 billion during 2015. Comcast's ratings reflect its strong competitive position as one of the largest  video, high-speed Internet and phone providers to residential and business  customers in the U.S. and the company's compelling subscriber clustering  profile. NBCUniversal's portfolio of leading cable networks as well as the  growing importance of its theme parks business are key considerations supporting  Fitch's ratings and a strength of the company's credit profile. Outside of a change to Comcast's financial strategy or additional event-driven  M&A activity, rating concerns center on Comcast's ability to adapt to the  evolving operating environment while maintaining its relatively competitive  position, given the challenging competitive environment and soft housing and  employment trends. Considering the mature nature of video services and growing  penetration of high-speed data services, Comcast's ability to grow consumer  revenues while maintaining operating margins remains a key rating consideration. RATING SENSITIVITIES: --A positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast achieving and  committing to a financial policy consistent with an 'A' rating, including  maintaining its leverage below 1.5x on a sustained basis. Comcast would need to  demonstrate that its operating profile will not materially decline in the face  of competition and less than robust housing and employment conditions.  --Negative rating actions would likely coincide with discretionary actions of  Comcast's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a more  aggressive financial strategy, or additional event-driven merger and acquisition  activity, that drive leverage beyond 2.5x in the absence of a credible  deleveraging plan.

209,"   By Liana B. Baker and Malathi Nayak | LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO  LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO Comcast Corp may soon allow customers using its cloud-connected X1 cable box system to buy games from Electronic Arts Inc through their televisions, according to five sources briefed on the plans.Such a partnership would come as the cable company seeks to protect its turf against a new wave of challengers.After two years of testing, Comcast and EA, are close to reaching an agreement to stream video games such as ""FIFA"" and ""Madden,"" into the living rooms of some of Comcast's more-than 22 million customers across the United States, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly before a deal had been struck.Comcast would make the games available on X1, a video operating system with apps and an interface that is considered the most sophisticated in the cable industry, the sources said. It features Internet applications, viewing recommendations and voice control.If the agreement goes through, it would mark the boldest step yet by a cable company to muscle into the territory of leading video-game console manufacturers such as Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp.Comcast has been beefing its x1 system with new features to stop potential customer defections to rival video streaming systems such as Apple TV and Amazon.com Inc's FireTV, which was launched just last month with a slew of games.Apple TV allows users to stream games from their iOS phones and tablets to TV sets, and developers expect Apple to bring gaming directly to its streaming box. FireTV was released with over 100 free and paid games from the likes of Disney and Electronic Arts. Comcast and EA's aim is to make buying games as easy as ordering a pay-per-view movie, sources said. This could create a new distribution model that circumvents console and video-streaming device makers.EA and Comcast, which is awaiting regulatory approval for its $45 billion proposal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, declined to comment.The TWC deal, which would make Comcast the country's largest cable provider, highlights Comcast's desire to thwart the fresh challenge from the video and entertainment upstarts.A NEW DAWN  For Electronic Arts, a deal with Comcast could represent an important new revenue opportunity.The video game industry has yet to see a sustained recovery in sagging software sales despite robust hardware sales driven by the November launches of Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 consoles.In January, Redwood City, California-based EA lowered its 2015 revenue forecast - prompted by the sooner-than-expected drop in sales of games for older consoles after the release of the new devices.Under the agreement now being hashed out with Electronic Arts, Comcast will offer action, sports and casual titles from EA's portfolio, including potential titles such as ""FIFA,"" ""Madden,"" ""Monopoly"" and ""Plants vs. Zombies,"" the people said. The game offerings have not been finalized. Customers will be able to turn their tablets into controllers to play the games. Revenue share terms and the exact release date have not been decided.Comcast has been bulking up the capabilities of its X1 service, which can store content on the cloud, and experimenting with new ways to reach viewers.Last fall, it started selling movies for download and streaming through its set-top boxes and XFINITY TV website, which created a new path for Hollywood studios to generate revenue from films after their theater run ends.While Comcast added video subscribers for the past two quarters, after years of losses, it is facing increasing competition for viewership, both online and through streaming boxes. The Xbox and PlayStation, for instance, are now marketed as living room entertainment hubs that offer more than just games.Microsoft and Sony have added media features to their consoles over the past two years like original programming, online video and TV apps -- including Comcast's XFINITY on-demand service. But cable companies so far have not been able to load their set-top boxes with the technology to support gaming.Comcast will focus on casual and family games at first and consider offering other first-person shooter and action games later based on user preferences, the sources told Reuters.(Editing by Edwin Chan and Alden Bentley)",2014-05-02,CMCSA,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 4:11pm EDT",Exclusive - Comcast nears deal to stream EA games to TVs: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-comcast-gaming-exclusive-idUSBREA410V920140502?type=companyNews

213,"  (Adds contract details, rival media companies and media analyst comment)By Liana B. BakerMay 7 NBC Universal, the media unit of cable operator Comcast Corp, is paying $7.65 billion for the rights to six Olympic Games, surprising competitors by keeping its grip on the valuable live sports event for the next two decades.The agreement, announced on Wednesday in a joint statement with the International Olympic Committee, includes media rights across broadcast television, cable TV, internet and mobile platforms, and extends NBC's previous contract by 11 years.NBC sealed the exclusive deal to broadcast three winter games and three summer games from 2022 to 2032 before any other media companies could even bid. The IOC did not approach ESPN, a network spokesman said, and neither were Fox nor CBS.NBC and rival networks have been stocking up on live sports content, which are popular with advertisers because large audiences watch in real-time and do not skip the TV commercials. ""It was a smart preemptive move to get control of the situation early,"" said Steve Ridge, media strategy group president at the consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates, who added that advertising demand for the Olympics remains strong.IOC president Thomas Bach said the organization wanted to build a long-term partnership with NBC, which also made the financial commitment. The IOC ""did not see any reason to take any risk"" by talking to other networks, Bach said. The host cities of the six Olympic Games have not been selected yet. The next Olympics to be decided is expected to be announced in 2015 for the winter games of 2022.The United States has not had an Olympics since the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games and could be back in the running to host the Summer Games of 2024 because interest is gaining momentum at home and among IOC members.Comcast, which clinched full control of NBC Universal last year, used the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, as a spring board to promote its prime time lineup and boost viewership of its cable networks. Live streaming online options of Olympic events from the games in Sochi also attracted tens of millions of dollars in advertising. Macquarie analyst Amy Yong estimates that Comcast paid 20 percent more for each contest than it did on its last contract, which she said was is in line with other sports media deals.The Olympics haven't always scored for NBC. The unit lost $223 million at the Vancouver Winter Games in 2010, according to General Electric, which owned NBC at the time. Olympics with prime time live events usually have better ratings.NBC agreed in 2011 to spend $4.38 billion on the U.S. broadcasting rights for four Olympic games until 2020 when the games are in Tokyo. After that deal was announced, NBC executives had said the network should reap a profit from that contract.NBC added on Wednesday that it had to agreed pay an extra $100 million signing bonus to promote the Olympics brand for five years beginning in 2015.

214,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Lawmakers expressed concern about combining the top two U.S. cable operators at a congressional hearing Thursday to discuss Comcast's plan to merge with Time Warner Cable Inc.While none of the lawmakers asked regulators to block the transaction, both Republicans and Democrats cautioned there were potential negatives in the $45 billion deal.Representative Blake Farenthold, a Texas Republican, worried that small programmers may not be able to sell video to cable operators. ""I don't want to sound hostile to this merger,"" he said, but noted constituents and interest groups have raised concerns.Representative John Conyers, a Democratic critic of big mergers in general, said a combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable would have 30 percent of the cable market, at least 40 percent of the broadband market, 19 of the 20 biggest cable markets and a major Spanish-language channel, as well as movies and television shows and sports programming.""Comcast is a cable company and a programmer. That raises a double concern with me,"" said Conyers. ""I don't know if it's resolvable.""Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen tried to allay the concerns. ""This transaction has the potential to slow the increase in prices. ... Consumers are going to be the big winners,"" he told a hearing of the House of Representatives' antitrust panel. A trio of lawmakers pressed Cohen on why the company decided to reduce the number of areas where it showed programming from Rural Media Group, whose founder, Patrick Gottsch, testified.Representative Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, said: ""A lot of people who move from the farm to the urban area still want to be connected to the farm.""Cohen said the decision was made because of a shortage of bandwidth, and was not necessarily permanent.""We carry 160 independent programming networks,"" he said. ""We're a company that really tries to find the niches of programming that customers in particular markets are interested in."" Comcast faced tough criticism from Dave Schaeffer, CEO of Cogent Communications Group Inc, which has been a high-speed go-between for Netflix Inc and Comcast. In February, Netflix agreed to pay Comcast to connect directly.Schaeffer said that, after years of free connections, Comcast demanded Cogent pay to remedy Netflix's balky speed. Schaeffer said Cogent offered to pay some hardware costs, but that Comcast had remained silent and no agreement was reached.""That's not a free market. That's an abuse of market power,"" he said. Cohen disagreed. ""We did not force Netflix to enter into an interconnection deal with us. That was Netflix' idea,"" he said, noting that the company said it wanted to ""cut out the middleman.""Cohen said he could not disclose the terms of the deal but added, ""It has been publicly reported that Netflix is paying no more to us under this agreement, but less (than they paid Cogent).""Netflix has been critical of the agreement it made, with one executive calling it ""double-dipping"" since Comcast customers and Netflix both pay to have the movies and TV shows delivered to living rooms.The American Cable Association's Matthew Polka also worried about video programming and urged the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission, which must review the deal, to ensure Comcast does not raise prices or withhold shows from smaller rivals.Comcast said on April 28 that it was willing to divest nearly 4 million subscribers to win approval for the deal.

All its TV deals, including renewals in the United States, United Kingdom and Thailand have increased TV revenue by $90 million to an average value of $200 million per year, it said in a statement.Analysts said on Friday the company had been too upbeat about the opportunity to increase the rights fees it stood to gain from its U.S. TV deal. ""Given management's more optimistic tone and the fact that other major sports franchises have garnered much higher increases, this outcome is likely to be viewed as disappointing,"" said CJS Securities analyst Daniel Moor in a research note.On December 10 at a UBS conference Barrios compared Nascar's $820 million annual deal with FOX (FOXA.O) and NBC, with the roughly $100 million WWE got at the time, citing a ""massive opportunity"" to close that gap. Since those comments were made until Friday's selloff, WWE shares had gained 37 percent.Barrios said he did not think his comments were too upbeat.""We never said specifically what we thought we'd get. What we did say is, look, the market is really valuing live content and we think we should be worth more, and we were right. We were worth more,"" he said, pointing to how WWE secured an overall increase in revenue from all of its TV deals combined. WWE also made a big bet this year on a TV streaming product which costs subscribers $9.99 a month. As of April 6, the company had 667,000 subscribers. Barrios said the company's research shows that 2 million to 2.5 million people could sign up.PAA Research analyst Brad Safalow said WWE could spend $25 million to $60 million to support the streaming service in 2015 and that investors are questioning when it would become profitable.WWE has forecast a net loss of $45 million to $52 million for 2014.(Reporting by Liana B.

Its $93.2 million nipped at April's $95 million debut for ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier.""Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution for Warner Bros., said the film played well in all markets, which boded well for more Godzilla films.""We have a franchise in the making, and we're looking at sequels as we speak,"" Fellman said. Legendary controls the rights to future ""Godzilla"" installments. Warner Bros. has an option to co-finance any sequels and distribute them, according to a source with knowledge of the arrangement.TOUGH COMPETITION Legendary Pictures's President Jon Jashni said female and more mature audiences boosted the film's fortunes. ""Those who thought a Godzilla movie might not necessarily be for them ... and that feeds on itself,"" he said.Legendary is one of Hollywood's most prolific producers of big-budget films, among them director Christopher Nolan's two ""Dark Knight"" installments, which the studio made with Warner Bros. Last year, Legendary reached a five-year agreement to produce films for Comcast Corp's Universal Pictures.""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" starring Andrew Garfield, brought worldwide sales to $633 million through Sunday, said distributor Sony Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp.New Walt Disney Co movie ""Million Dollar Arm"" debuted in fourth place with $10.5 million.""Mad Men"" star Jon Hamm plays a real-life sports agent who seeks to turn Indian cricket players into U.S. baseball stars in the $25 million film.Comedy ""The Other Woman"" earned $6.3 million for fifth place.

227,"  WASHINGTON May 27 U.S. regulators should challenge the proposed $45 billion merger of the two largest American cable providers, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc, the New York Times said in an editorial in Tuesday's newspaper.The editorial, headlined ""A Cable Merger Too Far,"" said there were good reasons for the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission to block the proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable by Comcast. The Times cited limited competition in the high-speed Internet market and Comcast's negotiating power with Web content companies and TV programmers.""The merger will concentrate too much market power in the hands of one company, creating a telecommunications colossus the likes of which the country has not seen since 1984 when the government forced the breakup of the original AT&T telephone monopoly,"" the editorial said.""By buying Time Warner Cable, Comcast would become a gatekeeper over what consumers watch, read and listen to.""The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing whether the merger is in the public interest, and the Justice Department will decide whether it complies with antitrust law. Public interest groups and some legislators have opposed the combination. Comcast has argued that its business faces powerful competitors like Google Inc or wireless carriers like AT&T Inc, and has stressed that Comcast and Time Warner Cable do not directly compete in any market.AT&T, the No. 2 wireless carrier, has proposed buying the largest U.S. satellite TV company, DirecTV, for $48.5 billion, which the Times said only increased concerns about Internet and TV market consolidation. A Washington Post editorial in April said regulators should approve the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, but with conditions.However, the Times said conditions, such as requiring the merged company not to give favored treatment to established content providers like Netflix, may not be enough. "" ... This merger would fundamentally change the structure of this important industry and give one company too much control over what information, shows, movies and sports Americans can access on TVs and the Internet,"" the newspaper said.""Federal regulators should challenge this deal.""To read the editorial, click here: nyti.ms/1myB1Pi   (Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)",2014-05-27,CMCSA,"Tue May 27, 2014 | 10:57am EDT",U.S. should reject Comcast-TWC merger - NY Times editorial,http://www.reuters.com//article/comcast-timewarnercable-newyorktimes-idUSL1N0OD0JB20140527?type=companyNews
228,"  (Recasts with ratings figures and background on programming)By Eric KelseyLOS ANGELES May 29 Kevin Reilly, the top executive at Fox broadcast television, is leaving the network next month, the company said on Thursday, after Fox slumped to last place in ratings among the big U.S. broadcasters.Reilly's seven years as chairman of entertainment at Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's broadcast division ended with marquee programs like ""American Idol"" and ""Glee"" suffering sharp ratings drops.Fox has also lost its top ranking among viewers in the 18-49 age group that advertisers value most.Reilly said in a statement that he and Fox Networks Group chairman and chief executive officer, Peter Rice, had been discussing his departure for a while.""It felt like the timing was as right as it could be,"" Reilly, who joined Fox in 2007 and was named chairman of entertainment in 2012, said in the statement. The move comes after the network presented its fall stable of programming to advertisers earlier this month.Fox said that Reilly's senior executives will report to Rice before the company names a replacement.The network averaged 7.3 million in daily primetime viewers this past season, according to Nielsen data. That was up from 7 million last year, but Fox fell one place to fourth behind, CBS, NBC and ABC, respectively. Its record haul of 111.5 million viewers in February for football's Super Bowl did not deliver a significant improvement on overall viewership.The Super Bowl also failed to boost the coveted 18-49 audience, which remained flat and in second place with 3.1 million viewers on average.Fox's current entertainment slate consists of critically acclaimed shows such as ""The Mindy Project,"" ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" and ""New Girl,"" but the shows have so far been unable to become ratings powerhouses for the network. In addition to struggling with falling audiences for  ""American Idol"" and ""Glee,"" the network jettisoned Simon Cowell's singing contest ""The X Factor"" in February after three seasons.Fox also canceled the anticipated science-fiction drama ""Almost Human"" from executive producer and ""Star Trek"" director J.J. Abrams after one season.Fox was the top draw in the 18-49 age group for eight consecutive years before it was knocked to second in the 2012-13 season.NBC, under the ownership of Comcast Corp has managed to make a big comeback and now is the top network in the 18-49 age group.Reilly joined Fox from NBC, where he was the president of entertainment and oversaw the development of shows like hit comedies ""The Office"" and ""30 Rock.""Reilly is also credited with helping usher in the current era of acclaimed and well-rated cable television from his time at Fox's cable network FX where he introduced drama series such as ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""The Shield.""

229,"  (Adds context, paragraph 2, changes source in last paragraph to ""a Comcast spokeswoman"")By Lisa Richwine and Marina LopesLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, June 5 Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday demanded that Netflix Inc  immediately stop displaying messages to customers that place blame on Verizon's broadband service for slow delivery of Netflix TV shows and movies.The letter is the latest sign of tension between content providers like Netflix and Internet service providers over who should pay the price for companies that stream heavy traffic online.In a cease-and-desist letter sent to Netflix, Verizon also asked the video streaming service to provide information including a list of customers on the Verizon network to whom Netflix delivered the notices, or face legal action.""Failure to provide this information may lead us to pursue legal remedies,"" Verizon general counsel Randal Milch said in a letter to Netflix general counsel David Hyman. In mid-May, Netflix started a test of messages displayed on the screen for some customers when a video is buffering. The messages say that there is congestion on the network of Verizon or another Internet service provider.Netflix said on Thursday the test is continuing and meant to provide customers more information about their service, similar to a speed index that Netflix has published for months with a ranking of Internet service providers.""This is about consumers not getting what they paid for from their broadband provider,"" Netflix spokesman Jonathan Friedland said. ""We are trying to provide more transparency, just like we do with the ISP Speed Index, and Verizon is trying to shut down that discussion."" David Young, Verizon's vice president of federal regulatory affairs, told Reuters he felt the messages were part of a Netflix agenda to promote its views in Washington. Netflix has been urging the Federal Communications Commission to prevent broadband providers such as Verizon from charging Netflix fees for faster delivery of videos.""That seems to be the motivation, to try to make a point or make points in that discussion that is going on in Washington D.C.,"" Young said in a phone interview, though he wouldn't specify the issues. In the letter, Verizon said the message's assertions were deceptive and inaccurate and that the responsibility for slow streaming on the site falls on Netflix.Verizon said that in order to save money, Netflix relies on middlemen to distribute its content knowing that some of them have issues with congestion in some networks.In April, Netflix said it reluctantly signed a deal to pay fees to Verizon to bypass those middlemen and deliver content directly to the company, ensuring faster speeds. But Verizon is still working to implement the needed architecture and expects to finish improvements by the end of 2014, said Young.""I sincerely hope this is not a harbinger of things to come in terms of how Netflix treats its partners and our mutual customers,"" Milch said in the letter.The Verizon notices came to light this week when a reporter who was a Verizon user tweeted about them. Comcast Corp , which also receives connection fees from Netflix, is not aware of any reports of Netflix buffering messages to its customers, a Comcast spokeswoman said.

230,"   By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile TMUS.N might have some fresh arguments to allay regulator skepticism about a merger, but the government may still be reluctant to approve shrinking the U.S. wireless market from four main players to three.    Analysts said a decline in shares of both companies on Thursday reflected those high regulatory hurdles. T-Mobile closed 2.3 percent lower and Sprint 4 percent lower. Sprint, purchased by Japan's Softbank Corp (9984.T) in 2013, has agreed to pay about $40 per share, or over $32 billion, for T-Mobile US, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, bringing to a head a long-discussed and controversial deal to reshape the U.S. cellphone market.  But top U.S. antitrust and communications enforcers have already warned that the wireless market is too concentrated. In 2011 the Justice Department stopped a bid by AT&T Inc (T.N), No. 2 in the market, to buy struggling T-Mobile.Top dog Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T each have roughly twice as many subscribers as either Sprint or T-Mobile, in the third and fourth spots by numbers of subscribers. Bill Baer, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in January that it would difficult for his agency to approve a big wireless mergers.""It’s going to be hard for someone to make a persuasive case that reducing four firms to three is actually going to improve competition for the benefit of American consumers,"" Baer told the New York Times.  Masayoshi Son, CEO of Softbank, trekked to Washington in February to seek the counsel of Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, but got a cool response to a potential merger. Wheeler has not hinted at any softening of that stance.Antitrust experts called the unusually public cautions from Wheeler and Baer a warning.""This is going to be a tough road for them. Tough,"" said one expert, who spoke anonymously to protect business relationships. ""In the wake of AT&T/T-Mobile, this deal faces long odds.""

240,"   By Barbara Liston | ORLANDO,  Fla., June 17  ORLANDO,  Fla., June 17 Universal Orlando kicks off previews on Wednesday of its much anticipated Diagon Alley, a second Harry Potter-themed attraction that is expected provide a boost for the park's revenues and for tourism in central Florida.Universal has yet to fix a date for the opening of Diagon Alley this summer, but theme park experts predict a major bump in tourism based on the response to the original, a recreation of Hogsmeade Village, which required staggered entry times long after the June 2010 grand opening to control crowds.""There are heightened expectations for this expansion,"" said Richmond-based theme park consultant John Gerner of Leisure Business Advisors.Universal did not respond to inquiries about company attendance expectations.In the month after the original Harry Potter attraction opened, bed tax revenue from hotel guests in Orange County jumped 21 percent over the previous year. ""It certainly appeared to be a correlation to the Harry Potter opening,"" said Peggy McGarrity, deputy county comptroller, who added that double-digit increases became standard thereafter.Universal and the Harry Potter franchise are being promoted all week on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. The network and resort are both owned by Comcast Corp. ""It's unusual you would have a national show like the Tonight Show to promote this. That's an indication they are doing everything they can,"" Gerner said.Universal is promising a red carpet event to unveil the park on Wednesday night with some of the film's stars but is not saying which ones.Diagon Alley recreates the wizarding business district in London described in J. K. Rowling's book and movie series. The attraction will be geared in large part toward eateries and souvenir shops, both of which have been bottlenecks in the Hogsmeade Village, home to the wizard school Hogwarts.Gerner said popular themed attractions can double their ticket price revenue from in-park sales.To visit both sections of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, guests will have to buy a more expensive two-park pass because Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley were built in separate Universal parks. The attractions are connected by a train featured in books and movies which is a themed ride in itself.Gerner said this is the first time a resort has found a way to seamlessly connect two separately ticketed parks to drive up ticket sales.

241,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Ronald Grover  and Liana B. BakerJune 20Univision Communications has had several informal sale talks in the past year, but the company's board could take a year or longer to decide on a potential deal, as the company seeks to boost profits and pay down debt, people familiar with the matter said.Owners of the Spanish-language U.S. media company think it could fetch more by further improving its earnings ahead of an initial public offering or sale in 2015, according to three people familiar with the board's thinking.Univision's reluctance to commit to a formal sale process at this stage highlights the challenges that the company's potential suitors face in winning what is widely considered to be one of the media industry's most highly coveted businesses.The company held preliminary talks with CBS Corp and Time Warner Inc earlier this year, but those talks were preliminary in nature, the people said. The board, including members who represent private equity firms that bought Univision for $12.3 billion in 2007, could still decide to sell if Univision fetches an offer that is too good to turn down, said one of the people.For now Univision is focused on paying down its $9.2 billion in debt through its rising cash flow, that person added.New York-based Univision was taken private by a group of buyout firms including Haim Saban's Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners. Mexican media company Televisa owns an 8 percent stake in Univision and has bought debt that could be converted into a stake of up to 30 percent. It holds three board seats and also collects hundreds of millions in licensing revenue and royalties every year from Univision which airs a large chunk of its programming.""It is unclear if Televisa would be willing to divest its stake or even acquire the remainder of the company at this juncture,"" Barclays analyst Danish Agboatwala said.A representative for Televisa declined to comment on its plans. Univision reduced its debt by nearly $130 million in the first quarter ended March 31, its most recent quarter, compared to a year ago, according to a financial statement on its website. Net cash flow from operations more than tripled, to $77.8 million in the quarter that ended March 31, as the company enjoyed higher ratings at its UniMas broadcast network and Univision Deportes Network cable sports channel.Representatives for CBS and Time Warner Inc declined to comment. Univision spokeswoman Monica Talan said the company does not comment on rumors.The talks underscore the consolidation sweeping the telecoms, cable and satellite TV industry, which is being shaken up by Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc and AT&T's agreement to buy satellite TV provider DirecTV.Walt Disney Co is another media company that could be interested in Univision, analysts said. Maxim Group analyst John Tinker said the fees that Univision collects from pay TV operators could appeal to Disney, while there could also be synergies with its theme park business since many park visitors are Spanish speaking. A Disney representative declined to comment.Univision, which based in New York, owns two broadcast TV networks, 62 TV stations and 68 radio stations in major U.S. Hispanic markets and Puerto Rico. Its cable channels include entertainment network Galavision and Fusion, a news and lifestyle channel for English-speaking viewers it launched in October with Walt Disney Co.

242,"  (Adds comments on reduction of prices, Comcast/Time Warner competition, rewrites throughout)By Marina Lopes and Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, June 24 U.S. lawmakers grilled AT&T Inc and DirecTV on Tuesday over a proposed merger that some Democrats and public interest groups fear will result in higher costs and less competition.The chief executives of the No. 2 wireless carrier and the largest U.S. satellite TV service provider testified about their proposed $48.5 billion deal at hearings in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and said the scale the merger would allow them to save on the high costs of negotiating rights to video content.But there were some tough reactions in Washington.""I am very, very skeptical as a senator, not just as a consumer,"" senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said at a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.Blumenthal asked AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson whether he could commit to pass on the savings from lower content fees to consumers dollar-for-dollar. ""No sir, I can't,"" Stephenson said, but added he hoped the merger would result in slower price increases for consumers.""One would have to believe in the market and the market pressures, and that market pressures will compete margins away and cost savings will find their way into prices.""Michael White, DirecTV's Chief Executive added that he expected customers to see better value bundles. ""It's pretty hard to commit to lower prices on pure-play TV because of the price of content,"" he said.The companies say their merger would also allow them to better compete with cable companies and provide improved Internet service to rural areas.But representatives of content producers and smaller cable operators spoke out against the deal, saying the combined company might wield too much power over the creation, distribution and costs of programming. The AT&T/DirecTV merger is one of several roiling the cable and wireless industries. Consumer advocates are worried that consolidation might result in fewer choices and higher prices for consumers.The others mergers are Comcast Corp's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc and Sprint Corp's  potential bid for T-Mobile US Inc.The Justice Department, which ensures mergers comply with antitrust law, and the Federal Communications Commission, which has a broader public-interest standard, will have to approve the deal. Lawmakers, although influential, do not have a formal role in deciding the fate of deals.Earlier on Tuesday, Stephenson also told House Judiciary Committee lawmakers that AT&T's proposed purchase of DirecTV does not compare with other mergers that are shaking up the telecommunications industry because the companies largely provide different services.Comcast, however, has stressed that its bid for Time Warner Cable would combine two companies that serve different markets, while AT&T and DirecTV overlap in serving about 25 percent of U.S. households.

255,"   By Jennifer Saba  Aug 4 Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc is expected to make an aggressive case for merging with Time Warner Inc during its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, though people familiar with the company's plans have said it would not use that forum to raise its bid.Time Warner is due to report its financial results on Wednesday as well, marking the first time executives from both companies will publicly speak since the offer was first revealed on July 16.It will be an opportunity for Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes to defend his record for shareholder value. Fox's Chief Operating Officers Chase Carey and James Murdoch will have the chance to discuss the more than $1 billion in cost savings and powerful combination of cable networks and sports programming. It is unclear whether Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of Fox, will make an appearance given the stakes.Fox has offered to buy Time Warner for about $80 billion, or about $85 per share, in a mix of cash and stock. Time Warner turned it down, saying its plan to go it alone ""is superior to any proposal"" from Fox.Though Fox is expected to raise its offer it will not rise beyond the range of $90 to $95 per share, a person familiar with Fox told Reuters on July 25. The timing of another offer is unclear. Some analysts have said that an even higher bid would be needed to win over Time Warner management and shareholders A spokesman for Fox declined to comment.A potential tie-up would create one of the world's largest media conglomerates, dominating content production with two major studios, a stable of cable networks like Fox News and TNT, broadcast networks and pay-TV channel HBO. Faced with a rash of media distribution mergers, such as Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and AT&T's $48.5 billion deal to buy DirecTV, programming creators are responding with their own potential deals to add clout for negotiations with cable and satellite distributors and new entrants like Netflix  and Amazon.Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note to investors on Friday that it would be in the interest of both companies to ink a deal. He and his team spoke to hundreds of Fox and Time Warner shareholders and concluded that ""most people are supportive.""""To reject the $85 a share offer, you would have to believe that Time Warner would get to $95 a share on its own,"" he wrote. ""We don't find very many people who think it will be easy to get there."" A Time Warner spokesman declined to comment.With a backdrop of a rebuffed deal, Time Warner will be on the hook to explain why it is better off going solo.Time Warner has outpaced its peers with 15.2 percent earnings per share growth for the past 5 years, nearly double the median for its competitors, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Can Time Warner demonstrate to shareholders that left alone, the value to shareholders would be meaningfully greater than the $85 bid on the table from Fox?"" Alan Gould, managing director at Evercore Partners Inc, asked in a research note.For now, Gould pointed out that there does not seem to be an alternative bidder.

The plan must be put to a vote of creditors and approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Marvin Isgur.Comcast made clear it did not back the plan in its current form. ""The reorganization plan presented raises significant concerns regarding the equitable treatment of the network and its various constituencies,"" Comcast said in a statement. ""We intend to exercise all of our available rights as part of a fair process.""The network was pushed into bankruptcy by a unit of Comcast Corp, which loaned the network $100 million and filed an involuntary bankruptcy against it in September. At the time, Comcast said the network should be put up for sale and that it was prepared to bid.The sports network owes the Astros $27.8 million for unpaid licensing fees from its 2013 season, and it has not paid the team at all for 2014, according to court documents. The Rockets was owed $44.4 million for its 2013-14 season,  court documents say.The network plans to repay some of what it owes the teams by pursuing legal claims against Comcast for exerting undue influence over the network and attempting to it at a knock-down price, according to court documents.Regional sports networks have risen sharply in value in recent years, thanks to exclusive rights to broadcast games and the loyalties of sports fans. The Houston network was formed in 2003 by the Astros and Rockets to broadcast their games as well as games of the Houston Dynamo soccer team and 150 college games. Comcast bought a stake in 2010.The network has failed to reach a majority of Houston-area viewers due to disagreements with cable and satellite television providers.

261,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Aug 20 Online video personalities are joining together to advocate for equal treatment of Internet traffic, aiming to stop the U.S. government from allowing what they worry will be fast and slow lanes for delivering content.The video creators are signing an online petition that will be submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, which is now considering new ""net neutrality"" rules governing how broadband providers route Internet traffic. Some stars have posted videos about the issue to rally their legions of fans.Internet campaigns have impacted policy issues in the past. In 2012, a massive online mobilization of Internet users and major websites helped sink anti-piracy legislation.Organizers hope the new effort, which they are starting to publicize on Wednesday, will raise the visibility of online video creators and the scope of their industry with regulators.The top stars have built careers by posting videos on Google Inc's YouTube and other platforms. While many aren't mainstream celebrities, they reach millions of fans daily.As of Wednesday, dozens of online personalities had joined the effort on www.videocreatorsfornetneutrality.org. Those creators represent more than 10,000 videos that have been viewed 5.2 billion times, according to the website. ""This is a huge community, and they will be massively impacted by this,"" said Michael Weinberg, a vice president at consumer group Public Knowledge, one of the organizers behind the petition.Another organizer is The Harry Potter Alliance, a group of  fans who advocate for social change. The FCC's proposal, while prohibiting Internet providers from blocking content, suggests allowing some ""commercially reasonable"" deals where content companies such as Netflix  or Amazon.com could pay broadband providers such as Comcast Corp or Verizon Communications  to ensure smooth and fast delivery of their web traffic. Critics, which include Netflix, worry that such rules could result in ""slow lanes"" for content from sources that do not pay. Video creators are concerned that such rules would limit the ability of independent producers to reach audiences.The petitioners are asking the FCC to consider classifying Internet service as a public utility, a step advocates say would give the agency more power to stop potential net neutrality violators.Among the advocates are YouTube stars Hank Green and his brother John Green, a novelist who wrote the book that was the basis for the hit movie ""The Fault in Our Stars.""In a video posted on their vlogbrothers YouTube channel, Hank Green stages a debate between himself as an Internet user, and himself as a representative of an Internet service provider. The video has been viewed more than 512,000 times.Hank Green said he decided to speak out because ""the Internet, and particularly the flat and neutral Internet, was the most significant driver of new economic growth of the last 20 years,"" and he doesn't want new rules to interfere with that.

Indiana said it was looking at the deal but declined to say if it was working with the group of state attorneys general. It is not unusual for attorneys general to join a Justice Department investigation of a major merger that potentially affects consumers in their state.Asked about the expanded investigation, AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris said: ""We look forward to discussions with these state attorneys generals on the significant consumer benefits created by this merger."" While antitrust experts have said they expect the AT&T deal to be approved, the proposed transaction has raised hackles for several reasons.One is because of lost competition in the estimated quarter of U.S. homes where AT&T, the No. 2 wireless carrier, offers U-Verse, fiber optic delivery of television programming, high-speed Internet and home phone service. DirecTV, a satellite alternative to local cable providers, is present in those markets.The attorneys general also are looking at programming issues, one source said. Content producers and smaller cable operators worry that the combined company might wield too much power over the creation, distribution and costs of programming. They also are asking questions about the merger's effects on the development of high-speed broadband. As part of the deal, AT&T pledged to expand broadband to 70 million consumer locations.The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission must sign off on both deals before they can close.

Responding to calls for action from advocacy groups and a segment by comedian John Oliver on his HBO show, Americans overwhelmed the FCC with comments through online automated submission forms, email and mail.The net neutrality submissions more than doubled the FCC's previous record of 1.4 million comments submitted about singer Janet Jackson's accidental breast exposure during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004.They also smashed records at other federal agencies on contentious issues, for instance trumping the more than 1 million comments received by the State Department last year on its environmental review of the Keystone XL pipeline. No formal deadline exists for the FCC to set new rules, which require a majority vote at the five-member FCC for approval. The agency has scheduled a series of workshops on technological, economic and legal aspects of the rules through early October, so the vote is unlikely before November.The workshops, which will be open to the public in Washington and streamed live online, begin on Tuesday, focusing on policy approaches to the rules and on mobile broadband.People can submit comments by email and on Twitter, the FCC said. Wheeler has said he wanted to set new rules as quickly as possible, given the void created by a federal court's rejection in January of the FCC's earlier version. That means he could present a new draft of the rules before the end of the year.The outcry on net neutrality prompted Wheeler to alter the plan to ask whether ""some or all"" pay-for-priority deals should be banned and whether ISPs should be entirely reclassified to face regulations more like public utilities, an approach backed by advocacy groups but staunchly opposed by Republican lawmakers and the ISPs.Wheeler has repeatedly reassured the public of his intent to  police any discrimination, which ISPs say would not be in their business interest anyway.

279,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON, Sept 30  WASHINGTON, Sept 30 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering a  change in how it regulates Internet TV, potentially putting it on the same footing as traditional cable and satellite television, an FCC official familiar with the idea said on Tuesday.If formalized and approved, the change would help Internet TV services, such as ones being developed by Dish Network Corp , Sony Corp and Verizon Communications Inc , compete with traditional pay-TV for digital rights to major network programming.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, however, indicated the plan has not been circulated yet to the four FCC commissioners, who would have to vote to formally propose it and begin the process of collecting public comments.""Somebody found out that it was an idea that was being kicked around ... and that's where it stands,"" Wheeler said Tuesday. ""I'm not ready to plant the flag,"" he added. The idea concerns online subscription video services that offer scheduled programming similar to traditional pay-TV providers, and not online video services such as Netflix Inc  that stream content on-demand.Traditionally, the FCC has ensured that cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp could negotiate for rights to retransmit major network programming. Online video services have not had the same regulatory backing because they rely on a different technology and do not have their own video distribution facilities. Now, the FCC's Media Bureau is proposing leveling the playing field with a technology-neutral definition of a ""multichannel video program distributor,"" said the FCC official who spoke anonymously to discuss matters that have not been made public. The goal behind the plan is to encourage new and stronger competition in the video market.""You want to make sure that you're always keeping up with technology, you're always keeping up with innovations in the marketplace. This falls into that kind of category,"" Wheeler told reporters, when asked what prompted the consideration. A draft of the proposal tentatively concludes that Internet TV services should have the same access to major network programming as traditional pay-TV services and seeks comments on whether the obligations imposed on the two types of video services should also be the same, the FCC official said.It was unclear how quickly the proposal could come up for a vote by FCC commissioners, but it could potentially be as soon as Oct. 17.If adopted, analysts see the proposal as creating a possible new opening for Aereo, a video streaming company whose business model was questioned by a Supreme Court ruling in June that said the company had infringed broadcasters' copyrights by capturing live and recorded programs through antennas and transmitting them to subscribers.(Reporting by Alina Selyukh; Editing by Tom Brown)",2014-09-30,CMCSA,"Tue Sep 30, 2014 | 2:41pm EDT",U.S. regulators look into treating Internet TV like cable,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fcc-video-idUSL2N0RV1AL20140930?type=companyNews
280,"   By Anjuli Davies and Soyoung Kim | LONDON/NEW YORK, Sept 30  LONDON/NEW YORK, Sept 30 European companies emboldened to spend their large cash balances on U.S. rivals have boosted global deal volumes by 60 percent so far in 2014, just as new government rules look set to dampen U.S. companies' deal making abroad aimed at cutting taxes.After several years of economic stagnation, European chief executives are feeling more confident that the crisis is behind them. Keen to buy growth in an anemic economy and capitalize on cheap financing and ample cash reserves, they are pulling the trigger on deals in the faster-growing American economy.""In a world where Europe is slow, China is slowing, and the U.S. is actually accelerating, you want to be in the U.S. European companies realize they are underinvested in the best part of the world for the next several years,"" said Michael Santini, global head of Deutsche Bank AG's  industrials group.Global mergers and acquisitions have surged to $2.66 trillion year to date, up 60.1 percent from the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters data as of September 26. That was the highest level since 2007, when deal volume hit $3.2 trillion.The volume of cross-border transactions is up 119 percent, passing the $1 trillion mark for the first time since 2007 and accounting for nearly 40 percent of total deals globally. In the year-ago period, cross-border deals made up just 29 percent of global activity.In the past two weeks alone, a slew of large cross-border deals were struck, led by German companies seeking to expand into the United States.Drugs and chemicals maker Merck KGaA agreed to buy U.S. based Sigma-Aldrich Corp for $17 billion; industrial group Siemens is acquiring U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand for $7.6 billion; and German car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen reached a deal to buy U.S.-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp for $13.5 billion, including debt.""Several years of internal focus on efficiency and portfolio trimming, strong balance sheets as well as increased confidence of boardrooms have led to increased M&A activity of German corporates,"" said Jens Maurer at Morgan Stanley, responsible for M&A in Germany.Not only German companies are looking for U.S. acquisitions, says Dirk Albersmeier, head of German M&A at JPMorgan Chase .""The fact that so many German companies have announced deals in the past 10 days is a bit of a coincidence. It is unlikely that that pace will be kept up. Instead, you will see (outbound) transactions from other European countries,"" he said.Norway's Yara International and Chicago-based CF Industries are in talks on a merger that would create a $27.5 billion global fertilizer producer, while Sweden's Electrolux in September struck a $3.3 billion deal to buy General Electric Co's appliance business, its biggest deal ever.European M&A as a result is up 83 percent from last year, totaling $685 billion, or 26 percent of the global market. Activity in the United States is up 63 percent to $1.23 trillion, accounting for the lion's share of global deal making, with 46 percent, Thomson Reuters data show. However, some factors contributing to caution in boardrooms are the volatility in the Middle East, as well as heightened regulatory scrutiny around some of the biggest transactions.Sprint Corp and its parent, Softbank Corp, decided to end their pursuit of T-Mobile US after conceding that U.S. antitrust regulators would likely block  such a tie-up. The proposed mergers of Comcast Corp  and Time Warner Cable, and AT&T and DirecTV  are also pending regulatory reviews.""There is continued caution around the regulatory environment as deals are getting bigger and industries are consolidating,"" said Gregg Lemkau, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group.INVERSION PAUSE The wave of European purchases of U.S. firms has counterbalanced activity earlier in the year in which at least 10 U.S. companies chased European targets in a so-called tax inversion. Such deals allow them to be domiciled in countries that have a lower corporate tax rate. But the U.S. Treasury Department last week announced a series of moves designed to make new inversions more difficult to do and less economically rewarding.The rules apply to deals that have been announced but not yet completed, including AbbVie's agreement to buy Shire Plc for $54.7 billion and Medtronic's  proposed $42.9 billion acquisition of Covidien Plc, raising doubts that the deals will proceed.The rules could also deter other U.S. companies, such as Pfizer, from seeking their own inversion deals. Pfizer had been looking for alternative deals after its $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca failed in May over price.The pace of inversions had already slowed in recent months. Since August, only one such deal was announced, when Burger King  said it planned to buy Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc for $11.5 billion and base the merged company in Canada.BUY HIGH  Multi-billion dollar deals are driving activity so far this year, with 76 deals worth more than $5 billion announced compared with 32 deals in the year-ago period, according to Thomson Reuters data.""This year has been about the return of the large strategic acquirers and the return of big deals,"" Goldman Sachs' Lemkau said. ""The biggest companies are continuing to actively assess and pursue their most important strategic objectives via M&A.""But some of these deals have been expensive. With stock markets at record-high levels, the average premium buyers paid over target companies' four-week stock prices was 25.5 percent, down from 27.8 percent in the same period last year and 30.3 percent in 2012.But on an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) basis, valuations continued to climb.Buyers on average paid targets 12 times EBITDA in the first nine months of the year, compared with 11.2 times in the same period last year. That was the highest since 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data. For U.S. targets, buyers paid a much higher 14.6 times EBITDA, up from 11 times last year.""The single most important constraint at the moment is to justify valuations,"" said Wilhelm Schulz, head of EMEA M&A at Citigroup.""The good thing is that so far the market has been receptive to M&A and in a low-yield environment, M&A is still seen as a good solution, and a better option compared to share buy-backs or increased dividends.""Deutsche Bank's Santini said some European buyers eyeing U.S. deals may choose to act sooner rather than later amid expectations U.S. rates will rise in 2015 while Europe will continue to hold rates at zero to try to stimulate growth.""The U.S. dollar could strengthen relative to the euro so the cost of acquisitions could be more economical today,"" he said.Buyout firms have been forced to sit back and watch, with private equity-backed leveraged buyouts accounting for just 7.4 percent of total M&A activity, compared with 10.3 percent this time last year.Goldman Sachs was the top M&A adviser worldwide, with almost $777 billion worth of deals. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch rounded out the top five.

285,"  NEW YORK Oct 4 Redbox Instant, a streaming video service operated by Verizon Communications Inc and Outerwall Inc's Redbox, will shut down next week because the venture has not been as successful as hoped, the two companies announced Saturday.The service, which combined the Redbox DVD rental kiosk business with a streaming video offering from Verizon, was launched in 2013 to compete against online video company Netflix Inc, but never caught on with consumers.Redbox Instant will shut down on Oct. 7th, the companies said in a joint statement.

286,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ten years ago, Walt Disney Co, having fended off a hostile bid from Comcast, had to make a case why it was better off as an independent company.It succeeded. Disney's shares have soared more than 250 percent since.Now, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes faces a similar moment of reckoning after rejecting a bid for $85 a share from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox. Bewkes and other top brass will be under pressure at a meeting with analysts and investors next Wednesday to show they can repeat Disney's magic.""Disney pleaded the case to get its share price up on their own,"" said David Miller, an analyst with Topeka Capital Markets.""We think that Mr. Bewkes will attempt to drive home the same concept,"" he said, adding it remained to be seen if Bewkes would manage to replicate Disney's sterling stock performance.Time Warner is trading at around $73 - more than twice its price since Bewkes took over as CEO in 2008, but still below Murdoch's original $85 bid. Fox had considered boosting the offer to as high as $95 a share, people familiar with the matter said.  Rejection has had its price. Time Warner shares have dropped 15 percent since Aug. 5, when Fox walked away from its offer. Fox shares are up 5.7 percent over the same period.""It's too simple to say that Bewkes has to get the stock price over $85,"" said Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss.  ""He has to tell us why he said no to Fox. Time Warner has said nothing - only that at no price would it combine with Fox.""Gabelli, an asset management firm, holds shares in Time Warner. Harriss thought a combined Fox and Time Warner would benefit both companies. Bewkes, who last stood in front of investors during a similar meeting four years ago, will lay out a long-term vision for the company's Warner Bros movie studio, Turner Broadcasting cable networks and pay TV channel HBO. Those plans could include letting consumers buy HBO without a cable subscription, given the popularity of the HBO GO mobile app, some analysts have said. Topeka's Miller said that a new broadband-only product similar to Netflix could crack open new markets.Topeka estimates that there are approximately 9 million households in the United States with Internet access but no pay TV and roughly 66 million households with pay TV but no HBO. Indeed, Bewkes has slowly changed his tune about Netflix that he once derided as a ""200-pound chimp."" He said Monday, at a conference hosted by Hollywood website The Wrap, that he wished he personally owned the streaming video service, given its market value of around $30 billion.There are other signs of Time Warner's long-term plan that have emerged over the past weeks. Turner Broadcasting and Disney's ESPN more than doubled their annual payments to the NBA under a new nine-year deal worth more than $22 billion. Collectively, TBS and ESPN will pay more than $2.5 billion, starting in the 2016-17 season, to the basketball league. The networks coughed up more to keep the rights out of the hands of Fox - which started its own sports network - and those of other rivals.The pricey content deal comes as Turner, which also operates the 24-hour news channel CNN, attempts to crack down on costs. The company, which employs about 14,000 full-time staffers, is poised to slash 10 percent of its workforce.Focusing on internal operations is how Disney jolted it shares, noted Topeka's Miller - a strategy likely to be embraced by Bewkes.

Oct 9 President Barack Obama declared himself fully committed to ""net neutrality"" on Thursday while U.S. regulators review controversial new regulations that would govern how Internet service providers (ISPs) manage traffic on their networks.The Federal Communications Commission has received a record 1.5 million comments since Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed new so-called Open Internet rules in April. Consumer advocacy groups criticized the rules for creating fast and slow ""lanes"" on the web.""Net neutrality"" refers to the idea that Internet service providers should enable equal access to all content regardless of source.The proposed rules would ban them ISPs from blocking or slowing down users' access to websites but allow them to charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of traffic to users.

Analysts had been expecting $16.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Comcast said it added 315,000 net high-speed Internet subscribers, a 5.8 percent uptick over the year-ago period.About 81,000 customers canceled video subscriptions, far fewer than the net loss of 127,000 in the 2013 third quarter. Analysts had forecast a net loss of 93,000 subscribers, according to StreetAccount.Comcast said the number of customers who dropped cable subscriptions was the smallest of any third quarter in seven years. It has a total of 26.8 million customers.Comcast shares were up 3.4 percent at $53.25 in early afternoon trading. The decrease in cable subscriptions is a closely watched figure that has taken on greater import given two major announcements from Time Warner Inc's HBO and CBS Corp last week.Both the pay TV network and broadcaster are launching services that allow people to watch programs with only a broadband connection. Cable and satellite distributors are seeking ways to stop consumers, especially younger ones, from dumping their cable subscriptions, or ""cutting the cord."" NBC Universal Chief Executive Steve Burke told analysts on Thursday he was surprised by the HBO and CBS news and that both media companies face challenges.He noted the standalone products represent a big strategic  change for Time Warner and CBS. Time Warner has long pushed the notion of ""TV Everywhere"" which allows cable and satellite customers to access content on any device. CBS has touted its ability to receive retransmission fees - money paid by distributors to CBS to carry the network. ""The existing customers that are sold through cable and satellite are extremely high-margin,"" Burke said.

299,"   By Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 28 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission in coming weeks will vote on whether Internet TV should have the same access to television programming as cable and satellite TV providers, which could shake up competition in the video industry.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler on Tuesday said he has asked his fellow commissioners to vote on a proposal that would help Internet TV services, such as ones being developed by Dish Network Corp, Sony Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, to compete with traditional pay-TV for digital rights to major network programming.The potential regulatory change concerns online subscription video services that offer scheduled programming similar to traditional pay-TV providers, and not online video services such as Netflix Inc that stream content on demand.Satellite provider DirecTV is another company that has indicated plans for an Internet video service and CBS Corp  this month revealed a plan for an Internet streaming service that would include scheduled programming. Time Warner Inc's HBO will also launch a standalone online streaming product but its details are unclear.Traditionally, the FCC has ensured that cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp could negotiate for rights to retransmit network programming. Online video services have not had the same regulatory backing because they rely on a different technology and do not have their own video distribution facilities. Now, the FCC will vote on leveling the playing field with a technology-neutral definition of a ""multichannel video program distributor,"" with the goal of encouraging new competition in the video market.""Twenty-first century consumers shouldn't be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th-century technology,"" Wheeler said in a blog post on Tuesday. ""Consumers have long complained about how their cable service forces them to buy channels they never watch. The move of video onto the Internet can do something about that frustration, but first Internet video services need access to the programs.""A draft of the proposal tentatively concludes that online TV services should have the same access to cable and local TV programs as traditional pay-TV services and seeks comments on whether the obligations imposed on the two types of video services should also be the same.If adopted, some analysts see the proposal as potentially also creating a new opening for Aereo, a video streaming company whose business model was questioned by a Supreme Court ruling in June that said the company had infringed broadcasters' copyrights by capturing live and recorded programs through antennas and transmitting them to subscribers.The vote by four FCC commissioners, two Democrats and two Republicans, would formally propose the idea and begin the process of seeking public comments.

301,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Comcast Corp has reached a $50 million settlement in a decade-old lawsuit accusing it of overcharging cable television subscribers, 1-1/2 years after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a larger version of the class-action case.The preliminary settlement, which requires court approval, calls for Comcast to pay $16.67 million in cash to current and former subscribers in Philadelphia and four nearby countries.Comcast will also offer current subscribers as much as $33.33 million in services via a $15 bill credit or free Internet upgrades or movies worth up to $43.90.More than 800,000 subscribers are believed to be included. Comcast denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.Settlement papers were filed on Tuesday with the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, where Comcast is based. Neither Comcast nor lawyers for the plaintiffs responded immediately to requests for comment. The lawyers plan to seek as much as $15 million to cover fees and expenses.In the lawsuit, begun in December 2003, the plaintiffs accused Comcast of trying to monopolize the Philadelphia-area cable TV market and unfairly raising prices by buying rivals or swapping coverage areas, resulting in peak market share of 77.8 percent in 2002.In March 2013, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, threw out an earlier version of the lawsuit that covered more than 2 million subscribers. Scalia said the proposed subscriber class failed to show they were harmed in sufficiently similar ways, or that damages could be measured classwide rather than individually.A fourth amended complaint covering the smaller class was filed this April, and became the basis for the settlement. In a court filing, Eric Green, a retired Boston University law professor who mediated the settlement, said it was an ""excellent result"" for class members.The settlement covers Comcast customers in Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania who subscribe to video programming services other than basic cable, or who did so between 2003 and 2008.

308,"  (Revises first paragraph and adds link to Insider video)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Nov 10 U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday said Internet service providers should be regulated more like public utilities to make sure they grant equal access to all content providers, touching off intense protests from cable and telecoms companies and Republican lawmakers.Obama's detailed statement on the issue of ""net neutrality,"" a platform in his 2008 presidential campaign, was a rare intervention by the White House into the policy setting of an independent agency.Shares of major Internet service providers Comcast Corp  and Time Warner Cable Inc fell sharply after Obama said ISPs should be reclassified to face stricter regulations and banned from striking paid ""fast lane"" deals with content companies.The president also said the Federal Communications Commission's new rules should apply equally to mobile and wired ISPs, with a recognition of special challenges that come with managing wireless networks.""Simply put: No service should be stuck in a 'slow lane' because it does not pay a fee,"" Obama, currently in Asia, said in a statement released by the White House. ""That kind of gate keeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet's growth.""Nearly 4 million comments flooded the FCC this year after Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed new Internet traffic rules in May that would prohibit the ISPs from blocking any content but allowed content companies to strike ""commercially reasonable"" deals to ensure their websites and applications load smoothly and swiftly.Although Wheeler had pledged to police any such paid-prioritization deals that would harm consumers, public interest groups worried that his proposed rules would create ""fast lanes"" for the companies that pay up and relegate others to ""slow lanes."" ISPs say they have not and will not strike paid prioritization deals but have balked at the prospect of being regulated more like public utilities.""Reclassification ..., which for the first time would apply 1930s-era utility regulation to the Internet, would be a radical reversal of course,"" Verizon Communications Inc said in a statement.Verizon in January won a federal court case challenging the FCC's previous set of net neutrality rules, which allowed ""commercially reasonable"" discrimination of traffic but indicated the FCC would disapprove of pay-for-priority deals.The court supported the commission's authority to regulate broadband access but said the agency was applying stricter rules to ISPs that did not jibe with the way the FCC classified them, which is as an information service. Consumer advocates have for years pressed the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service as a way to have more oversight authority, but ISPs have pledged they would fight the matter in court.Verizon on Monday said a ""gratuitous"" move to reclassify would probably not stand up in court, while AT&T said it would expect to participate in a legal challenge.'OBAMACARE FOR THE INTERNET'  Wheeler, Obama's friend and former major fundraiser, on Monday reiterated that he, too, opposed Internet fast lanes or harmful prioritization deals but said that approaches including reclassification of ISPs to regulate them more strictly raised substantive legal questions.""We must take the time to get the job done correctly, once and for all, in order to successfully protect consumers and innovators online,"" Wheeler said.Obama and other White House officials acknowledged that the FCC, as an independent agency, would ultimately shape the regulations. But Republicans lawmakers quickly seized on Obama's encroachment, days after their party won control of both houses of Congress in a midterm election largely viewed as a repudiation of the president's policies.""Net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet,"" said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. ""It puts the government in charge of determining Internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered.""Though lobbyists say legislative efforts to overturn new rules would face a White House veto, cable and wireless companies were expected to turn to Republican allies in Congress for stricter oversight of the FCC.""The president's call ... would turn the Internet into a government-regulated utility and stifle our nation's dynamic and robust Internet sector with rules written nearly 80 years ago for plain old telephone service,"" said Senator John Thune, a Republican expected to lead the Senate Commerce Committee.Wheeler had originally pushed to reinstate net neutrality rules before the end of the year, but experts on Monday said the latest developments probably pushed the process into 2015.Time Warner Cable shares fell as much as 7.2 percent, and closed down almost 5 percent, while Comcast dropped as much as 6.1 percent and closed own 4 percent. Comcast, whose bid to buy Time Warner Cable is under regulatory review, was by far the most actively traded stock on U.S. markets.

309,"  (Adds Comcast CEO's comments)By Marina LopesWASHINGTON Nov 12 AT&T Inc on Wednesday raised pressure on the U.S. telecommunications regulator's work on new ""net neutrality"" rules, saying it would stop investing in high-speed Internet connections in 100 cities until the Web rules were settled.The statement from AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson is the first move by an Internet service provider in response to President Barack Obama's unexpected call on the Federal Communications Commission on Monday to regulate these companies more like public utilities.AT&T has been spending heavily on acquisitions and the statement came only days after it cut its capital spending estimate for 2015.The industry and Republican lawmakers have protested Obama's proposal, saying stricter Internet traffic regulations would stifle growth and investment. ""We can't go out and invest that kind of money deploying fiber to 100 cities not knowing under what rules those investments will be governed,"" Stephenson said at an analyst conference.In April, AT&T said it would deploy its high-speed fiber network in 100 cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami.Ensuring access to quality Internet for all Americans has been the FCC's major focus. The White House detailed Obama's plan in a blog post on Monday, saying that, if implemented, it ""shouldn't create any new burden for Internet providers."" Telecom companies plan to fight Obama's call for utility-style regulations in Congress and the courts.More than three dozen congressional Republicans wrote to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler on Wednesday that Obama's proposed changes were ""beyond the scope of the FCC's authority."" Comcast Corp, now closing a merger deal with Time Warner Cable Inc that would create the nation's top cable Internet service provider, said on Wednesday the net-neutrality uncertainty would chill investment in Web infrastructure.""The (regulatory) insecurity creates investment insecurity,"" Comcast CEO Brian Roberts told reporters in San Francisco. ""We will spend $20 billion in capital spending if you include Time Warner Cable. We want to have open internet rules, but don't want to discourage investment.""AT&T, whose $48.5 billion bid for DirecTV is under government review, said on Friday it would also pay $1.7 billion to acquire Mexican wireless operator Iusacell. It trimmed its 2015 capital spending outlook to $18 billion from $21 billion.At the same conference on Wednesday, Verizon Communications Inc CFO Fran Shammo struck a more restrained tone. She said the FCC could restrict ""paid prioritization"" deals, where content companies pay for faster downloads of some websites or applications, without pursuing utility-style regulations.""I think the independent agency of the FCC will make the right decision,"" Shammo added.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, at the request of numerous content companies, is weighing how the FCC should handle the confidential materials related to programming agreements.Once the court rules, the FCC indicated it may further reset or delay the deadline to ensure enough time for outside parties to comment and for the agency to properly consider those comments. The country's biggest cable company Comcast has bid $45 billion for the No. 2 Time Warner Cable, while second-largest wireless provider AT&T has bid $48.5 billion to buy biggest satellite TV provider DirecTV.The FCC has to determine whether the deals are in the public interest.

The FCC said Time Warner Cable had withheld thousands of documents that the agency requested based on an inappropriate claim of attorney-client privilege and late submissions of those documents would significantly slow down the review.

Florida is a member of the multi-state group, which joined the Federal Trade Commission to determine if the deals were legal under antitrust law, according to Whitney Ray, spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi.Vermont has also joined, said Jill Abrams, an assistant attorney general in the state.

The presence of the state attorneys general gives the FTC additional lawyers to look at the case, much-needed knowledge of how the merging companies function in the state and how the deal would affect a state's consumers, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust attorney with the Konkurrenz Group in Washington, DC.""There are times where federal government wants to do one remedy and you have a state or two who believe that there should be more done in their state. They at times will negotiate additional divestitures,"" said Grunes. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar declined comment. Dollar General has previously said that it remained committed to the transaction and would continue to work with the FTC.Family Dollar, which has 8,100 discount stores in 46 states, has been targeted for a takeover by both Dollar Tree, which has 5,282 stores in 48 states, and by Dollar General, which is the big dog in discount retailing with 11,000 stores in 40 states.Family Dollar reported a 47 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday as margins fell due to higher discounting. Net income fell to $41.4 million, or 36 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 29, from $78 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.Family Dollar agreed to be bought by smaller rival Dollar Tree for $8.50 billion in cash and stock and rejected a hostile, $9.1 billion offer from Dollar General because of antitrust concerns.In December, Family Dollar shareholders voted by a wide margin to put off a vote approving the Dollar Tree offer, indicating interest in the higher offer despite its risk.

331,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Dan Levine  A U.S. judge has rejected portions of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's lawsuit seeking to stop Dish Network Corp from selling devices that let viewers skip over commercials when playing back shows.In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles rejected copyright claims that Fox had brought over the Hopper, Dish's digital recording device.Gee invoked last June's U.S. Supreme Court decision against the video streaming company Aereo Inc in concluding that Dish's ""sling"" technology, which lets programs be viewed on a wide range of mobile devices, did not constitute a ""public performance"" that infringed Fox copyrights.However, Gee allowed Fox to pursue some claims on whether Dish violated a contract governing distribution of Fox programming. In a statement on Tuesday, Fox spokesman Scott Grogin said the company welcomed Gee's contract rulings, and was disappointed by her copyright findings. ""This case is not, and has never been, about consumer rights or new technology,"" Grogin said. ""It's always been about protecting creative works from being exploited without permission.""In a statement, Dish said it welcomed the ruling. ""Consumers are the winners today, as the court sided with them on the key copyright issues in this case,"" the company said. The 63-page decision is dated January 12 and had been under seal.It may narrow the remaining litigation in a 3-year-old battle in which broadcasters accused Dish of using technology that infringed copyrights, and threatened advertising revenue by letting subscribers skip over commercials. CBS Corp and Walt Disney Co's ABC had settled similar litigation last year, as part of broader settlements allowing Dish to broadcast the networks' programs. Similar litigation against Dish by Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal had been put on hold pending developments in the Fox case. Fox had been scheduled to go to trial against Dish on Feb. 24, but the case has been put on hold until Oct. 1.Aereo, backed by billionaire Barry Diller, filed for bankruptcy in November after the Supreme Court effectively forbade its business model, involving the capture of programs on miniature antennas for retransmission to paying subscribers.The case is Fox Broadcasting Co et al v. Dish Network LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 12-04529.

332,"  (Adds specifics of plan, company comments)By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Feb 4 The top U.S. communications regulator on Wednesday proposed to tighten regulations on Internet service providers by treating them more like public utilities, an approach endorsed by President Barack Obama.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, in an op-ed on Wired.com, said he sought the ""strongest open Internet protections ever proposed by the FCC"" that would apply, for the first time, to both wireless and wired Internet services providers.The proposed rules to preserve net neutrality, the principle that all web traffic should be treated equally, would ban Internet providers from blocking or slowing down websites or charging companies for swifter delivery of their content in deals known as paid prioritization.But Wheeler also sought to address some Internet service providers' concerns, proposing no price regulations, tariffs or requirements to give competitors access to their networks.That and the largely expected nature of the proposal prompted investors to bid up cable and telecom stocks, including Comcast Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and Time Warner Cable. Wheeler's latest proposal would reclassify Internet service providers as more heavily regulated ""telecommunications services"" under Title II of the communications law, instead of the current, more lightly regulated ""information services.""Wheeler on Thursday will share his latest plan with other FCC commissioners. The five-member FCC will vote whether to enact new rules on Feb. 26.Such a change would represent a victory to smaller web companies and net neutrality activists who have argued that lack of such regulation would give unfair advantage to larger websites that can afford to pay for faster content delivery. That push has fueled widespread backlash from Internet providers, which argue that while they support net neutrality, such regulatory reclassification would impede investments and innovation.The broadband industry is expected to fight the rules in court, and Republicans in Congress are working on legislation to set net neutrality rules while restricting the FCC's authority. Without Democrats' support, any such legislation is expected to face Obama's veto.Under the proposed rules, the FCC for the first time would fully apply anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules to mobile carriers alongside wired ISPs, such as cable companies. The FCC authority would also expand to previously unregulated deals that content companies, such as Netflix Inc , strike with Internet services providers on the back-end of the network, known as interconnection agreements.  The FCC would review them on a case-by-case basis.The FCC has been working on new net neutrality rules since a previous version was struck down in court in January 2014 in a case brought by Verizon.Wheeler initially proposed to allow ""commercially reasonable"" paid prioritization deals, which upset net neutrality advocates and helped draw more than 4 million comments from the public. Obama later sided with critics, calling in November for the ""strongest possible"" net neutrality rules.""We're certainly encouraged to see that the FCC is heading in the same direction of safeguarding net neutrality with the strongest possible protections,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a press briefing on Wednesday.The debate over net neutrality has also put a sharp focus on the pending $45 billion merger of two of the largest cable companies, Comcast and Time Warner Cable. It is currently being reviewed by the FCC and Department of Justice.FCC officials on Wednesday said net neutrality rules ""had nothing to do with any proposed transactions."" But UBS analysts said in a note that they would give the FCC ""more than enough authority to police any negative consequences"" of the merger and so lowered the regulatory review hurdle.

335,"  Feb 14 Comcast Corp said on Friday that a California Public Utilities Commission Administrative (CPUC) law judge recommended  to approve its pending $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable and related transactions with Charter Communications.The approval, characterized by Comcast as an ""important step"" for the overall regulatory process, was proposed with a set of conditions, including making broadband available to un-served and under-served communities.Approval from California, the most populous U.S. state, is just one of a series of state and federal hurdles Comcast needs to clear to close the merger. Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen said the company was reviewing the proposed decision but that some of the recommended conditions ""could prevent the full benefits of this transaction being realized by Californians, and create a more intrusive regulatory regime where innovative services could be hampered rather than helped.""In a statement, Cohen specifically cited the penetration rates and said the time frame related to making broadband more widely available to communities lacking service was ""simply unattainable under market conditions."" ""We look forward to working with the Commission as it creates conditions to approve this transaction that are fair to consumers in California and to our company,"" he said. The overall approval of Comcast's acquisition of Time Warner has been closely watched especially as regulators propose rules that adhere to net neutrality, or the notion that all internet providers should treat all web traffic equally.Comcast said it already has the vast majority of state and local approvals necessary to close the deal. It is working with the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice toward a close in early 2015.

""We do not generally comment on pending litigation, but this complaint represents nothing more than a string of inflammatory, inaccurate, and unsupported allegations,"" she said.A Time Warner Cable spokeswoman declined to discuss the lawsuit, but said the New York-based company and Comcast remain separate, ""including with respect to programming decisions."" Sharpton also rejected the allegations, saying they could support defamation counterclaims, and that his group has received less than $1 million from Comcast.""The lawsuit is the epitome of an insult to the black community"" and has ""not one scintilla of evidence,"" Sharpton said in a phone interview.The NAACP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Entertainment Studios Networks Inc, owned by comedian and producer Byron Allen, is also suing Comcast and Time Warner Cable.The case is National Association of African-American Owned Media et al v. Comcast Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 15-01239.

349,"   By Sarah McBride | AUSTIN, Tx., March 16  AUSTIN, Tx., March 16 As his likely rivals spent the weekend shaking hands in New Hampshire, potential Republican candidate Rand Paul flew to Texas to court the software developers and entrepreneurs who are likely to play a central role in the 2016 election.The libertarian-leaning Kentucky Senator tweeted, Snapchatted and Instagrammed his way through the South by Southwest Interactive conference as he sought to make inroads among an independent-minded crowd that could serve as an important source of money, votes and programming talent for his expected presidential bid.""If you want talent you gotta go where the talent is,"" he said on Monday.It was the first time a potential candidate has participated in the conference, according to organizers. Paul spent much of the weekend talking about the shared DNA of the tech community and the libertarian movement, but he spent little time talking about net neutrality, the thorny question of how to ensure that all Internet traffic is treated equally.While many tech companies back recently approved rules that broadband providers such as Verizon and Comcast should be regulated like utilities, Paul and other Republicans have argued that the new regulations will choke off innovation.It's an argument he has made in great detail in other forums. In front of this crowd, he framed the debate in the broadest terms possible. ""I don't want the government to screw up one of the greatest technologies we've had,"" he told the conference on Sunday, drawing applause.The applause that line drew came as a surprise for tech consultant Warren Hanes, who said he thought many at the conference weren't aware of his opposition to the new rules.""It's possible there are people who simply responded emotionally to the issue of less regulation,"" he said.

While former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has locked down many big donors on Wall Street and Florida Senator Marco Rubio has made inroads with the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, Paul has worked hard to cultivate ties in Silicon Valley, where many entrepreneurs share his frustration with government eavesdropping.Campaigns have also engaged in a technology arms race since 2004 to find ever more sophisticated ways to target voters.

350,"   By Alina Selyukh and Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON AT&T Inc's proposed acquisition of satellite television company DirecTV is getting a smooth ride from U.S. regulators and industry rivals, who instead are directing their firepower at a merger deal between the nation's two biggest cable operators.U.S. Federal Communications Commission filings and interviews with several people familiar with the Justice Department show the $48.5 billion AT&T-DirecTV deal is getting far less attention than Comcast Corp's agreement to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45 billion.At the core is how Comcast's deal would bolster the company's already dominant position in broadband Internet, an important growth area as more Americans drop cable subscriptions to watch video on the Web.      Each merger would create a company controlling more than a quarter of the pay TV market. But it is the Comcast deal that has triggered FCC and Justice Department inquiries resulting in hours-long depositions, hundreds of meetings and nearly 90,000 comments, according to disclosures and people who have met with the regulators.Muted opposition does not necessarily guarantee a painless regulatory process for AT&T and DirecTV, but it does reduce pressure on regulators, whose bar is high for rejecting a merger, antitrust and FCC experts say. COMCAST CONCERNS  With Time Warner Cable, Comcast would provide high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data. Critics at advocacy groups and telecom, media and Web companies say they fear Comcast would gain unparalleled control over how content providers reach millions of pay-TV subscribers, as well as consumers' access to video delivered by competitors over the Internet.By contrast, AT&T covers about 17 percent of the broadband market, and DirecTV does not offer Internet access. ""The customers aren't anxious, and the competitors aren't rattled,"" said former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, now at law firm Covington & Burling. ""The FCC or the Justice Department will be looking for markets where this will have an impact, and hardly anyone is telling them that there are such markets.""The FCC, which determines if deals are in the public interest, has received nearly 20 petitions to deny Comcast's proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable, but only five such petitions for AT&T-DirecTV, a review of disclosures shows. The FCC has received about 14,000 ""brief comments"" on the AT&T deal, many from members of the public concerned about the merger, according to a Reuters tally. On Comcast-Time Warner Cable, the agency has gotten about 88,000 such comments.FCC disclosures show officials there have held more than 300 meetings with supporters and opponents of Comcast's proposed merger, compared with about 70 for AT&T-DirecTV.  A critic of the AT&T-DirecTV deal who met with the Justice Department said reviewers there asked ""few questions"" and gave ""blank stares."" The Justice Department, which looks at antitrust issues, and the FCC declined to comment for this story. A Comcast spokeswoman declined to comment on comparisons with AT&T's merger. But she said merging with Time Warner Cable would not cause consumers to lose any video, broadband or phone choices as the two companies do not directly compete in any market.An AT&T spokesman said the DirecTV acquisition received support from ""labor, rural interests, the tech community, and many others eager for an alternative to cable.""

Their review could be handed in as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/1CUPx9V) The final decision would be made by senior officials.Time Warner Cable shares closed down 5.4 percent at $149.61 on the New York Stock Exchange while Comcast shares ended down 2.1 percent at $58.42 on Nasdaq.A source close to Comcast said that discussions with the DOJ had been positive and that the Federal Communications Commission was still gathering material from companies, making it early for any discussion of conditions for a deal. The FCC, which as well as the Justice Department is reviewing the deal, earlier this month paused the informal countdown toward its decision as it awaited a court ruling related to how it should handle disclosures of some documents.The FCC pause would push the conclusion of the regulatory review to the middle of the year, a Comcast executive said in a March blog post. ""There is no basis for a lawsuit to block the transaction,"" a Comcast spokeswoman said in an emailed statement on Friday, adding that expected benefits to both consumers and businesses from the deal ""...have been essentially unchallenged in the record - and all can be achieved without any reduction of competition.""The deal has faced severe scrutiny from several media companies and executives since its initial announcement over a year ago.On Friday, a coalition of companies, associations and public interest groups sent a letter to FCC Chair Tom Wheeler opposing the merger.""The combined company would, among other things: control over half of the high-speed residential broadband connections in the United States; dominate pay-TV across the nation; combine even stronger distribution muscle with NBC-Universal's ""must-have"" video programming; and control critical advertising and set-topbox inputs,"" the letter stated.""... the Commission should reject this merger because it would result in too much power in the hands of one company.""

The merger briefing was also expected to address the pending $48 billion deal between AT&T Inc and DirecTV, according to one of the sources.The sources could be identified because the planned briefings have not been made public. Comcast's merger with Time Warner Cable would combine the nation's two largest cable companies, which do not directly compete against each other in any markets. Opponents, however,  have particularly focused on the combined company's broadband market reach, worried about its potential gatekeeping power.The FCC has to decide that the deal is in the public interest and the Justice Department has to rule that it does not harm competition for the merger to go through. Comcast has pushed back against criticisms, arguing the deal would bring faster Internet speeds and better video services to more consumers.The company's officials were expected to discuss the merger with the Department of Justice antitrust reviewers on Wednesday in the latest of its ongoing series of meetings there, according to a separate source familiar with the matter.Six senators on Wednesday called on regulators to reject the merger, following a Bloomberg report on Friday that antitrust lawyers at the Justice Department were nearing such a recommendation to senior officials there.

379,"  (Repeats story without changes to text)By Liana B. BakerApril 21 Hints that U.S. regulators could veto Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc have investment bankers worried about whether they will get paid, with smaller advisory firms particularly on edge.Boutique investment banks such as Allen & Company, Centerview Partners and Paul Taubman's PJT Partners have limited resources compared to their larger brethren, and they use them to win mandates on a few big deals. Yet it is megadeals such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable buyout, that carry the most regulatory risk.""Big banks have many deals going on, and they can afford to lose one more, even though it is painful. Smaller firms are less diversified, so for them it's much more painful,"" said Campbell Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.At least $140 million in investment banking advisory fees are at risk if the Department of Justice ends up blocking the deal. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that staff attorneys at the department's antitrust division were nearing a recommendation to veto the takeover because of concern about its impact on consumers.As much as $170 million in fees on two smaller transactions tied to the Time Warner buyout involving Comcast rival Charter Communications Inc may be in peril too, according to estimates by consulting firm Freeman & Co LLC. To be sure, bankers often negotiate a provision that allows them to be paid a fraction of the agreed fee if the deal falls through.

388,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar  Comcast Corp abandoned its $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable Inc on Friday after U.S. regulators raised concerns that the deal would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market.The collapse of the deal opens the door for other possible offers for Time Warner Cable, but also casts heightened regulatory risk on merger activity in the U.S. cable industry, which has been rapidly consolidating in the face of competition from satellite TV and Web-based services. The proposed acquisition had faced criticism from some politicians, media company executives and consumer and industry groups, who had worried it would create a monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV. Comcast had argued the merger would bring faster service and better video services to more Americans.""The pressure to consolidate in a very competitive industry is going to continue,"" Maxim Group analyst John Tinker said.Charter Communications Inc lost out on a bid for Time Warner Cable last year, and Charter's controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, had since indicated continuing interest.""We believe that TWC will get a bid from Charter in the next three months, which we expect to be lower than the market expects,"" Needham analysts said in a note. The analysts said they expected the opening bid at $130 to $135 per share. Time Warner Cable shares last traded at $152.52, up 2.5 percent on the day. Comcast shares were up 0.15 percent at $59.32 and Charter shares were down 0.8 percent at $182.18.ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONCERNS  The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would have created a company controlling almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay-TV subscribers, following promised divestitures, and would have provided high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday that the merger would have posed an ""unacceptable risk to competition and innovation.""U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the companies' decision to abandon the deal was ""the best outcome for American consumers."" Comcast had argued that the Time Warner Cable deal would not be anti-competitive because the companies had no real geographic overlap. The company had also proposed to divest some assets to help address regulatory concerns.The collapse of the deal is a setback for Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts.""Today, we move on,"" he said in a statement.

389,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Comcast Corp's failed bid to buy Time Warner Cable Inc is the latest muscle flex by U.S. antitrust enforcers and will likely deter chief executives from pursuing aggressive transactions as a way to spend excess cash.Comcast, which had barely convinced regulators to allow it to buy NBC Universal four years ago, folded under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice and scrapped its deal to buy its No. 2 rival on Friday.It comes two months after the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust jurisdiction with the Justice Department, sued to block Sysco Corp's proposed deal to buy its biggest rival US Foods. A court fight is ongoing.The one-two punch from regulators shows the U.S. government is reluctant to approve deals that will take out a main rival in industries with few competitors, and could prompt companies to eye deals outside their core areas or their home markets, dealmakers say.Spencer Kurn, analyst at New Street Research, said the government sent Comcast a clear message that they are too big right now, and the company is going to be hesitant to put deals in front of regulators where they could gain scale.""Before the (Time Warner Cable) deal came about, Comcast was looking internationally and said that they hadn’t found anything attractive to them. Given the restrictions in the U.S. they are likely to resume looking internationally again,"" he said. Perceptions of a bigger regulatory threat could also make buyers more risk averse and push them to lock in stronger  protections, such as securing consent from sellers that they do not have to pay penalties if regulators shoot down a deal. Comcast, for example, has emerged relatively unscathed from the deal collapse since it does not have to pay the so-called reverse break-up fee. Meanwhile, AT&T had to pay $6 billion in cash and assets to T-Mobile when regulators killed its planned purchase of the smaller rival in 2011. ""What's going to happen is that Wall Street will continue to go forward with some trepidation, trying to do some big deals,"" said Carl Hittinger, an antitrust expert at law firm Baker & Hostetler LLP. ""People are going to hesitate.""Indeed, the abortive bid for Time Warner Cable follows the public scuttling of AT&T's T-Mobile bid, as well as the quiet dismissal in 2014 of ambitions by SoftBank Corp, Sprint's owner, to buy rival T-Mobile. In that instance, SoftBank decided not to make a formal bid for T-Mobile after both FCC chairman Tom Wheeler and the Justice Department's antitrust chief expressed skepticism about a merger between any of the top four wireless phone companies.""One lesson for everyone: Don't get too greedy,"" said a top mergers and acquisitions lawyer who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships.

Comcast had argued the merger would bring faster service and better video services to more Americans. ""The pressure to consolidate in a very competitive industry is going to continue,"" Maxim Group analyst John Tinker said.Charter Communications Inc lost out on a bid for Time Warner Cable last year, and Charter's controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, had since indicated continuing interest.""We believe that TWC will get a bid from Charter in the next three months, which we expect to be lower than the market expects,"" Needham analysts said in a note.

Comcast shares were up 0.15 percent at $59.32 and Charter shares were down 0.8 percent at $182.18.ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONCERNS  The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would have created a company controlling almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay-TV subscribers, following promised divestitures, and would have provided high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday that the merger would have posed an ""unacceptable risk to competition and innovation.""U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the companies' decision to abandon the deal was ""the best outcome for American consumers.""Comcast had argued that the Time Warner Cable deal would not be anti-competitive because the companies had no real geographic overlap.

On Monday, Reuters reported the Time Warner Cable was open to discussions with Charter Communications Inc.The future of the No. 2 U.S. cable provider is much on the minds of analysts. Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Rob Marcus said in a conference call when asked about potential deals: ""We're not really going to respond to questions about any mergers and acquisitions.""The company said it added 30,000 residential video customers in the first quarter, its first increase since 2009. Analysts were expecting 11,800 subscribers.  The number of high-speed data subscribers also rose.""We feel great about the operating health of our business right now,"" Marcus said. Shares of Time Warner Cable were down 0.6 percent at $156.98 in morning trading.""Time Warner Cable is unmistakably investing for growth,  and that has to raise questions about whether they would be willing to sell to Charter after all,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said.Time Warner Cable said it expected 2015 operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding special items, to be flat this year. Analysts also wondered whether Time Warner Cable would follow Verizon Communications Inc's lead and start to offer smaller bundles to its customers, rather than traditional packages stuffed with hundreds of channels.Chief Operating Officer Dinesh Jain said there was still a lot of value in the triple-play package of video, broadband and landline services.""In terms of skinny packages, we don't want to be pioneers on that,"" he said.Net income attributable to the company fell to $458 million, or $1.59 per share, in the quarter from $479 million, or $1.70 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $1.87 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to almost 3.5 percent to $5.78 billion, below the analysts' average estimate of $5.83 billion.

""While we are participating in the government's review, we are not opposing the merger,"" the spokeswoman, Anne Marie Squeo, said in a statement. ""We've been highlighting concerns about AT&T's broadband practices and the need for appropriate remedies since last September.""According to regulatory disclosures posted on Tuesday, Netflix representatives met recently with more than 20 FCC officials and raised concerns about the combined company's gatekeeping power as it would become the country's largest pay-TV provider with potentially expansive broadband reach. Though the filing does not amount to a formal ""petition to deny"" the merger, it marks the strongest language yet from Netflix on the proposed merger of the No. 2 wireless carrier and the largest U.S. satellite-TV company. Previous FCC filings from Netflix on the deal called for approval with conditions. ""The combination of these companies would increase the incentive and ability to limit competition and innovation in the online video space,"" Squeo said.Netflix's April 30 meeting with the FCC's merger reviewers came just days after the agency's strong opposition helped thwart another mega-deal between the two largest U.S. cable providers, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc .The growing online video and over-the-top video markets became a critical issue in the review of that merger, fueled by heated opposition from Netflix, Dish Network Corp, some media companies and public interest groups.

411,"   By Liana B. Baker  Bright House Networks, the sixth largest U.S. cable operator, is preparing to abandon a $10.4 billion deal to be acquired by larger peer Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), according to people familiar with the matter.Charter, the No. 4 U.S. cable operator, clinched the deal with Bright House in March contingent on completion of Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N. Comcast walked away from the Time Warner Cable deal last month because of antitrust hurdles.Charter's agreement with Bright House includes a 30-day provision for them to renegotiate a deal in this event. That period lapses in about two weeks. Even though negotiations are still formally continuing, Bright House, which is controlled by the Newhouse family, owner of magazine publisher Conde Nast, now believes it best to remain independent, the people said this week.Time Warner Cable has an agreement to negotiate programing rates for Bright House, as well as share technology, in exchange for a fee. Bright House would rather not change this arrangement by partnering with Charter, which is a smaller operator than Time Warner Cable, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Bright House Networks, Charter and Time Warner Cable representatives declined to comment.Last week, Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge said on the company's earnings call he was negotiating with Bright House ""in good faith."" Time Warner Cable has the right of first refusal in the event Bright House pursues a sale.The U.S. cable TV industry has been rapidly consolidating in recent years to counter the growing popularity of satellite TV and Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). The Bright House deal would have made Charter, whose biggest shareholder is John Malone's Liberty Broadband Corp, the No. 2 U.S. cable TV provider. It would have helped Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence. Charter's key markets include Alabama, Georgia, Michigan and California.Charter is now in negotiations to acquire Time Warner Cable, people familiar with the matter have previously said. Time Warner Cable's deal with Comcast fell through after U.S. regulators raised concerns that it would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market.Charter last week reported a first-quarter net loss of $81 million, or 73 cents per share, up from $37 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.

The appointment, which takes effect in early summer, is a blow to Carlyle. The private equity firm had hired Cavanagh just last year from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), where he was seen a potential successor to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon.Cavanagh, 49, replaces Michael Angelakis, who Comcast said in March would head its investment arm scheduled to start operations in 2015 or early 2016 with up to $4.1 billion to invest in growth-oriented companies.Glenn Youngkin, Cavanagh's fellow co-president and co-chief operating officer at Carlyle, will assume sole responsibility of these roles. Carlyle has no immediate plans to replace Cavanagh, according to a person briefed on the matter and not authorized to discuss it publicly. Cavanagh is the second top executive to leave Carlyle in as many years. Last year, CFO Adena Friedman returned to NASDAQ OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O) after three years at Carlyle to become the market exchange operator's president. ""We see Cavanagh's departure highlighting the cultural risk at Carlyle,"" JPMorgan equity analysts wrote in a note. ""Our expectation was that Cavanagh would bring big-company management to Carlyle, which is growing into a big company."" Carlyle is run by its founders, David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello.Before joining Carlyle, Cavanagh was co-head of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank. He also had been the bank's CFO for six years. Cavanagh will receive a base salary of $1.8 million for 2015 plus a cash bonus of up to four times that amount, Comcast said in a regulatory filing. He is also entitled to an additional incentive package of up to $22.5 million, the filing said.Shares of Comcast were down 0.5 percent at $58.11 in afternoon trading, while Carlyle rose 0.3 percent to $30.31.

Last year, CFO Adena Friedman returned to NASDAQ OMX Group Inc after three years at Carlyle to become the market exchange operator's president. ""We see Cavanagh's departure highlighting the cultural risk at Carlyle,"" JPMorgan equity analysts wrote in a note. ""Our expectation was that Cavanagh would bring big-company management to Carlyle, which is growing into a big company.""Carlyle is run by its founders, David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello. Before joining Carlyle, Cavanagh was co-head of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank. He also had been the bank's CFO for six years.Cavanagh will receive a base salary of $1.8 million for 2015 plus a cash bonus of up to four times that amount, Comcast said in a regulatory filing. He is also entitled to an additional incentive package of up to $22.5 million, the filing said.Shares of Comcast were down 0.5 percent at $58.11 in afternoon trading, while Carlyle rose 0.3 percent to $30.31.

417,"   By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 26 Time Warner Cable, entering into talks to be acquired by  Charter Communications Inc just a month after regulators killed a proposed takeover by Comcast Corp's, was determined not to get burned a second time.It won such an insurance policy on Tuesday, when Charter included as part of its $56 billion takeover agreement a pledge to pay Time Warner Cable a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal goes south. Comcast, by contrast, had made no such pledge and was able to walk away scot-free when its bid collapsed.Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus said in an interview that the company had more leverage to negotiate various terms of the deal with Charter because it was a competitive process. Reuters reported that French telecom company Altice had been in talks about buying the company as well.Time Warner Cable's insistence on a breakup fee reflects lingering worries that the Federal Communications Commission, which rejected the Comcast deal over concerns about its broadband market reach and the future of online video, could do something similar in this case.Charter, meanwhile, was willing to pledge $2 billion because it is confident the deal will go through and it ultimately won't have to pay the fee, according to people close to the company who declined to speak on the record.Underscoring the high stakes involved, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler issued an unusually quick statement when the new deal was announced on Tuesday, reiterating that the agency will review the deal to determine whether it is in the public interest.""In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient,"" Wheeler said. ""The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved."" 'A HARD LOOK' While one FCC official noted that ""absolutely nothing about this transaction has been pre-judged"" and other experts warned against reading any implicit indications of opinion in the comment, some insiders saw Wheeler's statement as a reason for concern.""That's a shot across the bow,"" said one antitrust expert and former FCC official, who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships. ""If I were the parties, I wouldn't like that statement.""Although the FCC and the Department of Justice will both review the merger proposal, the former will present a higher hurdle for Charter because of its broad public interest standard. The Justice Department reviews deals' antitrust impact and has to prove actual harm to consumers to stop a merger.One issue of concern for regulators is whether the combination of Charter and Time Warner Cable will result in higher prices for cable and broadband, said Gene Kimmelman, a veteran of the Justice Department who is now president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. ""It will get a hard look and it will depend on whether they will work out conditions,"" he said, adding that conditions usually can be worked out in such deals.Other industry analysts said Charter's deal would be viewed as less risky than that of Comcast because of its relatively smaller scale and lack of major content assets like Comcast's NBC Universal.""This is a qualitatively different deal,"" said Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and founder of Business in the Public Interest think tank.Charter kicked off a charm offensive in the deal's favor on Tuesday, pledging to invest more in faster broadband, public WiFi networks and high-speed Internet connections for small and medium-sized businesses. It also promised more affordable telephone service and better video products, including high definition channels. 'DISMAL' CUSTOMER SERVICE Still, Charter will face tough questions on the U.S. broadband Internet market, of which the combined companies would control more than one-fifth, according to data from research firm MoffettNathanson.Wheeler said the FCC's review of a possible Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination led regulators to begin to consider cable companies less as traditional pay-TV providers and more as Internet service providers. The regulators are likely to seek reassurances that the new company would not harm the growing online content competition, for instance by charging high fees for access to its network, experts say. Charter currently does not charge such fees.""One of the biggest questions about Charter and Time Warner Cable is whether the deal is in the public interest. Frankly, we're skeptical,"" said Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.""Prices for cable and broadband continue to go up, and customer service is dismal.""And, as with any cable or Internet deal, regulators will look to see if Charter and Time Warner systems overlap, and require asset sales in areas where they do before approving any deal. Both Time Warner Cable and Charter are strongest along the eastern United States with a smattering of customers in Texas and California, although they directly compete in few, if any of those markets.(Reporting by Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh; Editing by Christian Plumb)",2015-05-26,CMCSA,"Tue May 26, 2015 | 7:52pm EDT",Charter's Time Warner Cable bid faces $2 billion regulatory question,http://www.reuters.com//article/twc-ma-charter-communi-regulator-idUSL1N0YH1GB20150526?type=companyNews

442,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, posted in-line second-quarter results, as its high-speed Internet and NBC Universal businesses grew amid a drop in pay-TV subscriber departures.Comcast, also the No.1 U.S. high-speed Internet provider, said on Thursday total revenue rose 11.3 percent to $18.74 billion in the second quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $18.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to Comcast rose 7.3 percent to $2.14 billion, or 84 cents per share, from a year earlier.Profit was up 10 percent from a year ago to 84 cents per share after excluding items such as investments and acquisition-related items, matching Wall Street estimates. The company, which lost 8,000 video customers last quarter, reigned in subscriber losses in the second quarter compared to a year ago. It said 69,000 subscribers departed from April through June, but it was less than the 144,000 users who left a year earlier. Wall Street keeps a close watch on the number of new video subscribers as pay TV operators fight to keep customers amidst intense competition from streaming video services such as Dish Corp's Sling TV.Earlier this month, Comcast said it is beta testing a new cable streaming service called Stream, which will broadcast live TV from HBO and about a dozen other networks for $15 per month. The new service lets Comcast's Xfinity Internet customers stream live TV over phones, tablets and laptops.Comcast's high-speed Internet customer additions dropped 12 percent to 180,000, but revenue from the business rose about 10 percent to $3.1 billion. Business services revenue increased 20.4 percent to $1.16 billion.At NBC Universal, revenue rose 20.2 percent to $7.23 billion from a year earlier. Revenue at the film studio rose 93 percent from a year earlier to $2.3 billion, bolstered by its summer blockbusters ""Furious 7"" and ""Jurassic World."" The Universal theme park business, with its popular ""Harry Potter"" attraction in Florida, saw revenue rise 26 percent to $773 million.Advertising revenue at cable networks fell 3 percent in the quarter to $917 million amid a decline in ratings that has hit networks across the TV industry.

444,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK, July 23  NEW YORK, July 23 Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, posted in-line second-quarter results, as its high-speed Internet and NBC Universal businesses grew amid a drop in pay-TV subscriber departures.Comcast, also the No.1 U.S. high-speed Internet provider, said on Thursday total revenue rose 11.3 percent to $18.74 billion in the second quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $18.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to Comcast rose 7.3 percent to $2.14 billion, or 84 cents per share, from a year earlier.Profit was up 10 percent from a year ago to 84 cents per share after excluding items such as investments and acquisition-related items, matching Wall Street estimates.The company, which lost 8,000 video customers last quarter, reigned in subscriber losses in the second quarter compared to a year ago. It said 69,000 subscribers departed from April through June, but it was less than the 144,000 users who left a year earlier. Wall Street keeps a close watch on the number of new video subscribers as pay TV operators fight to keep customers amidst intense competition from streaming video services such as Dish Corp's Sling TV.Earlier this month, Comcast said it is beta testing a new cable streaming service called Stream, which will broadcast live TV from HBO and about a dozen other networks for $15 per month. The new service lets Comcast's Xfinity Internet customers stream live TV over phones, tablets and laptops. Comcast's high-speed Internet customer additions dropped 12 percent to 180,000, but revenue from the business rose about 10 percent to $3.1 billion.Business services revenue increased 20.4 percent to $1.16 billion.At NBC Universal, revenue rose 20.2 percent to $7.23 billion from a year earlier. Revenue at the film studio rose 93 percent from a year earlier to $2.3 billion, bolstered by its summer blockbusters ""Furious 7"" and ""Jurassic World.""The Universal theme park business, with its popular ""Harry Potter"" attraction in Florida, saw revenue rise 26 percent to $773 million.Advertising revenue at cable networks fell 3 percent in the quarter to $917 million amid a decline in ratings that has hit networks across the TV industry. The NBC broadcast network's ad revenue rose a modest 0.3 percent to $1.25 billion.Shares of Comcast, which abandoned its proposed $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc in late April, closed at $64.50 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq.

They bake cookies, go for long walks and volunteer at a local psychiatric hospital. But after the sun goes down, things get weird in M. Night Shyamalan's latest horror movie, ""The Visit.""The film, out in theaters on Friday, follows teen siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) as they are sent by their single mother to meet her estranged parents for the first time and stay with them for a week.Shyamalan, 45, known for supernatural movies such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs,"" channels his own teen filmmaker self into the precocious Becca, an aspiring documentarian who films everything during their visit, including the bizarre behavior of her grandparents as night falls.The film was written, directed and produced by Shyamalan on a micro-budget of under $5 million. He partnered with horror producer Jason Blum and Comcast Corp's Universal Pictures for distribution. ""I love constraints, both financially and creatively,"" Shyamalan told Reuters. ""Passive entertainment, where you do everything for the audience, is not what interests me. I want you to fill in gaps ... the budget helps you think like that.""The film has earned mixed reviews and is projected by BoxOffice.com to open with $17 million this weekend. ""The Visit"" follows Shyamalan's first foray into television as the executive producer of Fox's 10-part summer sci-fi mystery thriller ""Wayward Pines.""The hit TV show, set in a town shrouded from the outside world, ""directly affected 'The Visit' and how I shot it,"" Shyamalan said, referring to the faster pace and smaller budgets of working in television. ""It really taught me what's important and how to get the things out of the actors fast and really concentrate,"" Shyamalan said. ""What it did for me is tell me how lazy I had become as a filmmaker.""""The Visit"" marks the Philadelphia filmmaker's return to the big screen after films that failed to spark up critics or box office, such as 2008's supernatural ""The Happening"" and 2013's  sci-fi movie ""After Earth.""Shyamalan dismissed those lackluster performances and said he was focusing on bringing a refreshed self to movies and TV.""The whole point is to make different movies, make genre-bending movies,"" he said. ""It's all about 'Wayward Pines' and 'The Visit' right now, that's where my tonality is right now, dark humor and mysterious.""

Goldman Sachs, MBK and other current owners will retain an interest in the Japanese theme park operator.

Roberts said that while a deal had only been finalised in the last few weeks, it had been on the company's radar since its 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal. USJ had planned a Tokyo listing this year, but it was shelved due to concerns that three IPOs for Japan Post group companies in November worth a combined $11.5 billion would saturate the market, two sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.

468,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) assigned to Comcast Corporation (Comcast) and its wholly owned  subsidiaries included in Comcast's cross-guaranty structure. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'A-' IDR assigned to NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. (NBCUniversal  Enterprise) and to NBCUniversal Media, LLC. (NBCUniversal) The Rating Outlook on  all of these ratings is Stable. Approximately $49.3 billion of Comcast's consolidated debt, including $9.2  billion outstanding at NBCUniversal and $4 billion outstanding at NBCUniversal  Enterprise as of June 30, 2015, is affected by Fitch's action. KEY RATING DRIVERS Consistent Capital Structure Policy: Comcast's capital structure and financial  strategy remains balanced between investing in its businesses, reducing leverage  to its target range of between 1.5x-2x, and returning excess capital to  shareholders.  Significant Financial Flexibility: Fitch believes Comcast's strong operating  profile and solid free cash flow (FCF) metrics afford the company a high degree  of financial flexibility at the current rating category. Comcast generated  approximately $7.8 billion of FCF during the LTM period ended June 30, 2015.  Going forward Fitch anticipates the company will consistently generate  consolidated FCF in excess of $7 billion. Consistent Capital Allocation Strategy: Comcast's capital allocation policy is  expected to remain relatively consistent and focused on returning capital to its  shareholders while continuing to invest in the strategic needs of its business.  Fitch expects that share repurchases will total approximately $6.75 billion  during 2015, in line with management guidance. Leading Market Positions: Fitch's ratings incorporate Comcast's strong  competitive position as one of the largest video, high-speed data and phone  providers to residential and business customers in the U.S. and the company's  compelling subscriber clustering profile with operations in 39 states and the  District of Columbia. In Fitch's view, NBCUniversal's size, scale, leading brand  positions and diversity of operations and business risk, and position as one of  the world's most prominent media and entertainment companies, lowers the  business risk attributable to Comcast's credit profile. The company also creates  new avenues for revenue and cash flow growth while limiting the impact on  Comcast's balance sheet and credit profile. Strength of Cable Networks: NBCUniversal's portfolio of leading cable networks  as well as the growing importance of its theme parks business are key  considerations supporting our ratings and are a strength of the company's credit  profile. Fitch considers cable networks one of the strongest subsectors in the  media and entertainment industry, which provides NBCUniversal with a revenue  base largely consisting of stable, recurring and high-margin affiliate fee  revenue generated from multichannel video programming distributors as well as  being a significant source of NBCUniversal's FCF generation. International Parks Investment:  The affirmation incorporates the company's  decision to purchase a 51% ownership stake in Universal Studios Japan (USJ) for  approximately $1.5 billion.  USJ's current ownership, consisting of Goldman  Sachs, MBK Partners, Owl Creek Asset Management and current management, retain a  49% stake in the company.  The investment marks a shift in Comcast's  asset-light, licensing fee model for its international parks businesses.   Furthermore, the investment presents an opportunity to geographically diversify  its operating profile and leverage the growth and return on investment Universal  Studios has captured in domestic markets.  Evolving Competitive Environment: Fitch believes that over-the-top (OTT) can  become a persistent, long-term drag on the pay-television sector.  The internet  is becoming another platform to distribute video content. Fitch expects that OTT  will have a broad impact on the sector affecting the size of pay-television and  cable network subscriber bases, advertising and affiliate fee revenues, and  programming costs.  However, in Fitch's view, OTT and its impact on  pay-television subscriber base will not materially affect Comcast's operating or  credit profile over the current ratings horizon.  Comcast has sufficient  flexibility within the current ratings to withstand modest subscriber losses due  to cord cutting.  That said, however the largest offset to the threat of OTT to  Comcast's cable business is that regardless of how a subscriber consumes video  content - through the internet or with a traditional video service - the  subscriber will still need to pay for network access (video or high-speed data  service).     LEVERAGE AND FINANCIAL POLICY Comcast's leverage metric through the LTM period ended June 30, 2015 was 2x, a  modest improvement from 2.1x as of year-end 2014. Fitch believes Comcast's  credit profile will be relatively consistent during 2015 and that leverage will  approximate 2x as of year-end 2015 and remain within the higher end of the  company's leverage target during the current ratings horizon.  Total debt  outstanding as of June 30, 2015 was approximately $49.3 billion, relatively  unchanged compared with year-end 2014 and a modest 1.4% increase relative to  year-end 2013.  Fitch's expectation that shareholder returns as a percentage of pre-dividend  cash flow will increase during the ratings horizon is incorporated into the  ratings.  Comcast returned approximately $4.8 billion of capital to its  shareholders through the year-to-date period ended June 30, 2015 in the form of  dividends and share repurchases reflecting an 84.5% increase compared to the  same period last year.  Shareholder returns during 2015 represented  approximately 93.1% of cash flow before dividends.  Approximately $6.4 billion  of share repurchase capacity remains under the current authorization as of June  30, 2015. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Reflecting the overall maturity of Comcast's services, Fitch's base case  assumes overall primary service unit (PSU) additions continue to slow,  reflecting increasing penetration of the company's service offering portfolio.   Importantly, Fitch believes that video service subscriber losses will continue  to moderate over the forecast period.  High-speed data subscriber growth remains  in mid-single digits while telephony subscriber growth is in low single digits.   --Comcast's cable business will continue to report low- to mid-single-digit  revenue growth during the forecast period as service ARPUs continue to grow in  light of the favorable revenue mix shift of subscribers taking more advanced  video services and higher speed (higher-priced) high-speed data service tiers as  well as increased overall service penetration.   --Cable segment margins decline modestly during the forecast period reflecting  ongoing programming cost increases.  The increased costs are offset somewhat by  Comcast's ability to shift its revenue mix to higher margin services such as  high-speed data services and commercial services, as well as improving  operational efficiencies.   --Cable segment capital intensity remains relatively consistent over the near  term before moderating somewhat as the deployment of the X1 platform and related  cloud DVR and wireless gateway spending winds down.   --Soft advertising market continues throughout the rating horizon forecast with  base advertising revenues flat to down 1% excluding political and Olympic  related spending.   --Mid-single-digit affiliate fee revenue growth within NBCU's cable network  segment  --NBCU's broadcast segment benefits from strong retransmission and reverse  compensation revenue growth.   --Theme park revenue growth is assumed at mid-single digits following the launch  of the Harry Potter attraction during 2014 and 2015. --Fitch's base case assumes no change in Comcast's financial policy or capital  allocation strategy.  In line with company guidance, we expect Comcast will  repurchase $6.75 billion of its common stock during 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would likely coincide with Comcast committing to and  achieving a financial policy consistent with an 'A' rating, including  maintaining its leverage below 1.5x on a sustained basis. Comcast would need to  demonstrate that its operating profile will not materially decline in the face  of competition.  Negative rating actions would likely coincide with discretionary actions of  Comcast's management including, but not limited to, adopting a more aggressive  financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition activity that drive  leverage beyond 2.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan. LIQUIDITY Comcast's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility are strong based  on Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to generate material  amounts of FCF. Comcast generated approximately $7.8 billion of FCF during the  LTM ended June 30, 2015. Going forward, Fitch anticipates that the company will  consistently generate consolidated FCF in excess of $7 billion. Fitch acknowledges that Comcast's share repurchase program represents a  significant use of cash. However, Fitch believes the company would reduce the  level of share repurchases should the operating environment materially change,  in order to maximize financial flexibility.  The liquidity position is further supported by cash on hand (which totaled  approximately $3.5 billion on a consolidated basis as of June 30, 2015) and $7.4  billion of collective available borrowing capacity (as of June 30, 2015) from  Comcast's two revolving credit facilities. Commitments under Comcast's $6.25  billion revolver will expire during June 2017, while the commitments related to  NBCUniversal Enterprise's $1.35 billion revolver expire during March 2018. The  credit facilities provide a liquidity back-stop to the company's two commercial  paper (CP) programs.  Comcast maintains a $6.25 billion CP program (no  outstanding amount as of June 30, 2015) while NBCUniversal Enterprise has  established a $1.35 billion CP program under which approximately $705 million  was outstanding as of June 30, 2015. Comcast's debt maturity profile is well-laddered and within Fitch's FCF  expectation. The company does not have any scheduled maturities during the  remainder of 2015 excluding outstanding CP, followed by $2.5 billion, $2.6  billion and $4.1 billion during 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

473,"  (Adds detail on Dish's ad inventory and household reach)By Malathi NayakNEW YORK Oct 26 Dish Network Corp will begin experimenting with automated ad sales, moving away from the pay-TV industry's years-old way of selling ads through phone calls, paperwork and in-person deal-making.Dish will open up a digital ad market to let advertisers buy linear television ads as a beta test before officially launching at a later date, the company said in a statement on Monday.""We're bringing the ease of digital ad buying to the TV marketplace,"" Adam Gaynor, vice president of media sales and analytics at Dish, said in an interview.Dish will work with ad-buying firms Rocket Fuel, TubeMogul and DataXu, the company said. Automated or programmatic ad technology allows each ad impression to be offered up by sellers on a digital ad exchange and buyers make real-time bids based on data about individuals they aim to target.Television still represents the largest slice of advertising revenue but digital advertising is growing quickly. Advertisers are expected to spend $70.6 billion this year on TV and $58.6 billion on digital media including mobile, according to research firm eMarketer.As more eyeballs shift to online video on digital services and advertisers get used to the flexibility of buying, selling and placing digital ads on the fly, the pay-TV industry is under pressure to follow suit. ""Our goal is to go get online (advertising) budgets,"" Gaynor said.Pay-TV providers collect customer data through set-top boxes. Dish's automated ad market can reach 8 million households with set-top boxes that record data useful for targeted advertising. Dish will use 80 specifications like age, gender, and education and plans to bring in more data sets, Gaynor said.Dish's set-top boxes record whether the ad ran on the TV set or was skipped which is feedback for advertisers, Gaynor said.Digital ads can be placed instantly. Television ads can be bought in real-time but it takes a couple of days to be slotted into programming, he added.Late last year, Walt Disney Co's ESPN experimented with programmatic ad auctions for its SportsCenter show. Disney's ABC and Comcast Corp's NBC have tested programmatic ad-buying on their online video offerings.Pay-TV providers have access to two minutes per hour of ad time in local programming. While ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox and their affiliates sell ad slots independently, commercials from Dish's ad inventory can run on channels such as the Food Network, Gaynor said.

478,"   By Lisa Richwine  During the next U.S. Republican presidential debate on Tuesday, Fox Business Network aims to keep the candidates talking about economic issues and avoid the criticism leveled at rival CNBC that it failed to keep the focus on substance.The stakes are high for Fox Business, a younger and smaller cable channel to CNBC that has a chance to attract new viewers from the millions likely to tune in for its first debate in the November 2016 presidential election. ""For Fox Business, this is an important rite of passage,"" Neil Cavuto, the network's managing editor of business news, said in an interview this week. ""I don't want to screw it up.""    Cavuto and Fox's Maria Bartiromo will moderate the prime-time debate with eight top-polling candidates alongside Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Gerard Baker. Fox Business is owned by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, and the Wall Street Journal is a unit of Murdoch's News Corp.Moderators for CNBC, the top-rated business network owned by Comcast Corp, came under criticism from candidates who felt questions were unfair, serving up opportunities to criticize each other rather than discuss issues. A CNBC spokesman said presidential hopefuls ""should be able to answer substantive, challenging questions.""For the next debate, Cavuto said he aims to keep candidates talking about economic issues such as Social Security, taxes and government spending. While some critics say the network leans conservative, Cavuto said there is no political agenda.""We are a business network,"" he said. ""We really don't focus on the red or the blue. We are just green. Money in and money out.""  Cavuto and Bartiromo declined to critique their rivals' performance. But their network ran a commercial saying CNBC ""never asked the real questions"" and promised it would offer a ""real debate about our economy and our future.""The contenders will have more time for responses at the two-hour debate in Milwaukee - 90 seconds to answer questions and 60 seconds to respond if their name comes up, longer than the traditional 60-second answers and 30-second responses. ""You want to let it breathe and make sure no one is rushed but at the same time no one is showboating,"" Cavuto said.  Both moderators said they are doing their homework to be prepared for challenges from the contenders. Bartiromo, global markets editor for Fox Business, said she believes jobs, wages and tax reform are among voters' top concerns in the November 2016 election. ""It's amazing to me that we haven't had much focus on the economy and jobs yet and here we are four debates later.""Fox Business Network was founded in 2007, following CNBC's 1989 debut. Fox Business reached 82 million homes on average this year compared with CNBC's 92.7 million, according to SNL Kagan data. Earlier debates attracted record audiences, topped by the 24 million who tuned in to Fox News Channel's debate in August. Viewership in the millions would far surpass the typical audience for Fox Business, which averaged 102,000 viewers on weekdays in October, according to Nielsen data. The debates will stream for free on foxbusiness.com. Several pay television distributors will let their customers watch the debate on TV even if they do not subscribe to a package that includes Fox Business Network.""The reason we do these (debates) is to help viewers get informed on the candidates' positions and help the voter best distinguish the differences,"" Bartiromo said. ""That's missing a bit right now.""For more on the 2016 U.S. presidential race and to learn about the undecided voters who determine elections, visit the Reuters website.

479,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Nov 10 Ride service Uber is attempting a new legal maneuver to learn more about an Internet address that it thinks could help identify the individual who improperly accessed an Uber database last year, according to court filings on Tuesday.A San Francisco judge authorized a subpoena against Comcast Corp earlier this year, in which Uber  sought information about the online history of one Comcast Internet address that Uber believes could yield clues about the hacker. In February, Uber revealed that as many as 50,000 of its drivers' names and license numbers had been improperly downloaded, and the company filed a lawsuit in San Francisco federal court in an attempt to unmask the perpetrator.The subpoena ruling is currently on hold, pending an appeal by the Comcast subscriber. However, Uber also faces a separate lawsuit filed by one of its drivers. In that lawsuit, Uber on Tuesday asked for a new subpoena against Comcast for much of the same information about the Internet address. Last month Reuters reported that the Comcast Internet address could be traced to the chief technology officer at Lyft, a rival U.S. ride service. A Lyft spokesman said it had found no evidence the executive or any other Lyft employee was involved in the Uber data breach. Representatives for Uber, Lyft and the Comcast subscriber could not immediately be reached for comment on the Tuesday court documents.(Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Ken Wills)",2015-11-11,CMCSA,"Tue Nov 10, 2015 | 11:17pm EST",Uber tries new legal tactic to identify hacker behind data breach,http://www.reuters.com//article/uber-tech-breach-lawsuit-idUSL1N1360AA20151111?type=companyNews
480,"   By Alexandra Ulmer and Andrew Cawthorne | CARACAS  CARACAS Nov 13 It reads like a typical Latin American soap opera: two relatives of Venezuela's president were caught in their Haitian hotel and whisked to the United States to face cocaine charges.As the pair sit in a New York jail awaiting their fate in a case that has made global headlines, a real narco-telenovela drama is also causing controversy back home.Four days before his wife's nephews were arrested, President Nicolas Maduro's government banned U.S.-based Latino network Telemundo's soap ""Queen of the South"" for ""glorifying"" the drug trade and harming family values.But with Maduro's own family now dragged into a drug controversy, critics are having a field day poking fun at what they deem the socialist government's hypocritical moralizing.First Lady Cilia Flores has been dubbed the 'Queen of the South' in a flood of internet memes that joke about the banned show morphing into a 'reality' show featuring the Miraflores presidential palace.In one, the 62 year-old lawyer's face has been superimposed on a promotional photo showing glamorous Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who plays the 'Queen of the South', sitting in a short black dress with her legs crossed.In another, a video has been tinkered with to make it seem like Flores and Maduro are merrily dancing merengue to the lyrics of the soap's theme song, which go ""Queen of the South/ A very famous trafficker/ Born out there in Sinaloa."" In the Spanish-language drama, a Mexican woman from the drug-rife state of Sinaloa rises to become a top cartel boss in Spain. The plot line is infused with passionate love stories, bitter betrays, and undercover agents.""If Cilia Flores' nephews had watched the 'Queen of the South' they would have learned about undercover agents, but no, the telecoms regulator didn't let them,"" quipped Venezuelan political commentator Marysabel Cadenas on Twitter.To be sure, there is no indication Flores herself is involved in trafficking. The government has not commented on the arrests.Venezuelan telecoms regulator Conatel did not answer calls seeking comment on its decision to ban the show, which has been a hit in big TV markets like the United States, Mexico and Spain. Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, which owns Telemundo, did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on the show's suspension. GLAMORIZING GANGSTERS In an oil-rich country with an alleged bustling drug trade and one of the world's highest murder rates, most crime experts argue that profound policy change, rather than censorship of entertainment, is the top priority to turn the tide of violence. Both Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez have taken aim at hugely-popular 'telenovelas' - once a successful Venezuela export industry - for romanticizing guns and gangsters.But amid U.S. investigations into alleged drugs and money-laundering crimes linked to Venezuelan officials, the Socialist Party is sometimes finding itself alluded to on screen.National Assembly boss Diosdado Cabello, reported by U.S. media to be under investigation there for links to drug trafficking, accused the ""The Lord of the Skies,"" another Telemundo soap, of modeling a narco boss after him.""You know what one of their corrupt drug-trafficking generals is called?"" the former soldier said in May during his weekly show. ""Diosdado Carreno Arias!... Oh sweet Lord!""Cabello refutes allegations he is involved with drugs, saying the Venezuelan opposition and U.S. government are spreading lies, including via entertainment, to subvert and discredit the ruling Socialists.""Do you think any similarity with this scandalous fabrication is pure coincidence?"" he said.""I don't think so!""

483,"   By Liana B. Baker  Nov 18 Former Comcast Corp chief financial officer Michael Angelakis hired two executives for his new investment company, according to people familiar with the matter.The executives, former Sunoco LP Chief Financial Officer Clare McGrory and Davis Polk & Wardwell Partner David Caplan, are the first hires by Angelakis' firm to come from outside of Comcast, which is the main financial backer of the company.Representatives from Davis Polk and Sunoco confirmed the departures. Comcast declined to comment.The firm will invest in and operate growth-oriented companies in the United States and globally. It plans to do deals in various sectors, and not just in technology, media and telecommunications. McGrory will join the firm, which has not yet been named, as a partner and CFO, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the hires had not yet been announced. McGrory left the master limited partnership Sunoco on Oct. 30. Before she was CFO and treasurer, she has held other positions over the past 13 years at Sunoco in finance and investor relations.Caplan, an attorney who focuses on mergers and acquisitions at Davis Polk, will become a partner and general counsel in the new company after he leaves the law firm at the end of the year. Caplan has worked on several of Comcast's major deals including its acquisition of NBCUniversal and its sale of spectrum to Verizon Wireless. He recently led the M&A group and worked with clients such as Aetna Inc, L Brands, PwC and Sterling Equity.Angelakis announced earlier this year that he was stepping down as Comcast's CFO to become the chief executive of the new company. It has secured $4 billion in capital commitments from Comcast, along with up to $100 million from senior members of the management team, including $40 million from Angelakis personally. Comcast has an exclusive agreement to be the sole outside investor in the firm for 10 years.Besides Angelakis, Comcast's former corporate development and strategy chief Alexander Evans has also moved to the new firm as a partner. Both Angelakis and Evans previously worked at private equity firm Providence Equity.Comcast announced earlier this month that longtime Morgan Stanley investment banker Robert Eatroff was joining the cable and media company to head global corporate development and strategy.(Reporting by Liana B.

488,"  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it has filed a complaint aimed at stopping Staples Inc (SPLS.O), the nation's largest office supply store, from buying its top rival, Office Depot Inc (ODP.O).Canada's Competition Bureau also said on Monday it would challenge the proposed transaction, which has received the green light from competition authorities in China, Australia and New Zealand.Office Depot's shares fell as much as 17.6 percent to a year low of $5.46, while Staples' stock dropped 13.6 percent to a year low of $10.68.""The commission has reason to believe that the proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot is likely to eliminate beneficial competition that large companies rely on to reduce the costs of office supplies,"" FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement. (1.usa.gov/1NeaaD9)The FTC said Staples and Office Depot were often the top two bidders for large business customers and the deal would hurt customers who wanted nationwide contracts for office supplies.The companies said in a statement on Monday that they would fight the FTC in court, arguing that they face stiff competition from manufacturers who sell their own products, e-commerce companies, big box stores and others. The deal is also being investigated by EU regulators, who in September raised concerns about possible price hikes.The FTC stopped a merger attempt between the same two companies in 1997 on similar concerns.But in the past 19 years, Amazon (AMZN.O) and other online sellers, which deliver to almost anywhere in the United States, have exploded onto the scene, while megastores such as Costco (COST.O) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) have further crowded the market. Staples was emboldened to make a $6.3 billion offer for Office Depot in February after that chain succeeded in buying No. 3 OfficeMax in November 2013 with no divestitures.This time around, Staples has offered divestitures totaling ""more than $500 million in commercial business"" in order to allay the FTC's concerns.This has been a year of aggressive deals killed by equally aggressive U.S. antitrust authorities. Other deals contested by regulators include General Electric Co's (GE.N) $3.3 billion agreement to sell its appliances business to Sweden's Electrolux, Comcast's (CMCSA.O) bid to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N, and Sysco's (SYY.N) plan to buy US Foods.Other mergers under review include two insurance deals: Aetna's (AET.N) deal for Humana (HUM.N) and Anthem's (ANTM.N) planned merger with Cigna (CI.N).Halliburton's (HAL.N) offer to buy its rival oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHI.N) is also under review.

In the case of the unnamed credit monitoring firm, the indictment said Livingston paid Chmielarz to write a program to steal a database containing 10 million records.When law enforcement seized Livingston's computer in July, they discovered a database with 7 million of that company's records, the indictment said.

496,"  Jan 5 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said it is delaying its informal deadline by 15 days to review the proposed $56 billion merger of cable rivals Charter Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc.This delay in the 180-day countdown will give the regulators sufficient time to review the new information filed by the companies, throughout December, regarding Charter's residential pricing and packaging methodology and its plan to deploy a new low-cost broadband service, the commission said in a letter to companies. (bit.ly/1VDUNtd)The 15-day pause, which is now set to conclude on Jan. 20, will also allow the regulator to look at proposed transaction's impact on the distribution of Time Warner Cable's regional sports networks, the commission added in the letter, posted on its website, on Monday.FCC's so-called 180-day ""shot clock"", which was started in September, is used as guidance, though it is often surpassed. Charter said in May that it would buy Time Warner Cable in a cash-and-stock deal that would make it the No. 2 U.S. Internet and cable company after Comcast Corp.The deal has been approved by shareholders of both companies and most U.S. states, but is awaiting clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The National Association of Broadcasters and Dish Network Corp have separately petitioned the FCC to reject the proposed merger, which Dish said would be no better for public interest than Comcast Corp's proposed deal. AT&T Inc also wrote a letter to the FCC, in October, asking for a careful review on the impact of cable deals on emerging online video products. However, it said, it does not oppose the proposed Charter-Time Warner merger.Charter said in late October that it expects the merger to close in the first quarter of 2016.Charter Communications and Time Warner could not be reached immediately for comment outside regular business hours.

It earmarked $5 billion in stock buybacks for 2016 as part of a $10 billion program.Total revenue at Philadelphia-based Comcast rose 8.5 percent to $19.25 billion in the fourth quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations of $18.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to the company rose 2.4 percent to $2 billion, or 79 cents per share, from a year earlier. Excluding items such as gains on sales and acquisition-related items, profit rose 5.2 percent to 81 cents per share, a penny below estimates. The company added 89,000 video subscribers, much better than a year earlier, when it picked up about 6,000 new subscribers.Cable operators are battling streaming video services like Netflix Inc and Hulu for subscribers, as viewers gravitate toward online video offerings. Comcast has been seeking to improve customer service and giving its set-top boxes facelifts in a bid to retain  subscribers. It is beta-testing an ad-supported short-form video service called ""Watchable"" targeting millenials and launched a comedy-centric $3.99-a-month streaming service, called ""Seeso,"" to test viewers' appetite for online products.Its business services unit posted $1.3 billion in revenue, up 19 percent from a year ago. Revenue from Comcast's high-speed Internet business grew about 10 percent to $3.2 billion, and Internet customer additions rose 23 percent to 460,000. At NBCUniversal, revenue jumped 13 percent to $7.5 billion. Despite a quiet movie lineup in the quarter, revenue at the film studio climbed 26 percent to $1.63 billion, helped by DVD releases of blockbuster hits such as ""Minions"" and ""Jurassic World.""Revenue at Universal theme parks, including Universal Studios Japan, soar 39 percent to $1.02 billion, propelled by the huge popularity of Harry Potter attractions. Comcast bought a majority stake in Universal Studios Japan for $1.5 billion in September.Shares of Comcast closed at $54.59 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq.

500,"  SHANGHAI Chinese film company Perfect World Pictures Co Ltd (002624.SZ) will invest $250 million into a slate of Universal Pictures movies, extending the tie-ups between China and Hollywood, as the world's second largest economy sees its box office soar.The Chinese firm will help fund at least 50 Universal Pictures films over a five-year period through its Perfect Universe Investment Inc investment unit, the company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.Universal Pictures, owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), is the studio behind blockbusters such as ""Jurassic World"" and ""Fast and Furious"", the latest installment which is one of China's biggest-ever grossing films.Perfect World said the investment gives them a ""direct link"" into one of the biggest Hollywood studios, and would help them expand.  The Chinese firm added it would receive a proportion of global ticket sales, television and merchandising revenues for the films it funded.China's box office takings are catching up fast with the United States; ticket sales are set to touch $8.9 billion in 2019 from about $5 billion last year, according to PwC.  However, global studios often have a tough time navigating censors and getting around a strict quota system for imported films.Hollywood has been pushing hard in China: Warner Brothers announced a joint venture with China Media Capital in September, while Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc DWA.O, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (LGF.N) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) have all joined with local partners. In November, Chinese film distributor Bona Film Group Ltd BONA.O said it would invest $235 million into a slate of Twentieth Century Fox movies and help bring Hollywood productions to the Chinese market.

501,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc, which launched its pay TV plan ""Fios Custom TV"" last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels they want to watch, has redesigned the offering.The revamped Custom TV now offers a choice of one of two packages with over 100 channels and three optional genre-specific packs, instead of a slim offering of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons.  The move was not in response to objections from content partners but based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said.  The first package, named ""Essentials,"" has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks - Disney's ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC with no sports offerings. The second package, ""Sports & more,"" has more than 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels such as the Cartoon Network.In April last year, Verizon repackaged the traditional pay-TV bundle and created a stir with some programmers by moving some traditional pay TV base-tier channels into optional genre-specific add-on packs. The channels it moved included ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp division NBC Universal's USA. ESPN has sued Verizon, alleging a breach of contract, while Twenty-First Century Fox and NBC Universal have said the Custom TV offering violates their contractual obligations. ESPN is ""encouraged by the changes that Verizon has made to Custom TV,"" spokeswoman Katina Arnold said. She declined to comment on ESPN's lawsuit against Verizon.      FOX and NBC could not be reached immediately for comment. The offering now costs $69.99, along with Fios Internet and digital voice services and three genre-specific add-on packages for $6 each. The first Custom TV iteration started at $65 a month for broadband, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, from a choice of seven for $10 each.The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate.  Last month, Verizon's Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo declined to comment on the ESPN lawsuit on an earnings call with investors, but said customers ""don't want to have to pay for bundles that they never use."" ""We will refresh (Custom TV) here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements,"" he added.Compared to pay-TV giants AT&T Inc with its DirecTV acquisition last year and Comcast, Fios has a small market in 12 states and Washington, D.C., with 5.8 million video customers as of the end of 2015.(Corrects to change ""FiOS"" to ""Fios"" in headline and paragraphs 1, 10 and 14.)

505,"  (Adds details on T-Mobile, Puerto Rico Telephone company;  Liberty and Comcast could not be reached for comment)By David Shepardson and Malathi NayakWASHINGTON/NEW YORK March 18 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Friday that it had received 104 applications to take part in an auction of valuable low-frequency airwaves relinquished by TV broadcasters,     including many wireless companies who want to use the airwaves to build new networks or improve existing coverage.The government plays the middleman in the auction designed so broadcasters are incentivized to sell at the lowest rates and telecom companies are encouraged to buy at the highest rates. The government keeps a large part of the difference.The FCC said 69 applications are complete and 35 are incomplete. The incomplete applicants have until April 6 to finish their application.The applicants include subsidiaries of Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc  and Liberty Global Plc  and many U.S. rural carriers. Some applications were filed by individuals, partnerships, consortiums or other corporate entities and ownership of the entities will not be publicly known until Monday. Also applying to bid is Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a firm owned by Mexican telecom giant America Movil SAB, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim.In an FCC filing from February seen by Reuters, Liberty's subsidiary ""Liberty Spectrum Inc"" told the agency that it may bid on one or more blocks of low-frequency spectrum in the auction to potentially provide mobile wireless services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Global, headquartered in London and backed by cable pioneer John Malone, could not be immediately reached for comment.Malone's Liberty Broadband Corp. backs U.S.-based pay-TV provider Charter Communications Inc, which appeared on Friday to be absent from the FCC's list although more details could emerge on Monday once the agency releases the auction applications. Charter's chief executive has said in recent weeks participation in the auction was unlikely. Comcast Corp and Dish Network Corp both said previously they planned to bid.A person familiar with the bids said that cable company Comcast had bid through a company with a different name. Comcast did not respond to a request for comment. Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital has said it will take part and filed an application, while the No.4 U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp and Alphabet Inc, which participated but did not buy in a 2008 auction, have said they are sitting out.Analysts forecast that the upcoming auction could fetch proceeds in the $15 billion to $45 billion range, but they expect bidders to be less aggressive than in the FCC's last auction, the ""AWS-3 auction,"" which ended last year and set a record of $44.9 billion in bids.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said earlier this month that he was ""encouraged by the strong interest that we have seen both from broadcasters interested in selling their spectrum and the broad assortment of parties interested in buying it.""Separately, the FCC said Friday that a decision by a federal appeals court late Thursday to allow Latina Broadcasters to provisionally participate in the auction that begins March 29 will not delay the auction.The FCC in February denied Latina Broadcasters application to participate.

506,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A quiet decision by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to recently sell three TV stations may foreshadow uncertain returns for some selling TV airwaves and lower wireless demand in the U.S. government's upcoming spectrum auction, industry watchers say.The U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auction, which kicks off on March 29, will sell low-frequency airwaves held by TV broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders.  Blackstone-controlled investment vehicle LocusPoint Networks LLC bought at least 16 stations from San Francisco to Miami, spending $66 million since 2012, according to FCC filings and data from research firm SNL Kagan. Other well-funded buyout firms such as OTA Broadcasting LLC backed by billionaire Michael Dell and NRJ TV LLC, funded by Fortress Investment Group, have also snatched up TV stations in the run-up to the auction.But in late November, shortly before the FCC began accepting applications from TV stations to sell spectrum, Blackstone's LocusPoint agreed to sell three stations in Baltimore, Detroit and Buffalo, New York, for about $24 million, according to FCC filings reviewed by Reuters. The deal closed late last month.That's five times the $4.8 million Blackstone paid, but just 5 percent of the government's $477 million stated opening bid prices for the three stations' spectrum licenses. Its acceptance of the deal for $24 million implies Blackstone lowered its expectations for the auction, even as the government's $477 million opening bid was not realistic,  analysts said. The FCC will first hold a ""reverse auction,"" gradually reducing its offer to the lowest amount participating TV broadcasters will accept. Wireless companies then bid for airwaves. ""There’s a general agreement among broadcasters that the opening bid prices that you see registered are high and that you won’t be getting that,"" said Dr. John MacKerron, professor at Towson University who manages student-run WMJF-CD in Towson, Maryland, one of the three sold to HME.Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner forecasts the 2016 auction proceeds at $20 billion to the low $30 billion range. The FCC's ""AWS-3 auction"" that ended last year saw record  bids of $44.9 billion.""If it would be a massive success, (Blackstone) wouldn’t sell right now, right before (the auction),"" Enter said.  While spectrum in certain geographic areas around metropolitan areas is attractive, there is a glut in secondary markets, analysts said. Moreover, some of the biggest wireless bidders are still digesting their investments from the previous FCC auction that ended last year, they added. Blackstone sold to HME Equity Fund II, owned by U.S. President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, and retired National Basketball Association player Grant Hill, and others, according to filings. Blackstone declined to comment and a lawyer for HME did not respond to requests for comment.  The three stations sold are among those in Blackstone's portfolio with lowest opening bid prices. Stations that LocusPoint has retained in major markets such as San Francisco and Orlando say ""cha-ching,"" Entner said. If HME is unable to sell the licenses, ""they could sell (after the auction) for less than what LocusPoint paid for them,"" SNL Kagan analyst Justin Nielson said.OTA and NRJ have not sold stations ahead of the auction, he added.Top U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc(VZ.N)  and AT&T Inc (T.N) , pay-TV providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Dish Corp (DISH.O) have filed to participate, but some analysts do not expect them to bid aggressively. T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) has said it needs low-frequency spectrum for network enhancements. Sprint Corp (S.N) will sit out.

508,"   By David Shepardson and Malathi Nayak | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday kicked off an auction of low-frequency spectrum relinquished by television  broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders that are seeking new airwaves to build and improve wireless networks.The so-called ""broadcast incentive"" auction is considered one of the FCC's most complex and ambitious spectrum auctions to date.    The first step is a ""reverse auction,"" where the government recovers spectrum from broadcasters that will voluntarily give up airwaves either to go off the air for a payout or be shifted to another frequency band for a smaller sum.""A successful auction means that spectrum will be repurposed, a huge amount of money will change hands, and technology and spectrum policy will be shaped for the future,"" said National Association of Broadcasters Executive Vice President Rick Kaplan. Of the 1,800 eligible broadcasters, an undisclosed number submitted applications to take part. Eligible broadcasters have until 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday to submit a binding agreement to take part.The reverse auction should be completed by summer and will be followed by a ""forward"" auction, where the government sells to telecommunications operators and other bidders the spectrum, which it will package into new bands. The results of that auction are expected by October.The government plays the middleman in the auction, which is  designed to give broadcasters an incentive to sell at the lowest price and encourage telecommunications companies to buy at the highest price. The government keeps a large part of the difference.The names of the TV broadcasters that are participating in the reverse auction will not be revealed by the FCC during the auction. Last week, the FCC said it saw 104 applications for the forward auction, 69 of them complete and 35 incomplete. Participants included wireless companies Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AT&T Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and pay-TV providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O).Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a unit Mexican telecommunications provider America Movil SAB (AMXL.MX), rural carriers  and financial companies such as Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital have also filed to take part.

""If broadband Internet service is an engine for economic growth, then mobile broadband has been its booster rocket, creating a platform for innovation, competition and new markets,"" he said.

509,"   By Liana B. Baker | March 29  March 29 NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp, said it had sold $1 billion in national ad sales for the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, as the network prepares to broadcast a rare Games where some of the most high-profile contests will air live in prime time for U.S. audiences.NBC said in a statement on Tuesday that the Games, which start on Aug. 5, were on pace to have the biggest Olympics advertising sales ever. The $1 billion figure includes national broadcast, cable and digital ad sales, the network said.""We've surpassed the $1 billion mark four months ahead of  (the 2012 Summer Games in) London,"" Seth Winter, NBC Sports' executive vice president of advertising Sales, said in a statement.By nature of a short time zone difference between Brazil and the United States, the Rio games will feature more live events such as track and field and swimming than in London, over 17 consecutive nights in August. U.S. advertisers have already bought out some inventory, but some prime-time advertising is still available on the main NBC broadcast network and cable channels, according to NBC.The network has not yet revealed its streaming plans for online viewing but said digital ad sales were healthy. Live streaming of events at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi generated tens of millions of dollars in advertising. NBC signed on two years ago to pay $7.65 billion for the right to air six Olympic Games from 2022 to 2032 before any other U.S. media company could bid.NBC and rival networks have been stocking up on live sports content, which is popular with advertisers because large audiences watch in real-time and cannot skip the TV commercials. Official Olympics sponsors spend significant amounts on ad time from NBC, with some even signing exclusive deals that keep other advertisers out of certain categories for the entire Games.Sponsors have been announcing their rosters of athletes in recent weeks. Citigroup said earlier this month it was sponsoring gymnast Gabby Douglas, beach volleyball's Kerri Walsh Jennings and rugby's Carlin Isles.Visa Inc, a global Olympics sponsor, is backing swimmer Missy Franklin and fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first Muslim-American to complete in a hijab.

510,"   By Diane Bartz and Ernest Scheyder  The U.S. Justice Department will file a lawsuit as soon as this week to stop oilfield services provider Halliburton Co from acquiring smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The antitrust lawsuit could potentially scupper the deal that was first announced in November 2014 to combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies. Since then, oil prices have fallen by more than 55 percent. Faced with opposition from the Justice Department, the companies may either cancel the planned tie-up or fight the government in court. The deal is one of several that antitrust enforcers have rejected as illegal during the recent wave of mergers of large, complex companies.Share prices for Baker Hughes closed down 5.1 percent at $39.36 Tuesday while Halliburton ended up 1.2 percent at $34.40.Halliburton and Baker Hughes both declined comment.The two sides had been discussing asset sales aimed at saving the deal, which was originally valued at $35 billion but is now valued at about $25 billion based on the decline in Halliburton shares.  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings.The proposed deal also has hit headwinds in Europe, where the European Union's competition authority was concerned that the proposed merger would reduce competition and innovation in more than 30 product markets. Regulators in Australia also flagged concerns about the massive tie-up.As far back as July 2015, Reuters reported that there were concerns in the U.S. government that the merger would lead to higher prices and less innovation.The Justice Department's worry then focused on two areas. One was that the drilling technology businesses that were divested would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders. The other was that the leaders would have less incentive to innovate. Baker Hughes in particular has been aggressive in developing new oilfield technologies, part of its appeal to Halliburton from the beginning. Baker Hughes developed smartphone apps to help customers in the field decide in real time how best to hydraulically fracture new wells. Furthermore, uniting Halliburton and Baker Hughes would create a dominant leader in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking.Lower oil prices had given investors hope that the companies' best path forward was together, especially as demand for their products and services evaporate as customers slashed budgets. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which enforce antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop a surprising number of deals in the past 18 months.The FTC stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc in 2015, and is currently in court fighting Staples' merger with Office Depot.The Justice Department, working with the Federal Communications Commission, stopped Comcast Corp from buying Time Warner Cable in 2015. It also stopped Electrolux from buying GE's appliance business and halted a merger of tuna sellers Bumble Bee and Thai Union, which owns Chicken of the Sea.The Justice Department also is reviewing two controversial insurance deals -- Aetna Inc's purchase of Humana and Anthem Inc's decision to buy Cigna Corp  -- amid concern they would reduce the number of national insurers from five to three.

The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which enforce antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop a surprising number of deals in the past 18 months.The FTC stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc in 2015, and is currently in court fighting Staples' merger with Office Depot.The Justice Department, working with the Federal Communications Commission, stopped Comcast Corp from buying Time Warner Cable in 2015. It also stopped Electrolux from buying GE's appliance business and halted a merger of tuna sellers Bumble Bee and Thai Union, which owns Chicken of the Sea.The Justice Department also is reviewing two controversial insurance deals -- Aetna Inc's purchase of Humana and Anthem Inc's decision to buy Cigna Corp  -- amid concern they would reduce the number of national insurers from five to three.

512,"   By Deborah M. Todd | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is ready to make a bid for Yahoo's web business, and hopes to make a merger more successful by also making an offer for a stake in Yahoo's Japan subsidiary, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter.The telecom giant is planning to make a first-round bid for Yahoo's web business next week, the news organization said.  Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google unit is also mulling a bid for Yahoo's core business, Bloomberg reported, citing a source.However, Bloomberg said many companies that had been seen as likely investors in Yahoo were not planning a bid, including AT&T Inc (T.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).Shares of Yahoo fell just over 1 percent to $36.17. Verizon, Yahoo and Google declined to comment for this story. AT&T, Comcast and Microsoft could not be reached immediately for comments.Verizon showed interest in Yahoo's core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would ""see if there is a strategic fit"" for its holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).The offer to purchase Yahoo's 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan could put Verizon one step ahead of any rival bidders.The offer will also likely leave Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer out of the mix, since Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said in a recent television appearance that merging Yahoo's assets with AOL assets under the leadership of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong ""would be a good thing for investors.""  The New York Post reported last month that Mayer has been working to team up with private equity firms to create a ""package deal"" that sells the company and keeps her at the helm.  Verizon shares were down 2.84 percent.

514,"   By Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON, April 15  WASHINGTON, April 15 The Obama administration on Friday weighed into the debate over allowing consumers to switch pricey cable television boxes for less expensive devices, urging an agency to set an example for other parts of government to boost competition.Consumers can spend nearly $1,000 over four years for renting cable set top boxes. Opening the business to competition and allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, an official said.""You could have a set a standards such that anyone could connect any box to their cable and those boxes could compete for lower prices and greater innovation,"" Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers told reporters in a teleconference. The Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, in February proposed a rule opening competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. It set a 60 day comment period on the rule that could cost major cable companies.The rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications . It is unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office next January. Cable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal saying it could stifle innovation.The administration entered the debate through a rare filing into the FCC's comment period. ""When the President personally gets involved is when it's of real great importance, in his mind, to consumers, to competition, and to the economy more broadly,"" Furman said. Obama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on specific areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition.Furman would not venture a guess on what kind of pro competition measures that order could spur. The administration is looking to add to actions it has already taken for consumers on cell phones, net neutrality and retirement advice.""This is going to be a whole of government effort to empower consumers, workers and small businesses,"" Furman said.

529,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A majority of the five-member U.S. Federal Communications Commission has voted to approve Charter Communications Inc's (CHTR.O) acquisitions of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and Bright House Networks, two sources briefed on the matter said on Thursday.The deals, which would create the second-largest U.S. broadband provider and third-largest video provider, won the backing of FCC Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Michael O'Rielly this week, the sources said on condition of anonymity.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler had already voted to approve them. The two other FCC commissioners have yet to vote on the matter.O'Rielly dissented in part, meaning the final conditions of the agency's approval could change before the full vote is completed and made public. The U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to the acquisitions with conditions on April 25.The FCC declined to comment on Thursday. Charter and Time Warner Cable shareholders have approved the companies' deal. Privately-held Bright House also is in favor of its acquisition.

A state administrative judge last month recommended that California's public utilities commission approve the deal. The decision is expected at a May 12 hearing.Tom Rutledge, president and chief executive of Charter, said in a statement Friday that the transactions have ""significant benefits"" including greater competition, broader access to affordable broadband, and new U.S. jobs. The FCC-imposed conditions ""are largely extensions of the longstanding consumer friendly values and practices of our company,"" Rutledge said.A majority of the five-member FCC voted to approve the deals earlier this week. The FCC said in a statement Friday that an ""order detailing the commission’s reasoning and the conditions will be issued in the coming days.""  Charter has valued its deal for Time Warner Cable at $56.7 billion, excluding debt, and the acquisition of Bright House at $10.4 billion.The U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to the acquisitions with conditions on April 25 and earlier Charter and Time Warner Cable shareholders approved the companies' deal.The Justice Department's approval carried conditions designed to protect competition, coming at a time when the pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix Inc and Hulu.The Justice Department said Charter agreed to refrain from telling its content providers that they cannot also sell shows online as part of the approval process.

The completion of the deals came days after Charter won final regulatory approvals, about a year after the transactions were announced.

Last week, California state regulators approved the deal.Charter has valued its deal for Time Warner Cable at $56.7 billion, excluding debt, and the acquisition of Bright House at $10.4 billion.Charter said Wednesday the deals ""will drive investment into the combined entity's advanced broadband network, resulting in faster broadband speeds, better video products, more affordable phone service and more competition, for consumers and businesses."" The U.S. Justice Department gave antitrust approval to the acquisitions with conditions on April 25, saying the deal prevents Charter ""from using its leverage over programmers to harm competition.The pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Hulu.

We remain open to a fair offer that allows us to carry this content at an appropriate value to our customers,"" Dish said in a statement.The NFL said it currently reaches 60 million homes and has set up a website that lists television networks that still carry its channels so viewers can watch games through other providers such as Comcast Corp's  XFINITY and AT&T Inc's DIRECTV. www.iwantnflnetwork.com TRIBUNE DISPUTE Dish is also locked in a battle with Tribune Media Co over fees to carry Tribune-owned stations and cable network WGN America.  Cable and satellite TV distributors are increasingly negotiating hard with programmers, resisting demands for price increases to carry content at a time when viewers are being drawn to Netflix Inc, Amazon Prime and other online services. Such contract standoffs have made blackouts commonplace in the television industry.Dish said on Sunday about 5 million subscribers had lost access to 42 Tribune-owned local channels and cable network WGN America in 33 markets across 34 states and the District of Columbia.On Thursday, Dish asked Tribune to agree to an arbitration process to restore its channels. Dish has said it has been giving customers free antennas to help them gain access to Tribune's programming. In response, Tribune suggested the U.S. Federal Communications Commission monitor contract talks between the two parties. ""Regrettably, we can only interpret Tribune's unwillingness to participate in binding arbitration as an indication that it actually is angling for rates that are above fair market,"" Dish's executive vice president of programming, Warren Schlichting, said in statement on Friday.Tribune has maintained that it is offering Dish the same rate it has under deals with other pay-TV partners.

Instead of basking in the glory of hosting the first Olympics in South America, organizers were struggling to get the event ready.Brazil has been grappling with a volatile political situation, concerns over crime levels in Rio, water pollution, late infrastructure and an outbreak of the Zika virus, which has clouded the start to the Games.""It sounds a little bit distorted or perverse, whatever the appropriate word is, but it just raises awareness that there are Olympic Games going on in South America and you'd have to be hibernating under a rock not to understand that,"" Winter said, speaking from Rio on a conference call with reporters.  By nature of a short time difference between Brazil and the United States, the U.S. broadcast will feature more live events such as track and field and swimming than in London, over 17 consecutive nights from Aug. 5-21. The live events give NBC ""confidence in committing to our advertisers the types of numbers that we think we can reach,"" Winter said. The broadcaster is still planning to air the opening ceremony on Friday on a tape delay, however, which has generated criticism on social media. NBC signed on two years ago to pay $7.65 billion for the right to air six Olympic Games from 2022 to 2032 before any other U.S. media company could bid. Winter alluded to the Rio games being profitable to the network.Networks have been stocking up on live sports, which are popular with advertisers since audiences cannot skip commercials. More than 75 percent of the ad sales are driven by the main broadcast network, Winter said, although they also include cable and digital ad sales.

565,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON, Sept 7  WASHINGTON, Sept 7 The top U.S. communications regulator plans on Thursday to unveil a revised plan to allow about 100 million pay TV subscribers to replace expensive set-top boxes with less-costly apps that provide access to television and video programs, two people briefed on the plan said.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed in January opening the $20 billion cable and satellite TV set-top box market to new competitors and allow consumers to access multiple content providers from a single app or device.The plan, aimed at breaking the cable industry's long grip on the lucrative pay TV market and lowering prices for consumers, drew fierce opposition from TV and content providers, including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.The FCC has said Americans spend $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 annually. Set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones has dropped 90 percent, the FCC has estimated. The pay TV industry raised concerns over copyright, content licensing and privacy issues and made a counterproposal in June, offering to commit to creating its own apps to allow consumers to watch programs without needing to lease a box.Wheeler's revised plan is expected to include some components of the pay TV industry's proposal, and to exempt some smaller cable providers from the new requirements. The plan is also expected to create a licensing body to oversee the pay-TV apps, according to industry filings with the FCC. The revised application-based proposal is expected to come before the five-member commission for a vote on Sept. 29 at the commission's next meeting, the sources briefed on the matter said.Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, declined to comment. Disney, CBS, Viacom, Time Warner  Inc, Scripps Networks Inc and others met with Wheeler aides last week to discuss ""a revised approach... that would ensure that all of programmers' valuable content would remain inside of, and under the control of, apps developed exclusively by"" cable and other pay-TV providers, according to a filing with the FCC this week.These companies fear that rivals like Alphabet Inc  or Apple Inc could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content.Wheeler's January proposal would create a framework for device manufacturers and software developers to produce a single device or app to gain access to content from providers such as Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu, Alphabet's YouTube and a pay-TV company.Wheeler has an aggressive agenda in the final months of the Obama administration. He wants the FCC to finalize a proposal to ensure privacy for broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent. He also wants to complete reforms of the $40 billion annual market for business data services known as special access lines.

574,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), the largest U.S. cable company, will pay a $2.3 million fine to resolve a federal investigation into allegations the company wrongfully charged cable TV customers for services and equipment they never authorized.The Federal Communications Commission said on Tuesday it had received numerous complaints from consumers that Comcast added charges to their bills for unordered services, including premium channels, set-top boxes and digital video recorders. Comcast will implement a five-year compliance plan as part of a consent decree, the FCC said, and must offer a detailed program for responding to consumer complaints ""in a standardized and expedient fashion.""By next year, the FCC said, Comcast must send customers a separate order confirmation of new services, allow customers to block additional cable services, improve customer record keeping and require additional employee training for individuals placing excessive unauthorized charges on customer bills.  Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said the company did  not agree with the FCC's legal theory but added, ""We acknowledge that, in the past, our customer service should have been better and our bills clearer."" She also said Comcast had already committed to make most changes sought by the FCC.The FCC investigation found numerous examples of Comcast billing customers for services they did not want but would not refund charges. Customers were often told by Comcast that the company would only address six months of billing issues because of its computer systems, the FCC said.In June, a U.S. Senate panel found overbilling to thousands of consumers by Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Time Warner Cable, which has since been acquired by Charter. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said the companies made no effort to trace equipment overcharges unless consumers asked and did not provide notice or refunds. Comcast told the Senate panel it would make it easier for consumers to cancel service without being forced to stay on the phone and answer questions.

It was unclear which Fox and Viacom networks would be part of the Google service, two of the sources said.The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential.

577,"   By Michelle Sierra, Lynn Adler and Karen Schwartz  Oct 24 AT&T Inc's plan to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion in the biggest global acquisition of the year will bring the second-largest U.S. bridge loan financing ever to a market hungry for mergers and acquisitions loans.The new $40 billion bridge loan backing the deal is being welcomed by bankers after a deep slump in investment-grade M&A lending in the first nine months of the year, bankers said.The loan will be lucrative for banks, led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) and JP Morgan (JPM), that are arranging the jumbo bridge loan. AT&T's swoop on Time Warner was announced on Saturday.The 18-month bridge loan is expected to be split between a $30 billion commitment to issue bonds and $10 billion of term loan commitments, a banking source said.Lenders will earn $110 million to $130 million in fees for arranging this financing, according to Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services, said via email.""These bridge loans are especially important to banks now, given weakness in the overall investment banking revenue pool,"" according to Nassof.If the acquisition is approved by regulators, AT&T will gain control of media assets including cable TV channels HBO and CNN, as well as film studio Warner Bros. The deal, which combines content with delivery, is an attractive proposition for liquid lenders.""This is a pretty strategic asset, and the financing markets are as strong as they've been in a long time,"" a loan banker said. ""No matter what the outcome of the (US) election is this is a very compelling strategic transaction for both companies."" The $40 billion bridge loan is a large underwriting commitment in volatile markets and the two lead banks are expected to syndicate some of the risk shortly to other relationship banks.""Given the risk and the size and the fact that there is going to be a lot of scrutiny around regulatory issues, JP Morgan and BAML, they're going to want their risk to come down,"" a second loan banker said.Only the $30 billion bridge to bond issues is expected to be syndicated, the first banker said. ""The deal demonstrates banks' continued confidence in the bond markets, even despite the uncertainty around elections and the Fed,"" Nassof said. ""JPM and BAML should be first in line to lead the bond financing to replace the bridge, which could generate another $200 million in underwriting fees down the line.""In the US, AT&T's financing is the second largest bridge loan after a $49 billion bridge loan backing Verizon Communications' acquisition of British telecom Vodafone Group's stake in its U.S. wireless business in 2013.These deals overshadow other large U.S. bridge loans, including a $30.9 billion deal backing pharmaceutical company Actavis' acquisition of specialty pharmaceutical company Allergan in 2014, a $22.5 billion bridge loan backing insurer Anthem's purchase of rival Cigna in 2015 and a $22.5 billion loan that supported drugmakers Pfizer and Wyeth's 2009 combination.AT&T's deal is the second biggest bridge loan globally after a $56.9 billion deal backing German chemical company Bayer's $66 billion acquisition of U.S. seed firm Monsanto which has been allocated. The fact that AT&T has obtained an underwritten bridge loan is a good sign for loan volume, the two bankers said. The bond market has been receptive this year and investment-grade companies have been able to use balance sheet cash or issue bonds to pay for acquisitions and bypass the loan market altogether.Investment-grade M&A lending slid 26 percent to $100 billion in the first three quarters of the year from $135 billion in the same period last year, Thomson Reuters LPC data show, and is far off the full-year total of $181 billion in 2015.  MORE TO COMEAT&T's new bridge loan pays a margin ranging between 75 basis points and 150 basis points, based on ratings.In line with other similar financings, the margin on the loan steps up and becomes more expensive over time, which gives AT&T an incentive to replace the bridge with permanent financing.JP Morgan and BAML declined to comment. AT&T and Time Warner did not immediately return calls and emails for comment.The corporate tie-up is expected by the markets to face regulatory pushback amid a wave of consolidation in the telecom and media sectors.This deal comes on the heels of cable company Comcast Corp's $30 billion purchase of NBCUniversal. Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T's wireless rival, is in the process of buying internet company Yahoo Inc for about $4.8 billion.

579,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK T-Mobile US Inc is the likeliest acquisition target as media companies seek a wireless partner following AT&T Inc's proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc, analysts said.AT&T announced the deal late on Saturday, stoking urgency in the telecoms and media sectors, where carriers facing a saturated wireless market are looking for content to attract mobile users and producers of shows and movies are seeking digital distribution.   T-Mobile took most of the wireless industry's subscriber and revenue growth in the third quarter. Its strong balance sheet and fast-growing wireless business makes it an attractive target for a pay-TV or media company, analysts said. T-Mobile shares jumped 9.5 percent on Monday after it announced third-quarter financial results. At least nine analysts raised their target price on the No. 3 wireless company, which said it added 851,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter. T-Mobile has taken market share from bigger rivals Verizon and AT&T, and that momentum is expected to continue, analysts said.""The takeout target over the next twelve months has got to be T-Mobile,"" New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said. Potential buyers include Comcast Corp, satellite-TV provider Dish Network Corp, and Mexican telecom company America Movil, analysts said. Comcast and Dish declined to comment. America Movil could not be immediately reached for comment.""Content of all kind is rapidly landing on the internet and the internet itself is rapidly transforming toward mobile,"" T-mobile Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert told Reuters. T-Mobile is ""very interested"" in exploring strategic opportunities, he said.  Sprint Corp, which is aggressively working towards reviving its wireless business, is another takeout candidate, analysts said. Sprint received more calls than usual from bankers over the weekend after the AT&T-Time Warner deal was announced, Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said on an earnings call on Tuesday.""Our strategic value to many has significantly grown,"" he added. Dish is struggling to grow its subscriber base amid intense competition, but sits on a treasure trove of wireless spectrum that it has amassed in recent years. Dish has been long considered an acquisition target for AT&T or Verizon to boost their wireless networks. Dish's spectrum could be worth nearly $45 billion, analysts said. Dish CEO Charlie Ergen ""has been pretty realistic about the challenges in the pay-TV business,"" so it is more likely they would look to sell, BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk said. The AT&T-Time Warner deal means Dish has lost a potential buyer in AT&T, Piecyk added.

582,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Comcast is schooling AT&T on media M&A. The $155 billion cable giant now gets more than a third of its revenue from NBC Universal, a deal it concluded in early 2013. The regulatory and political climate was more accommodating and Chief Executive Brian Roberts' strategy sound. AT&T's $85 billion bid for Time Warner, by contrast, is a dog's breakfast.The top line at NBC Universal, home to the Peacock Network, MSNBC and a giant movie studio, jumped 28 percent to $9.2 billion. Granted, the unit got a huge lift from broadcasting the Olympics in the United States. But even after stripping out the sporting event, revenue increased nearly 6 percent thanks to strong growth at its theme parks.Comcast's two-part deal for NBC Universal, which it bought from industrial conglomerate GE, was prudent by today's standards. Regulators insisted on a variety of conditions before approving the deal, including that Comcast take a passive role in its ownership of video-streaming service Hulu. GE's then-huge finance division was also under duress thanks to the financial crisis and the parent was eager to rid itself of media assets that made little sense in its portfolio of jet engines and capacitors. By contrast, AT&T is paying a whopping $20 billion above Time Warner's undisturbed market value. The cost savings cited by AT&T, some $1 billion, barely cover a third of the premium. The telecommunications giant also has little experience in producing TV shows and movies. Roberts himself has learned some hard deal lessons. Comcast's earlier attempt to take over Walt Disney  was a failure. So too was his proposal to buy Time Warner Cable after trustbusters denied the union. AT&T argues it will have no problem sailing through the review process. Based on Time Warner's shares, which are now trading $20 below the offer price of $107.50, AT&T may want to dial down the cockiness.

Telecom companies are eyeing media businesses to tap new revenue through digital content distribution, as their core business declines.Comcast, which is both the largest U.S. cable operator and the No. 1 U.S. high-speed internet provider, said total revenue rose 14.2 percent to $21.32 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $21.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Comcast grew 12.1 percent to $2.24 billion from a year ago. Excluding certain adjustments, profit was 92 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a penny.Philadelphia-based Comcast added 32,000 video subscribers July through September, compared to a loss of 48,000 users a year earlier. To keep its pay-TV subscribers, Comcast has been enhancing its X1 set-top box to let viewers search shows and movies easily, expanding its on-demand library and improving its customer service. Last month, through a beta test, it began letting customers stream Netflix through its X1 cable-TV service.Revenue from its high-speed internet business rose 8.8 percent to $3.4 billion in the quarter, while customer additions rose 3.1 percent to 330,000. Business services revenue increased 15.5 percent to $1.39 billion. Revenue from its NBCUniversal division, which includes the NBC television network, film studios and theme parks, grew 28.3 percent to $9.18 billion, helped by the broadcast of the 2016 Rio Olympics.The Universal film studio's revenue fell 6.1 percent to $353 million due to the lukewarm response to third-quarter releases, including ""Jason Bourne"" and ""The Secret Life of Pets."" A year ago it benefited from its blockbuster hit ""Minions.""Revenue at Universal theme parks rose 62.4 percent to $706 million, boosted by Harry Potter attractions and the addition of Universal Studios Japan. Comcast bought a majority stake in the Japanese studio for $1.5 billion in late September last year.Shares of Comcast closed at $64.52 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq.

The two drugmakers were the top boosts to the S&P 500. Profits at S&P 500 companies have largely exceeded analysts' estimates for the third quarter so far, setting up the first profit growth since the second quarter of 2015. Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data shows third-quarter earnings are now expected grow 2.6 percent, up from the 0.5 percent decline anticipated at the start of October.Sectors linked to interest rates weighed, however, as yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes touched a five-month high of 1.87 percent.The S&P real estate sector was down 2.4 percent and on track for its worst decline in five weeks, while utilities shed 0.4 percent. ""Essentially we've seen earnings, there are pockets of strength and weakness, but on the whole earnings have come in better than expected,"" David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York.""But on top of that today, some of the yield-sensitive parts of the market are contending with this backup in interest rates, so that is putting a little bit of a depressant on some parts of the market.""Comcast was among the top drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, falling 1.9 percent after Barclays and Deutsche Bank cut their price targets and cited increased competition from AT&T-owned DirecTV Now. The stock is down nearly 6 percent over the past three sessions. Comcast, along with O'Reilly Auto, whose quarterly earnings missed expectations, were the primary drags on the consumer discretionary index, which lost 0.7 percent.

Official data showed that Britain's economy slowed only slightly in the three months after it voted to exit the European Union. It grew by 0.5 percent between July and September, a touch less than the second quarter's 0.7 percent, but tempering fears about an immediate economic impact following the Brexit decision.Britain's 10-year government bond was up 12 basis points to yield 1.27 percent, on track for its biggest daily rise since June 2015.German and U.S. equivalents rose to their highest since early June at 0.19 percent and 1.86 percent, respectively.""The stronger (gross domestic data) print in the UK has given further weight to speculation that the BoE will not provide further stimulus any time soon,"" said Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire. In U.S. equity markets, investors took Qualcomm's deal  to buy NXP Semiconductors for about $47 billion as a sign of confidence, sending up shares of both.Despite beating earnings estimates a day earlier, Comcast  pulled the S&P and Nasdaq lower, falling as much as 2.7 percent following price target cuts from Barclays and Deutsche Bank.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,216.83, the S&P 500 lost 0.11 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,139.32 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 12.85 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,237.42.

589,"  CBS Corp (CBS.N), owner of the most-watched U.S. television network, reported results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and said it was still in the early stages of exploring a merger with Viacom Inc (VIAB.O), a deal favored by its controlling shareholders.Media mogul Sumner Redstone, who controls both CBS and Viacom through his privately held National Amusements, in September proposed a merger of the two companies, which he split up a decade ago. Both have created special committees to explore a tie-up.Shari Redstone, Sumner Redstone's daughter, has been in favor of merging CBS and Viacom under the leadership of CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves, sources have told Reuters. On a call to discuss CBS earnings, Moonves told investors contemplation of a Viacom deal is still in the early stages, but added, ""if it looks right and is structured properly, it could be an attractive opportunity.""Shares of CBS rose 1.8 percent in post-close trading.CBS, home to popular shows such as ""Homeland"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"" and the Showtime cable network, said revenue rose 4.3 percent to $3.396 billion in the third quarter. Analysts had expected revenue of $3.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, ad revenue, which accounts for more than 40 percent of total revenue, fell slightly to $1.47 billion. That was the result of limited ad spots during the prime time hours of the Republican and Democratic Party conventions and first presidential debate, as well as competition from the Summer Olympics on NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).While CBS executives on the call said they expect fourth-quarter ad revenue to be stronger, they added that CBS relies less on ad revenue than ever before. The company is working to add NFL games to its All Access online streaming service, for example, Moonves said, noting that the broadcaster is in ""active discussions"" with the NFL. CBS plans to begin selling All Access with its Showtime over-the-top service - independent of any cable TV subscription - but is still determining the pricing, Moonves said. Revenue from CBS's affiliate and subscription fees division rose 13.4 percent to $753 million in the quarter. Revenue from its content licensing and distribution business, one of its fastest growing, rose 6 percent to $1.11 billion.CBS said net income from continuing operations rose to $514 million, or $1.15 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $426 million, or 88 cents per share.Excluding items, CBS earned $1.05 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents per share.

591,"   By Tim Baysinger  Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal will begin selling ads for Apple Inc’s News app next year in an exclusive deal, the companies announced on Monday.Apple will outsource the selling to NBCUniversal, which already has relationships with many major U.S. advertisers. The deal is reminiscent of one that Snapchat struck with Viacom earlier this year, under which Viacom sells advertising on Snapchat's behalf.Unlike Apple, however, Snapchat has been filling its sales roster as it prepares for next year’s initial public offering.Apple does not have its own sales team after it shut down its iAd app ad network in June, which was used to fill unsold inventory for Apple News.  Apple launched its News app last year and currently has over 70 million active monthly users.Publishers on the app, which include The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, will still be able to sell their own ads and keep all of the revenue, but now NBCUniversal, rather than Apple, will sell the extra inventory.  For NBCUniversal, this provides another platform to offer advertisers. Like most legacy U.S. media companies, NBCUniversal parent company Comcast has invested heavily in digital-native companies like BuzzFeed and Vox, partly in an effort to better service existing advertisers. For example, NBCUniversal and Vox partnered on an ad product, Concert, that packages inventory from NBCUniversal and Vox’s digital properties and offers it to advertisers.NBCUniversal would not say how the revenue would be split for the ads it sells against other publishers' content; in the past, publishers would get 70 percent of the revenue with the other 30 percent going to Apple. Publishers also have the ability to opt out of having NBCUniversal sell ads against their content. NBCUniversal said it will also work with Apple on new ad products for the app. NBCUniversal will form a new sales unit dedicated to the News app, which will be lead by senior vice president James Kreckler.

597,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice of experts to focus on new policies at the Federal Communications Commission signals a regime that will have a ""lighter"" touch on regulation and be more likely to favor large mergers in telecoms industries, analysts said.Economist Jeff Eisenach and former Sprint Corp (S.N) lobbyist Mark Jamison were named by Trump's transition team to oversee hiring and policy for the FCC. They both oppose some recent telecom industry regulations resisted by telecom and cable heavyweights such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and AT&T Inc (T.N) and have voiced support for mega mergers in the past.The FCC is composed of five commissioners, including one designated as chairman, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Only three commissioners can be from the same political party and Trump's pick for FCC chairman would tip the balance in favor of Republicans. The addition of Eisenach and Jamison to Trump's ""landing team"" on Monday come as the Republican president-elect puts together a team to staff various government departments and agencies after he succeeds Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20.The two appointments are harbingers of ""a more typical Republican FCC that is lighter on regulation and more focused on competition,"" said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. ""The focus will be more on reducing regulation than creating new ones.""That would be in stark contrast to the Obama administration's FCC that enacted or proposed a handful of new industry rules and disapproved some proposed combinations, including Comcast's bid for Time Warner Cable and AT&T's attempt to buy T-Mobile (TMUS.O).The FCC under Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, has had a rocky relationship with large telecom companies, some of which strongly opposed the agency's 2015 net neutrality or open internet rules.The rules, which require internet service providers to treat all data equally and bar them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content, were seen as a major victory for internet businesses like Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) that offer services but do not own internet networks. 'PRO-BUSINESS POLICY' Eisenach has supported mergers such as AT&T and T-Mobile as well as Sprint and T-Mobile that were dismissed by regulators during Obama's administration, according to analysts. He is known in telecom circles for having a ""pro-business"" mindset, New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said.  ""Whoever gets picked (as FCC chairman) is likely going to implement a similar pro-business policy,"" Kurn said. Eisenach, who was previously tapped by the Trump campaign as an adviser on technology and telecom policy, is currently a managing director at consulting firm NERA Economic Consulting's communications, media and internet practice. He previously held advisory roles at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the White House Office of Management and Budget.In 2014, he testified in the U.S. Senate against net neutrality rules, arguing there was no need for new regulation as existing antitrust rules, while ""not perfect,"" offered safeguards against concerns about the business practices of internet service providers. Jamison is the director of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida. Like Eisenach, he has strongly disagreed in his publications with Wheeler's rules, including net neutrality and a proposal to open up the market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes.That measure was aimed at breaking the telecom and cable companies' grip on the $20 billion market and bringing in players such as Google and Apple (AAPL.O) in an effort to lower prices for consumers.Some analysts said the appointments also raised questions over whether Trump would carry out his campaign pledge to kill AT&T's $85.4 billion proposal to buy Time Warner (TWX.N).Matt Wood, policy director of the technology rights group Free Press, said that even as Trump opposes the deal, he picked the pro-business economist Eisenach, who was unlikely to want to block such a merger.
