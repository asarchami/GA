0,"  By Ernest Scheyder and Swetha GopinathJan 17 Schlumberger Ltd, the world's largest oilfield services company, posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Friday as robust international activity offset stiff competition in North America.Fracking, drilling seismic studies and other lucrative services for oil producers across most of the Middle East, Asia and Latin America helped the company's profit top analysts' estimates for the ninth straight quarter.Intense competition with Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc for work in North America's vast shale fields, though, combined with weak natural gas prices, eroded regional results.Without strong sales from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North American revenue would have dipped.""The main challenge in the North America land market is still pricing,"" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with investors.Negotiations for new contracts with several key North American customers should further dent results, with pricing falling, he said. Statoil and other international energy firms are Schlumberger's largest North American customers and have used the oversupply of oilfield services to their advantage.Despite tepid North American growth, Schlumberger expects the global economy to improve in 2014 and oil demand to rise, with double-digit earnings growth across the company for the year, Kibsgaard said.Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers. International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger's 2013 revenue of $45.27 billion. Middle Eastern revenue jumped 5 percent in the quarter, helped by activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but a temporary shutdown of operations in southern Iraq in November, following a protest, slightly dented fourth-quarter results, the company said.Schlumberger suspended activity in Iraq in November after dozens of Shi'ite Muslim workers and tribesmen, accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion, stormed the Schlumberger camp in North Rumaila and wrecked offices.Seasonal slowdowns in North America, the North Sea, Russia and China also weighed on results. The company expects oil producers' exploration and production spending, the lion's share of its business, to increase this year for international markets and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.Barclays expects oil and gas companies to spend about $723 billion on exploration and production this year, an increase of 6.1 percent from 2013, according to report released last month.Schlumberger's net income rose to $1.66 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec.31, from $1.36 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, profit from continuing operations was $1.35 per share.Revenue rose about 7 percent to $11.91 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue of $12.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results come the day after Schlumberger boosted its quarterly dividend by 28 percent to 40 cents.The company, which reviews its dividend every January, has no set level for future dividend payouts, Kibsgaard said.""There is no target number,"" he said.Baker Hughes and Halliburton are scheduled to report their fourth-quarter results on Jan. 21.Baker Hughes, considered the smallest of the ""big three"" oil service providers, earlier this month estimated a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit, citing the suspension of its operations in Iraq.Schlumberger shares rose 1.1 percent to $89.61 in morning trading on Friday.Schlumberger shares have risen 21 percent in the past year, compared with a 17 percent rise in the Philadelphia oil service index.",2014-01-17,SLB,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 10:38am EST","UPDATE 3-Schlumberger profit surges, helped by Middle East & Asia",http://www.reuters.com//article/schlumberger-results-idUSL3N0KR3DL20140117?type=companyNews

3,"  By Guillermo Parra-Bernal     SAO PAULO, Jan 24 Bankrupt oil producer Óleo e Gás Participações SA will delay presenting its restructuring plan to creditors, initially scheduled for Friday, by about a week as the company attempts to secure more funding, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.     Óleo e Gás, formerly known as OGX Petróleo e Gas Participações SA, and creditors are discussing terms of a potential $200 million debtor-in-possession loan, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the talks are private. The delay is unlikely to disrupt operations, and the company has enough funds to stay afloat, both sources added.     Management wants to convince the maximum number of creditors to back the recovery plan, which has to be filed with a Brazilian bankruptcy court, the first source said. Óleo e Gás owes about $5.1 billion to investors such as bond fund Pimco, dozens of suppliers including Schlumberger NV, and sister company and shipbuilder OSX Brasil SA.     Óleo e Gás and OSX are both controlled by Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista, the former billionaire whose empire of commodities and industrial companies collapsed last year in dramatic fashion under a mountain of debt after disappointing output at the oil company's wells sent investors running for the exits.     Calls to Óleo e Gás in Rio de Janeiro were not immediately answered. Lawyers working on behalf of the company and creditors declined to comment.     Once Óleo e Gás delivers the restructuring plan to the bankruptcy court, creditors will then have between 30 days and 60 days to endorse or reject the plan. Bankers and creditors have moved slowly with the DIP loan because they are uneasy with the lack of precedent for such a structure in Brazil, the second source said.     In the United States, DIP loans are the first debt that gets repaid. As a result, such loans tend to be a regular feature of bankruptcy cases and are credited with saving companies and their employees from fire-sale liquidations.      In recent weeks, Óleo e Gás obtained a bridge loan to pay for operations while it seeks the DIP loan.      The company, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 30, stands to lose offshore exploration rights in Brazil's Espírito Santo state should it fail to meet capital spending commitments by the end of this week, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Thursday.

4,"  Feb 7 Brazil's Óleo e Gás Participações SA creditors, led by bond firm Pimco, have agreed to about $200 million in financing for the oil company, which began Latin America's largest corporate debt default in October, Bloomberg reported on Friday.The deal would take control of the company, formerly OGX , out of the hands of Eike Batista, the former Brazilian billionaire whose swift rise to vast wealth was matched by his fall from those same ranks.Citing people with knowledge of the talks, Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Bank AG will act as an intermediary. Representatives from Pimco did not immediately return a phone message. Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and Óleo e Gás did not immediately respond to emails. The Brazilian company was expected to submit a debt restructuring plan this month after having delayed the plan in January. Óleo e Gás owes about $5.1 billion to investors such as bond fund Pimco, suppliers including Schlumberger NV, and sister company and shipbuilder OSX Brasil SA.Batista, who controls OSX which is also in bankruptcy proceedings, saw his commodities and industrial conglomerate collapse last year under huge debts after disappointing output at its oil wells sent investors fleeing.",2014-02-08,SLB,"Fri Feb 7, 2014 | 7:35pm EST",Creditors of Brazil's Oleo e Gas agree to $200 mln deal -Bloomberg,http://www.reuters.com//article/pimco-ogx-financing-idUSL2N0LC22H20140208?type=companyNews

The company earned $1.01 per share in the first quarter of 2013. The positive outlook came despite cold, wintry weather in North America and Russia that dented demand for the company's drilling, completion and other services for oil and natural gas producers.

8,"  * Schlumberger first-quarter profit $1.21/share vs est. $1.20* Baker Hughes first-quarter adjusted profit $0.84/shr est. $0.78* Both upbeat on Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling   (Recasts to adds details on outlook risks, new share prices)By Sayantani Ghosh and Ashutosh PandeyApril 17 Oilfield services providers Schlumberger Ltd and Baker Hughes Inc each posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, though they said pockets of weakness loom in Brazil, Canada, Russia and other drilling regions.The results highlight a rapidly changing landscape for the oilfield service industry, where companies are competing for a smaller number of new contracts in North American shale fields. At the same time, they are moving into newer, more-lucrative Eastern Hemisphere regions that have higher logistical risks.Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which provide drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys for oil and natural gas companies, have for months been complaining of market weakness in North America.Additionally, Royal Dutch Shell and other large, international oil companies, after a decade of double-digit growth in capital budgets, have begun cutting spending as oil prices stagnate and project costs rise, a bad sign for oilfield service companies.Executives from Schlumberger, the world's No. 1 oilfield services company by revenue, and Baker Hughes told analysts on conference calls they expect results to slightly improve this year in parts of North America but they warned of potential problems in other regions.Schlumberger said deepwater drilling off Brazil should decline 20 percent this year compared with last year and that revenue could drop in Russia due to weakness in the rouble. Both countries are important markets for Schlumberger.""Brazil revenue for us this year is going to be significantly down versus 2013,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on a call with analysts, citing slipping demand and less-lucrative contracts signed last year.Baker Hughes said its revenue this quarter would decline slightly in North America, where it gets half its annual revenue, partly due to a slowdown in Canada. GULF OF MEXICO HOLDS PROMISE Three years after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, large oil and gas companies are ramping up operations in the Gulf of Mexico, which they expect to yield more than 700,000 barrels per day of crude.""The Gulf of Mexico will play a big role in our North American margin growth,"" Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Martin Craighead said.While Schlumberger's revenue from deepwater drilling in the region fell in the first quarter due to operational delays, it  expects the situation to normalize this quarter. ""The outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year,"" Kibsgaard said.Baker Hughes, which said it had a good first quarter in the Gulf, expects business in the region to continue to improve and boost margins particularly in the second half of the year.The company's North American revenue rose 12 percent to $3.68 billion in the first quarter. Baker Hughes posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to $2.78 billion from the region.Baker Hughes' shares rose 4.1 percent to $69.05 in afternoon trading.Schlumberger's shares, which hit their highest point in nearly six years on Thursday morning, fell 0.4 percent to $100.53. The stock has risen about 12 percent in the past month, outperforming shares of Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes.In the past few quarters, unusually cold weather in North America and Russia disrupted drilling, hurting oil and gas companies while pushing up natural gas prices in North America and depleted stockpiles to their lowest level since 2003. Kibsgaard said the fundamentals of the global economic recovery were intact despite the harsh winter, slowing growth in China, and problems in Ukraine.Schlumberger, which cut its 2014 capital spending budget by about 3 percent to $3.8 billion, said it expected spending on well-related activity to rise by more than 6 percent this year.WEAK LATAM Schlumberger's first-quarter revenue fell short of analysts' average estimate due to reduced drilling activity and pricing pressure in Latin America.Revenue from the region declined 8 percent to $1.76 billion, the lowest in eight quarters. Latin America accounted for nearly 16 percent of Schlumberger's total sales in the first quarter ended March 31.Schlumberger's profit from continuing operations rose 32.5 percent to $1.59 billion, or $1.21 per share, in the first quarter. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.20 per share.The company's total revenue rose about 6 percent to $11.24 billion, but missed an average estimate of $11.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Baker Hughes also posted a 10 percent drop in quarterly revenue from Latin America.The company's adjusted profit rose 27 percent to 84 cents per share, while revenue rose nearly 10 percent to $5.73 billion.

9,"   By Sayantani Ghosh and Ashutosh Pandey  Oilfield services companies Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly profits and signaled an improvement in the North American market, driven by increased drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services company, gets a third of its revenue from North America. The region accounts for half of rival Baker Hughes' annual revenue.The companies provide drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys to oil and gas companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).Three years after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, large oil and gas companies are ramping up operations in the Gulf, which is poised to deliver more than 700,000 barrels per day of crude.While Schlumberger's revenue from deepwater drilling in the region fell in the first quarter due to operational delays, the company expects the situation to normalize in the current quarter.""The outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year,"" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with analysts.Baker Hughes, which said it had a good first quarter in the Gulf, expects business to continue to improve in the region and boost margins, particularly in the second half of the year.Barclays analysts were upbeat on both stocks, saying the companies had done well in North America despite a colder-than-usual winter.""The industry bellwether posted a solid earnings number in a tough quarter (and) signaled a 'robust' North American market ...,"" they said in a research note, referring to Schlumberger.The company's North American revenue rose 12 percent to $3.68 billion in the first quarter. Baker Hughes posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to $2.78 billion from the region. Baker Hughes' shares rose as much as 5 percent to $69.43 on the New York Stock Exchange - their highest since August 2011.Schlumberger's shares, which rose less than 1 percent in morning trade to their highest in nearly six years, were marginally down at $100.34 in morning trading.The stock has risen about 12 percent in the past month, outperforming shares of Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes.SPENDING CUTS In the past couple of quarters, colder-than-usual weather in North America and Russia disrupted drilling, hurting oil and gas companies. The cold weather, however, pushed up natural gas prices in North America and depleted stockpiles to their lowest level since 2003, after years of glut that forced many drillers to idle rigs.Kibsgaard said the fundamentals of the global economic recovery were intact despite the harsh winter, slowing growth in China, and problems in Ukraine.""These factors, however, are likely temporary in nature ... but supply and demand is expected to normalize over the coming months,"" he said in a statement.Oilfield services companies are expected to feel the heat as large oil companies, after a decade of double-digit growth, cut spending amid stagnating oil prices and higher project costs.The company has already seen a reduction in spending from integrated oil companies, Kibsgaard said, adding that he expects them to cut spending more on infrastructure and less on well-related projects. Schlumberger, which cut its 2014 capital spending budget by about 3 percent to $3.8 billion, said it expected spending on well-related activity to rise by more than 6 percent this year.WEAK LATAM Schlumberger's first-quarter revenue fell short of the average analyst estimate due to reduced drilling activity and pricing pressure in Latin America.Revenue from the region declined 8 percent to $1.76 billion, the lowest in eight quarters.

The opinions expressed are his own.)By John WasikCHICAGO, June 23 Despite the incendiary conflict in Iraq that last week sent the benchmark price of Brent crude oil to more than $115 a barrel, a nine-month high, U.S. stock markets largely shrugged off the oil threat, hitting record closing highs last week.For investors, a new energy crisis in the Middle East presents something of an opportunity, albeit a fragile, short-term one.Energy production has become much more geographically diverse, particularly in the United States. That lessens the severity of a Mideast production shortfall while boosting the long-term prospects of investment in fossil-fuel companies.As is the case during any threat to global oil production - Iraq is still OPEC's second-largest producer - the share prices of oil companies and the funds that invest in them soar on bad news, which is what happened last week. Petroleum producers score in the short term when this happens.Owing to greater demand for oil and geopolitical tensions, ExxonMobil Corp, the largest energy company by market valuation, climbed 10.5 percent over the three months through June 20, compared to a 5.3 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index. BP PLC (the ADR) was up nearly 15 percent over the three months ended June 20.The last three months are important because they include a spate of good reports on economic growth in Europe and the U.S. and a run-up to the political strife in the Middle East. These events, and growing demand from developing countries such as China and India, have pressured oil prices upward. The Vanguard Energy ETF, which holds a broad portfolio of oil and gas exploration, refining and pipeline companies, gained 16 percent in the quarter through June 20. It holds companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, and nearly all its holdings are based in North America. It's up about 16 percent in the three months through June 20.For a fund that's not dominated by the most popular energy stocks, consider the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Energy ETF , which holds a global portfolio of energy producers in roughly equal proportions.The Guggenheim portfolio places more emphasis on smaller, lesser-known companies like Newfield Exploration Co, Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Nabors Industries Ltd . The fund is up nearly 16 percent for the three months through June 20. Independent companies like these may have more drilling activities in the areas where shale oil and gas are being discovered throughout North America. ENERGY SHOCK BOOMERANG Over a short period of time, it makes sense to hold energy stocks as a defense against rising oil prices. After all, companies make profits on price surges.But on the consumer level, higher petroleum prices can act as a damaging boomerang. When prices soar beyond a certain level, it brakes economic activity across the board. Higher fuel prices force people to drive less and stay away from stores, raise prices for everything from farm goods to plastics, and act as a tax on economic growth.During the last draconian oil-price run-up in 2008 - when crude oil prices topped $140 a barrel - the combination of an energy shock, a banking/credit meltdown and massive unemployment from Athens to San Francisco created a recession in Europe and North America. Towards the end of that year, energy prices bludgeoned an already-hobbled economic situation and the Vanguard Energy fund lost nearly 40 percent of its value, slightly more than the S&P 500 Index.Looking ahead, what may mitigate any traumas in terms of oil prices will be growing U.S. oil and gas production, particularly in regions where ""fracking"" technology has liberated more hydrocarbons from shale formations from the Appalachians to North Dakota.Production in the U.S. was up a record 1.1 million barrels per day last year, offseting declines in global output from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq - all due to political strife.""The huge investments seen in the U.S. have been encouraged and enabled by a favorable policy regime,"" BP economist Christof Ruhl told Reuters. ""And this has resulted in the U.S. delivering the world's largest increase in oil production last year. Indeed, the U.S. increase ... was one of the biggest annual oil production increases the world has ever seen.""Across the globe, the future for energy stocks is positive long term. Consumers in China, India and Africa are buying petroleum-hungry vehicles. And until less-costly alternatives present themselves, fossil fuels will power the engines of these developing economies.Short-term political conflicts are unlikely to extinguish these trends.

17,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, July 21 All too often, I see investors heading in the wrong direction en masse. They buy stocks at the top of the market or bonds when interest rates are heading up.Occasionally, though, active investors may be heading in the right direction. A case in point has been the flow of money into certain exchange-traded funds in the first half of this year.Reflecting most hot money trends, billions of dollars moved because of headlines. The Energy Select SPDR exchange-traded fund, which I discussed three weeks ago, gathered more than $3 billion in assets in the first half, when crude oil prices climbed and demand for hydrocarbons remained high.The Energy SPDR, which charges 0.16 percent for annual management expenses and holds Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, has climbed 22 percent in the past 12 months, with nearly one-third of that gain coming in the three months through July 18. Long-term, this may be a solid holding as developing countries such as China and India demand more oil.""We think the Energy Select SPDR is a play of oil prices remaining high and supporting growth for integrated oil & gas and exploration and production companies,"" analysts from S&P Capital IQ said in a recent ""MarketScope Advisor"" newsletter.Headlines also favored European stocks as represented by the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF, which holds leading eurozone stocks such as Nestle SA, Novartis AG  and Roche Holding AG. The fund has been the top asset gatherer thus far this year, with $4 billion in new money, according to S&P Capital IQ.As Europe continues to recover over the next few years and the European Central Bank keeps rates low, global investors will continue to benefit from this growing optimism. The Vanguard fund has gained nearly 16 percent for the 12 months through July 18. It charges 0.09 percent in annual expenses and is a solid holding if you have little or no European exposure in your stock portfolio.RATE HIKES Not all hot money trends make sense, however. As the economy accelerates and interest-rate hikes look increasingly likely, investors are still piling money into bond funds, which lose money under those circumstances. The iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, which holds middle-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds, continued to rank in the top 10 funds in terms of new money in the first half. The fund, which holds nearly $5 billion, is up nearly 4 percent for the 12 months through July 18, compared with 4.2 percent for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Total return index, a benchmark for U.S. Treasuries. The fund charges 0.15 percent in annual expenses.While investors were able to squeeze a bit more out of bond returns in the first half of this year, they may be living on borrowed time.The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed recently that it would be ending purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in October. This stimulus program, known as ""QE2,"" has kept interest rates artificially low as the economy has had a chance to recover.The phasing out of QE2 could be bearish for bond funds. Will interest rates climb to reflect growing demand for credit and possibly higher inflation down the road? How will the ending of the Fed's cheap money program affect U.S. and emerging markets shares?Many pundits believe public corporations may pull back from their enthusiastic stock buybacks and trigger a correction. Yet low inflation and modest employment gains may mute bond market fears.""The Fed is on track to complete tapering in the fourth quarter, and we think there is essentially no chance that it will move the fed funds rate higher this year,"" Bob Doll, chief equity strategist with Nuveen Investments in Chicago, said in a recent newsletter.""With the 10-year Treasury ending the quarter at 2.5 percent, the yield portion of this forecast is more uncertain,"" Doll added, ""although we expect yields will end the year higher than where they began.""While there could be any number of wild cards spoiling the party for stocks, it is wise to ignore short-term trends and prepare for the eventual climb in interest rates.That means staying away from bond funds with long average maturities along with vehicles like preferred stocks and high-yield bonds that are highly sensitive to interest rates.Longer-term, shares of companies in consumer discretionary, materials and information technology businesses likely to benefit from a global economic resurgence will probably be a good bet.Just keep in mind that the hot money can be wrong, so build a long-haul diversified portfolio that protects against the downside of a torrid trend going from hot to cold.

America margins of 20 pct in Q3 vs 18.2 pct in Q2* Shares hit life-high   (Updates link to graphic)By Swetha Gopinath and Ashutosh PandeyJuly 21 Halliburton Co, North America's top oilfield services provider, said it would add fracking equipment and crew to take advantage of higher demand in the region, signaling an industry-wide recovery after a two-year slump.Shares of the world's No.2 oilfield services provider rose 2 percent to a life-high of $72.20 after the company also raised its share repurchase program to $6 billion from $5 billion.Halliburton, like global leader Schlumberger Ltd, said while there was no impact on business yet due to the U.S. sanctions against Russia, projects being tendered later this year could be impacted. The country contributes in the ""low single digit"" percentage to Halliburton's total revenue. ""As tensions potentially escalate and the risk of more sanctions sort of looms, that's what we believe puts some risk into the business in the back half of the year,"" Chief Executive David Lesar said on a post-earnings call.Halliburton reported a 20 percent rise in second-quarter profit, meeting Wall Street's expectations, as drilling activity increased in North America.HIGHER MARGINS Halliburton, which gets half its revenue from North America, said it expects margins in the region to touch 20 percent in the current quarter, up from 18.2 percent in the quarter ended June 30. The company's margin in the region was higher than Baker Hughes Inc's 12 percent and Schlumberger's 18 percent.Halliburton said it would ""immediately"" speed up additions to its crew and hydraulic fracturing fleet as capacity tightened in North America.""I think it is a kind of vote of confidence that demand is on its way back,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Stewart Glickman.Prices for hydraulic fracturing, where water, chemicals and sand are blasted into wells to extract oil and gas, have been depressed due to excess equipment and a drop in natural gas drilling, brought on by low prices of the fuel. However, a recent rise in natural gas prices has led to increased drilling, helping boost revenue at Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes.WEAK LATAM Halliburton's revenue from North America rose sequentially to 11 percent in the second quarter - stronger than a 9 percent rise in the eastern hemisphere, where it had been making a strong push to combat the weakness in North America.The weakest region was Latin America, where revenue rose just 4 percent, dragged down by reduced activity, a delayed order and costs related to new projects in Mexico.Margins in the region are expected to improve in the second half, with full-year margins in line with those a year earlier.The company's revenue rose 10 percent to $8.05 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.88 billion.Halliburton also said it would move the role of president to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Miller from Chief Executive David Lesar, effective Aug. 1.

25,"  * Region supplied 5 percent of French oil needs in 1920s* Very small volumes produced today, but highly profitable* Suspicion surrounding shale gas holds back permitsBy Gilbert ReilhacMerkwiller-Pechelbronn, France, Oct 1 (Reuters) - S ustainably high oil prices have lured small oil explorers back to Alsace, the cradle of the French oil exploration industry that gave birth to corporate giants such as Schlumberger.The activity near the Rhine on the German border does not amount to an oil boom. The region provides 1 percent of French oil production, which is just under 2 percent of European output.Nonetheless, 13 wells are pumping, two exploration permits have recently been granted and more are being reviewed by the French administration.""For us, Alsace was a sleeping beauty,"" said Stephane Touche, whose company Millennium Geo-Venture holds the two recent exploration permits and has applied for five more.Among its advantages, the region's oil reserves are already completely mapped and are very close to the surface. Oil leaks have long provided a favourite mud-bath playground for wild boars in the Alsatian forest.Oil production in Alsace started in the 18th century and peaked in the 1920s, when more than 650 wells and four refineries supplied 5 percent of French oil needs and provided work for 3,000 people around Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, 50 km north of Strasbourg. In that era, the Schlumberger brothers carried out the first electrical well log and created the company.The drop in oil prices and large discoveries in what was then French Sahara led to the end of the region's oil industry in the 1960s.The Rhine valley has produced about 80 million barrels of oil so far, Touche said.Millennium recently drilled its first well near Soufflenheim, and production is expected to start this autumn. The 46-year-old engineer founded the company with investors from Norwegian company Moore Energy, which has applied for more licences in the Paris basin for conventional oil and gas. MORE PROFITABLE THAN IN AFRICA Another advantage for the oil industry is that French taxes are light by comparison with more established oil-producing countries. Crude production in France becomes commercially viable at around $70 a barrel, according to industry figures.""A barrel produced in France is 10 to 20 times more profitable than a barrel produced in Africa,"" said Philippe Labat, who founded a small company called Oelweg and runs a well near Oberlauterbach.The 60-year-old had been a production engineer at Elf, now known as Total, when it tried and failed to revive French oil production in the 1980s.Oelweg, which has applied for three more permits in Alsace, has re-opened a well abandoned by Elf and has added a heater to improve its productivity. The beam pump, surrounded by corn fields, produces 10 barrels per day with only one part-time worker, giving Oelweg a net profit of 163,500 euros ($207,400) in 2012 on revenue of 375,000 euros.Since the closure of the region's Reichstett refinery in 2011, oil from Alsace is send to the Karlsruhe refinery in Germany. ""Thanks to Alsace, France exports crude oil,"" Labat quipped.The French authorities have not made oil exploration any easier in recent years, however. France banned hydraulic fracking in 2011, and fears about shale gas among environmentalists and the public have made even conventional oil drilling suspect.Last year, a request by U.S. firm Hess Corp to explore for shale oil and gas in the Paris basin, France's main production area, was rejected by the government despite assurances it would not use fracking.The fracking technique, which involves pumping water and chemicals underground, was banned under former President Nicolas Sarkozy due to concerns over the environmental impact including possible contamination of groundwater and earthquakes.The ban was upheld by the constitutional court in 2013, after a challenge by another U.S-based company, Schuepbach Energy, which held two permits that were cancelled.French oil lobby UFIP estimates that 112 hydrocarbon permit requests are currently frozen by the French administration, having been withheld sometimes for several years, although a few have been awarded this year.But the debate about oil and gas exploration on French soil shows no sign of abating. Sarkozy, in a policy U-turn, came out in favour of shale gas in his first political rally since his return to French politics this month, while energy minister Segolene Royal confirmed her opposition.Back in Alsace, however, the local population has no qualms about its black gold. ""It's part of our history,"" the mayor of Soufflenheim, Camille Scheydecker, said.

26,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Oct 8 Schlumberger Ltd, the world's largest oilfield services company, is exploring the sale of its oilfield tools rental unit Thomas Tools, which could be valued at more than $600 million, according to people familiar with the matter.An auction is already underway for Thomas Tools, which has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $80 million, the people said this week.Private equity firms keen to buy the unloved divisions of big conglomerates are among those that have shown interest in Thomas Tools, the people said. Boutique investment firm PPHB is advising Schlumberger on the sale process, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. A Schlumberger representative did not respond to a request for comment while PPHB declined to comment.New Iberia, Louisiana-based Thomas Tools is a provider of oilfield rental tools, such as drill pipes, to energy exploration companies. Founded in 1961 as a downhole tool specialty company, Thomas Tools was taken over by Houston, Texas-based Schlumberger in 2010 as part of its $11 billion acquisition of Smith International Inc.The market for companies that provide rental equipment to the oilfield industry has become increasingly competitive, with low barriers to entry for new participants offering less sophisticated products, and customers unwilling to tie themselves up in long-term contracts. Reuters reported earlier this year that Light Tower Rentals, a privately held peer of Thomas Tools, was exploring a sale that could have valued it at around $700 million.Light Tower Rentals subsequently pulled the sale process for the entire company after it failed to meet its valuation expectations and borrowed $330 million in July to refinance debt and pay a dividend to its owners, private equity firm Clairvest Group Inc and the company's management.One month later, Light Tower Rentals announced it had sold 44.2 percent of the company's equity for $100 million to new investors that included investment firms StepStone and Constitution Capital Partners LLC.

30,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Oct 17 Schlumberger Ltd, the world's largest oilfield services company, said oil and gas spending would increase in 2015 as global oil demand is poised to rise, downplaying fears of an investment slowdown due to weak crude prices.Schlumberger shares were up 7 percent at $97.10 in early morning trading.The company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit after markets closed on Thursday, helped by strong drilling activity in North America.Oil prices have slid nearly 20 percent since June due to oversupply, signs of weak demand growth and indications that key oil producers, particularly Saudi Arabia, have limited appetite to intervene in prices.The steep fall has sparked fears that oilfield earnings would be hurt with oil and gas customers reigning in spending. ""The key to the overall oil market is still that the global oil demand is currently set to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2015, which will require growth in exploration and production investments,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a post-earnings call on Friday.The International Energy Agency earlier this week cut its 2015 estimate for oil demand growth by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.1 million bpd, citing weak global economies.Oil demand was ""largely unchanged"", while supply was relatively ""well balanced,"" Kibsgaard said on the call. ""WTI oil at $80 a barrel for a short time is unlikely to have an impact on growth and margins for the services companies, but $80 oil for more than a month or two certainly will,"" William Blair & Co analysts wrote in a note.They expect the company to ""wait and see"" how $80 WTI would impact producers' spending plans. West Texas Intermediate crude was at about $83 per barrel on Friday, while Brent crude was over $87.Baker Hughes Inc, the world's No.3 oilfield services provider, said on Thursday that drilling activity was unlikely to slow unless crude fell to and remained at $75 for a few months.Still, Schlumberger expects 2014 exploration spending to fall by 4-5 percent from a year ago, largely due to a 20 percent fall in seismic expenditure.Oil and gas companies are spending more on maximizing production from existing wells, than on searching for new reserves as they face increasing investor pressure to raise shareholder returns.Up to Thursday's close, Schlumberger shares had fallen more than 20 percent over the last three months due to the sharp slide in crude prices.

31,"  The proposed merger of oilfield service companies Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc would create a serious challenger to Schlumberger NV in international markets and cement the two companies' dominance in North America.And that is the problem, according to some analysts.""The proposed merger would be dominant in North America, which could spur protracted (antitrust) scrutiny; and likely elicit howls of protest from customers everywhere, potentially requiring concessions to more than one national anti-trust authority,"" analysts at FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note.Baker Hughes disclosed after the market closed on Thursday that it was in preliminary merger talks with its Houston neighbor.But muted market reaction on Friday highlighted the likelihood that any deal would face an uphill regulatory battle.Baker Hughes' shares were up 0.2 percent in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange while Halliburton's were up 1.4 percent. Schlumberger's stock was up 0.4 percent. A combined Halliburton-Baker Hughes would have combined revenue of about $52 billion, based on 2013 results, outstripping Schlumberger's 2013 revenue of $45.3 billion.The merged company's business in North America would also be about double that of Schlumberger, which gets more than two-thirds of its revenue from international operations.Still, the merged entity's market value of about $70 billion would be far less than Schlumberger's $120 billion. Baker Hughes, whose shares were trading at $58.38 at midday, should be able to command a 25 percent premium to its Wednesday close of $50.98 for an enterprise value of $25.46 billion, Evercore ISI analyst James West said in a note.The proposed deal would give Halliburton, the No. 2 oilfield services provider, the leading market share in oilfield services such as directional drilling, coiled tubing and drill-bits, unseating Schlumberger in all three markets, said West. A deal would not be all bad news for Schlumberger, however. Analysts said that by reducing the number of big players in  the industry to two from three, pricing could stabilize.""Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have been in a knife fight the past few years for international and offshore tenders,"" Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts said.""A combined company could help introduce more discipline to these bid processes and ultimately improve returns/profits for the industry.""  (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr)",2014-11-14,SLB,"Fri Nov 14, 2014 | 2:11pm EST",Proposed merger of oilfield firms poses challenge to Schlumberger,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bakerhughes-halliburton-research-idUSKCN0IY24H20141114?type=companyNews

The multi-stage deal announced by the companies on Tuesday will see U.S. group Schlumberger, which has been in a strategic alliance with Eurasia since 2011, offer $22 a share for the near-46 percent stake.Shares in Eurasia, formed about 10 years ago mostly from the drilling assets of Russia's second-largest oil producer Lukoil, jumped 68 percent to $20.45 per global depositary receipt after Tuesday's announcement. The company, shares of which lost about 60 percent of their value last year in the face of the weakening Russian economy and increased competition from the likes of state oil producer Rosneft, intends to go private by delisting from the London stock market before the deal is completed.  The Schlumberger transaction and delisting are both expected to be completed in the first quarter, Eurasia said.In a separate statement, Schlumberger said it has an option to buy the remaining shares in Eurasia during a two-year period commencing three years from the closing of the initial transaction. KEY REVENUE SOURCE A source close to the deal told Reuters that the transaction will not result in any violation of the sanctions imposed against Russia. Russia is the world's leading oil producer, with output hitting a post-Soviet high at an average of 10.58 million barrels per day last year, but the Western sanctions pose an increasing threat to this key source of the country's revenue.  The oil services sector is ripe for consolidation as it grapples with reduced exploration investment in response to the painful 57 percent slump in global oil prices to around $49 since June and Schlumberger's move would leave it well placed for any upturn in Russia.Along with Halliburton, Schlumberger is one of the largest foreign oilfield services companies operating in Russia.""Eurasia ... joining with Schlumberger ... establishes an exceptionally strong platform for delivering drilling services to Russia's oil and gas industry as future market conditions stabilize,"" said Roderick Peacock, chairman of Xenon Capital Partners, adviser to Eurasia Drilling's core shareholders.

Feb 4 Halliburton, Statoil ASA, Hess Corp and other North Dakota energy companies have decided, for now, not to lay off staff in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, hoping to be prepared for any prolonged rebound in crude prices.Many oil producers and their contractors are trying to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining workforce reserves after a more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices  since last June.The drop has made some oil patch investors anxious that North Dakota could experience a third oil bust after slumps in the 1950s and 1980s. Local business leaders, though, say they're confident the state's economy can abide the slowdown.Indeed, oil prices are nothing if not volatile, up about 19 percent in the past four trading days after plunging for months.Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest North Dakota oil producer, has no plans to lay off any of its 507 employees in the state, spokesman Eric Hagen said. Oilfield service provider Halliburton has told its roughly 1,500 North Dakota employees that job cuts are not coming, for now. The update came in a letter to staff from Brent Eslinger, senior district manager for Halliburton in Williston, considered capital of North Dakota's oil patch.Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael added that the company ""will continue to monitor the business environment"" and cut costs as needed.Hess Corp, the state's third-largest oil producer and one that uses Halliburton to hydraulically fracture wells, has no plans to cut North Dakota staff. ""We're all about lean efficiencies, but there are no plans for layoffs,"" Hess spokesman John Roper said.Other large North Dakota producers, including Oasis Petroleum Inc and Statoil, have said they have no plans to reduce their workforce. EOG Resources Inc hasn't ""announced any layoffs,"" spokeswoman K Leonard said. To be sure, all energy-related companies in North Dakota's oil patch are hunkering down. Many of the state's oil producers, including Hess and Oasis, have cut 2015 capital budgets. Whiting and EOG release spending plans later this month.While there are nearly 800 wells needing to be fracked in North Dakota, oil producers can wait up to a year to do so. Hess, for instance, plans to bring fewer wells online in 2015.Halliburton's announcement last month that it will lay off 1,000 in the eastern hemisphere - as well as similar plans by peers Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes Inc, which Halliburton is buying for roughly $35 billion - sparked concern that the companies would cull large portions of their North Dakota staffs, steps that would have a negative economic ripple effect. Such fears, for now, appear unwarranted.Continental Resources Inc, North Dakota's second-largest oil producer, did not return a call seeking comment on staffing levels. Chief Executive Harold Hamm, though, bragged in a Tuesday press release that Continental's North Dakota acreage continues ""to provide exceptional results.""

53,"  (Adds details, background)MOSCOW Feb 20 Russia's Eurasia Drilling  said on Friday it was delaying a deal to sell a stake in the company to oil services giant Schlumberger while it waited for approval from a Russian regulator.Last month, Schlumberger said it planned to buy a 45.65 percent stake in Eurasia for about $1.7 billion, potentially paving the way for it to become the sole owner of Russia's most active oilfield services company. Eurasia said on Friday the company and Schlumberger were continuing to cooperate with the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) to respond to requests for information regarding the deal.It said the merger, including the delisting of its global depositary receipts in London, would not occur in the first quarter as it had previously announced. FAS approval is essential for all major mergers or acquisitions. Eurasia said it would make a further announcement once all conditions set out in the merger agreement had been satisfied, including that ""no further notification to, or review by, FAS is required"". Eurasia, whose shares lost about 60 percent of their value last year because of the weakening Russian economy and increased competition from the likes of state oil producer Rosneft , intends to go private by delisting from the London Stock Exchange before the deal is completed.Last month, Schlumberger said it had an option to buy the remaining shares in Eurasia during a two-year period commencing three years from the closing of the initial transaction.

55,"  CARACAS Feb 27 Venezuela's PDVSA  said on Friday that oil services giant Schlumberger was poised to extend an existing credit line to the South American state oil company, without offering details.In 2013, PDVSA received a revolving credit line of at least $1 billion to allow it to continue contracting Schlumberger for work including drilling and pipeline services in the OPEC nation with the world's largest oil reserves.On Thursday, Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard met PDVSA boss Eulogio del Pino in Caracas ""to deepen their cooperation agreements,"" according to PDVSA. ""Both companies said they have complete willingness to renew current agreements and increase the current credit line,"" the statement read. The two executives also discussed the need to optimize operations amid lower oil prices, it added. PDVSA did not respond to requests for details.

57,"  Oilfield giants Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and many others in the oil and gas industry have announced plans to lay off thousands of people in the past few months as global oil prices have halved since June.In March, Brent prices LCoc1 fell to a near six-year low, hurt by a global supply glut and OPEC's decision not to curtail production. This prompted oil producers to trim their budgets and lower the number of rigs planned for 2015, hurting their suppliers and service providers.Smaller oil services company Weatherford said last month it would eliminate the position of chief operating officer, while tiny oil and gas producer Resolute Energy Corp (REN.N) said it would slash its CEO's base pay by 96 percent.  Oil major BP Plc (BP.L) said it would freeze its base pay across the company this year, while Basic Energy Services (BAS.N) said it has implemented salary cuts for all management and administrative employees and made changes to some benefit programs.  The job cuts announced so far would not be sufficient to maintain profitability, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a note on March 16. The offshore oil services industry in the United States and Europe has to cut 10-15 percent more jobs over 2015, they said.

58,"  The U.S. shale oil industry may have forever abandoned its heavy-spending ways in the face of sliding crude prices, Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, said on Monday.Spending cuts already announced by producers - to the tune of 25 to 60 percent - have dropped the rig count by 45 percent since late 2014, and output will soon decline or flatten out so prices can recover, Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. U.S. oil prices CLc1 have fallen by 50 percent since June to below $50 per barrel as growing supplies of tight oil from shale and oil sands in North America overwhelm weak global demand.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has refrained from cutting output to lift prices, a move Kibsgaard said may be part of an effort to test the resilience of higher cost producers.At the time of $100 oil, some highly-leveraged U.S. players were known for their intensive capex budgets. That has changed.""Going forward, we believe financial prudence, where investments are limited to the cash flow generated byproduction, will be the new normal for U.S. tight-oil developments,"" he said at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy conference in New Orleans. Outside of North America, Schlumberger expects the oil and gas industry's international spending on exploration and production to drop by 10 to 15 percent in 2015, continuing a trend seen last year.He said this is related to a ""sharp reduction"" in deepwater exploration activity that could delay the sanctioning of new developments, adding that the company is seeing lower activity and pricing pressure in the Gulf of Mexico. That means, he said, ""the global oil market is clearly heading for a tightening ... in the second half of this year."" The rebalancing would come in part from less supply but also stronger demand in a market currently oversupplied by about 1 million barrels per day.Schlumberger, which has seen its share price fall by about a third since July, would be positioned to take advantage of any uptick in demand for its range of oilfield services, from drilling to fracking, Kibsgaard said.He emphasized that Schlumberger has been generating more free cashflow than its two main competitors, Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), which are in the process of merging. But he also acknowledged that the industry is going through a rocky downturn.""In the short term, activity visibility still remains limited as many of our customers are making drastic andsometimes unpredictable cuts to protect margins and cash flow,"" he said.

Schlumberger, which has seen its share price fall by about a third since July, would be positioned to take advantage of any uptick in demand for its range of oilfield services, from drilling to fracking, Kibsgaard said.He emphasized that Schlumberger has been generating more free cashflow than its two main competitors, Halliburton Co  and Baker Hughes Inc, which are in the process of merging.But he also acknowledged that the industry is going through a rocky downturn.""In the short term, activity visibility still remains limited as many of our customers are making drastic and sometimes unpredictable cuts to protect margins and cash flow,"" he said.

75,"  NEW YORK, April 17 An eventual recovery in U.S. oil drilling activity after the biggest slump in three decades may never reach last year's frenzied pace, according to the world's largest oilfield services company.The drilling recovery will likely to be slower to emerge due to a growing reserve of wells that have been drilled but not yet hydraulically fractured and increased activity in re-fracking wells that are running dry, Schlumberger Ltd Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a conference call Friday.Schlumberger expects the rebound in U.S. onshore drilling ""will be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells drilled and the refracturing market expand,"" Kibsgaard told analysts following the announcement of the company's earnings.The recovery ""will fall well short of reaching previous levels.""The message suggests that the disconnect between rigs drilling for oil and the trajectory of U.S. production may get worse before it gets better. While U.S. output rose in tandem with the number of rigs in the early years of the shale boom, output has continued climbing even as the rig count collapses to less than half its October peak. The decline in oil rigs slowed this week but left their number at the lowest since 2010, Baker Hughes Inc, another oil services firm, said separately on Friday.Now, fracking a backlog of wells and reviving existing ones could mean that oil production begins to recover even as the number of rigs drilling new wells remains depressed. ""There were a number of people still out there who were still expecting a v-shaped recovery,"" said James Wicklund, managing director of equity research at Credit Suisse.The recovery will instead be shaped like a bathtub, scraping along the bottom, with drilling levels remaining depressed for the coming four to five years, he said. In part, the return to drilling will lag because producers will begin to frack drilled uncompleted wells - wells that have been opened up, but have not yet had the oil extracted from them.""At least 2,700 wells have been identified as candidates for refracture in North America,"" said James West, an analyst at EvercoreISI.The Eagle Ford likely contains 1,000 of these wells, known as DUCs, according to West's estimate, while the Bakken has about 500, and the Marcellus, Niobrara, and Haynesville each contain over 300 candidates. The market value of these opportunities together is about $5 billion, he said.

82,"  (Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets)* Core capital goods orders fall 0.5 percent in March* Core capital goods shipments slip 0.4 percent* Durable goods orders jump 4.0 percent on transportationBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, April 24 U.S. business investment spending plans fell for a seventh straight month in March, weighed down by a strong dollar and lower energy prices, suggesting the economy was struggling to rebound from a recent soft patch.The report from the Commerce Department on Friday came on the heels of lukewarm data on retail sales, employment and housing starts that have hinted at insufficient growth momentum that could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later this year.""This is consistent with a sluggish rebound in growth. It's shedding more doubt on the Fed's willingness to raise rates mid-year,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February, which was the biggest decline since July 2013.The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1.1 percent in February. Economists had forecast these orders gaining 0.3 percent last month. The weakness mirrors other manufacturing indicators such as industrial production and various regional factory surveys.The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the report, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher as investors were cheered by strong results from Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Microsoft Corp.The Fed has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008, but a number of officials have said an increase will likely be considered at its June policy-setting meeting.MANUFACTURING STRUGGLING  Manufacturing has been undermined by the buoyant dollar, whose 12.1 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co.The world's largest household products maker on Thursday reported a 8.3 percent decline in quarterly sales.In addition, lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production, reducing demand for equipment by oil-field companies, including Schlumberger and Halliburton .Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, has cut its capital expenditure plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion. Halliburton slashed its capex by about 15 percent to $2.8 billion.""Cheap oil and a strong dollar, while beneficial to consumers, are putting serious pressure on manufacturers,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. The dollar and reduced capex spending by oil-field firms combined with a harsh winter and softer global demand to slow U.S. growth at the start of the year.In March, shipments of core capital goods - which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement - fell 0.4 percent after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in February.Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. As a result, JPMorgan lowered its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.6 percent annual pace.Barclays trimmed its forecast to a 1.1 percent rate from a 1.2 percent pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday.Pointing to prolonged weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, unfilled orders for core capital goods fell for a second straight month in March after barely rising in January.""We have not seen the full ramifications of the strong dollar and the drop in oil-related investment, so that could continue to play out,"" said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ""The focus is now on services and consumers in the hope that they are going to pick up the tab. So far we are not seeing signs of that.""A surge in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which rebounded 4.0 percent last month. That was the largest increase since July last year and followed a 1.4 percent decline in February.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-04-24,SLB,"Fri Apr 24, 2015 | 12:25pm EDT",WRAPUP 2-Weak U.S. business spending data hints at sluggish growth rebound,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XL0OC20150424?type=companyNews

(bloom.bg/1HRYqUb) Share prices of both companies dropped on the report. Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael said in an email to Reuters that the company was fully committed to its target of closing the acquisition in late 2015. Baker Hughes declined to comment.Halliburton has said it was willing to sell three drilling businesses to satisfy anticipated Justice Department concerns. Halliburton said on Monday that it was ""pleased with the prices and level of interest"" it had received. The second source called the potential purchasers ""impressive.""The Justice Department concern focused on two areas, according to the first source. One is that the drilling technology businesses would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders. The other is that the leaders would have less incentive to innovate. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have overlapping businesses in the United States, Asia and Europe, and the deal is being scrutinized by regulators in several countries.The second source, who believes regulators will ultimately approve the deal, said the companies knew going into the antitrust probe that divestitures would be needed, and that these were under discussion. The Justice Department has not said if it was satisfied, said the source, who noted that the agency was far from ready to make a final decision.The source also said it would be unusual for the department to sue because of an expected loss in innovation.Halliburton has said it was confident of achieving cost synergies of nearly $2 billion from the Baker Hughes deal.Shares of Baker Hughes closed down 3.9 percent at $58.28 while Halliburton finished down 0.8 percent at $41.54.

105,"   By Sneha Banerjee and Shubhankar Chakravorty  Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) will buy equipment maker Cameron International Corp CAM.N for $14.8 billion, as the world's top oilfield services firm scrambles to offer a broader range of products at lower prices to oil companies slashing budgets.The deal, which values Cameron around the market cap it had when oil prices were still $100 a barrel, marks the second big merger among energy services companies since crude prices LCOc1 entered a 60 percent slide last year.Halliburton and Baker Hughes, Schlumberger's rivals, agreed to a $35 billion tie-up in November.Schlumberger said the acquisition will allow it to bundle its offerings, which range from surveying a site to drilling wells, with ones from Cameron that include pressure valves and blowout preventers, one of which was at BP's Macondo well that exploded in 2010.The two companies know each other well. They set up a joint venture, OneSubsea, to target the deepwater industry in 2012.They have been eyeing each other since then, a person familiar with the deal told Reuters who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noting that Schlumberger has a history of acquiring its partners.""The deal should allow a more complete solution to customers and should allow SLB to grow market share,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Boyd. ""Smaller companies offering discrete products and services will likely be at a disadvantage going forward.""Schlumberger said the combined company would have pro-forma revenue of $59 billion in 2014.

Igor Artemyev, head of Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS), said the FAS had signed a nine-point agreement with Schlumberger regarding the bid last summer.A government commission must now make its decision on the deal. ""I'm not sure if there will be requirements for any additional points, but any of the bodies may put forward their proposals,"" RIA quoted Artemyev as saying.The deal to sell the stake to New York-listed Schlumberger has met with resistance in Russia's higher echelons of power, according to a senior government official speaking on the condition of anonymity.A source, familiar with the deal, said that it was probably a clause in the contract which opens the door to Schlumberger taking control of Eurasia which has irked some authorities. A Schlumberger spokesman has said the company ""is still committed to building on our successful collaboration with Eurasia Drilling Company and taking a minority position"".""Meanwhile, we are still awaiting on a formal response from the authorities,"" he said.Yana Yakovleva, head of Moscow-based non-profit organisation Business Solidarity, said the government has taken Russian President Vladimir Putin's advice to gradually refuse foreign help.""In the end, the party line to substitute imports will hit the effectiveness of domestic oil and gas production,"" she said.

124,"  (Updates estimates in paragraph 13 and adds day of Apple earnings announcement)By David RandallNEW YORK Oct 26 U.S. companies are far from optimistic that next year will see them get a break from the tough economic and market conditions they have faced in 2015. And that may well hurt capital investment and jobs growth.In the first three weeks of October, 165 American companies have cited the slowing global economy in their outlooks for earnings and revenue. That is up from 108 in the same period last year, and 97 in the year-earlier quarter, according to an analysis of earnings reports by Thomson Reuters.Among the phrases that have appeared in many of those statements are ""challenging macroeconomic environment,"" or ""global headwinds.""Earnings and revenue have been depressed this year largely because of the strong dollar, economic weakness in China and Brazil, and tumbling oil and commodities prices.The rise in the value of the American currency means that profits earned in foreign currencies are worth less when translated into dollars, possibly making American exports less competitive.The weakness in major emerging markets has hit sales by U.S. multinationals and the plunge in the prices of energy, metals and minerals have not only hit oil producers and miners but the manufacturing and service companies who sell to them.The problems are clearly not across the board, as shown by better-than-expected results reported last Thursday by technology heavyweights Amazon.com Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, and Microsoft Corp. They are all benefiting from the expansion of cloud-based computing.But among the major companies to announce job cuts in recent weeks are industrial conglomerates United Technologies Corp  and General Electric Co, technology giant Hewlett-Packard Co., and the world's largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger.Even social media company Twitter Inc, and biotechnology group Biogen Inc have said they are cutting jobs. Large employers announced 205,759 U.S. job cuts in the third quarter, the largest amount since the third quarter of 2009, according to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Caterpillar Inc, meanwhile, told analysts that it expects its capital spending to be ""less than half of what it was in 2012,"" while appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  lowered its capital spending for 2015 to between $700 million and $750 million, down from a previous forecast of $750 million to $800 million.Those moves are coming at a time when overall corporate earnings in the third quarter are on pace to fall by 2.8 percent from this time last year. So far 59 percent of companies have reported revenues that have fallen below analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.And expectations for 2016 are falling as well - in July analysts were predicting that corporate earnings per share in the first two quarters would grow 9.2 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively; those figures now are down to 4.7 percent for the first quarter and 6.2 percent for the second.The companies own forecasts, meanwhile, are falling short of expectations at the greatest pace since June 2014, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report. Companies ""have a reason to be worried. This isn't a major economic slowdown, but a meaningful one, and once you see a reduction in risk taking you will see a reduction in growth,"" said Paul Hoffmeister, a portfolio manager with the Quaker Funds.REBOUND POSSIBLE Few expect the economy to go into a free-fall, of course. Should the dollar and oil prices stabilize, the prospects for many companies could improve quickly and their earnings and revenue could beat expectations, setting the stage for a stock rally.Some consumer-driven companies also continue to do well, both in the U.S. and even in China, where both Nike Inc  and toy-maker Mattel have said they still see high rates of growth. Apple Inc, which reports its quarterly results Tuesday, has said that China remains a big part of its growth plans. And some multinationals who have taken a pounding, such as household products giant Procter & Gamble Co, have signaled they may be turning a corner. P&G said it sees sales growth strengthening in the second half of the year, as it focuses on more profitable lines such as Pampers diapers and Tide detergent.Many of those feeling the pinch from slowing growth overseas are the same companies that just a few years ago were counting on China and other emerging economies to bolster their bottom lines.For example, International Business Machines Corp, which cut its full-year profit forecast, said fewer big deals in China caused revenue from that country to fall 17 percent in the third quarter.Alan Gayle, a portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments, said that he has been increasingly moving more of his equity portfolio into U.S.-based companies that have limited exposure to China and other emerging markets.""I've pulled back from my China and emerging market exposure until there are clearer signs that the economy has stopped slowing,"" he said, adding that he expects that top-line revenue growth will continue to be a challenge for U.S. companies there.Yet he remains guardedly optimistic that oil and other commodity prices are nearing a bottom, and that consumer spending in the U.S. and Europe should remain steady.""We think the chances of a global recession remain quite low,""  he said.(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, Robin Paxton and Bill Berkrot; Editing by Linda Stern, Martin Howell and Bernadette Baum)",2015-10-26,SLB,"Mon Oct 26, 2015 | 1:47pm EDT","UPDATE 1-With global outlook weak, many U.S. companies tighten belts",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-companies-outlook-idUSL1N12Q1IO20151026?type=companyNews
125,"  * Venezuela, Iran push OPEC to lower production* No sign yet of Saudis changing course* Russia maintains Nov output at post-Soviet record* Schlumberger to cut more jobs as low oil price hurtsBy Alex Lawler and Vladimir SoldatkinVIENNA, Dec 2 Saudi Arabia has come under increased pressure from fellow OPEC members to cut output to prop up prices as the group meets this week amid one of the most severe oil gluts in its history.OPEC is widely expected to stick to its policies - enforced by Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi a year ago - of defending market share by pumping record volumes to drive rival, higher-cost producers out of the market.But while the Saudis can claim a partial victory over the U.S. shale oil boom, production from top non-OPEC rival Russia has kept surprising on the upside and its own members Iraq and Iran are set to add new barrels. World oil stockpiles are at a record, according to the International Energy Agency. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday said his country, OPEC's traditional price hawk, would push for a 5 percent output cut to shore up prices when OPEC meets on Friday. OPEC is currently producing some 1.7 million bpd above ceiling""Our (oil) minister Eulogio del Pino will put forth a very clear proposal to respect production ceilings,"" Maduro said. ""The hour has come to put the oil market in order.""Iran has also asked OPEC members to respect the production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day. It wants OPEC to be prepared to accommodate new volumes as soon as Western sanctions on the country are lifted next year.Oil prices have more than halved to $45 per barrel over the past 18 months due to a U.S. shale oil boom and high OPEC production levels. The decline was steep enough to deal a severe blow to the U.S. oil industry - where production costs are some of the highest in the world.Oil services giant Schlumberger said on Tuesday it would cut more jobs, adding to 20,000 already this year, citing low oil prices and a growing oversupply.""It has become clear that any recovery in activity has been pushed out in time,"" said Schlumberger's president of operations Patrick Schorn. FEELING PAIN But outside the United States the signs of a slowdown in supply are thin. Fresh data on Wednesday showed OPEC's biggest rival Russia held its output steady in November at a post-Soviet high.Russian output has repeatedly surprised OPEC on the upside over the past year. A year ago, Saudi's Naimi said output from ageing Siberian fields was set to decline: ""Others will be harmed greatly before we feel any pain,"" he said.Moscow has allowed its currency to weaken over the past year to adjust to lower prices and oil firms have ramped up drilling.Last week, U.S. bank Merrill Lynch said Saudi Arabia may have to devalue its currency, pegged to the U.S. dollar, or ultimately cut production to protect its budget revenues.Several non-Saudi OPEC delegates told Reuters they hoped Naimi would listen to other members, whose finances are much more limited than those of Riyadh and need an urgent boost from higher oil prices.""I hope this time it will be different, but I doubt it will be,"" one OPEC delegate said. Another delegate said he still saw no indication an agreement on cuts could be reached on Friday.

130,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Schlumberger Ltd Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said a ""significant"" recovery in oilfield activity was not expected until 2017, and he indicated that the company might struggle to meet analysts' estimates for its current-quarter profit.Shares of the world's largest oilfield services provider, which reported a better-than-expected profit on Thursday, rose as much as 8 percent. ""If we focus on (earnings per share), I would say that the current Q1 EPS consensus is probably a best-case scenario from what we can see today,"" Kibsgaard said on a post-earnings call on Friday. Analysts on average are expecting Schlumberger to post a profit of 55 cents in the first quarter ending March, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Demand for services provided by Schlumberger and its rivals is waning as oil companies tighten their belts in response to a 73 percent slide in global crude prices since June 2014.It would be ""tough"" to keep profit margins at current levels, Chief Financial Officer Simon Ayat said. The company, which also unveiled a $10 billion share buyback program on Thursday, expects investment in exploration and production to fall for the second straight year in 2016.Although North American oil companies have scaled back spending, their output remains high as they steer drilling rigs to the most prolific shale spots and frack wells more intensely.Production in North America and outside of OPEC is resilient because oil companies, looking to maximize cash flow, are keeping ""taps wide open,"" Kibsgaard said. ""We still expect positive movement in oil prices during 2016 with specific timing being a function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates,"" he said.Like its customers, Schlumberger has been cutting costs.The company said on Thursday it had laid off 10,000 employees in the fourth quarter, taking its total job cuts to 34,000, or 26 percent of its workforce, since November 2014.

Analysts on average are expecting Schlumberger to post a profit of 55 cents in the first quarter ending March, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Demand for services provided by Schlumberger and its rivals is waning as oil companies tighten their belts in response to a 73 percent slide in global crude prices since June 2014.It would be ""tough"" to keep profit margins at current levels, Chief Financial Officer Simon Ayat said. The company, which also unveiled a $10 billion share buyback program on Thursday, expects investment in exploration and production to fall for the second straight year in 2016.Although North American oil companies have scaled back spending, their output remains high as they steer drilling rigs to the most prolific shale spots and frack wells more intensely.Production in North America and outside of OPEC is resilient because oil companies, looking to maximize cash flow, are keeping ""taps wide open,"" Kibsgaard said. ""We still expect positive movement in oil prices during 2016 with specific timing being a function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates,"" he said.Like its customers, Schlumberger has been cutting costs.The company said on Thursday it had laid off 10,000 employees in the fourth quarter, taking its total job cuts to 34,000, or 26 percent of its workforce, since November 2014. Kibsgaard, however, said he was ""optimistic"" the company would not have to cut more jobs in the current oil downturn.Schlumberger shares were up 3 percent at $63.39 in noon trading, after touching a high of $66.25 earlier. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had lost a quarter of its value in the past 12 months.

135,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS The world's biggest oilfield services company Schlumberger (SLB.N) is set to gain unconditional EU approval for its $14.8 billion bid for equipment maker Cameron International Corp CAM.N, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The acquisition will enable Schlumberger to offer a broader range of products at lower prices to oil companies, which are slashing spending in response to falling oil prices, and boost its market share.Antitrust experts have said the two U.S. companies offer complementary product lines, meaning the deal would draw less regulatory scrutiny.Schlumberger's relatively smooth passage with regulators contrasts with a larger proposed energy services tie-up, Halliburton's (HAL.N) proposed $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes (BHI.N), which has stirred worries with watchdogs on both sides of the Atlantic. It is now the target of a full-scale investigation by the European Commission because of concerns it could push up prices for oil and gas exploration in Europe.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Schlumberger spokesman Joao Felix said the company typically does not discuss merger and acquisition opportunities. Cameron International did not immediately reply to an email for comment. The EU competition enforcer is scheduled to decide on the deal by Feb. 5.U.S. antitrust regulators cleared the deal without conditions in November last year. The companies expect to close the merger in the first quarter. Schlumberger last week said it would cut 10,000 jobs in the fourth quarter amid a prolonged oil price slump.

140,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. employment gains slowed more than expected in January as the boost to hiring from unseasonably mild weather faded, but rising wages and an unemployment rate at an eight-year low suggested the labor market recovery remains firm.Non-farm payrolls increased by 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008, the Labor Department said on Friday. The payrolls gain was a sharp step-down from the average 231,000 jobs per month during the fourth quarter.""The fact that payroll gains fell back to earth is not necessarily a bad sign. Most indications are that the job market in the U.S. is on solid footing and improving,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS in Lexington, Massachusetts.Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190,000 in January and the jobless rate steady at 5 percent. The economy added 2,000 fewer jobs in November and December than previously reported.On top of a 0.5 percent jump in average hourly earnings, which was the biggest gain in a year, employers increased hours for workers. Manufacturing, which has been undermined by a strong dollar and weak global demand, added the most jobs since August 2013.Economists said the combination of strong wage growth and falling unemployment suggested a March interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve could not be completely ruled out.The dollar rose against a basket of six major currencies on the data after hitting a roughly 15-week low on Thursday. Prices for U.S. government debt initially fell, but pared losses as stocks on Wall Street extended their decline. ""The lower unemployment rate and rising wages further support the view that the labor market is doing nothing but tightening,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Clearly, there are more uncertainties today than when the Fed raised rates in December and hinted that there could be four increases this year. But the labor market is absolutely not one of them.""Tightening financial market conditions and signs that both the domestic and global economies were slowing had undercut the case for a Fed rate hike next month and lowered the probability of monetary policy tightening this year. The U.S. central bank raised its short-term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The economy, especially voters' perceptions of their job prospects, will likely be an issue in the November elections. President Barack Obama lauded the labor market progress.""This progress is finally starting to translate into bigger paychecks. The United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, however, said the economy was ""still failing the millions of Americans who have given up looking for work.""  WEATHER PAYBACK January's softer job gains were payback after the warmest temperatures in years bolstered hiring in weather-sensitive sectors like construction. January employment also lost the lift from the hiring of couriers and messengers, which was buoyed in November and December by strong online holiday sales.The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, restrained by headwinds that included the strong dollar and efforts by businesses to sell off inventory. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed the buoyant dollar cutting into exports in December, causing the trade deficit to widen 2.7 percent to $43.4 billion. In January, the unemployment rate fell even as more people entered the labor force. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. It remains near four-decade lows. Low participation could crimp job growth as the supply of labor shrinks, unless a strong rise in wages lures more people back into the labor force. The private sector accounted for all employment gains in January, adding 158,000 positions. The services sector created 118,000 jobs, the fewest in 10 months. That was because temporary help services fell 25,200 and courier and messenger employment declined by 14,400 jobs. Hiring in these categories normally rises during the holiday season.Educational services lost 38,500 jobs, but retail payrolls added a strong 57,700 positions. Hiring could slow in the months ahead after a number of retailers, including Walmart (WMT.N) and Macy's (M.N) announced dozens of store closures.The embattled manufacturing sector surprisingly added 29,000 jobs last month, while mining laid off 7,000 more workers. Mining payrolls have decreased by 146,000 since peaking in September 2014. About three-fourths of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining. Further losses are likely after a report on Thursday showed energy firms in January announced plans to lay off 20,246 workers. Oil prices have plunged about 70 percent in the last 18 months, forcing firms like oilfield services provider Schlumberger (SLB.N) to slash their workforces.Construction payrolls rose 18,000, cooling off after adding 146,000 jobs in the fourth quarter.

142,"   By Hillary Flynn and Laura Benitez  NEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 11 (IFR) - US companies are lining up euro deals that could give the moribund European corporate bond market a much needed boost after a dire start to the year.US issuers have already borrowed 2.3bn this year, around a quarter of the total euro corporate supply, and a new wave of issuers are readying deals to take advantage of lower yields and more stable spreads after the US primary market stayed shut for the fifth straight day on Thursday.Goldman Sachs tapped euros for the second time in less than a week on Wednesday, following a number of corporate issuers over the past fortnight that have sold euro deals - including oil outfit Schlumberger and industrial gases company Praxair.Bankers are now preparing potential bonds from technology and manufacturing company Honeywell, biotech group Amgen and aircraft manufacturer United Technologies, tipped to be a bumper multi-tranched bond, according to leads on the deal.A record number of US corporates issued in the euro market last year, accounting for 57bn of the 253bn issued in the European investment-grade market, according to IFR data.LOWER ALL-IN The main reason for the interest is lower yields in the euro market, which are especially appealing for US borrowers keeping funds in the single currency.That attraction could grow if the Federal Reserve embarks on more rate hikes, while at the same time the European Central Bank contemplates more easing. Marc Fratepietro, co-head of Americas investment-grade debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank, put the differential between the two currencies for some companies at up to 150bp.Schlumberger, for example, raised 600m from a three-year deal last week at a yield of 0.674% - a fraction of the 2.35% it paid on a US$1.3bn three-year sold back in December.Even higher-than-average premiums sparked by the recent volatility are not expected to deter US companies - which are more pragmatic than their European counterparts - from targeting euros.""US issuers are not as price sensitive versus secondaries as Europeans. Some print euros only once a year so they won't split hairs,"" one European DCM official said. Others point out that European spreads have held up relatively well in the recent sell-off.""In the midst of the recent market volatility dollar spreads underperformed their euro counterparts for the same issuers,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch credit analyst Yuriy Shchuchinov said in a note published Wednesday.He estimated that dollar spreads of European issuers have widened 20bp relative to euros since mid-January (adjusted for the cross-currency basis) and put the differential at 44bp, the widest since January 2015.US issuers' dollar spreads also underperformed euros, but to a smaller extent, he added. BEWARE THE BASIS However, for those companies thinking about swapping back to US dollars, the economics are not as attractive.""For a company to issue in euros and then swap it back to dollars it would cost them a lot, around 40bp on the five-year,"" another banker told IFR.Two years ago that would only have cost 8bp, and last year around 25bp.But bankers said the majority of US issuers looking to tap euros actually want the euro exposure.""Issuing in euros creates a hedge for their European businesses, because now they're match funding their European activities with their euro debt,"" the banker said.""In a world where the euro is expected to depreciate the value of the currency hedge is pretty meaningful to them.""

The company is set to embark on major new projects in the next few years, including building the replacement for Britain's Vanguard nuclear submarines.

146,"   By Diane Bartz and Ernest Scheyder  The U.S. Justice Department will file a lawsuit as soon as this week to stop oilfield services provider Halliburton Co from acquiring smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The antitrust lawsuit could potentially scupper the deal that was first announced in November 2014 to combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies. Since then, oil prices have fallen by more than 55 percent. Faced with opposition from the Justice Department, the companies may either cancel the planned tie-up or fight the government in court. The deal is one of several that antitrust enforcers have rejected as illegal during the recent wave of mergers of large, complex companies.Share prices for Baker Hughes closed down 5.1 percent at $39.36 Tuesday while Halliburton ended up 1.2 percent at $34.40.Halliburton and Baker Hughes both declined comment.The two sides had been discussing asset sales aimed at saving the deal, which was originally valued at $35 billion but is now valued at about $25 billion based on the decline in Halliburton shares.  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings.The proposed deal also has hit headwinds in Europe, where the European Union's competition authority was concerned that the proposed merger would reduce competition and innovation in more than 30 product markets. Regulators in Australia also flagged concerns about the massive tie-up.As far back as July 2015, Reuters reported that there were concerns in the U.S. government that the merger would lead to higher prices and less innovation.The Justice Department's worry then focused on two areas. One was that the drilling technology businesses that were divested would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders. The other was that the leaders would have less incentive to innovate. Baker Hughes in particular has been aggressive in developing new oilfield technologies, part of its appeal to Halliburton from the beginning. Baker Hughes developed smartphone apps to help customers in the field decide in real time how best to hydraulically fracture new wells. Furthermore, uniting Halliburton and Baker Hughes would create a dominant leader in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking.Lower oil prices had given investors hope that the companies' best path forward was together, especially as demand for their products and services evaporate as customers slashed budgets. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which enforce antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop a surprising number of deals in the past 18 months.The FTC stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc in 2015, and is currently in court fighting Staples' merger with Office Depot.The Justice Department, working with the Federal Communications Commission, stopped Comcast Corp from buying Time Warner Cable in 2015.

Shares in Ophir, which had projects in Africa and East Asia, fell as much as 25 percent on Friday, eroding the company's market value by over 160 million pounds ($233 million).Ophir CEO Nick Cooper said the company was in talks with a number of other ""quality counterparties"" that could offer funding. He did not disclose any names.Stifel analysts said Schlumberger's exit had put a question mark on the read-through value of the project, especially as the deal had fallen through after the U.S. company had done its due diligence. Fortuna, Africa's first deepwater independent floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, is one of a number of projects planned when prices were higher.The field is expected to produce 2.2 million tons per annum and Ophir currently has an 80 percent working interest in the field, according to its website.Under the head of terms agreement signed in January, Schlumberger had agreed to take a 40 percent economic interest in the project. The company would have reimbursed Ophir for half of its previous costs in the project, which was expected to help cover Ophir's share of capital expenditure up until first gas sales.""(Schlumberger's exit) raises obvious questions how Ophir can move the project forward,"" Liberum analyst Andrew Whittock told Reuters.Ophir pushed back expectations for a first investment decision on the project on Friday, saying it would take time to reach binding deals with other potential partners.A decision on first investment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first production will is expected by early 2020, the company added.It had earlier expected to make its investment decision in mid-2016, with production in 2019.Ophir shares had pared some of their earlier losses by 1000 GMT, but were still on track for their worst day ever. The stock, down 18 percent at 75 pence, was the second-largest percentage loser on London's midcap index.

""Some people thought they left because the project was not profitable. That is not the case - it was because they wanted to do everything and we cannot allow one service company to do everything,"" he said. Schlumberger was not immediately available to comment.Ophir said it was talking to a range of equity investors, as well as gas buyers, to help to finance the project.""We've done all the work in a very difficult environment to deliver a very investable project, (including) bringing down the capital costs of first gas by half to what they were 12 months ago, to $450 million, which is huge,""  Bill Higgs, Ophir's chief operating officer, said.

184,"  Schlumberger Ltd, the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider, said it expects a ""significant global supply deficit"" of crude oil, assuming steady growth in demand, given the sharp decline in spending on exploration and production.Energy companies have halved their E&P budgets since oil prices began their slump in June 2014, scaling back drilling to focus on the most prolific oil fields, a strategy called high-grading.""As the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on an earnings conference call on Friday.The IEA, which coordinates the energy policies of industrial nations, earlier this month raised its forecast for global oil demand growth by 0.1 million barrels per day (bpd) to 1.4 million bpd in 2016 and 1.3 million bpd in 2017.Schlumberger reported a better-than-expected adjusted profit for the second quarter on Thursday, and said it was considering rolling back pricing concessions. The view echoed that of smaller rival Halliburton Co, which said on Wednesday that ""deep, uneconomic pricing cuts"" would have to be reversed.""Inevitably service industry pricing has to recover and as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity, which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit,"" Kibsgaard said. Oil producers have said their ability to keep pumping oil without spending more was due to lower prices for oilfield services and better production techniques that drastically lower costs for each new well, while yielding more oil.But Kibsgaard said the low costs were not indicative of a ""permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance"", emphasizing there had be no fundamental changes in technology, quality efficiency, collaboration or the industry's business model. ""What has taken place over the past 21 months is instead a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously sitting mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supply industry.""Schlumberger's shares were down 0.7 percent at $79.43.

As a result, employees working on projects ranging from the oil-rich Maracaibo Lake to the Orinoco Belt are being laid off, workers and a union leader said, an ominous sign for Venezuela's slumping crude production and crumbling economy. ""They're getting rid of almost all the workers because they're reducing operations and the contracts won't be renovated because of debt owed by PDVSA,"" said a Schlumberger employee in Venezuela's eastern city of Maturin, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak with media. Houston-based Schlumberger declined to comment. Caracas-based PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.Ivan Freites, a union leader and fierce PDVSA critic, said some 600 workers are being fired in Zulia state, whose capital is Maracaibo, and 2,000 workers are being let go nationally. While the exact number of laid-off workers was not immediately clear, the dismissals could further stoke social unrest as Venezuelans struggle to eat three meals a day amid worsening food shortages and triple-digit inflation.Some Schlumberger workers protested the layoffs in Maracaibo on Wednesday. A worker in Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco Belt said Schlumberger had scaled back its projects and was now only working on Petropiar, a joint venture between PDVSA and U.S. oil company Chevron, and Petromonagas, a joint venture between PDVSA and Russian oil giant Rosneft.  PDVSA, exclusive operator of Venezuela's vast oilfields, has run up billions of dollars in unpaid bills to service providers as a result of cash-flow problems amid a deep recession. U.S. oil services company Halliburton Co in April also said it would begin curtailing activity in Venezuela. It also declined to comment on its scale-back.     PDVSA's president Eulogio Del Pino told Reuters in June that it was close to reaching a deal with Schlumberger to boost services again, but there have been no details on the potential agreement. Schlumberger's declining presence comes as Venezuelan oil fields suffer from lack of spare parts, a brain drain, crime, and maintenance issues.    The country's crude output fell to some 2.364 million barrels per day in June, from 2.675 million in the same month last year, according to data OPEC says was provided by Venezuela. The drop could help erode a supply glut that has weighed on prices.Of course, Schlumberger and Halliburton's dwindling operations in Venezuela could also provide opportunities for their rivals.One Schlumberger source said a PDVSA unit and Bohai Drilling Service, a unit of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), were pocketing some of the contracts.

202,"  Schlumberger Ltd, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, reported a quarterly profit that topped analysts' expectations as more oil producers put rigs back to work in North America.The company expects improved activity in onshore North American, Middle Eastern and Russian markets next year, Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on Thursday, although he warned of limited visibility into customers' investment plans for 2017.Halliburton Co, the No.2 oilfield services provider, said on Wednesday that oil prices would have to stabilize at above $50 per barrel for producers to meaningfully increase oilfield activity.Schlumberger is already seeing gains from the North American rig count, which has risen for 15 of the last 16 weeks.Excluding results from Cameron International Corp, which Schlumberger acquired earlier this year, Schlumberger's third-quarter land revenue in North America rose 14 percent from the second quarter.Higher drilling and fracturing drove the increase, Schlumberger said, adding that pricing improvements were limited as much of the increase in activity was driven by small companies. Schlumberger, which was historically tilted toward the big oil companies, has been moving ""downmarket"" to smaller producers, said Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai. The company is also gaining from a contract rider that ties service pricing to oil prices, Desai said.Global crude oil prices have risen nearly 40 percent this year and Kibsgaard said on Thursday that global crude oil supply and demand were ""now more or less balanced."" Strict cost control has helped Schlumberger offset revenue declines caused by a steep fall in exploration and production spending that eroded demand for its services. The company's pro forma revenue had slumped more than 50 percent in the previous seven quarters, Kibsgaard said, adding that the company had cut $6 billion of costs over the period.""After calling the bottom of the cycle in the second quarter of this year, our business stabilized in the third quarter."" Net profit attributable to Schlumberger fell to $176 million, or $13 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $989 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to the Cameron merger and integration, Schlumberger earned 25 cents per share, above the analysts' average estimate of 22 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell 17 percent to $7.02 billion, shy of analysts' estimate of 7.08 billion.Schlumberger's shares have gained nearly a fifth of their value this year up to Thursday's close of $82.99.
