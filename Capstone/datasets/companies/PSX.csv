0,"  Jan 29 U.S. refining company Phillips 66  said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter profit rose, topping Wall Street estimates, as refining margins were better than anticipated.The Houston-based company had a quarterly profit of $826 million, or $1.37 per share, compared with $708 million, or $1.11 per share in the same quarter a year earlier. Adjusting for certain items, Phillips 66 had a per share profit of $1.34. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.10 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts at Houston-based energy investment bank Simmons & Co said Phillips earnings beat was driven by robust refining gross margins. Still, the company's marketing, chemical and transportation and processing businesses fell short of Simmons' expectations, the firm said in a note to clients.Shares of Phillips fell to $73.01 in premarket trade from Tuesday's New York Stock Exchange close of $75.08.",2014-01-29,PSX,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 9:29am EST",UPDATE 1-Phillips 66 quarterly profit up on improved refining margins,http://www.reuters.com//article/phillips66-earnings-idUSL2N0L30WI20140129?type=companyNews

3,"  WASHINGTON, March 17 Five oil companies submitted winning bids for the 5 million barrels of crude offered in the first test sale of the U.S. strategic oil reserve in more than two decades, the U.S. Department of Energy said on Monday.     Phillips 66 bought the most oil from the auction, which wrapped up on Friday, successfully bidding on 2.04 million barrels of oil.     The Obama administration offered up 5 million barrels of sour crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve last week. Federal officials said the auction was designed to assess the country's ability to respond to changing energy markets in case of a disruption in oil supplies.      The government-owned emergency stockpile can hold up to 727 million barrels of oil in deep underground storage caverns created in salt domes under the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts.     The federal government should earn nearly $500 million dollars from the sale, based on the winning bids.     Royal Dutch Shell bought the second largest amount of oil from the sale, purchasing 1.22 million barrels, followed by Marathon Petroleum Corp, which bought 1.2 million barrels.     Exxon Mobil bought 500,000 barrels of crude in the sale, while Mercuria Energy Trading bought 40,000 barrels.     Successful bids in the auction ranged from around $95.40 a barrel to as much as $103.012 a barrel.     The DOE has said it would deliver the fuel to the buyers between April 1 and May 10.     It was the first test sale from the reserve since 1990.

4,"  * China bought first U.S. LPG in 2013* But Sinopec-Phillips 66 deal signals involvement of big oil* China now looking at using fuel to make petrochemicals* U.S. exports of LPG could roughly triple by 2020-analyst* To heat up competition with Middle East suppliers to AsiaBy Chen AizhuBEIJING, April 10 A deal between China's top refiner Sinopec Corp and Phillips 66 could be a game changer that signals the United States is on track to become one of the top suppliers of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to the world's second-biggest economy.China is the biggest consumer of LPG, a compressed mix of propane and butane, used for heating and transport, and now increasingly being considered for making petrochemicals.As demand in China soars, the U.S. shale boom has led to a surge in production of LPG, which is bringing down global prices and challenging established suppliers in the Middle East.Washington restricts exports of crude and has only slowly opening up liquefied natural gas shipments for energy security reasons, but there are no such limits on LPG sales.China's first purchases of U.S. LPG were made last year, amounting to 3,530 barrels per day, according to Chinese customs' data, in deals done by little known private firms.But marking the entry of big oil Sinopec Corp and U.S. refining company Phillips 66 struck a deal last month to supply U.S. LPG for delivery likely to start in 2016 and put by traders at about 34,000 bpd worth around $850 million at current prices.Sinopec, China's top ethylene producer, is looking at using U.S. LPG for making petrochemicals due to cheaper pricing and shortages of the traditional feedstock naphtha, a product from processing crude oil. ""The U.S. shale boom could lead to a fresh way of developing China's petrochemical sector,"" said Mao Jiaxiang, deputy head of Sinopec's research arm, China Petrochemical Consulting Corp.""We're evaluating the competitiveness of U.S. light-end feedstocks versus naphtha as a petrochemical feedstock,"" added Mao.U.S. exports of LPG could roughly triple by 2020 from last year to around 635,000-795,000 barrels per day, energy consultancy FACTS Global Energy estimated.China has lined up about 100,000 bpd of long-term U.S. LPG imports with supplies mostly starting in 2015-16, including the Sinopec deal and otherwise mainly involving smaller firms, traders said. China's total LPG imports could reach half-a-million bpd by 2020, up nearly four-fold from last year and overtaking other key Asian importers such as Singapore and Indonesia, they said.""The supply overhang of U.S. LPG...would put America in direct competition against the Middle East, vying for the China market,"" said Al Troner of Houston-based Asia Pacific Energy Consulting.Middle East suppliers such as Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia together supplied 80 percent of China's LPG imports of 132,000 bpd in 2013. PETROCHEMICAL FEEDSTOCK China is the world's largest LPG consumer, using about 874,000 bpd, though the bulk of this is for heating or transportand only 5 percent is used in the petrochemical sector.Most of China's own LPG supplies come as a by-product in refineries and normally contain olefins containing coke that can create unwanted residue in steam crackers that makes it more dirty and expensive to use as a feedstock for petrochemicals. LPG from gas fields contains no olefins.Colin Shelley of FACTS Global Energy said that China's imports had the potential to rise sharply now that LPG was being increasingly looked at as a feedstock to make petrochemicals. ""Sinopec is taking the lead. We may see CNOOC, we may also see PetroChina,"" he said.Last June, Sinopec proposed building a $3.1 billion ethylene plant in eastern China, which would be the company's first to use natural gas and LPG as a feedstock.CNOOC, parent of CNOOC Ltd, is also considering using LPG for its new 1 million tonne-per-year cracker in Guangdong province, said a company official.ATTRACTIVE PRICING Currently traders estimate U.S. LPG costs roughly $850 per tonne, $50-100 per tonne lower than Middle East supplies for May delivery to China.It is also cheaper than naphtha for China delivery at about $1,000-1,200 per tonne.The bulk of China's 100,000 bpd U.S. LPG orders is due for delivery from 2015-2016 when U.S. export facilities are completed and after an expansion of the Panama Canal to allow through bigger tankers, known as very large gas containers (VLGC), to cut the journey time to Asia by more than two weeks.LPG is transported in tankers at around minus 40 degrees Celsius, although not super-chilled to the extent of LNG at about minus 160 degree Celsius.Apart from Sinopec, other Chinese buyers of LPG are mostly private investors in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plants, which process propane into propylene, used in plastic products.China's Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry Group launched in September a 600,000 tonne-per-year PDH plant in the northern city of Tianjin, the first of about 10 such plants being built or planned to cash in on a shortage of propylene.The plants have been tying up with U.S. LPG firms such as Enterprise Product Partners and Targa Resources Corp .

5,"  NEW YORK, April 11 Phillips 66 joined a long list of companies exporting U.S. oil to Canada after it secured a license to do so last year, the company said late on Thursday.The Houston-based company does not own a refinery in Canada, unlike other exporters like Valero Energy, which sends U.S. oil to its Quebec refinery.""A Phillips 66 spokesman declined to say where in Canada its exports are headed and in what volume.  He also didn't disclose if the oil will reach its destination via rail or barges.""""As a matter of practice, Phillips 66 does not comment on commercial activity,"" spokesman Dennis Nuss said.The United States does not allow exports of its own oil, but makes exceptions such as barrels going to Canada and re-exports of foreign oil.Nonetheless, the U.S. Department of Commerce has issued 43 licenses over the last six months allowing companies to export U.S. oil for use by Canadian refineries. Earlier this year, Houston-based Phillips 66 came out in support of lifting the decades-old ban on exports. The company is among the few independent refiners advocating for exports while other refiners like Valero oppose them.Phillips 66 Chief Executive Greg Garland said on Thursday the United States is unlikely to make meaningful policy changes anytime soon, with American consumers still concerned that exports will result in higher gasoline prices. His company is making a bet on that projection. Phillips 66 plans to build a condensate splitter at its 247,000 barrels-per-day Sweeny refinery in Texas, which will allow it to process condensates into fuel components that can be exported.Last week, Enbridge Inc became the first company to confirm plans to re-export Canadian oil from the United States followed by Valero Energy.

8,"  * Profit up as focus increases on midstream and chemicals* Company ordering more railcars to keep up with crude by rail growth* Project to process more oil at Illinois refinery announced   (Adds financial details, executive comments, updates share price)By Kristen Hays and Anna DriverApril 30 Phillips 66, the second-largest independent U.S. oil refiner, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by a big gain from a share exchange and its chemicals and midstream businesses.Crude oil and natural gas pumped from shale formations in the United States have lowered feedstock costs for companies such as Phillips, which is expanding its network of pipelines and processing facilities for increasing onshore output.Phillips, based in Houston, had a first-quarter profit of $1.6 billion, or $2.67 per share, compared with $1.41 billion, or $2.23 a share, in the same quarter of 2013.Excluding a one-time gain of $706 million primarily related to Berkshire Hathaway Inc's deal to swap its Phillips 66 shares for ownership of the company's specialty products unit, Phillips 66 earned $1.47 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results topped expectations on the performance of the chemicals and midstream businesses, analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients.Earnings in the company's refining business slumped to $306 million from $904 million in the first quarter of 2013, hurt by plant maintenance and lower margins.Profit from the company's interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical company was $316 million, up 12 percent from a year earlier. MORE RAILCARS Phillips 66 is increasing its capability to receive North Dakota crude via rail at its New Jersey and West Coast refineries, and has ordered 1,200 new tank railcars to move it.That is in addition to 2,000 railcars the company received last year. A spate of fiery crude train crashes last year has increased regulatory scrutiny of the safety of the oil-by-rail movement, which has boomed in tandem with growing U.S. inland oil production.Last week Canadian regulators ordered that all tank railcars that do not meet the industry's latest safety standards adopted in October 2011 be phased out in three years, and U.S. regulators are expected to recommend similar or possibly tougher rules.Phillips 66's new fleet and the railcars on order meet the latest standard, Tim Taylor, executive vice president of  commercial, marketing, transportation and business development for Phillips 66, told analysts on Wednesday. The company also is working with contractors and shippers to ensure their fleets do the same.""Certainly we will comply, but we want them to meet the newest specification,"" he said.Also on Wednesday, Cenovus Energy Inc announced a $100 million project to expand capacity at its joint-venture 333,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in Wood River, Illinois, which Phillips 66 operates as part of the 50-50 agreement.The project, which will allow the plant to fully utilize processing capabilities after a $4 billion expansion to run more Canadian heavy crude, will start up in the first quarter of 2016.Shares of Phillips were up 4 cents at $83.79 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

10,"  EL TIGRE Venezuela May 30 Venezuela will appeal an arbitration ruling allowing refiner Phillips 66 to acquire state oil company PDVSA's 50 percent stake in a delayed coking unit at the Sweeny refinery, the oil minister said on Friday.The 70,000 barrel-per-day coking unit was originally owned by Merey Sweeny LP, a joint venture between PDVSA and Phillips.But the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration panel ruled in April that Phillips 66 could exercise its right to acquire PDVSA's 50 percent after agreeing with Phillips 66 that PDVSA had violated a supply agreement. Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez, asked about the issue at a press conference, said, ""Yes, of course, we are going to defend ourselves legally."" The Sweeny refinery in Old Ocean, Texas, was owned by ConocoPhillips until 2012, when it spun off its refining assets through the creation of Phillips 66 as a separate refining company and left ConocoPhillips as an upstream producer. ConocoPhillips filed an arbitration claim against Venezuela in 2007 at the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for the takeover of assets, including two heavy crude projects in the Orinoco Belt.It initially sought $30 billion in compensation, while Venezuela offered to pay only $2 billion.

Phillips 66 said the terminal will serve its own refineries, as well as others on the U.S. U.S. Gulf Coast, and has ""significant"" expansion potential. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter pending regulatory approvals. The companies did not disclose terms. The terminal has two marine docks capable of handling 750,000-barrel oil tankers, one barge dock, and rail and truck loading and unloading infrastructure. Its storage capacity reaches 4.7 million barrels for crude and 2.4 million barrels for refined products. It also has connections to major crude oil and product pipelines that serve 3.6 million bpd of Gulf Coast refining capacity, more than one-fifth of total U.S. capacity.

15,"   By Kristen Hays | FREEPORT  FREEPORT Texas Aug 13 Independent refiner Phillips 66 said on Wednesday it is evaluating the export of super-light crude oil known as condensate, after two industry peers received U.S. government approval to ship it overseas after minimal processing.The company declined to say if it has sought formal permission to export condensate from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is tasked with interpreting exceptions to a decades-old ban on crude exports.""We're evaluating the process and seeking a better understanding,"" Chris Chandler, Phillips 66's head of natural gas liquids (NGLs) said. ""That process is still a little unclear to us.""He spoke before the groundbreaking for the construction of a 100,000 barrel per day (bpd) fractionation plant that strips NGLs from gas and a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) export facility that will require $3 billion in investments.The facility in Freeport, Texas will sit near the Gulf Coast and is close to the company's 247,000 bpd refinery in Sweeny, which has a link to Kinder Morgan's Crude and Condensate pipeline, a 300,000 bpd line that moves crude from the Eagle Ford fields to Houston. The terminal after start up in 2016 will provide 4.4 million barrels per month of export capacity for LPGs, which include butane and propane.Asked if the export facility could potentially export condensate that has been minimally processed, Chandler said: ""This Freeport facility has a lot of expansion possibilities. It's close to the Gulf of Mexico, three miles from open water. We have the capability of doing a lot more here than we do currently.""Chief Executive Greg Garland, while cautioning further plans are still being weighed, said the company could end up spending more on energy infrastructure on the Gulf Coast. ""We're thinking of $10 billion in projects right here on the Gulf Coast,"" he said.Demand is growing for new facilities to handle surging output of oil and gas from the U.S. shale boom. That output has prompted a rise in exports of refined products and led to calls for a loosening of the ban on crude exports, especially because local refiners have limited capacity to run lighter crudes coming out of shale fields.""In the not too distant future we need to export crude. We are long light sweet crude in Texas,"" Texas Railroad Commissioner Barry Smitherman, the state's top energy regulator, said.In June, Commerce told Pioneer Natural Resources and Enterprise Product Partners they could export stabilized condensate as a refined product without a special license, which is needed to export unprocessed domestic crude.U.S. law has long defined processed oil as having passed through distillation towers, key pieces of refinery equipment that turn crude oil into finished products.But the Commerce Department said equipment known as stabilizers, traditionally used to treat crude so it meets pipeline specifications, could also be used to comply with the refining regulation.

Garland said during a webcast of a presentation at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference that the company has ordered another 500 railcars to boost its fleet to 3,700 railcars.On Aug. 1 the company's 238,000-bpd Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, received its first crude-only train at the plant's newly expanded offloading system. The system can take up to 70,000 bpd, in addition to up to 75,000 bpd from a joint venture with Global Partners. Phillips 66's 30,000-bpd offloading system at its 100,000-bpd refinery in Ferndale, Washington, is on track to start up in the fourth quarter, Garland said.Garland said the company was ""disappointed"" in the lengthy permitting process for a rail offloading project at its refinery in Santa Maria, California, but remained optimistic it would be built. The Santa Maria operates in tandem with the company's Rodeo, California, refinery, with a combined capacity of 120,200 bpd. The rail project would bring in about 40,000 bpd of heavy oil, like that produced in Canada rather than light Bakken crude, according to the company.A local planning commission meeting to consider approving the project has been pushed to January from April to allow an environmental impact report produced in late 2013 to be recirculated for more public comment. It is one of several crude-by-rail projects in California that have faced much scrutiny and lengthy permitting processes in light of several fiery crude train crashes in the past year.Next week, Kern County supervisors are expected to approve Alon USA Energy's proposed 140,000 bpd rail offloading project at its Bakersfield refinery, which has been shut since late 2012 because lack of access to cheaper inland U.S. crudes rendered the plant unprofitable.If approved as expected, it would be the first substantial new such project to win approval in California.""It just takes time in California to get these things permitted,"" Garland said.

""Our operations ran well during the third quarter, capturing strong margins in our refining and marketing businesses,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland said in a statement.The U.S. shale oil revolution has opened up a period of hefty profits for refiners that increasingly buy inexpensive inland crudes and then fetch healthy prices when selling refined products locally or exporting them around the world. The company said its realized refining margin was $10.89 a barrel and that a record 95 percent of its crude slate came from so-called advantaged U.S. crudes.Although profits at the company's chemical, midstream, and marketing units rose slightly or dipped during the quarter, earnings for the refining business climbed to $558 million from a loss of $30 million a year earlier. Shares of Phillips 66 fell 58 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $76.95 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.On a conference call, analysts focused on the company's plans for investing in the midstream business and dropping assets into a new master limited partnership.Phillips is increasingly investing in its logistics operations, which it sees as a source of growth, by adding railcars to its fleet and adding pipeline capacity.

43,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON County planners want to squash Phillips 66's proposal to transport heavy crude by rail to one of its California refineries, saying it is too risky to public health and the environment. The staff of San Luis Obispo County's planning commission this week recommended that commissioners reject the project because of ""significant and unavoidable"" impacts from toxic emissions and contaminated water to fires and explosions if trains derail or leak.That recommendation came a week before a public hearing Feb. 4-5 on whether to grant permits allowing the company to build the 41,000 barrels per day project first proposed in 2013.It is one of several rail projects on the U.S. West Coast that have undergone lengthy environmental reviews while facing heated opposition in light of fiery crude train crashes since mid-2013. ""We understand that there are concerns about the project and we look forward to addressing questions"" in the review, Phillips spokesman Dennis Nuss said on Tuesday. The Benicia Planning Commission will hold a similar hearing Feb. 8, with more if necessary, on Valero Energy Corp's proposed 70,000 bpd rail project - also delayed pending reviews - at its refinery there. Unlike other proposals that aim to receive both light inland U.S. and Canadian heavy crude via rail, the Phillips project would handle just heavy crude at its Santa Maria refinery in Arroyo Grande, California. That plant is built to process heavy oil produced in California. Once initially processed, it moves via pipeline more than 200 miles north to the company's refinery in Rodeo near San Francisco to turn into fuels. The two plants' combined capacity is 120,200 barrels per day.Phillips proposed the rail project because California oil output is shrinking and the company wanted another source of crude. The company had hoped to start up in 2014, but environmental reviews pushed final consideration of permits to 2015 and then this year.Crude by rail has declined since mid-2014 as U.S. oil prices slid more than 70 percent and discounts of domestic crude to global crudes that once topped $20 narrowed to less than $1. Cheaper domestic crude helps cover extra transportation costs of rail, but a narrow spread entices coastal refiners to take imports instead.Last month Phillips started up its own joint-venture rail loading terminal in North Dakota, shipping crude loaded on railcars from trucks to its New Jersey refinery, Nuss said.

44,"  HOUSTON U.S. oil producers, refiners and logistics companies have dozens of crude-by-rail project throughout the United States, although U.S. crude movements via rail retreated to 785,143  barrels per day in the third quarter of 2015 from more than 1 million bpd in the second half of 2014. Oil-by-rail movements started to decline in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a global supply glut sent oil prices spiraling. Discounts of domestic and Canadian heavy crudes to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate and London’s Brent narrowed sharply as well, prompting coastal refiners to take more imports with spreads too thin to absorb rail's extra transportation costs. The East and West coasts, in particular, have used rail to tap cheaper U.S. and Canadian heavy crude with no major oil pipelines in operation to move inland crude to those markets. U.S. Gulf Coast refineries built to run heavy oil also receive Canadian crude via rail, as well as domestic oil.Some, mainly on the West Coast, have faced lengthy delays and opposition.The staff of the San Luis Obispo County planning commission this week recommended rejecting permits for Phillips 66’s proposed 41,000 bpd project at its Santa Maria refinery in Arroyo Grande, California, because of “significant and unavoidable” impacts from toxic emissions, water and farmland contamination, and fires and explosions if trains derail or leak. The commission will consider permits at a two-day hearing next week.Valero Energy Corp’s proposed 70,000 bpd rail project at its San Francisco-area refinery in Benicia, California, will go before the city’s planning commission Feb. 8 in a public hearing. The commission will schedule additional meetings on Feb. 9 and 10 to hear more public comment as warranted.Both companies first proposed the projects in 2013 with hopes of startup in 2014. Lengthy environmental reviews delayed those plans.Growth of oil-by-train shipments started more than five years ago as pipeline infrastructure lagged booming U.S. and Canadian crude production. The Association of American Railroads said 785,143 bpd originated on top U.S. railroads in the third quarter of 2015, down 8.9 percent from the second quarter this year and down more than 23 percent from the peak of 1.02 million bpd in the third quarter of 2014.Oil moved by rail in the third quarter was 8.4 percent of 9.3 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s estimate of average U.S. output in 2015.Once seen as a stopgap to move crude until pipelines get built, rail became part of the transportation mix, adding flexibility for refiners to choose the best-priced crude from shale and tight oil plays rather than just rely on pipelines. Contracts are shorter, and they are not locked into specific types of crude moved from fixed points via pipeline.Here is a rundown of more than 100 U.S. rail projects, both loading at production sites and unloading at refineries and terminals:           WEST COAST                                                                                       Company Name   Type    Location      State   Capacity      Crude           Status                                                                   (bpd)                                              Tesoro Corp    Ref     Anacortes     WA      50,000        Bakken          Operational                                                                  (refinery                                                                                       120,000 bpd)                                       U.S. Oil and   Ref     Tacoma        WA      40,000        Bakken          Operational                     Refining;

45,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON County planners want to squash Phillips 66's proposal to transport heavy crude by rail to one of its California refineries, saying it is too risky to public health and the environment. The staff of San Luis Obispo County's planning commission this week recommended that commissioners reject the project because of ""significant and unavoidable"" impacts from toxic emissions and contaminated water to fires and explosions if trains derail or leak.That recommendation came a week before a public hearing Feb. 4-5 on whether to grant permits allowing the company to build the 41,000 barrels per day project first proposed in 2013.It is one of several rail projects on the U.S. West Coast that have undergone lengthy environmental reviews while facing heated opposition in light of fiery crude train crashes since mid-2013. ""We understand that there are concerns about the project and we look forward to addressing questions"" in the review, Phillips spokesman Dennis Nuss said on Tuesday. The Benicia Planning Commission will hold a similar hearing Feb. 8, with more if necessary, on Valero Energy Corp's proposed 70,000 bpd rail project - also delayed pending reviews - at its refinery there. Unlike other proposals that aim to receive both light inland U.S. and Canadian heavy crude via rail, the Phillips project would handle just heavy crude at its Santa Maria refinery in Arroyo Grande, California. That plant is built to process heavy oil produced in California. Once initially processed, it moves via pipeline more than 200 miles north to the company's refinery in Rodeo near San Francisco to turn into fuels. The two plants' combined capacity is 120,200 barrels per day.Phillips proposed the rail project because California oil output is shrinking and the company wanted another source of crude. The company had hoped to start up in 2014, but environmental reviews pushed final consideration of permits to 2015 and then this year.Crude by rail has declined since mid-2014 as U.S. oil prices slid more than 70 percent and discounts of domestic crude to global crudes that once topped $20 narrowed to less than $1. Cheaper domestic crude helps cover extra transportation costs of rail, but a narrow spread entices coastal refiners to take imports instead.Last month Phillips started up its own joint-venture rail loading terminal in North Dakota, shipping crude loaded on railcars from trucks to its New Jersey refinery, Nuss said.

46,"  (Adds quotes, details about project)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON Jan 29 Phillips 66 may consider increasing its 25 percent stake in Energy Transfer Partners'  pipeline project to move North Dakota Bakken oil to Illinois and Texas, but likes its current commitment as is, President Tim Taylor told analysts on Friday.Energy Transfer on Wednesday said it was evaluating  financing of its $4.78 billion Bakken pipeline, and that measure would ""materially reduce the direct spending required"" for it. Energy Transfer said its 2016 growth capital funding had already been reduced by $750 million to $4.2 billion from last November's projections. Energy Transfer and its subsidiary, Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, can further reduce their overall 2016 capital funding by shrinking required spending on the project.Taylor said during Phillips 66's quarterly earnings call that their partners on the project have ""been exploring various options,"" and the company may consider increasing its stake but ""our commitment is where we would like it to be at this point."" The project involves two legs: the new 1,168-mile (1,879 km) North Dakota-to-Illinois Dakota Access Pipeline; and the 744-mile (1,197 km) Illinois-to-Texas Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline, mostly a natural gas line converted to move oil.The first line can connect to other pipelines at the Patoka, Illinois hub, while the second line will move crude to Sunoco's Nederland, Texas terminal, near Phillips 66's Beaumont terminal. Taylor said the company could take Bakken crude moved to Texas on the new system, load it onto tankers and ship it to Phillips 66's New Jersey refinery. That refinery receives Bakken crude via rail, but the roundabout pipeline/ship route is ""very competitive"" with rail, he said.Oil-by-rail has fallen as discounts of domestic compared to global crudes narrowed sharply in the global oil rout, eroding profitability of moving it by train.Taylor wouldn't say how much cheaper the pipeline/tanker option was other than the cost was ""substantially less than rail.""

55,"  ConocoPhillips (COP.N) slashed its quarterly dividend for the first time in at least 25 years and further lowered its capital budget for 2016 as a relentless fall in crude oil prices took its toll on the largest U.S. independent oil company.Shares of ConocoPhillips, which reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, fell 4 percent to $37.08.Global crude oil prices have dropped about 70 percent from their 2014 high of over $100 barrel, eroding profitability at nearly all oil producers and limiting their ability to award shareholders cash.Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world's largest publicly traded oil company, reported its smallest quarterly profit in more than a decade on Tuesday and said it would slow share buybacks. Noble Energy Inc. (NBL.N) cut its dividend last week.With oil prices now hovering at about $30 barrel, producers are cutting investments in new wells and projects, triggering another large wave of spending curbs.ConocoPhillips on Thursday lowered its 2016 capital expenditure target by 17 percent to $6.4 billion, and its operating cost forecast by 9 percent to $7 billion.The reduction is the second in two months. ConocoPhillips also trimmed its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 74 cents. That is the first reduction since at least 1991, according to the web site of the company, which split from refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) in 2012, assuring investors of faster dividend growth.""We believe it's prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time,"" Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in a statement.The dividend cut and lowered spending will help ConocoPhillips add $4.4 billion to net cash flow in 2016, he said.     The company said it expects 2016 production to be unchanged  from 2015, excluding the impact of asset sales. It produced 1.589 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mmboe/d) in 2015.     ConocoPhillips forecast current-quarter output of 1.54-1.58 mmboe/d, lower than the 1.599 mmboe/d it produced from continuing operations in the fourth quarter.

58,"  (Repeats story that was published Wednesday)By Catherine Ngai and Liz HamptonNEW YORK/HOUSTON Feb 10 U.S. refiner Phillips 66 dumped crude for immediate delivery in Cushing, Oklahoma on Wednesday, sparking speculation that the move reflected advance warning of looming output cuts amid sluggish winter demand and record inventories.The unusual sales of excess oil added pressure to the March/April WTI futures spread CLc1-CLc2, with the front-month discount widening to as much as $2.37 a barrel on Wednesday, the most since November.It was unclear how many barrels one of the largest U.S. independent refiners sold, but three traders confirmed at least two deals traded at negative $2.50 and $2.75 a barrel. Two sources said a second refiner was also looking to offload barrels but transactions were not confirmed.A company spokesman said that it does not comment on market rumors or speculation.These deals drew notice among traders, who said the prices were distressed and the timing unusual. The so-called cash roll, which allows traders to roll long positions forward, typically trades in the three days following the expiry of the prompt futures contract. The trading period for February-March contracts concluded almost three weeks ago.Since then, however, oversupply has pressured refined products prices lower, and now some grades of crude are yielding negative cracking margins, traders say.""Midwest margins turned negative after operating expenses last week and forward cracks suggest margins will remain in the doldrums for some time,"" said Dominic Haywood, an analyst for Energy Aspects in London.Planned maintenance in the industry may not be enough to offer any respite, he added. U.S. Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday showed inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub hit a record 64.7 million barrels last week - just 8 million barrels shy of its theoretical limit - stoking concerns that tanks may overflow in coming weeks.But Midwest refinery utilization rates fell by 1.8 percentage points to 95.6 percent in the week ended Feb. 5, the EIA reported.Midwest refiners ran their facilities near full tilt for much of January, averaging more than 96 percent capacity utilization compared with just under 91 percent last year, inundating the region with stocks of gasoline and distillates. One trader described the market as a ""bloodbath.""If Phillips 66 does cut refinery runs, it would be the third refiner to capitulate amid record gasoline inventories and negative margins.Earlier on Wednesday, sources said Delta Air Lines'  Monroe Energy refinery near Philadelphia had decided to cut output by 10 percent at its 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery due to economic reasons.On Tuesday, sources said that Valero Energy Corp was planning to cut gasoline production at its 180,000 bpd Memphis, Tennessee, refinery by about 25 percent.Phillips 66 operates three refineries in the U.S. Midwest, including its 306,000 bpd Wood River refinery in Roxana, Illinois; a 200,000 bpd refinery in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and a 146,000 bpd refinery in Borger, Texas.""Ponca pulls crude from Cushing and likely uses Cushing tanks for storage or blending. You need somewhere to put the crude if you're cutting runs,"" Haywood added.

These deals drew notice among traders, who said the prices were distressed and the timing unusual. The so-called cash roll, which allows traders to roll long positions forward, typically trades in the three days following the expiry of the prompt futures contract. The trading period for February-March contracts concluded almost three weeks ago.Since then, however, oversupply has pressured refined products prices lower, and now some grades of crude are yielding negative cracking margins, traders say. ""Midwest margins turned negative after operating expenses last week and forward cracks suggest margins will remain in the doldrums for some time,"" said Dominic Haywood, an analyst for Energy Aspects in London.Planned maintenance in the industry may not be enough to offer any respite, he added.U.S. Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday showed inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub hit a record 64.7 million barrels last week - just 8 million barrels shy of its theoretical limit - stoking concerns that tanks may overflow in coming weeks. But Midwest refinery utilization rates fell by 1.8 percentage points to 95.6 percent in the week ended Feb. 5, the EIA reported.Midwest refiners ran their facilities near full tilt for much of January, averaging more than 96 percent capacity utilization compared with just under 91 percent last year, inundating the region with stocks of gasoline and distillates.One trader described the market as a ""bloodbath.""If Phillips 66 does cut refinery runs, it would be the third refiner to capitulate amid record gasoline inventories and negative margins.  Earlier on Wednesday, sources said Delta Air Lines' Monroe Energy refinery near Philadelphia had decided to cut output by 10 percent at its 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery due to economic reasons.On Tuesday, sources said that Valero Energy Corp was planning to cut gasoline production at its 180,000 bpd Memphis, Tennessee, refinery by about 25 percent.Phillips 66 operates three refineries in the U.S. Midwest, including its 306,000 bpd Wood River refinery in Roxana, Illinois; a 200,000 bpd refinery in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and a 146,000 bpd refinery in Borger, Texas.

61,"   By Liz Hampton and Osamu Tsukimori | HOUSTON/TOKYO  HOUSTON/TOKYO Japan will receive a U.S. crude cargo in May, its second such purchase from the United States since Washington lifted a four-decade ban on crude exports, industry sources said on Wednesday.This will follow the arrival in April of Japan's first crude cargo from the United States, bought by Cosmo Oil Co earlier this year, indicating a growing willingness among Asian refiners to experiment with new grades as they seek to diversify their feedstock sources away from the Middle East.The May shipment will be from Phillips 66, said the sources, who did not want to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media. Phillips 66 has sold a Panamax-sized cargo likely to Japan's TonenGeneral, they added. The U.S. firm could not be reached for a comment, while a spokesman for the Japanese refiner declined to comment.Japan usually gets more than 80 percent of its crude from the Middle East. But Cosmo and TonenGeneral, which have bought U.S. condensate previously, are among the more adventurous Asian buyers who are willing to experiment with new grades. [O/JAPAN1] Chinese refiner Sinopec Corp has also bought U.S. crude, to be loaded from a Gulf Coast port in March.ACTIVE SELLER  To meet this rising demand, Phillips 66 has been actively marketing U.S. crude to Asian buyers since Washington lifted the export ban, joining a string of trading houses who are taking advantage of the relatively new arbitrage.However, the U.S. crude's economics or whether it is more competitively priced than oil from the Middle East can only be determined after it is processed at refineries, one source said. Phillips 66 has likely shipped out its first U.S. crude cargo, which is set to arrive into Singapore next month, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.Phillips 66 has also been planning to co-load U.S. crude with Colombian grade Castilla for Asia, although it is unclear if it has found any buyers for such a cargo, a Singapore-based trader said.In addition to U.S. crude, Phillips 66 has been marketing Black Hawk condensate and it also regularly sells heavy naphtha from the United States to Asia, traders said.

64,"  (Recasts and adds explanation for shutdown of units)By Jarrett RenshawNEW YORK, April 5 The sudden closure of the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada has forced Phillips 66  to shut several units at its Illinois refinery, sources said on Tuesday, as the ripple effects of disrupting one of the largest U.S. import lines spread.TransCanada Corp said it had shut its 590,000 barrel per day (bpd) Keystone pipeline system, which carries light and heavy crude from Alberta to Cushing, Oklahoma, and into Texas, on Saturday due to a potential leak in South Dakota. It told shippers the line may not resume operating until Friday.Company work crews are still investigating the leak, as is the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Although U.S. cash crude traders said the outage was having a limited impact on markets given expectations the line would quickly resume operating, at least one big refinery that relies heavily on Keystone was feeling the effect.Phillips' Wood River, Illinois, plant has shut down a 64,000 bpd sour crude unit and a 16,000 bpd coker due to the disruption in supply, two sources told Reuters. A day ago it had cut production rates at the 306,000 bpd refinery, although it has since restored full operations at other units. The company also advanced some planned work on the units during the shutdown, which could extend beyond the restart of the pipeline, the sources said. The plant imported nearly 200,000 bpd of heavy sour Canadian crude last year, according to U.S. government data.Phillips 66 confirmed that it cut rates at the refinery to deal with the pipeline issues, but declined to discuss or confirm the shutdown of the units. ""At this time we are still meeting product supply commitments to our customers in the region,"" Phillips 66 said.Canadian heavy crude differentials widened on Monday on news of the pipeline shut down. Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery in Hardisty, Alberta, last traded on Monday at $13.90 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. That compares with a settlement of $13.30 per barrel below the benchmark on Friday.The prices are holding at the same level today, traders say.

65,"  (Repeats story with no changes to text)By Jarrett RenshawNEW YORK, April 20 Phillips 66 has purchased a cargo of Algerian crude oil for its Bayway refinery in New Jersey for the first time since 2013, two sources said, the latest U.S. refiner on the East Coast to shun domestic crudes in favor of cheaper imports.The rare shipment suggests East Coast refiners are ramping up efforts that started in the past year to shift to a diet of foreign crudes as the era of cheaper domestic supplies continues to fade.A Panamax-sized vessel named Energy Century carrying about 433,000 barrels of Saharan Blend crude oil arrived in New York Harbor on Monday after leaving the Algerian port of Skikda on March 29, according to Reuters Eikon shipping data.BP was listed as the charterer, shipping records show.The oil, which is very similar to U.S. Bakken crude, is headed to the 238,000 barrel-per-day Bayway refinery owned by one of the biggest U.S. independent refiners, according to two sources familiar with the plant's operations. Phillips 66 declined to comment. Sarah Emerson, a managing principal at ESAI Energy LLC, says the return of Algerian crude to the East Coast was expected given the collapse of the discount U.S. crude once enjoyed against Brent, the global benchmark.Low prices make it nearly impossible for U.S. shale producers with crude that has to travel thousands of miles by rail to compete with foreign crude, which costs less to ship.""Price dictates the flow of oil,"" Emerson said.The move marks a return of Algerian crude after years of being shunned from one of the world's biggest energy markets as the U.S. shale revolution made it cheaper to buy locally. Phillips 66 has also routine crude deliveries from Canada and West African nations such as Gabon and Angola, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).Phillips 66, like other East Coast refiners, built rail terminals to unload Bakken crude flowing from North Dakota.Miles of trains flowed to the East Coast daily as Bakken traded at a deep discount to Brent, but the discount has vanished in recent months amid the prolonged oil rout, and so have the trains as they have imported more. For Phillips 66, it is the first purchase of Algerian crude for its Bayway refinery since December 2013, according to the EIA.The last time Algerian crude was imported to the East Coast was in July 2014, EIA data shows.Before the U.S. shale revolution, Algerian crude was a mainstay on the East Coast. In 2012, more than 15 million barrels, or roughly 40,000 barrels per day (bpd), were imported to the East Coast.Overall, U.S. rail traffic of crude oil and other petroleum products is down 21 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same stretch last year, according to the American Association of Railroads.The East Coast imported 807,000 bpd in January, the highest monthly total since September, according to the latest data from EIA.(Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Alan Crosby)",2016-04-20,PSX,"Wed Apr 20, 2016 | 7:00am EDT","RPT-Once a mainstay, Algerian crude returns to U.S. East Coast",http://www.reuters.com//article/phillips-66-crude-usa-idUSL2N17M29Y?type=companyNews

68,"  (Recasts throughout with quotes, details about margins, gasoline output)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON, April 29 Independent refiner Phillips 66 is looking to a buoyant  summer driving season and distillate export demand to lift profits squashed by swollen inventories and dismal margins in the first quarter, executives told analysts on Friday.Phillips, the nation's fourth-largest refiner, reported more than a 40 percent drop in profit from the prior year as weak margins squeezed most divisions. It also has substantial operations in energy logistics and chemicals.But since March, gasoline margins have improved and distillate margins are ""relatively stable,"" President Tim Taylor said during the company's quarterly earnings call. Executives expect strong U.S. summer gasoline demand to  reduce brimming stocks and support high refinery rates, while ""good"" demand in China, India, West Africa and Latin America can siphon distillate inventory overhang, he said.""The summer driving season, that's going to drive the overall refinery utilization and certainly drives our thinking,"" Taylor said.Other refiners stung by lower first-quarter profits or losses after a robust 2015 also expect a rebound from the summer driving season, when gasoline demand is at its seasonal highest. The industry is experiencing fallout from running plants at high rates through January, filling storage tanks when gasoline demand was seasonally low.Phillips, like others, shifted to making as much gasoline as possible because the warm winter and economic uncertainty depressed distillate demand, pushing crack spreads to their lowest since 2010, Chief Executive Greg Garland said. By February gasoline margins retreated as demand lagged brimming stocks, prompting many refiners - Phillips included - to reduce output and try to rebalance markets.""We ran really hard in January and we slowed down in February. That is really the story,"" Garland said.He said Phillips expects its plants to keep running as much gasoline as possible for the rest of the year, about 43 percent and 45 percent of overall output.""I think we pretty much are running what we can,"" he said.

79,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. diesel futures have soared about 40 percent in the last two months, prompting independent refiners to pounce, selling future output on the view that resurgent domestic demand and higher exports may turn out to provide only a brief boost.The surprise rally in U.S. diesel futures has put prices on track for their biggest quarterly percentage gain in seven years. Money managers and hedge funds have invested heavily in the fuel as stronger-than-expected demand has helped draw down record inventories.Diesel typically enjoys strong seasonal demand in these months from farmers fueling tractors and equipment during the spring planting season. But prices this year have gotten an extra boost from robust exports to Europe and Latin America.Strikes in France have slashed European supplies for almost two weeks, boosting demand for U.S. diesel. But the announcement that one French refinery would restart hit U.S. diesel margins on Thursday. The distillate crack spread had jumped 7 percent, then gave up most of the day's gains.Refiners such as Valero Energy Corp and Phillips 66 typically look for big price rallies to sell future output. These refiners were presented with a rare opportunity to lock in profits when diesel prices and margins popped in April and May.Producer short positions in NY Harbor Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) have soared to levels not seen since November 2010, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.Refining margins, represented by the U.S. diesel crack spread, have jumped by about 70 percent since early April and are on track for their biggest quarterly percentage gain since 2013. Margins widened to $14.94 on Thursday, their highest since mid-February, but then gave back most of the day's gains on the French refinery announcement.Locking in $13 to $14 per barrel of profit through the rest of 2016 was better than the single-digit margins earlier this year, a trader at a U.S. East Coast refiner said. But they remain a far cry from the record hit in 2012, which exceeded $45 a barrel. ""Refiners are systematic, because they need to lock in margin,"" said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group. ""Anytime there's an uptick in a crack or a margin they're going to capitalize on it.""The rally could fade if hedging gathers pace and speculative buying wanes.In a further sign of selling into next year, the average for the 12 futures contracts expiring in 2017, called the calendar strip, has not kept pace with gains in this year's prices. Since early April, the 2017 strip has risen 21 percent to $1.64. Over the same period, the 2016 strip has gained about 29 percent, while the front-month contract has jumped about 40 percent. The picture for refiners has improved dramatically since the bleak outlook this winter, after margins fell as low as $8 a barrel in late January. Soon after that, many refiners shut capacity due to weak profits because of a big glut in diesel. But refiners are skeptical that margins will remain strong, because U.S. crude is on track for its biggest quarterly percentage gain since 2009. Fear for tighter margins going forward has encouraged them to hedge.The heightened activity in diesel is surprising for this time of year, when typically the market buzz surrounds gasoline, heading into the busy summer driving season. INVENTORY DRAWS Speculative investors turned bullish on diesel early in May for the first time in about two years, after inventories that had been bloated by a mild winter started to decline.Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, have now fallen for seven weeks straight, hitting the lowest level last week since early December 2015, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.

90,"  (Adds estimated deal value, refinery details, updates share price; changes dateline)By Allison Lampert and Jessica Resnick-AultMONTREAL/NEW YORK Aug 3 Irving Oil said on Wednesday it agreed to buy Ireland's only refinery from Phillips 66, scooping it up at a discount in a deal that will extend the Canadian company's reach across the Atlantic.The value of the deal, expected to close by the end of the third quarter, was not disclosed in a news release from Irving, which operates Canada's largest refinery in the province of New Brunswick. Irving did not respond to a request for comment, but two people familiar with the transaction said the refinery had sold for less than $90 million.The closely held Canadian company, controlled by the billionaire Irving family, will take full ownership of the Whitegate refinery near Cork, Ireland. Irving said it will maintain Whitegate's existing work force, which includes 160 employees as well as many contract workers. ""It gives them a product terminal asset that could be valuable: Ireland still has need for refined product, whether it's produced locally or imported,"" said John Auers, executive vice president of Turner, Mason & Co, a consultancy in Dallas. ""It gives them some assets across the Atlantic in a market where they're already present and export diesel already.""The east coasts of the U.S. and Canada and parts of Western Europe and the UK form a single Atlantic-basin refining market.Decreased refining capacity in the region, as other plants have shuttered or cut operations, may allow Irving to operate the refinery more profitably in the long-run, according to refining experts. Phillips 66 had made repeated attempts to sell the refinery since it first put it up for sale in 2013, but poor refining margins had dampened interest.Previous attempts to divest the plant in 2003 and 2007 were unsuccessful, despite interested bidders during the high refining margins seen in 2007. Phillips shares closed up 3.3 percent on Wednesday at $78.66 on the New York Stock Exchange.Irving said Whitegate can process up to 75,000 barrels of crude oil per day and produces transportation and heating fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene. Its gasoline production is 15,000 barrels a day, and it makes 30,000 barrels a day of refined fuel, Phillips 66 spokesman Dennis Nuss said.The refinery is not a sophisticated plant, and scores 4.2 on the Nelson complexity scale, a metric for evaluating refineries' ability to process crude into gasoline. That is significantly below the average 11.4 complexity of the Phillips system in total.(Reporting By Allison Lampert and Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by W Simon and Tom Brown)",2016-08-03,PSX,"Wed Aug 3, 2016 | 4:44pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Canada's Irving Oil to buy Irish refinery from Phillips 66,http://www.reuters.com//article/phillips-66-refinery-irving-idUSL1N1AK1CU?type=companyNews

Marathon will pay $500 million for its smaller share.""This will provide our shippers the ultimate potential to reach the eastern USGC (United States Gulf Coast), which has been a strategic priority for us,"" Guy Jarvis, Enbridge's executive vice president for liquids pipelines, said in a statement.    The Bakken Pipeline System is made up of two pipeline projects - the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline - both of which are expected to be in service by year end. The deal involves the Enbridge-Marathon joint venture paying $2 billion to Energy Transfer Partners (ETP.N) and Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL.N) for a 49 percent stake in the holding company that owns 75 percent of the system.   Phillips 66 (PSX.N) owns the remaining 25 percent of the Bakken Pipeline System.

Irving said it will maintain Whitegate's existing workforce, which includes 160 employees as well as many contract workers. Phillips 66 had made repeated attempts to sell the refinery since it first put it up for sale in 2013, but poor refining margins had dampened interest. Phillips shares rose 2.2 percent on Wednesday morning to $77.85 on the New York Stock Exchange. Irving said Whitegate can process up to 75,000 barrels of crude oil per day and produces transportation and heating fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene.

That $1.5 billion deal, if successful, will leave Sandpiper without Marathon as its main anchor, even though an Enbridge spokesman said plans for the line are still being evaluated. The project involves two pipeline legs stretching from North Dakota through Minnesota to Wisconsin.Outgoing pipeline capacity from the Bakken is currently at around 641,000 bpd, according to Genscape. Once Dakota Access becomes operational, capacity will rise to 1.21 million bpd.That projected increase comes against the backdrop of a dramatic decline in oil prices that has weighed on production in North Dakota's Bakken play, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the boom in U.S. shale production over the last several years.The Dakota Access Pipeline, slated to stretch from North Dakota to Illinois, is expected to come online in the fourth quarter. With global oil futures down by 70 percent in the last two years, traders and analysts say there just is not enough crude in production in the U.S. Midwest for both pipelines. According to the North Dakota Industrial Commission, the state's oil production fell to 1.05 million bpd in May, down from a peak of 1.23 million bpd in December 2014. Drillers have cut the number of rigs operating in North Dakota to 27, according to Baker Hughes, down from a peak of 203 in June 2012.   Shippers in the North Dakota area already have the Double H and Pony Express pipeline to carry crude to other markets, and the Dakota Access Pipeline will increase competition for supply. ""This reflects falling production in the Bakken.

Dakota Access, owned by Energy Transfer Partners, Sunoco Logistics and Phillips 66, will be able to transport North Dakota crude to Patoka, Illinois, giving shippers access to markets in the Midwest, East Coast and Gulf Coast. With oil hovering near $40 a barrel and narrow pricing differentials between regions, concerns about overcapacity are hitting midstream operators in numerous parts of the country, even in shale plays more economical than the Bakken.

104,"   By Catherine Ngai | NEW YORK  NEW YORK With the U.S. government siding in favor of Native American protests against a key North Dakota pipeline, local oil producers and shippers are facing the possibility of greater delays in getting a quick route to ship oil to the Gulf of Mexico.On Friday, following ongoing protests from environmentalists and Native American tribes, the U.S. Justice Department asked operators of the Dakota Access pipeline to suspend construction along a 40-mile (64 km) stretch in North Dakota, just minutes after a U.S. district court said construction could resume. The 1,100-mile (1,770 km), $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline was originally expected to start up later this year, to deliver more than 470,000 barrels per day of crude from North Dakota's prolific Bakken shale play through Illinois and toward  refinery row in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Should the pipeline be delayed for a substantial period, it would affect producers who had counted on demand for oil to be rapidly shipped to the U.S. Gulf, as well as shippers who could find themselves stuck with crude, putting them at risk of unloading it at a loss. The primary owner of the Dakota Access pipeline is Energy Transfer Partners. Shares of that company's stock fell 3.6 percent on Friday, sliding after the Justice Department's statement. Dakota Access LLC, a unit of ETP, declined to comment on Friday. It is unclear what the workaround will be if it is unable to build on the current route, though such reroutes can be costly. Other North American pipelines have in the past been rerouted in response to protests.Brigham McCown, the former head of the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) under George W. Bush, said that reroutes can be fairly expensive, particularly if it needs to be moved substantially away from the locale of a dispute.""It could delay a project by years. If you’re moving the pipeline to an area that’s far enough, you may need to go through the regulatory process gain and get permits like ones for water and endangered species. It takes time,"" McCown said.  For the oil industry, the problems are not limited just to constructing the pipeline. Shippers with long-term contracts have already started buying the oil for delivery later this year - known as line fill - ahead of the expected startup, according to a source familiar with pipeline operations. Line fill refers to the amount of barrels that move through a pipeline constantly in order to maintain pressure and flow. Trading sources estimate that line fill from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast will be some 8 million barrels altogether. The anticipated extra demand helped boost Bakken prices this week to a three-month high, trading at about 35 cents a barrel discount to U.S. crude futures. A year ago, they were trading at $1.75 a barrel discount to U.S. crude. It was anticipated that these barrels would be moved to the Gulf through the new, swift route via Illinois - rather than the more arduous rail routes to the East and West Coasts, or through pipelines in the Rocky Mountains en route to Oklahoma and eventually Texas. ""In the absence of a new alternative, (Bakken) crude will have to use the existing infrastructure to move,"" said Sandy Fielden, the director of research for commodities and energy at Morningstar. The lack of pipeline infrastructure creates a problem for shippers. There is little commercial storage available in North Dakota, so storing large volumes is not a possibility. Shippers may have no choice but to sell off the oil at a loss, transport it via more expensive rail routes, or move crude through already-crowded pipelines to the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.  That would hurt cash-strapped Bakken producers already dealing with the two-year global oil market rout, because of competitive prices from foreign imports. ""Producers will have to take lower prices to compete with imports,"" said Fielden.About 1 million barrels of oil were produced daily in North Dakota in June. The U.S. Justice Department, in its statement, said it will not allow construction of the pipeline on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land bordering the Lake Oahe area, the site of the main protests.While work remains uncertain in North Dakota, construction continues in all other parts of the state and in other states. The Dakota Access pipeline is also owned by Phillips 66 and Sunoco Logistics Partners. Last month, Enbridge Inc said it had formed a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum Corp to take a minority stake in the pipeline.

110,"   By Liz Hampton | HOUSTON  HOUSTON North Dakota oil producers were dealt another blow this week when Royal Dutch Shell said it would scrap plans to build an oil train terminal in Washington state that would have taken over 400,000 barrels per week of Bakken and other inland crudes.Shell's move on Thursday comes at a bad time for Bakken producers, who have endured a two-year price rout and need new routes to move their oil to coastal refineries.Inland North American producers have seen four projects stymied since September, owing to both environmental opposition and an oversupplied global oil market that make it easier and cheaper to import cargoes than transport inland crude thousands of miles on railcars.On Wednesday, San Luis Obispo, California, city planners rejected a rail terminal proposed by Phillips 66, two weeks after the city council of Benicia rejected Valero Energy's proposed 70,000 barrel per day (bpd) facility.Not long before that, protests by Native Americans worried about environmental impact prompted the U.S. government to halt work on the 470,000 bpd Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which would take North Dakota oil to the Midwest and Gulf Coast.The potential loss of takeaway capacity on DAPL and a drop in West Coast demand could spell more pain for producers in the Bakken, where output has fallen by more than 15 percent on the prolonged rout in oil prices. ""This development (with Shell), along with the developments regarding the DAPL, will hurt Bakken producers' netbacks,"" Sarp Ozkan, a senior energy market analyst with Denver-based Ponderosa Advisors, said in reference to profits.  Shell said the conditions of the global crude market and a tight capital environment made its project uneconomic.Shell's rail facility would have connected to an existing rail line and supplied Shell's 145,000 bpd Anacortes refinery with light crude from North Dakota.Phillips 66 this week said it is considering appealing the City Planning Commission's decision.Current pipeline and refining capacity out of the Bakken is around 851,000 bpd, and about 60 percent of its output leaves the region on pipeline, according to the state's pipeline authority. Nearly all of the rest goes by rail, which has loading capacity around 1.52 million bpd. Despite the latest setbacks, Jonathan Garrett, a principal analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said low prices are still a bigger concern for North Dakota producers than transportation.""The biggest challenge to the Williston Basin right now isn't transportation, it's oil prices. Takeaway capacity is a concern but that's not going to be the thing that makes the Williston Basin a difficult place to operate,"" he said. Benchmark U.S. oil prices have jumped by more than $6 per barrel in the last week following news that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reached an agreement to curb supply, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures settling above $50 per barrel on Thursday. Higher oil prices could unleash a wave of supply from the Bakken, which as of June had more than 700 drilled-but-uncompleted wells, more than any other major shale region in the United States, according to data from Wood Mackenzie.Bakken discounts to WTI have narrowed sharply since 2013, and in early October were at about $1.That is good for Bakken producers, but makes paying for costly rail too expensive for West Coast refiners.Railed volumes entering the West Coast from the Midwest fell to around 106,000 barrels per day this summer, off 43 percent from a peak in November 2015, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

111,"   By Liz Hampton and Valerie Volcovici | HOUSTON/WASHINGTON  HOUSTON/WASHINGTON The top executive at the company behind the embattled Dakota Access Pipeline has donated more than $100,000 to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump since June, according to campaign finance disclosure records.The donations by Kelcy Warren, chairman and chief executive officer at pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners, support the candidate seen by many as more likely to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry than his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.Warren donated $300 to the Trump campaign during the primaries, and $2,700 to Trump during the general election phase of the campaign, for the maximum contribution allowed by a single individual during an election. He also gave $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that includes the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee, the Republican Party of Arkansas and the Connecticut Republican Party. The donations, first reported by the British newspaper The Guardian, were made before the U.S. government halted construction on a segment of Energy Transfer Partners' 1,100-mile (1,770-km) Dakota Access Pipeline in early September following protests by Native American and environmental groups.  The project, which would move oil from the highly productive Bakken shale formation to the Midwest and Gulf Coast, sparked violent clashes between security officers near the construction site and Native American tribe members and other protesters. Opponents have said the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and pollute the area's drinking water. Warren has also given $66,800 to the Republication National Committee since Trump secured the nomination for the Nov. 8 election, The Guardian reported.Trump has not yet taken a position on the Dakota Access Pipeline, but supports the development of oil and gas and related infrastructure, including pipelines. Asked about Trump's position on the Dakota Access Pipeline in a policy debate this week, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the candidate's main energy advisers, declined to answer, saying he did not want to get ahead of Trump.He added, ""I'm not sure he (Trump) is aware of it.""  If elected, Trump in his first 100 days will ask TransCanada to renew its permit application for the Keystone XL Pipeline, according to his campaign website. U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposed pipeline from Canada last November.Trump has holdings in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66, a joint owner of the Dakota Access Pipeline, through mutual funds, according to financial disclosure records.U.S. oil and gas industry workers have contributed slightly more to Clinton, with employees giving $114,141 to the Democratic candidate and $99,302 to Trump since July, according to a Reuters review of federal campaign finance disclosures.

120,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A Nebraska nonprofit on Friday said it will propose that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) sell its investments in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) and other companies involved in fossil fuels over 12 years.The Nebraska Peace Foundation, which focuses on anti-war, civil rights and environmental issues, said it submitted a formal proposal for Berkshire shareholders to consider at the Omaha-based conglomerate's annual meeting next May 6.Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the proposal, which was reported earlier by the Associated Press.The nonprofit would face an uphill battle absent support from Buffett, who commands nearly one-third of Berkshire's voting power.In April, shareholders including Buffett defeated its proposal that Berkshire report on the risks that climate change posed for its insurance businesses. Buffett called that proposal unnecessary, and only 11 percent of the votes cast favored it.The nonprofit said its fossil fuels proposal reflects the need to reduce greenhouse gases and shift toward renewable energy, without endangering Berkshire's near-term profitability.It said the proposal would not cover businesses that Berkshire owns outright, including several utilities and the chemical company Lubrizol. Instead, it would cover investments such as Berkshire's nearly $7 billion stake in Phillips 66, and its recently sold stake in Canada's Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO).Buffett owns about 18 percent of Berkshire. Forbes magazine on Friday estimated his net worth at $71.7 billion. The Suncor sale ""reinforces our faith about what Warren Buffett can do about this,"" Tim Rinne, state coordinator for Nebraskans for Peace, with which the foundation is affiliated, said in an interview.""He's a huge philanthropist, he's an international icon and he's extraordinarily smart,"" Rinne said. ""That puts him in an ideal position to make a statement for the entire world about addressing the perils of climate change.""Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses including Geico auto insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear.
