2,"   By Jonathan Leff | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Chemicals firm LyondellBasell, owned by Ukraine-born billionaire Leonard Blavatnik, appears to be the mystery American buyer of two cargoes of Kurdish crude delivered in May, according to U.S. government data and industry sources.Nearly two months prior to this week's standoff between the central government of Iraq and Kurdistan over a tanker near Texas with $100 million of Kurdish crude, a smaller ship with Kurdish oil discharged its cargo of heavy, sour Shaikan crude in Houston without any legal tangles, Reuters had reported. A second ship arrived later in May, data show.The ultimate buyer of those cargoes had remained a mystery - until now.According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday, Houston Refining LP, owned by LyondellBasell, imported two cargoes of what was labeled Iraqi crude that match the size of the May shipments and had the distinct quality specifications of Kurdish Shaikan.The data show two shipments of 266,000 and 267,000 barrels of crude oil, both with 4.6 percent sulfur content, far higher than typical Iraqi imports but in line with the Kurdish Shaikan variety, according to market sources familiar with the oil.The Houston Refining imports were also significantly more dense, or heavier, than standard Iraqi crude, with API ratings of 16.7 and 21.4, similar to Kurdish Shaikan, the data show. Almost all Iraqi crude imported since 2012 has been lighter, at 28 API or more.LyondellBasell did not respond to emails and phone messages from Reuters asking if it had contracted to buy Kurdish oil. A spokesman for Blavatnik's global conglomerate Access Industries, which has a stake in Lyondell, did not comment. Blavatnik, a U.S. citizen who was born in Odessa to Russian-speaking parents, is now the world's 33rd richest man after selling his stake in TNK-BP to Russian oil giant Rosneft, according to Forbes. The data highlight the difficulty Baghdad has had in blocking Kurdistan's ability to sell its crude as its leaders push for greater political and economic autonomy.Both Iraq's oil marketers and the U.S. government have warned those who do business with the Kurdish government, including oil sales, that they risk legal action from Baghdad.For the most part, however, Baghdad has done little to discourage Kurdistan from selling piecemeal shipments hauled to Turkey via truck. In total almost 20 million barrels of combined Kurdish crude oil and condensate has been sold to international customers over two years, including refineries in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Israel and Brazil.But Baghdad has shown new legal vigilance toward large-scale tanker sales that began this summer, causing buyers to balk. This week it filed a lawsuit in Texas to try to gain control of 1 million barrels of Kurdish crude on the United Kalavrvta tanker anchored in the Gulf of Mexico.  The State Department said it has no information on who bought the May cargoes.OPPOSITION TO KURDISH SALES Only a few times in the past two and a half years has the United States imported Iraqi crude with characteristics similar to the cargoes that arrived in May, the EIA data show. One of those was imported by Houston Refining in November 2012 - the same year that Kurdistan first began selling oil independently of the central government in Baghdad. It was not immediately clear whether this shipment also originated from Kurdistan.Another shipment with the characteristics of Kurdish oil arrived at Marathon Petroleum Corpâ€™s Galveston Bay refinery in April 2013. It was 19.3 API with sulfur at 3.84 percent. Marathon declined to comment.The United States has not formerly banned purchases of Kurdish crude oil, but in recent months it has pressured companies - both at home and abroad - not to buy Iraqi crude from outside Baghdad's central oil sales system.Still, a number of major U.S. companies, including ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp, Marathon Oil Corp, and Hess Corp are operating in Iraqi Kurdistan, despite objections from Baghdad and occasional disquiet in Washington.Baghdad has increased opposition to Kurdish sales since the launch of the Kurdistan Regional Government's own pipeline to Turkey in January that could bring the Kurds greater revenues.

3,"  (Incorporates LyondellBasell statement, tankers in limbo, loading of cargo, U.S. court case)By Terry Wade and Humeyra PamukHOUSTON/ISTANBUL, July 31 Efforts by Iraqi Kurdistan to boost its finances through bulk oil sales suffered a setback on Thursday as its main U.S. customer swore off more purchases and Baghdad vowed to block delivery from oil-laden vessels like one the Kurds were loading for export.U.S.-based chemicals and refining company LyondellBasell , in its first comments on the controversy, said that after receiving previous shipments it was halting all purchases of what it called disputed Iraqi crude.""We have cancelled further purchases and will not accept delivery of any of the affected crude until the matter is appropriately resolved,"" the company said in a statement about crude for its Houston Refining unit.The United Kalavrvta tanker, carrying some 1 million barrels of Kurdish crude worth $100 million, has been anchored off the coast of Texas since Saturday, stuck in a bitter legal row between the semi-autonomous Iraqi region of Kurdistan and the central government of Iraq over who owns it.The Kurds say control over their oil is crucial for their own dreams of independence and because Baghdad has responded weakly to Islamist militants who overran parts of the country in recent months. Washington has refused to intervene in commercial sales, saying the oil belongs to all Iraqis and supporting a unified Iraq, while warning companies about dealing directly with Kurdistan.Kurdish authorities meanwhile made new efforts to get their crude to market on Thursday, loading another tanker at the Mediterranean Turkish port of Ceyhan even as three vessels carrying their oil remained in limbo.One of those ships, the United Emblem, offloaded part of its cargo onto another ship while anchored in the South China Sea about 12 miles (20 km) off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. But it was still unclear who, if anyone, had bought the smaller cargo or its destination.The third, the United Leadership, has been anchored off Morocco for almost two months. All three tankers are managed by Marine Management Services M.C., a Piraeus-based shipper that has declined to discuss the fate of the vessels. NEW CARGO LOADING Despite the trouble that Kurds have moving crude to buyers, the ship being loaded at Ceyhan on Thursday was scheduled to  sail on Friday. The cargo was the first one of Iraqi Kurdish oil in over a month at Ceyhan, at the end of a pipeline running from Kurdistan to Turkey. The Suezmax tanker Kamari will carry one million barrels of crude oil.So far, most of the buyers of Kurdish oil remain anonymous, while the intensifying legal and political struggle with Baghdad could deter potential buyers, analysts say.Arguing all oil sales outside its control are illegal, Baghdad this week got a U.S. court to order the seizure of 1 million barrels of oil from the United Kalavrvta if the cargo comes ashore. But the tanker is outside the court's jurisdiction while it is not in U.S. territorial waters.Lawyers for the Kurdistan Regional Government, in a letter seen on Thursday, said they had legally sold that shipment. Payments for such shipments are typically made some 30 days after delivery.The Kurds say Baghdad has starved them of their share of national oil money. While the region has long aspired to independence, its position has grown stronger in recent months as Kurdish Peshmerga troops have out-performed Iraqi soldiers against Islamist militants.Kurds have cemented their control of oil reserves around the resource-rich city of Kirkuk and sought to push for more autonomy as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shi'ite Arab who has been an adversary of Iraqi Kurds, has fallen out of favor in Washington.

That cargo, now idle for several days, is at the center of a legal dispute between the central government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government over who owns it.The statement from LyondellBasell, its first public comment on the imports, did not refer to any specific shipments and did not refer directly to Kurdistan.""This Iraqi crude is apparently now the subject of an ownership dispute,"" the company said. A spokesman was not immediately available to clarify what this referred to, or whether the earlier smaller shipments were in dispute.""We have canceled further purchases and will not accept delivery of any of the affected crude until the matter is appropriately resolved.""The decision to swear off further imports is a win for Baghdad, which has stepped up efforts to discourage refiners across the globe from buying crude oil piped out of Kurdistan.Iraq's oil marketers and the U.S. government have both warned those who do business with the Kurdish government, including oil sales, that they risk legal action from Baghdad.The long-running dispute gained global attention this week after Baghdad filed a lawsuit in Texas to try to gain control of the United Kalavrvta's oil. U.S. Marshalls have been unable to carry out an order to seize the cargo because the tanker is outside of U.S. waters. Lyondell said its Iraqi oil purchases were made ""from a reputable international trader with a guarantee of title and in compliance with U.S. law.""The company said Blavatnik, whose Access Industries conglomerate owns over 17 percent of the firm, according to ThomsonReuters Data, has no knowledge of its daily operations.Blavatnik, a U.S. citizen who was born in Odessa to Russian-speaking parents, is now the world's 33rd richest man after selling his stake in TNK-BP to Russian oil giant Rosneft, according to Forbes.Lyondell's shares fell 1.7 percent in New York.TRUCKS OKAY, PIPES NOT  While Baghdad has shown new legal vigilance toward large-scale tanker sales that began this summer, it has done little to discourage Kurdistan from selling piecemeal shipments hauled to Turkey via truck.

9,"  (New throughout, adds face-to-face talks resume, union response to refinery explosion, Lyondell letter to striking workers)HOUSTON Feb 18 The largest U.S refinery workers strike since 1980 entered its 18th day on Wednesday as union and oil company representatives renewed face-to-face negotiations over safety and pay, after a week's hiatus.More than 5,000 workers at 11 plants, including nine refineries accounting for 13 percent of U.S. production capacity, remained on strike.Talks between representatives of the United Steelworkers union (USW) and lead oil company negotiator Royal Dutch Shell Plc had been on hold as the company compiled a reply to an information request and a counterproposal from the union.On Monday, the union's lead negotiator, International Vice President Gary Beevers, told Reuters that safe staffing levels at refineries and chemical plants remained a sticking point. The union also wants wage increases.The USW has issued no new strike notices since Feb. 6, when workers at plants in Whiting, Indiana, and Toledo, Ohio, were told to walk off their jobs the next day. On Wednesday, the USW sent a text message to members after an explosion at Exxon Mobil Corp's 149,500 barrel per day Los Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California. The union said the blast, which injured four contract workers, showed the urgency of its goal to negotiate safer working conditions.     ""As USW pushes life-saving safety improvements, explosion rocks Exxon Torrance,"" the message read. ""Some injuries, no fatalities. Safe refineries save lives.""Exxon said four workers at the Torrance refinery were taken to a hospital with injuries. Lyondell Basell sent letters on Wednesday inviting more than 400 striking workers at its 263,776 bpd Houston refinery to cross picket lines and return to work under terms of the previous contract.A USW spokeswoman said the company should focus on working with the union to improve safety.""Our workers at that location are in solidarity with what we're trying to achieve through the national pattern talks, which is health and safety,"" said USW spokeswoman Lynne Hancock. Tesoro Corp's 166,000-bpd plant in Martinez, California, was the only refinery to cease operations due to the strike. Part of it was already shut for maintenance and after the walkout started the rest was idled. Tesoro officials have said production there will not resume for the duration of the strike.Shell has rescheduled from March until September a planned overhaul of a hydrocracking unit at its 327,000 barrels per day (bpd) joint-venture refinery in Deer Park, Texas, sources told Reuters on Monday.The USW is seeking a three-year, industrywide pact that would cover 30,000 workers at 63 U.S. refineries that together account for two-thirds of domestic capacity.Companies have called on temporary replacement workers to keep plants running at nearly normal levels.

10,"  General Motors Co (GM.N) on Thursday named Craig Glidden, chief legal officer at chemicals company LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB.N), as general counsel, succeeding Michael Millikin, who is retiring in July.    Glidden, 57, helped steer LyondellBasell out of bankruptcy and through restructuring. Like GM, the chemical, plastics and oil refining company went into bankruptcy in 2009. LyondellBasell emerged from bankruptcy in 2010. Glidden has been LyondellBasell's top lawyer since 2009, the same year that Millikin, 66, became GM's chief legal counsel. Milliken has had a 38-year career with GM.Glidden is a graduate of the law school at Florida State University, where he was editor-in-chief of its law review.

14,"  HOUSTON Hourly workers striking against LyondellBasell Industries NV's (LYB.N) Houston refinery voted on Thursday to ratify a new four-year contract, clearing a key hurdle on the way to ending a three-month-long strike, according to a union official.No date has been set for the more than 400 members of United Steelworkers' Local 13-227 to return to work as an agreement for re-entering the refinery has not been made with Lyondell, said Kent Farr, a committeeman with the local.After contract ratification, workers typically return to their jobs within 10 days to two weeks.A Lyondell spokesman did not have an immediate comment about the vote, which took place at the union's offices on Wednesday and Thursday.Lyondell workers will continue to walk picket lines outside the refinery's entrances until the return-to-work agreement is reached.This was the second contract proposal on which Lyondell workers have voted. The previous proposal, which the company called its ""last, best and final"" offer, was overwhelmingly rejected on April 14 because the company did not include a premium pay provision that was in previous contracts. It allowed workers to receive multiple pay differentials when working extensive overtime.The new contract does not include the premium pay provision, but does include double-time provisions, according to the union.After the April 14 rejection, Lyondell put its final offer in place at the refinery and invited strikers to cross picket lines and return to work. The strike at Lyondell's Houston refinery began on Feb. 1 as part of the largest work stoppage by U.S. refinery and chemical plant workers in 35 years. The strike spread to 15 plants, including 12 refineries accounting for one-fifth of national refining capacity.In addition to Lyondell's Houston refinery, strikes are continuing at three other refineries. Workers at BP Plc's (BP.L) Whiting, Indiana, refinery are waiting for a return-to-work agreement prior to voting on a new contract.  Talks are ongoing at Marathon Petroleum Corp's (MPC.N) Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, and the BP-Husky Energy (HSE.TO) joint-venture refinery in Toledo, Ohio.Lyondell has kept the 263,776 barrels per day Houston refinery in operation with temporary replacement workers.The new contract provides pay raises of 2.5 percent in the first year, 3 percent in the second and third years and 3.5 percent in the final year.

15,"  HOUSTON Lyondell Basell Industries Chief Executive Bob Patel said on Wednesday the chemical company may at some stage sell its 263,776 barrel per day (bpd) Houston refinery.""In the longer term, I can't help but think it's more valuable as part of a refining system than as part of a chemical company,"" Patel said in response to a question during a webcast from the JP Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference.Patel did not define the time frame he was describing and the Lyondell presentation ended shortly after he talked about the refinery. The presentation almost exclusively focused on the outlook for the company's chemical production.He said the refinery had generated strong cash flows over the past five years that far exceed the investment needed to keep the refinery running well.In a statement, Lyondell said Patel was stating a long-held view by the company of the refinery's value and not a suggestion the refinery is being actively marketed for sale.  For decades Lyondell management has described the Houston refinery as a primary source of feedstocks for the company's petrochemical plants, three of which are in industrial suburbs of Houston. The company also has plants in the Netherlands and Germany.In 2005, Lyondell and minority partner Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL] put the refinery up for sale to end a partnership that had unraveled after 12 years.  By the summer of 2006, bids for the plant reached between $5 billion and $6 billion before the sale was canceled and Lyondell bought out Citgo's minority stake for $2.1 billion, or $19,000 per barrel of crude oil refining capacity. Since that time, U.S. refinery values have fallen drastically with plants selling for less than $5,000 per barrel. Patel took over as CEO in 2015 when James Gallogly, a former refining executive, stepped down. Prior to joining Lyondell in 2010, Patel worked for 20 years in management at Chevron Phillips Chemical Co [CHEPH.UL].

Fire fighters from Houston, neighboring suburbs, refineries and chemical plants were summoned to battle the blaze, the second in as many days at a Houston-area refinery.On Thursday, a fire broke out at Exxon Mobil Corp's Baytown, Texas, refinery, but was extinguished within an hour, caused no injuries and did not affect main production units. The Lyondell fire broke out in a pump on the 42,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) delayed coking unit, the smaller and older of two at the refinery, the sources said. The same coker underwent a six-week overhaul that finished in March, but the pump was not included in that project.The length of time needed to repair and return the coker to production depends on the extent of damage, the sources said.         About half of U.S. refining capacity is located in plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast.The U.S. gasoline crack spread, a widely used benchmark for refiner margins, extended gains Friday, rising by 2.35 percent to $21.79 per barrel in the minutes after the Reuters report of the fire at the Houston refinery. The crack spread was up roughly 5 percent on the day.Canadian heavy crude differentials fell on Friday, with May trading at $15.05 a barrel below WTI, according to Shorcan Energy brokers, down 30 cents from Thursday's settlement. June differentials fell by 85 cents to a $14.65 a barrel discount to WTI.  Over one-fifth of the Lyondell refinery's roughly 210,000 bpd of imported crude came from Canada last year, up from less than 4 percent the year before, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Gulf Coast cash refined products markets largely shrugged off the fire.

25,"  HOUSTON LyondellBasell Industries returned its 263,776 barrel per day Houston refinery to normal operations on Wednesday, one day after a power interruption on a unit cut production in half, sources familiar with plant operations said.A Lyondell spokeswoman on Wednesday declined to discuss operations at the refinery.The sources said the refinery's output had been at full capacity when the sulfur recovery unit lost power on Tuesday afternoon, but production was cut, amid worker evacuations and orders to shelter in place, to about half capacity following the power interruption.Due to the quick restart of the SRU, the refinery's production is expected to return to full capacity within a few days, the sources added. Last month, the company said the refinery's production averaged 73 percent of capacity during the second quarter as Lyondell performed extensive repairs to a coking unit damaged in an April 8 fire. It also said the refinery was not able to run at full production until the coker restarted on July 15.Flaring from the refinery lasted for about eight hours beginning at 2 p.m. CDT (1900 GMT) on Tuesday, the sources familiar with the plant's operation said. In a notice filed by the refinery on Wednesday with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Lyondell said an estimated 592,500 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 6,400 pounds of hydrogen sulfide were released into the atmosphere during flaring from the refinery.The Houston Ship Channel was shut for about 20 minutes on Tuesday afternoon so the crew of a ship on the waterway north  of the Lyondell refinery would not be exposed to the facility's hydrogen sulfide release, the U.S. Coast Guard said. A sulfur recovery unit extracts sulfur from hydrogen sulfide removed from motor fuel feed stocks in compliance with U.S. environmental rules.

26,"  HOUSTON LyondellBasell Industries was restoring production at its 263,776 barrel per day (bpd) Houston refinery after a midday power interruption robbed the plant of steam supply on Thursday.""Operations impacted by the power interruption from the external electrical and steam supplier have resumed,"" Lyondell spokeswoman Faye Eson said in an emailed statement.A single turbine producing steam was restarted mid-afternoon by supplier Calpine Corp, said a Calpine spokesman. Three Gulf Coast market sources said the refinery's two crude distillation units were operating at mininum levels and a plan was being developed to restart the 90,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit over the weekend. Each of the two CDUs was operating between 80,000 and 90,000 bpd. The larger of the two crude units has a capacity of 147,000 bpd and the smaller's capacity is 120,000 bpd. Lyondell hopes the refinery will reach a total crude throughput above 70 percent of capacity by sometime Friday, the sources said. The timing of the FCCU's return may depend on the restart of a second steam-producing turbine, so the unit has redundant supply, according to the sources.Eson said no injuries were reported at the refinery due to the loss of steam, which powers turbines, compressors, and for the flare system.A thick plume of black smoke, visible 10 miles away,  streamed from the refinery for about two hours after the steam loss. Eson said initial air testing showed ""no level of concern for the surrounding community.""   Before the steam loss, the refinery had been at reduced production levels since Wednesday, when the 42,000 bpd coking unit was shut to replace piping on the unit that may be subject to corrosion, the sources said. Thursday was the second time this month Lyondell had to contend with an unplanned interruption.A power outage at the sulfur recovery complex on Aug. 9 triggered 12 hours of flaring at the refinery that released 592,500 pounds of sulfur dioxide, according to a regulatory notice.CDUs do the initial refining of crude oil coming into the refinery and provide feedstock for all other units. Cokers boost the yield of refinable material taken from barrel of oil and convert residual crude to petroleum coke.

A company spokeswoman said in August, ""the refinery may be more valuable as part of a larger refining system. We are exploring all options.""Lyondell uses the Houston refinery to produce feedstocks for its chemical plants. The refinery can run a variety of cheaper high-sulfur crude oils. In the past few years it has been running a large amount of Canadian oil. The 263,776 barrel per day (bpd) Houston refinery was restoring production on Monday after an early Thursday morning power outage, the latest in a string of fires, shutdowns and power outages that have cut the plant's production throughout year. Saudi Aramco-Motiva emerged as the leading contender over the weekend, when Lyondell's management evaluated proposals from potential buyers, the sources said.Aramco-Motiva and Canada's Suncor Energy Inc were exchanging proposals with Lyondell in the past few days, according to the sources.Little was heard about another potential buyer, Valero Energy Corp, the sources said.  Saudi Aramco, Motiva, Suncor and Valero did not reply to messages seeking comment.The refinery has been valued at about $1.5 billion based on an average price between $5,000 and $6,000 per barrel of refining capacity in recent sales of U.S. refineries. The Lyondell refinery is well known to Saudi Aramcoâ€™s partner in Motiva, Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  Lyondell's refinery supplies dry gas to Shell's joint-venture refinery seven miles (11.25 km) east in Deer Park, Texas. Aramco and Shell announced plans in March to divide Motivaâ€™s three refineries, distribution terminals and retail networks between them. Aramco is to keep the Motiva name.It was unclear if the Lyondell refinery will remain with the post-breakup Motiva once the split takes place on April 1, 2017.Negotiations on the final distribution of assets after the breakup were continuing as of last week, according to Motiva.

We are exploring all options.""Lyondell uses the Houston refinery to produce feedstocks for its chemical plants. The refinery can run a variety of cheaper high-sulfur crude oils. In the past few years it has been running a large amount of Canadian oil. The 263,776 barrel per day (bpd) Houston refinery was restoring production on Monday after an early Thursday morning power outage, the latest in a string of fires, shutdowns and power outages that have cut the plant's production throughout year. Saudi Aramco-Motiva emerged as the leading contender over the weekend, when Lyondell's management evaluated proposals from potential buyers, the sources said.Aramco-Motiva and Canada's Suncor Energy Inc were exchanging proposals with Lyondell in the past few days, according to the sources.Little was heard about another potential buyer, Valero Energy Corp, the sources said.  Saudi Aramco, Motiva, Suncor and Valero did not reply to messages seeking comment.The refinery has been valued at about $1.5 billion based on an average price between $5,000 and $6,000 per barrel of refining capacity in recent sales of U.S. refineries. The Lyondell refinery is well known to Saudi Aramcoâ€™s partner in Motiva, Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  Lyondell's refinery supplies dry gas to Shell's joint-venture refinery seven miles (11.25 km) east in Deer Park, Texas. Aramco and Shell announced plans in March to divide Motivaâ€™s three refineries, distribution terminals and retail networks between them. Aramco is to keep the Motiva name.It was unclear if the Lyondell refinery will remain with the post-breakup Motiva once the split takes place on April 1, 2017.Negotiations on the final distribution of assets after the breakup were continuing as of last week, according to Motiva.

31,"  HOUSTON A 91,000 barrel per day (bpd) vacuum distillation unit was shut by a pump failure on Tuesday at LyondellBasell Industries' 263,776 bpd Houston refinery, Gulf Coast market sources said. Lyondell was working to determine the cause of the pump failure on Tuesday night and return the unit to operation overnight or sometime on Wednesday, the sources said.The VDU is one of two vacuum units of the same size at the refinery. It takes residual crude oil from the 120,000 bpd crude distillation unit and processes it in a vacuum, increasing the yield of motor fuel feedstock.  Similar VDU outages in the past have forced the refinery to reduce production.There are two CDUs at the refinery. Both remained in operation on Tuesday night, the sources said. The CDUs do the initial refining of crude oil coming in to the refinery and provide feedstock for all other units.
