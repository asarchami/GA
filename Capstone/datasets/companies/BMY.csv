0,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Friday reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results, but its shares fell because of investors' jitters about the pace at which the company is developing a promising new combination of cancer drugs.The stock dropped as much as 6.7 percent after company officials said on a conference call with investors that they were not yet planning a late-stage trial that would combine two of its high-profile drugs as a treatment for lung cancer.Instead, Bristol-Myers said it would continue a mid-stage study of the drugs - an experimental medicine called nivolumab and an approved melanoma treatment called Yervoy - before moving them into a larger Phase III lung cancer trial. Both drugs enhance the immune system's ability to fight cancer.""Many investors expected Bristol-Myers to rapidly advance the Nivo-Yervoy combo to Phase III, with the plans for such a move perhaps being announced as early as today,"" BMO analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note.The company's slower timetable might be interpreted as a sign of caution or suggest a lack of ""synergy"" between the two drugs when targeting lung cancer, he said.Results of the mid-stage trial, called Checkmate-012, are expected to be released at a cancer meeting in late May or early June.""We believe today's news is incrementally positive for Merck & Co,"" (MRK.N) Arfaei said, which is developing a rival drug in the same PD-1 inhibitor class as nivolumab.Shares of Bristol were down 3.7 percent at $51.93 in afternoon trading after dropping as low as $50.35. Merck was up 0.2 percent at $51.71 amid a sharp downturn for the broad stock market.ELIQUIS SALES JUMP  In announcing its fourth-quarter results, Bristol-Myers said it had benefited from cost cuts and growing sales of its treatments for cancer, blood clots and diabetes.Sales increased sharply for Eliquis, a closely watched new blood clot preventer, but the product is off to a far slower start than Wall Street had hoped.Eliquis, which is used to prevent strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat condition called atrial fibrillation, generated sales of $71 million, up from $41 million in the prior quarter.But when the pill was approved in late 2012, analysts had predicted sales would eventually reach $3 billion to $5 billion a year.""We're waiting for Eliquis to hit an inflection point, but it hasn't hit that big pop yet,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. ""It will still get there, to $5 billion."" Eliquis, which Bristol-Myers markets with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), proved safer and more effective in clinical trials than the standard oral treatment, warfarin, in preventing strokes among patients with atrial fibrillation.Many patients instead are taking two new blood clot preventers that were approved before Eliquis - Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim and Xarelto from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). But many industry analysts and doctors consider Eliquis to be the best of the new crop of oral agents.Other Bristol-Myers drugs that stood out in the quarter include Yervoy, whose sales rose 23 percent to $260 million, and leukemia treatment Sprycel, whose sales jumped 30 percent to $365 million. And sales of HIV treatment Sustiva increased 11 percent to $427 million.COST CUTS DELIVER The company reported quarterly earnings of $726 million, or 44 cents per share. That compares with $925 million, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, when it took a big write-off for a failed hepatitis C drug. Excluding special items, the profit was 51 cents per share, above the analysts' average estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 6 percent to $4.44 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $4.3 billion.Marketing, selling and administrative expenses fell 7 percent, and research spending shrank 12 percent.""Bristol-Myers' execution on cost structure continues to impress, with lower-than-expected spending"" that helped the company handily beat earnings estimates, Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said.Bristol said it still expected 2014 earnings of $1.65 to $1.80 per share, excluding special items. The forecast assumes current foreign exchange rates and the closing of a deal with British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) in the first quarter.AstraZeneca last month agreed to buy Bristol-Myers' stake in a longstanding diabetes joint venture between the two drugmakers for an initial $2.7 billion, up to $1.4 billion in additional milestone payments, and royalties on net sales through 2025.The joint venture includes oral medicines Onglyza, Kombiglyze and Forxiga, as well as injectable treatments Bydureon and Byetta.The sale will give Bristol more funds to invest in other areas, such as cancer.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Stephen Powell and Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-01-24,BMY,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 1:57pm EST",Pace of Bristol-Myers' cancer trial spooks investors,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bristol-myers-sales-idUSBREA0N0TF20140124?type=companyNews

10,"  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Tuesday said it plans this year to begin a late-stage trial testing whether a combination of two of its high-profile immunotherapies can effectively treat lung cancer, easing concerns about the company's intentions.Company executives spooked investors in January by saying they were not yet planning a late-stage trial that would combine its experimental medicine, nivolumab, and an approved melanoma treatment called Yervoy as a treatment for lung cancer.The company's cautious timetable suggested to some investors a possible lack of ""synergy"" between the two drugs when targeting lung cancer. The medicines both enhance the immune system's ability to fight cancer.But spirits lifted on Tuesday when Brian Daniels, senior vice president of global development for Bristol-Myers, told investors at the Cowen and Co healthcare conference in Boston that the Phase III trial was indeed on track to begin by the end of 2014. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said insights from an ongoing mid-stage trial of the drug combination, presumably durable effectiveness and improved patient survival, had given company officials confidence to move ahead with the costlier larger trial.Nivolumab is a member of an emerging new class of drugs that block a protein called PD-1, thereby allowing the immune system to recognize cancer cells and go after them.

11,"  March 4 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Tuesday said it plans this year to begin a late-stage trial testing whether a combination of two of its high-profile immunotherapies can effectively treat lung cancer, easing concerns about the company's intentions.Company executives spooked investors in January by saying they were not yet planning a late-stage trial that would combine its experimental medicine, nivolumab, and an approved melanoma treatment called Yervoy as a treatment for lung cancer.The company's cautious timetable suggested to some investors a possible lack of ""synergy"" between the two drugs when targeting lung cancer. The medicines both enhance the immune system's ability to fight cancer.But spirits lifted on Tuesday when Brian Daniels, senior vice president of global development for Bristol-Myers, told investors at the Cowen and Co healthcare conference in Boston that the Phase III trial was indeed on track to begin by the end of 2014. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said insights from an ongoing mid-stage trial of the drug combination, presumably durable effectiveness and improved patient survival, had given company officials confidence to move ahead with the costlier larger trial. Nivolumab is a member of an emerging new class of drugs that block a protein called PD-1, thereby allowing the immune system to recognize cancer cells and go after them.

12,"  March 14 U.S. regulators have approved an additional use of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's blood clot preventer Eliquis, to prevent  blood clots in the legs and lungs of patients who have undergone surgery to receive artificial hips or knees.The drug is already sold in partnership with Pfizer Inc  to prevent blood clots that can cause strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that is most common in the elderly.The drugmakers, in a joint release on Friday, said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the new use, noting that each year in the United States there are about 719,000 total knee replacement surgeries and 332,000 hip replacements. After such surgeries, patients are at greater risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can break free and travel to the lungs, where they can be fatal.The new approval will help Eliquis to compete with Xarelto, a similar drug from Johnson & Johnson and Bayer AG  that is also approved for use after knee and hip replacements, as well as to prevent strokes among those with atrial fibrillation.

14,"   By Bill Berkrot  A combination of two anti-viral drugs developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co cured 90 percent of previously untreated hepatitis C patients and 82 percent of those who failed to respond to prior therapy, according to results from a late stage study presented on Thursday.The Phase III trial of more than 700 patients called Hallmark-Dual tested a combination of Bristol's daclatasvir and asunaprevir over 24 weeks of therapy in patients with genotype 1b of the virus that causes progressive liver disease.The cure rate was also 82 percent among patients unable to tolerate treatment with the older standard drugs interferon and ribavirin and 84 percent in patients who had cirrhosis, which accounted for nearly a third of those in the trial.Patients for whom the virus was undetectable in the blood 12 weeks after completing 24 weeks of treatment were deemed to have achieved sustained virologic response (SVR), which is considered cured.""Not only was the daclatasvir and asunaprevir regimen highly effective among study participants, it was also very well tolerated, even among sicker patients with more advanced liver disease,"" Professor Michael Manns, the study's lead investigator from Hannover Medical School in Germany, said in a statement.The study results were presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in London. Genotype 1 is the most prevalent and considered the most difficult to treat form of the virus. Genotype 1b tends to be more common in Europe and 1a is more widely seen in the United States.Several drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences Inc, AbbVie and Merck & Co are developing a new generation of all-oral hepatitis C treatments that do not include interferon or ribavirin, which cause miserable side effects that have led thousands of patients to put off treatment to wait for the highly touted new drugs.In clinical trials, the new drugs have demonstrated cure rates in excess of 90 percent while cutting treatment duration to 12 weeks with few side effects, leading to Wall Street forecasts of multibillion-dollar annual sales in what is shaping up to be a fiercely competitive market. Prior to the recent approval of the first of Gilead's new drugs, standard treatments cured about 75 percent of patients and required either 24 or 48 weeks of therapy.Bristol this week applied for U.S. approval of the two drug combination and said it expects to file for approval of a three-drug combination early next year.Based on earlier studies, Bristol's three-drug combination is likely to further boost cure rates with 12 weeks of treatment, which would be more competitive to results seen so far from rival drugmakers. Patients in the Hallmark-Dual trial received 60 mg of daclatasvir once a day and 100 mg of asunaprevir twice daily. The drugs belong to new classes of medicines that work in different ways to prevent the virus from replicating.The discontinuation rate due to adverse side effects was between 1 and 3 percent, the company said.

21,"   By Bill Berkrot  When the world's leading cancer doctors meet in Chicago next month, new treatments from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Roche Holding AG that help the immune system fight disease are expected to capture much of the spotlight. The drugs, known as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 therapies, are biotech medicines that work by blocking a tumor's ability to camouflage itself, thereby allowing T cells in the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer.They have shown great promise against advanced melanoma - the deadliest of skin cancers - as well as advanced lung and kidney cancers, with relatively mild side effects, generating  excitement among researchers and investors. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago beginning May 30, researchers will for the first time present data on Roche's anti-PDL1 drug in advanced bladder cancer for which there have been few advances in decades. Merck will have no less than 16 studies involving its highly touted anti PD-1 drug, MK-3475, including a first look at the drug as an initial lung cancer treatment. Early data released on Wednesday showed 36 percent of 45 patients had an initial immune response to the treatment. Merck will also provide results from the first trial of the drug in head and neck cancer.Brief summaries, or abstracts, of thousands of studies to be presented at the ASCO meeting were released on Wednesday. ""This area should represent a major advance in cancer therapy and patient survivability,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager for the healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. ""Wall Street is increasingly recognizing the multibillion-dollar potential for cancer immunotherapies."" The potential for lasting effects of these drugs will be on display in a pair of studies involving the Bristol-Myers anti PD-1 drug nivolumab.Researchers will present follow-up data from a 107-patient nivolumab study in metastatic melanoma showing that 41 percent were still alive after three years, an apparent leveling off from the 48 percent survival rate after two years.Three-year survival with advanced melanoma was virtually unheard of prior to the advent of cancer immunotherapy.In a trial of patients whose advanced kidney cancer had progressed following prior treatments, the mean overall survival was 25.5 months for the 2 milligram nivolumab dose. Past kidney cancer studies of drugs currently in use have demonstrated a mean survival of about 14 months, said Fouad Namouni, Bristol's head of global development for nivolumab.MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT  As drugmakers face greater scrutiny over how they price new therapies - with immuno-oncology expected to be among the most expensive - several studies will aim to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the new treatments.Researchers can now perform a test to determine the degree to which the PD-L1 protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. On a 0 to 3 scale, a score of 0 or 1 is considered PD-L1 negative, while 2 or 3 is deemed PD-L1 positive.If early data is confirmed in larger trials, this class of immunotherapies could become standalone treatments for some patients, while PD-L1 negative patients may require combination or alternative therapies, according to some researchers.In a small, Phase I study of Bristol's nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, five out of 10 PD-L1 positive patients saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent. No such responses were seen among 7 PD-L1 negative patients. Roche also saw half of the 20 PD-L1 positive patients in its bladder cancer trial respond to its drug.Namouni said Bristol would focus on PD-L1 positive patients only in a large Phase III lung cancer trial of previously untreated subjects. Its Phase III studies of those who had received prior treatments will include PD-L1 negative patients.

23,"   By Bill Berkrot  May 14 When the world's leading cancer doctors meet in Chicago next month, new treatments from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Roche Holding AG that help the immune system fight disease are expected to capture much of the spotlight.The drugs, known as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 therapies, are biotech medicines that work by blocking a tumor's ability to camouflage itself, thereby allowing T cells in the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer.They have shown great promise against advanced melanoma - the deadliest of skin cancers - as well as advanced lung and kidney cancers, with relatively mild side effects, generating  excitement among researchers and investors.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago beginning May 30, researchers will for the first time present data on Roche's anti-PDL1 drug in advanced bladder cancer for which there have been few advances in decades.Merck will have no less than 16 studies involving its highly touted anti PD-1 drug, MK-3475, including a first look at the drug as an initial lung cancer treatment. Early data released on Wednesday showed 36 percent of 45 patients had an initial immune response to the treatment. Merck will also provide results from the first trial of the drug in head and neck cancer.Brief summaries, or abstracts, of hundreds of studies to be presented at the ASCO meeting were released on Wednesday. ""This area should represent a major advance in cancer therapy and patient survivability,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager for the healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. ""Wall Street is increasingly recognizing the multibillion-dollar potential for cancer immunotherapies.""The potential for lasting effects of these drugs will be on display in a pair of studies involving the Bristol-Myers  anti PD-1 drug nivolumab.Researchers will present follow-up data from a 107-patient nivolumab study in metastatic melanoma showing that 41 percent were still alive after three years, an apparent leveling off from the 48 percent survival rate after two years.Three-year survival with advanced melanoma was virtually unheard of prior to the advent of cancer immunotherapy. In a trial of patients whose advanced kidney cancer had progressed following prior treatments, the mean overall survival was 25.5 months for the 2 milligram nivolumab dose.Past kidney cancer studies of drugs currently in use have demonstrated a mean survival of about 14 months, said Fouad Namouni, Bristol's head of global development for nivolumab. MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT As drugmakers face greater scrutiny over how they price new therapies - with immuno-oncology expected to be among the most expensive - several studies will aim to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the new treatments.Researchers can now perform a test to determine the degree to which the PD-L1 protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. On a 0 to 3 scale, a score of 0 or 1 is considered PD-L1 negative, while 2 or 3 is deemed PD-L1 positive.If early data is confirmed in larger trials, this class of immunotherapies could become standalone treatments for some patients, while PD-L1 negative patients may require combination or alternative therapies, according to some researchers.In a small, Phase I study of Bristol's nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, five out of 10 PD-L1 positive patients saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent. No such responses were seen among 7 PD-L1 negative patients. Roche also saw half of the 20 PD-L1 positive patients in its bladder cancer trial respond to its drug.Namouni said Bristol would focus on PD-L1 positive patients in planning its large Phase III trials.

24,"  (Corrects to Reimbursement Intelligence from Intelligence Reimbursement, to Whang as co-president from president, to Steve Miller from Stuart Miller)By Caroline Humer and Deena BeasleyNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES May 28 Shocked by the rapid adoption of a new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, U.S. health insurers are trying to make sure they aren't blindsided by other drugs being developed and are looking for ways to limit their use from the day they are launched.Manufacturer Gilead Sciences Inc says 30,000 people have received hepatitis drug Sovaldi so far, and that sales hit a record-breaking $2.3 billion within a few months. The treatment, typically 84 pills taken over 12 weeks, completely cures the disease in more than 90 percent of patients.As many as 3.2 million Americans are infected by hepatitis C, and the cost of giving most of them Sovaldi would surpass $200 billion. Some insurers have already put conditions on who can get the drug, and states including California and Texas have slowed or put treatment on hold while they study what to do.Insurers warned that these unforeseen costs will cut 2014 earnings and require rate hikes. Now, at industry conferences, in conversations with investors, and in private, they are pushing Gilead's rivals, a group that includes AbbVie Inc , Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co , to discount their own new hepatitis C treatments when they come to market starting this fall. Such a high-profile campaign by insurers before drugs are even approved is new.They are also signaling they will restrict who can get coverage for new cholesterol drugs being developed by Amgen Inc , Pfizer Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA.By law, insurers cannot deny access to new drugs if they represent a real improvement for patients, leaving drug companies with the upper hand in most price discussions. When comparable competitors, or a generic version is on the market about a decade later, insurers have room to steer patients away from the new drugs, and pharmaceutical companies cut prices steeply and give big discounts.But insurers have not faced such a highly effective drug aimed at a widespread disease that is so expensive and so quickly adopted. The previous record for a drug reaching blockbuster status was set in 2011, when hepatitis C therapy Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals raked in $1.56 billion for the entire year. Sovaldi has sold more in a quarter of the time.As a result, insurers are taking a harder line on which patients should get Sovaldi, based on the drug's clinical data.Sovaldi is ""game-changing"" for insurers' thinking, said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, a consulting firm that helps pharmaceutical companies set prices. The only way for them to respond is to control the volume of treatment used, he said.PUBLIC SHAMING  In a sign of how serious the industry has become, the largest insurer lobby group last week took Gilead to task at a public conference.""The company in this case is asking for a blank check and you can't give anyone anymore a blank check because it will blow up family budgets, state Medicaid budgets, employer costs and wreak havoc on the federal debt,"" said Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans.Gilead argues that Sovaldi's price is worth it, since it will replace even costlier spending on hospital visits and treatments for cirrhosis or liver failure. It has not budged on price for the hepatitis C drug, although Gregg Alton, Gilead's executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs, acknowledged that insurers are going to start negotiating.U.S. drug spending reached a record $329 billion in 2013, driven by a double-digit increase in prices for new cancer, HIV and hepatitis C therapies. Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, expects spending on such specialty drugs to rise an additional 63 percent from 2014 to 2016, driven by an 1,800 percent increase in hepatitis C drug costs.Successful drugs can cost $1 billion to bring to market, including spending on research, development and marketing. Supporters of drug companies say big advances necessitate high prices.""We are the only country in the world that pays exorbitant prices to provide innovation first here, but that's what we need and that's what the American people have come to expect,"" said Richard Burr, a Republican Senator from North Carolina who has spent decades working on bipartisan health bills.LIMITING USE  Hepatitis C complications can take years to develop, which gives insurers and government health agencies leeway to determine when treatment should start.Many insurers, which manage most of the 150 million people covered by employer-based plans as well as some government Medicare and Medicaid plans, require patients to get authorization before using Sovaldi. Some limit the drug to patients with a certain genetic type of the disease.Express Scripts has been pushing for all but the sickest patients to wait for new therapies that are expected to compete head-to-head with Sovaldi late this year. It is also pressing rival manufacturers for low prices, hoping to avoid the shock of Sovaldi, which sped through trials and regulatory approval and caught insurers by surprise.""In this particular case there was very little discussion pre-launch. But other companies are now already discussing potential future price points in response,"" said Steve Miller, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer.AbbVie and Merck both declined to comment on whether discussions with insurers about their new drugs were underway.Gilead, which says it discussed the Sovaldi launch with insurers, is in talks over which patients should be treated with its next hepatitis C pill. That will be a two-drug combination that will eliminate the need for a companion drug that nearly doubles Sovaldi's current total cost. Industry analysts expect the company will price it closer to Sovaldi's $84,000 than to the $150,000 cost of a combination of Sovaldi and a Johnson & Johnson drug that some doctors prescribe.Mick Kolassa, chairman of pricing consultancy Medical Marketing Economics, in Oxford, Mississippi, who advises pharma companies, says insurers are being aggressive. ""We are seeing some of them step up and flex their muscles,"" he said.CHOLESTEROL DRUGS IN SIGHT More scrutiny of new pricing is likely ahead as the country comes to terms with how it should pay for expensive drugs, according to John Castellani, Chief Executive Officer of leading drug industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA.Sovaldi has shown that patients are bearing too much of the drug's costs because of rising co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, he told Reuters, laying the blame on factors controlled by insurance companies.But patient advocates are not choosing sides yet, which may have the effect of giving insurers room for action.""I think the fault lies with both the for-profit insurers and the drug companies,"" said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at the San Francisco-based Project Inform, which advocates for hepatitis C patients. The system has not changed to reflect the impact of new effective, expensive drugs, she said.The next big price battle centers on a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which help the liver to clear ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from the blood.Large-scale studies show the new drugs can help patients who cannot tolerate, or get enough benefit from, the most widely-used cholesterol drugs, statins. The PCSK9 therapies are expected to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the price of statins sold as generics.Drugmakers are expected to push for the new medicines to be used by 7 million to 20 million people, or up to 30 percent of the 71 million Americans with high cholesterol. Insurers already are questioning whether the estimates of use are legitimate.""There is really no need to take these new medications and spread them out across a larger community of people who will respond to existing treatments, many of which are generic,"" Aetna Inc's National Medical Director for Pharmacy Policy Ed Pezalla said in an interview.

26,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S. researchers are finalizing plans to test two immunotherapy drugs made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on patients newly diagnosed with the most common form of deadly brain tumors in adults.Dr. Mark Gilbert, a leading brain tumor researcher at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said he got approval last Tuesday from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to start designing the trial, likely to begin this fall, with the melanoma drug Yervoy and an experimental drug called nivolumab.The trial will be run through the nonprofit NRG Oncology, an NCI sponsored cooperative group of cancer researchers. ""We're really excited about them,"" said Gilbert, who spoke in an interview at the American Society of Clinical Oncology  meeting in Chicago.The hope, he said, is that the drugs, which ramp up the immune system to fight cancer, will prove effective in treating the brain tumors known as glioblastomas.Researchers are already testing Bristol's nivolumab in patients with a glioblastoma that has come back after standard treatment, which involves surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Michael Giordano, head of development for oncology and immunology at Bristol-Myers, said the company's trial in recurrent glioblastoma is part of its push to test the potential of immunotherpies in a broad range of cancers.Gilbert said he has met with company officials, who still need to give written approval for their drugs to be used in the government-backed study.Initially, the trial in newly diagnosed patients will test the safety of the drugs in some 42 patients, Gilbert said. One concern is that bolstering the immune system in the brain could trigger an autoimmune reaction known as encephalitis, causing swelling and worsening patients' symptoms.  But so far, the studies in patients with recurrent tumors have not shown that to be a major issue, Gilbert said.""We have to take it slow. We want to understand what we're doing,"" he said. What is challenging about brain tumors is getting active treatments through a protective membrane called the blood-brain barrier. A major study led by Gilbert, reported at last year's American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, showed Roche's antibody drug Avastin failed to prolong life in patients with newly diagnosed disease. But early studies of immunotherapy in melanoma showed the treatments did shrink tumors in patients whose cancer has spread to the brain, suggesting that immune system cells were reaching their target in the brain and raising hope for immunotherapy treatments.Gilbert acknowledged that research on brain tumors has lagged some other fields, especially with new immune system therapies, but he sees that changing.Glioblastomas are the most common and most deadly form of brain and nervous system tumors, which affect an estimated 240,000 adults globally per year. With standard treatments,  average survival is 15 to 17 months.

28,"   By Bill Berkrot  New data on Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's melanoma drug Yervoy, including updated results from an effort to combine it with another promising cancer immunotherapy, suggest it can improve treatment for patients with both advanced and slightly earlier stage disease, according to findings released on Monday.Yervoy, which takes natural brakes off the immune system to help it more effectively attack cancer, is approved to treat metastatic, or stage 4, melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer. Cowen and Co expects the drug to capture annual sales of $1.95 billion by 2020, as it is approved in new indications and combinations with other treatments. During the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, Bristol-Myers presented several studies on Yervoy and nivolumab, its experimental cancer immunotherapy from a highly promising class called PD-1 inhibitors, both as standalone treatments and in combination. In one late-stage study on Yervoy alone, the drug reduced the risk of melanoma recurrence by 25 percent following surgery compared with a placebo. The median recurrence-free survival (RFS), or average time to disease return, following successful surgery to remove cancerous tumors was 26.1 months for Yervoy compared with 17.1 months for the placebo group. The result was deemed to be statistically significant.Patients in this study had stage 3 disease in which the cancer had spread to regional lymph nodes but not yet to other parts of the body.""This benefit was observed across all patient sub-groups, including those who were at highest risk of recurrence,"" Alexander Eggermont, the study's lead investigator, said in a statement.The result could pave the way for the drug's use earlier in the disease and boost future sales. Current treatment options to reduce the risk of recurrence following surgery are very limited, Eggermont said. The 951-patient Phase III study was the first large trial to look at Yervoy's effect following complete resection surgery.Overall survival data was not yet available. But three years after beginning treatment, an estimated 46.5 percent of Yervoy patients were free of disease recurrence compared with 34.8 percent in the placebo group. Nearly half of the Yervoy patients stopped treatment due to side effects, which are common with the drug, and there were five drug-related deaths, or 1.1 percent, researchers reported.Bristol shares were down 2 percent to $48.65 with some experts expressing concern about side effects.""There is a delay in recurrence, however I would argue that the delay … is comparable to interferon. And there was toxicity,"" said Dr Steven O'Day, director of the Los Angeles Skin Cancer Institute, noting the five deaths.Ron Peck, Bristol's global development leader for Yervoy, said a high 10 milligram dose was used in the study and may have contributed to the side effect rate. A 3 mg dose is being used in later studies. LONG-TERM SURVIVAL FOR COMBINATION Data from a separate, early-stage study of advanced melanoma patients demonstrated compelling survival data for Yervoy combined with nivolumab.At two years, the overall survival rate for the first 53 patients in the study was estimated to be 79 percent, down only a bit from the 85 percent survival rate reported after one year.""If this survival data is confirmed in Phase III trials, it's unprecedented. This is really exciting data,"" said Dr. Mario Sznol, a professor of medicine at Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut, and the study's lead investigator. Among the 17 patients who received the two drug doses that Bristol chose to test in its larger, later stage trials the two-year survival rate was 88 percent. Seventeen percent of patients in the study had a complete response, or no detectable cancer. Sznol expects that number to rise. Immunotherapy results often improve over time as the immune system learns to fight the disease.The results were consistent whether or not a patient's tumors expressed the PD-L1 protein, which helps camouflage them against the immune system. Patients who are deemed negative for PD-L1 tend to get little benefit from drugs like nivolumab alone, suggesting the addition of Yervoy may also help them.The incidence of serious side effects among the first 53 patients in the study was about 53 percent and rose to 62 percent with an additional group of 41 more patients.There was a 23 percent discontinuation rate due to side effects and one drug-related death, researchers reported.""These toxicities really are manageable in the clinic,"" Sznol said. ""If you're getting 79 percent overall survival at two years, the side effects are clearly worth it.""BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei expressed disappointment about separate kidney cancer data for the combination that could be contributing to the Bristol stock downturn. ""We remain uncertain that the incremental benefit of adding Yervoy to nivo is worth the additional toxicity,"" he said.

A 3 mg dose is being used in later studies.LONG-TERM SURVIVAL FOR COMBINATION Data from a separate, early-stage study of advanced melanoma patients demonstrated compelling survival data for Yervoy combined with nivolumab.At two years, the overall survival rate for the first 53 patients in the study was estimated to be 79 percent, down only a bit from the 85 percent survival rate reported after one year. ""If this survival data is confirmed in Phase III trials, it's unprecedented. This is really exciting data,"" said Dr. Mario Sznol, a professor of medicine at Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut, and the study's lead investigator.Among the 17 patients who received the two drug doses that Bristol chose to test in its larger, later stage trials the two-year survival rate was 88 percent.Seventeen percent of patients in the study had a complete response, or no detectable cancer. Sznol expects that number to rise. Immunotherapy results often improve over time as the immune system learns to fight the disease.The results were consistent whether or not a patient's tumors expressed the PD-L1 protein, which helps camouflage them against the immune system. Patients who are deemed negative for PD-L1 tend to get little benefit from drugs like nivolumab alone, suggesting the addition of Yervoy may also help them.The incidence of serious side effects among the first 53 patients in the study was about 53 percent and rose to 62 percent with an additional group of 41 more patients.There was a 23 percent discontinuation rate due to side effects and one drug-related death, researchers reported.""These toxicities really are manageable in the clinic,"" Sznol said. ""If you're getting 79 percent overall survival at two years, the side effects are clearly worth it.""BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei expressed disappointment about separate kidney cancer data for the combination that could be contributing to the Bristol stock downturn.

30,"   By Bill Berkrot  New data on Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's melanoma drug Yervoy, including fresh results from an effort to combine it with another promising cancer immunotherapy, suggest it can improve treatment for patients with both advanced and slightly earlier stage disease, according to findings released on Monday.Yervoy, which takes natural brakes off the immune system to help it more effectively attack cancer, is approved to treat metastatic, or stage 4, melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer. Cowen and Co expects the drug to capture annual sales of $1.95 billion by 2020, as it is approved in new indications and combinations with other treatments. During the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, Bristol-Myers presented several studies on Yervoy and nivolumab, its experimental cancer immunotherapy from a highly promising class called PD-1 inhibitors, both as standalone treatments and in combination. In one late-stage study on Yervoy alone, the drug reduced the risk of melanoma recurrence by 25 percent following surgery compared with a placebo. The median recurrence-free survival (RFS), or average time to disease return, following successful surgery to remove cancerous tumors was 26.1 months for Yervoy compared with 17.1 months for the placebo group. The result was deemed to be statistically significant.Patients in this study had stage 3 disease in which the cancer had spread to regional lymph nodes but not yet to other parts of the body.""This benefit was observed across all patient sub-groups, including those who were at highest risk of recurrence,"" Alexander Eggermont, the study's lead investigator, said in a statement.The result could pave the way for the drug's use earlier in the disease and boost future sales. Current treatment options to reduce the risk of recurrence following surgery are very limited, Eggermont said. The 951-patient Phase III study was the first large trial to look at Yervoy's effect following complete resection surgery. Overall survival data was not yet available. But three years after beginning treatment, an estimated 46.5 percent of Yervoy patients were free of disease recurrence compared with 34.8 percent in the placebo group.Nearly half of the Yervoy patients stopped treatment due to side effects, which are common with the drug, and there were five drug-related deaths, or 1.1 percent, researchers reported.Ron Peck, Bristol's global development leader for Yervoy, said a high 10 milligram dose was used in the study and may have contributed to the side effect rate. A 3 mg dose is being used in later studies. LONG-TERM SURVIVAL FOR COMBINATION Data from a separate, early-stage study of advanced melanoma patients showed results for Yervoy combined with nivolumab that researchers found very encouraging.At two years, the overall survival rate for the first 53 patients in the study was estimated to be 79 percent, down only a bit from the 85 percent survival rate reported after one year.""If this survival data is confirmed in Phase III trials, it's unprecedented.

32,"   By Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In the race to find a faster cure for hepatitis C, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said it will test its experimental antiviral drug combination with Gilead Sciences Inc's blockbuster drug Sovaldi, hoping to cut treatment time to four weeks.Bristol-Myers disclosed plans for the exploratory 30-patient trial testing its three-drug combination with Sovaldi in an interview with Reuters. Eric Hughes, the leader of Bristol's global hepatitis program, said the details were due to be posted on the clinicaltrials.gov website next week. Sovaldi's $84,000 price tag for a 12-week treatment has spurred outrage among insurers, state health officials and lawmakers who fear the cost of treating millions of Americans with the progressive liver disease will top $250 billion. Insurers are pushing Gilead's rivals to offer lower prices when their hepatitis C medicines reach the market. Using the drug for a shorter course of treatment could, in theory, lower the cost, even when combined with Bristol's therapies. Rivals Merck & Co and AbbVie are also racing to develop next-generation hepatitis C treatments that cure most people of the virus in a shorter time frame.But drug pricing experts expect Gilead and its rivals may still argue that the quicker cure represents a value to patients, buffering any steep price reductions.""The position and concept of pharma is not ingredient costs or duration of treatment cost. Pharma is looking at it as cost per cure,"" said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, which works with pharmaceutical companies and payers to help determine prices for medicines.The cost could come down, he said, ""but it's not going to be proportionate to the degree that the duration of treatment shortens."" The new generation of oral drugs being developed by several companies has raised hepatitis C cure rates to well above 90 percent from about 75 percent without the need for interferon or ribavirin, which caused miserable side effects that led many patients to delay or drop treatment. The drugs in clinical trials have already cut treatment time to 12 weeks from 24 to 48 weeks.  ""We got rid of the tolerability problem. We got rid of the efficacy problem. Now there is a tremendous drive to get down to shorter treatment durations,"" Bristol-Myers' Hughes said in a telephone interview.REVIVING A SOVALDI COMBO  Bristol's plan essentially revives an effort to test its drugs in combination with Sovaldi. It previously tested a single compound with Sovaldi, achieving cure rates close to 100 percent in 12 weeks. But Gilead scrapped further testing in 2012, as it  preferred to develop its own combination without a partner. Gilead's pill that combines Sovaldi with its ledipasvir is expected to gain U.S. approval this year for therapies of eight or 12 weeks, depending on the patient. The company is also testing the combination as a six-week treatment.The go-it-alone strategy has already paid off as Gilead was first to market with Sovaldi, breaking pharmaceutical industry sales records with $2.3 billion in sales within a few months. The new study, set to begin in late July, will test a trio of Bristol drugs with Sovaldi in previously untreated patients with the most common Genotype 1 form of the virus. It will involve two groups of 15 patients each - one getting four weeks of treatment and the other six. If Bristol can demonstrate cure rates in excess of 90 percent in four weeks, it plans to conduct larger trials with a more diverse patient population. ""We'll see what the data says,"" Hughes said. ""Taking this forward will be a very exciting thing.""       With Gilead not involved in the effort, Bristol will pay full price for Sovaldi to conduct the trial.Bristol would not discuss potential pricing of its regimen, since its drugs are not approved. But if treatment can be cut to four weeks from 12, the Sovaldi portion would be closer to $28,000. Other rivals are also advancing efforts to compete in what is expected to be a huge market.Merck this month agreed to pay $3.85 billion to acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc with the hope that combining the two companies' most promising drugs will produce cures in four to six weeks across the full spectrum of genotypes.U.S. and European health regulators in the last week said they would accelerate their reviews of AbbVie's four-drug regimen, meaning it could be vying for market share by early next year.

Durable goods orders, also due at 8:30 a.m., are seen as flat in May, while a June read on service sector business activity from financial data firm Markit is seen as essentially unchanged from May.* The S&P 500 hit an intraday record in early trading on Tuesday, boosted by some positive economic data, but enthusiasm waned in the final hours of trading as concerns over Iraq returned to the forefront. The Dow posted its biggest daily decline in over a month. * S&P 500 e-mini futures rose 2 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures  rose 9 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures rose 0.5 point.* Geopolitical tensions will remain in view. In a mounting Sunni insurgency, militants in Iraq attacked one of the country's largest air bases. Separately, the first U.S. teams arrived to assess Iraqi security forces and decide how to help counter the violence. * Investors are concerned about the impact prolonged turmoil in Iraq could have on oil prices, which are already up 3.8 percent this month. U.S. crude futures rose 0.6 percent to $106.64 per barrel in early trading. Many analysts have speculated that prices above $115 per barrel for an extended period will weigh on economic activity.* The CBOE Volatility index spiked more than 10 percent on Tuesday, coinciding with the market's pivot lower, the biggest one-day pop for the ""fear index"" since April.

42,"  July 10 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday it plans to seek U.S. marketing approval in the third quarter for its experimental cancer immunotherapy Opdivo as a treatment for advanced melanoma, which would be months sooner than Wall Street expected.The company said it would seek approval to market the drug to patients who had previously been treated with Bristol-Myers' already approved melanoma drug Yervoy, which works through a different mechanism than Opdivo.Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group, said many analysts had not expected Bristol-Myers to submit the marketing application until mid-2015, although he and some others had speculated an earlier filing was possible. The U.S. drugmaker in April, in a so-called rolling submission that will be completed by the year end, asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve Opdivo (nivolumab) to treat patients with another type of cancer, squamous cell lung cancer. Opdivo works by blocking a protein called PD-1, thereby enabling the immune system to recognize cancer cells and then attack them. It is considered one of Bristol-Myers' most important experimental drugs, with potential to generate multibillion-dollar annual sales, if approved.

46,"   By Olivia Oran, Soyoung Kim and Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 18 ConvaTec's private equity owners plan to explore a sale of the medical device maker next year, even as interest from several healthcare companies in a potential $10 billion acquisition intensifies, according to people familiar with the matter.Amid a wave of mergers in the healthcare sector aimed at reducing corporate tax rates, Luxembourg-based ConvaTec has emerged as a target for U.S. companies looking to move their tax domiciles abroad in a practice known as inversion.Diversified U.S. manufacturer 3M Co and medical equipment makers CareFusion Corp and C.R. Bard Inc  are among the companies exploring a potential deal for ConvaTec, the people said.CareFusion, with a market capitalization of $9 billion, and C.R. Bard, with $11.2 billion, would both be able to achieve an inversion if they use their own stock to pay for ConvaTec. While ConvaTec would review any compelling offer that would come before 2015, the company for now wants to boost its value further before launching an auction or an initial public offering next year, the people said.Still, calls from some U.S. politicians to crack down on inversions could prompt a potential buyer to act sooner rather than later, for fear missing the window of opportunity, one of the people added. ConvaTec reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $502.5 million in 2013, up 15 percent year-on-year. It is hoping to exceed $600 million in EBITDA this year, the people said.The people asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. ConvaTec, Avista Capital, Nordic Capital, 3M, CareFusion and C.R. Bard could not be reached for comment. ConvaTec makes wound care and ostomy care products at 11 manufacturing sites in eight countries, and sells them in more than 100 countries. It is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.Private equity firms Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital acquired ConvaTec from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  in 2011 for $4.1 billion. 3M was one of the contenders for ConvaTec at the time, according to people familiar with the matter.Inversion deals so far this year include medical device maker Medtronic Inc's acquisition of peer Covidien Plc  for $42.9 billion, and drugmaker AbbVie Inc's  $54.7 billion merger with pharmaceutical company Shire Plc .

47,"  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc on Thursday said U.S. regulators have approved an expanded use for their Eliquis blood clot preventer, to treat blood clots in the legs and lungs.The drugmakers said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also approved use of the pill to reduce risk of recurrent blood clots in the deep veins of the leg, called deep vein thrombosis, and in the lung, called pulmonary embolism, following initial therapy.Leg clots, if untreated, can travel to the heart, lungs and brain, and cause heart attacks and stroke. Lung clots, which can choke off blood flow, are linked to high mortality rates and require immediate treatment. Eliquis, which works by blocking a protein called Factor Xa that is involved in the clotting process, is already approved to prevent strokes in patients who have an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. It is meant to be an alternative to warfarin, an older oral drug that can cause serious bleeding episodes and comes with strict dietary restrictions and the need for frequent blood checks.  In large clinical trials involving patients with leg and lung clots, Eliquis was shown to cause far fewer cases of major bleeding than standard treatment with blood clot preventer enoxaparin for five days, overlapped by treatment with warfarin. Eliquis was shown to be similarly effective as standard care.Bristol-Myers and Pfizer are hoping the new approved use for Eliquis will significantly boost demand for Eliquis, whose sales have been very disappointing since it was introduced in late 2012. It garnered $171 million in sales in the second quarter. That pales with blockbuster sales of a similar drug from Johnson & Johnson called Xarelto, and a different but new type of blood clot preventer called Pradaxa, sold by privately held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim.

50,"  FRANKFURT Germany's Bayer unveiled plans to launch three new studies to expand the uses of its anti-clotting drug Xarelto, one of its top five new medicines.Xarelto, which competes with the Eliquis pill developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer in stroke prevention, reached sales of $1.7 billion in the 12 months to June. Analysts estimate annual sales could rise to more than $9.5 billion by 2020.The drug, jointly developed with U.S. firm Johnson & Johnson, is currently approved for uses including the prevention of strokes caused by atrial fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia.Bayer said on Friday that a Phase III trial involving about 7,000 patients would examine whether Xarelto can help prevent the recurrence of strokes in patients who have suffered strokes of undetermined cause.""We really have just as many strokes due to undetermined causes as to atrial fibrillation,"" Frank Misselwitz, head of the Therapeutic Area Cardiovascular and Coagulation at Bayer HealthCare, told Reuters. A second Phase III trial announced on Friday will examine the potential benefits of Xarelto in reducing thrombotic vascular complications in more than 5,000 patients with peripheral artery disease.The third new study is a Phase II trial designed to evaluate Xarelto for long-term prevention of acute coronary syndrome in patients who have suffered from the illness. If the study involving between 2,000 and 3,000 patients is successful, a Phase III study will follow, Bayer said.Misselwitz declined to say whether expanding the uses of Xarelto would prompt Bayer to raise its estimate of the drug's peak sales potential, which Chief Executive Marijn Dekkers has so far put at about 3.5 billion euros a year. ""But these are major illnesses,"" Misselwitz said with reference to the planned trials. Bayer shares were flat at 1441 GMT, against a 0.8 percent lower Dax index. Xarelto is also currently used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms and to reduce the risk of strokes and blood clots in patients with an irregular heart beat that is not caused by heart problems.

55,"   By Ben Hirschler | MADRID  MADRID Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy drug Opdivo produced markedly improved response rates with fewer toxic side effects compared to chemotherapy in a major melanoma study, underscoring its potential as a new treatment option.The data has been keenly awaited since this is the first presentation of results from a pivotal Phase III clinical trial of a promising new class of drugs designed to help the body's own immune system fight cancer.In the study, involving people with advanced melanoma, 32 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink when given Opdivo against 11 percent of those treated with conventional chemotherapy drugs.Importantly, the duration of response was also much longer. Patients on chemotherapy typically responded for 3.6 months, whereas 95 percent of those who responded to Opdivo were still benefiting after six months and the median duration of response was not reached.Patients in the study had previously been treated with the company's Yervoy immunotherapy, which works in a different way to take natural brakes off the immune system. “I was very nicely surprised,"" said Jeffrey Weber of the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, who presented the results at the European Society of Medical Oncology annual congress on Monday.“A 32 percent response rate with the majority staying in remission past six months is probably going to turn into a very impressive level of survival,” he said. ""I hope this is the death knell for chemotherapy in melanoma.""Opdivo, or nivolumab, is part of a promising new class of drugs designed to block a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1, used by tumors to evade the immune system's disease-fighting cells. Industry analysts are waiting next to see how Opdivo performs in another Phase III trial in lung cancer, for which they expect results in the fourth quarter of 2014. Since non-small lung cancer is a much bigger market than melanoma, that trial is viewed as critical to the drug's commercial outlook.Some investors are nervous about Opdivo's lung cancer prospects but Weber, for one, is upbeat. “It is highly likely that the lung data will be positive,” he told Reuters.  Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July when Japanese regulators gave it a green light, although it has been beaten to market in the United States by Merck & Co's rival Keytruda, which was approved earlier this month.On Friday, Bristol-Myers said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted Opdivo a priority review and a decision on approval was due by the end of March.Companies such as Roche and AstraZeneca are also developing PD-1 pathway drugs for a variety of cancers, including lung cancer.

Patients on chemotherapy typically responded for 3.6 months, whereas 95 percent of those who responded to Opdivo were still benefiting after six months and the median duration of response was not reached.Patients in the study had previously been treated with the company's Yervoy immunotherapy, which works in a different way to take natural brakes off the immune system. ""I was very nicely surprised,"" said Jeffrey Weber of the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, who presented the results at the European Society of Medical Oncology annual congress on Monday.""A 32 percent response rate with the majority staying in remission past six months is probably going to turn into a very impressive level of survival,"" he said. ""I hope this is the death knell for chemotherapy in melanoma.""Opdivo, or nivolumab, is part of a promising new class of drugs designed to block a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1, used by tumours to evade the immune system's disease-fighting cells. Industry analysts are waiting next to see how Opdivo performs in another Phase III trial in lung cancer, for which they expect results in the fourth quarter of 2014. Since non-small lung cancer is a much bigger market than melanoma, that trial is viewed as critical to the drug's commercial outlook.Some investors are nervous about Opdivo's lung cancer prospects but Weber, for one, is upbeat. ""It is highly likely that the lung data will be positive,"" he told Reuters.Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in July when Japanese regulators gave it a green light, although it has been beaten to market in the United States by Merck & Co's rival Keytruda, which was approved earlier this month.On Friday, Bristol-Myers said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted Opdivo a priority review and a decision on approval was due by the end of March.Companies such as Roche and AstraZeneca are also developing PD-1 pathway drugs for a variety of cancers, including lung cancer. Some analysts expect the new class could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2025.

58,"  (Adds details)ZURICH Oct 6 Swiss pharma group Novartis AG  said on Monday it would work with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co to test the U.S. drugmaker's immuno-oncology drug Opdivo in combination with three of its own experimental lung cancer drugs.The clinical collaboration will help Novartis advance its efforts in the field of immunotherapy, one of the hottest areas in biotech right now, following the acquisition of CoStim Pharmaceuticals Inc this year, the drugmaker said.Novartis currently lags rivals such as Roche, Merck , AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers in the race to develop immunotherapies - drugs that fight cancer by harnessing the body's immune system. The two companies will test the combination of three molecularly targeted compounds with Bristol-Myers' investigational PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) in phase I and II studies, Novartis said, adding it would conduct both studies.""Preclinical data suggests that combining molecularly targeted agents with immunotherapies such as nivolumab may have synergistic effects and lead to better outcomes for patients,"" Alessandro Riva, global head of Novartis oncology development and medical affairs, said in the statement. Opdivo is part of a closely watched class of drugs known as anti-PD-1 therapies, which block a tumour's ability to camouflage itself from attack by the immune system's cells.The drug is approved in Japan for the treatment of unresectable melanoma and is under review by the U.S and European health regulators. It is also being tested as a treatment for a range of other cancers. One of the Novartis studies will evaluate Opdivo with Novartis' Zykadia, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April as a treatment for late-stage non-small cell lung cancer.The second study will test Opdivo with two investigational drugs, INC280 and EGF816.Novartis is also developing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell, or CAR-T, immunotherapies, which involves engineering a patient's own T-cells to identify proteins on cancer cells.

60,"   By Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Tuesday said it is no longer seeking U.S. approval for an oral two-drug combination to treat hepatitis C because of competition from rival drugs that require treatment for half as long and have shown higher cure rates.The drugmaker's shares fell more than 2 percent.Bristol-Myers' combination of experimental antiviral drugs daclatasvir and asunaprevir was intended for patients with the genotype 1b form of the liver-destroying virus, which is far less prevalent in the United States than the 1a form.In addition, Bristol-Myers' drug faced stiff competition from products being developed by rival drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences <GILD, AbbVie and Merck & Co.In late-stage clinical trials, Bristol's two-drug combination cured about 85 percent of patients with 24 weeks of therapy. The combinations being developed by rival drugmakers have demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with just 12 weeks of therapy, and they are pursuing even shorter treatment durations. ""We believe revenue expectations for this two-drug combination in the U.S. were reasonably low given the lower efficacy relative to other regimens from Gilead and AbbVie that are awaiting approval later this year,"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. Gilead's once-a-day, two-drugs-in-one pill combination for hepatitis C is expected to gain U.S. approval as soon as this week. Its already-approved Sovaldi - half of that regimen - has shattered sales records for a new medicine, racking up $3.5 billion in the second quarter alone.Bristol said it will continue to pursue U.S. approval of daclatasvir, a potent drug from a new class called NS5A inhibitors, which could then be combined with other medicines. It is testing that drug in combination with Gilead's Sovaldi. The company also has a three-drug regimen that, based on earlier studies, is expected to cure more people in 12 weeks and would compete more favorably with rival treatments.A U.S. marketing application for Bristol's three-drug combination is expected to be filed next year.Bristol's two-drug combination was approved in July for use in Japan, which it long considered a prime market for the treatment. Genotype 1b is prevalent in Japan, where intolerance to the older medicine interferon is particularly high, creating a big need for new treatment options. ""We believe this treatment has the potential to play a major role in curing HCV patients in Japan, as well as in other markets where the HCV patient population is similar to Japan,"" Bristol-Myers said in a statement. Bristol-Myers shares were down $1.12, or 2.2 percent, at  $49.98 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

62,"  Bristol-Myers Squibb said it withdrew its U.S. marketing application for an oral drug combination to treat hepatitis C, citing a ""rapidly evolving"" treatment landscape in the country.The drugmaker's shares fell nearly 2 percent in early trading.Bristol-Myers is racing against Merck & Co and AbbVie to try and cut the treatment time by half and avoid side effects from older standard drugs interferon and ribavirin.Interferon and ribavirin treat hepatitis C (HCV) in about 24 weeks, but their side effects have led to thousands of patients putting off the treatment to wait for new drugs.Bristol-Myers' two-drug combination treatment, in a late-stage study in April, showed that it could cure HCV infections in 24 weeks in 82 percent of patients who were unable to tolerate interferon and ribavirin.

64,"   By Sophie Sassard and Anjuli Davies | LONDON  LONDON Oct 15 ConvaTec's owners have appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to explore a sale of the medical device maker which could be worth up to $10 billion, sources familiar with the matter said.Private equity firms Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital are preparing the groundwork for a possible sale or initial public offering (IPO) in 2015 for the Luxembourg-based company, said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private.Mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare space have hit a record pace so far this year, in part driven by U.S. companies seeking to redomicile in countries that have a lower corporate tax rate, in a practice known as inversion.Kimberley-Clark and 3M are considered likely bidders for ConvaTec, said the sources, adding that the U.S. firms' interest was not motivated by tax inversion issues. ConvaTec, Nordic Capital, 3M, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Kimberley Clark and Avista Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Reuters reported in August that some U.S. companies including diversified manufacturer 3M and medical equipment makers CareFusion Corp and C.R. Bard Inc were potentially exploring a deal, but that ConvaTec wanted to boost its value further before launching an auction or IPO. CareFusion has since been swallowed by medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson & Co for $12.2 billion, taking them out of the field. Also, in recent weeks equity markets have stumbled and the market for IPOs has stalled.Avista Capital Partners and Nordic Capital acquired ConvaTec from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co in 2011 for $4.1 billion. 3M and Kimberley-Clark were among the contenders for ConvaTec at the time, according to people familiar with the matter.ConvaTec reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $502.5 million in 2013, up 15 percent year-on-year. It is hoping to exceed $600 million in EBITDA this year, sources have said.The company makes wound care and ostomy care products at 11 manufacturing sites in eight countries, and sells them in more than 100 countries.

That compared with $692 million, or 42 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.Excluding special items, the company earned 45 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 42 cents, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The effective tax rate was 27.4 percent, compared with 15.4 percent a year ago.Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, who expected a 13 percent tax rate, saw few other material updates on its finances or products in the earnings report.Later Friday, investors will pay close attention to any updates from executives about how Bristol-Myers' high-profile immuno-oncology drugs are faring in clinical trials and in an ongoing review by regulators. The medicines include Opdivo (nivolumab), a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that takes the brakes off immune system cells to allow them to recognize and attack cancer cells. Bristol-Myers, along with Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), Roche Holding AG ROG.VX and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L)(AZN.N) are leaders in PD-1 inhibitors, and analysts say the new class could generate more than $30 billion in annual global sales by 2025. Opdivo was approved in Japan in July to treat melanoma, and Bristol-Myers has begun the process of seeking U.S. marketing approval for the drug to treat the less common ""squamous"" form of lung cancer as well as melanoma. Bristol-Myers is expected on Oct. 31 at a meeting in Chicago to present clinical trial data on the use of Opdivo as a treatment for squamous lung cancer, after two earlier courses of treatment failed. ""Overall, we believe the Street is significantly underestimating (Opdivo's) potential in lung cancer,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said on Friday. He predicted the stock could jump to the $55 to $65 range, if favorable data are seen at the meeting, the Chicago Multidisciplinary Symposium on Thoracic Oncology.Arfaei noted other Opdivo lung cancer data are expected in coming months and could help support U.S. approval of the drug.Shares were up $1.38 to $53.88. Merck's Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, last month became the first PD-1 inhibitor available in the United States.

69,"   By Bill Berkrot  Treatment of a common form of advanced lung cancer with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's experimental immunotherapy nivolumab  led to a one-year survival rate of 41 percent in a midstage clinical trial, according to data to be presented at a medical meeting, sending the drugmaker's shares up 8.8 percent.While the study, called CheckMate-063, did not compare nivolumab with another drug or placebo, the historical one-year survival rate for patients like those in the trial, whose  squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) had progressed after treatment with two or more prior therapies, is between 5.5 percent and 18 percent, the company said on Thursday. Squamous cell cancer tends to be found in the middle of the lung.""The data today look very, very good,"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said, adding that it bodes well for an ongoing  Phase III trial in NSCLC patients following just one prior therapy.He had estimated a 1-year survival rate of about 20 percent as the number to beat.Nivolumab belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that have generated great excitement in the medical community. They work by blocking a tumor's ability to camouflage itself, allowing the body's immune system to recognize and attack the cancer.Merck & Co Inc last month received the first U.S. approval of a drug from the class to treat advanced melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer. ""The Phase II findings from CheckMate-063 are encouraging as there are no effective treatment options for patients with refractory squamous cell lung cancer after their disease has progressed through two prior therapies,"" Dr. Suresh Ramalingam, director of medical oncology at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, said in a statement.Bristol-Myers, which has proposed the brand name Opdivo for nivolumab, plans to use the data as part of its rolling submissions seeking U.S. and European approvals.Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson sees Opdivo sales reaching $4.6 billion in 2020. Median overall survival was 8.2 months in the 117-patient trial. The median duration of response had not yet been reached.The objective response rate (ORR), which was the primary goal of the trial, was 15 percent as assessed by an independent review committee. That compares with historical expectations in the single digits, the company said. ORR was defined as reduction of the target lesion of at least 30 percent with no new lesions.The results were scheduled to be reported on Friday at a thoracic oncology meeting in Chicago. Fatigue, lung tissue inflammation and diarrhea were among the most common adverse side effects reported. The discontinuation rate due to drug-related side effects was 12 percent, and there were two drug-related deaths, the company reported.  Lung is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, with about 1.5 million each year, according to the World Health Organization.

70,"   By Bill Berkrot  Oct 30 Treatment of advanced squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's experimental immunotherapy nivolumab led to a one-year survival rate of 41 percent in a midstage clinical trial, according to data being presented at a medical meeting.While the study called CheckMate-063 did not compare nivolumab with another drug or placebo, the historical one-year survival rate for patients like those in the trial, whose cancer had progressed after treatment with two or more prior therapies, is between 5.5 percent and 18 percent, the company said.Nivolumab belongs to a highly promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a tumor's ability to camouflage itself, allowing the body's immune system to recognize and attack the cancer. Merck & Co last month received the first U.S. approval of a drug from the class to treat advanced melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer. ""The Phase II findings from CheckMate-063 are encouraging as there are no effective treatment options for patients with refractory squamous cell lung cancer after their disease has progressed through two prior therapies,"" Dr Suresh Ramalingam, director of Medical Oncology at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, said in a statement.Bristol-Myers, which has proposed the brand name Opdivo for nivolumab, plans to use the data as part of its rolling submissions seeking U.S. and European approvals. The median overall survival in the 117-patient trial was 8.2 months. The median duration of response had not yet been reached.The objective response rate (ORR), which was the primary goal of the trial, was 15 percent as assessed by an independent review committee. That compares with historical expectations in the single digits, the company said. ORR was defined as reduction of the target lesion of at least 30 percent with no new lesions. The results were scheduled to be reported on Friday at a thoracic oncology meeting in Chicago.Fatigue, lung tissue inflammation and diarrhea were among the most common adverse side effects reported. The discontinuations rate due to drug-related side effects was 12 percent, and there were two drug-related deaths, the company reported.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, with about 1.5 million each year, according to the World Health Organization. NSCLC accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases.

71,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Chemotherapy as a treatment for advanced melanoma could soon become obsolete, researchers said on Sunday, after patients taking an experimental immuno-oncology drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co had a much higher survival rate and had other favorable results.The impressive results, compared with chemo, were seen in a late-stage study of the Bristol-Myers drug Opdivo, which helps take the brakes off the immune system by blocking the protein PD-1.The 418-patient-study involved previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. Among those taking Opdivo, 73 percent were alive one year later, compared with 42 percent of those receiving standard chemo treatment dacarbazine. Moreover, 40 percent of those taking Opdivo had tumor shrinkage, versus 14 percent for the chemo group. The treatment was associated with mild side effects, including fatigue and nausea.""The results were incredibly good and show there will no longer be a role for chemotherapy in advanced melanoma,"" said Dr. Georgina Long, an associate professor at the Melanoma Institute Australia who helped lead the study. Findings were presented at a medical meeting in Zurich.Long, reached by phone there, said the findings bode well not only for Opdivo, but for an emerging crop of other PD-1 inhibitors being developed by other companies. They include products being tested by Merck & Co, Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc.Merck's Keytruda in September received the first U.S. approval of a drug from the class, to treat advanced melanoma.   Opdivo had also shown strong results in a different Phase III trial that involved advanced melanoma patients who had previously been treated with Yervoy, another immuno-oncology drug from Bristol-Myers. Those results, released in September, showed tumors shrank in 32 percent of patients given Opdivo, compared with 11 percent of those receiving chemo.Bristol-Myers is testing Opdivo for many other cancers, with early glimpses of success. Treatment of a common form of advanced lung cancer with the drug led to a one-year survival rate of 41 percent in a midstage clinical trial, according to data presented two weeks ago.The historical one-year survival rate for such patients, who previously failed on other drugs, is between 5.5 percent and 18 percent.

75,"  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Wednesday said U.S. regulators had declined to approve the use of its experimental treatment for hepatitis C, daclatasvir, in combination with other antiviral drugs.Bristol-Myers said it had initially sought permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market the drug, a so-called NS5A inhibitor, in combination with asunaprevir, one of the New York-based company's experimental medicines.But Bristol-Myers abandoned its U.S. marketing application for asunaprevir in October because of potential competition from more potent drugs, leaving the FDA without data to gauge the effectiveness of daclatasvir as part of a combination regimen. Bristol-Myers said the FDA has asked it for data involving use of daclatasvir with other drugs, and that the company is in discussions with the agency about the scope of the required information. Most notably, it is testing daclatasvir in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc's Sovaldi, a blockbuster treatment that is used on its own or as a component of a combination treatment called Harvoni that was recently introduced by Gilead and is expected to quickly become the market leader.Bristol-Myers' combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir,  however, was approved in July for use in Japan, which it long considered a prime market for the treatment.

Its other airport investments include UK's Bristol, Copenhagen and Brussels.The Canadian pension fund wants to strengthen Birmingham Airport's position as a regional hub in the UK by tapping into its capacity of around 9.5 million passengers per year.The airport, which hosts a number of low cost airlines such as Ryanair, Flybe, Monarch and Thomas Cook, offers domestic and international flights to destinations in Europe, North America and the Middle East. It ranks as the UK's seventh busiest airport after Edinburgh and Luton, according to the UK Civil Aviation Authority, while London's Heathrow and Gatwick are in the top two spots with more than 110 million combined passengers, followed by Manchester Airport with more than 21 million annual passengers.Ontario Teachers first invested in Birmingham Airport in 2001. It then acquired a joint 48.25 percent stake with Victorian Funds Management (VFM) for 420 million pounds in 2007 when Macquarie Airports Group and Aer Rianta made a full exit. The pension fund gave no financial details of their latest buyout.The Canadian pension fund became the sole owner of the UK's ninth busiest airport, Bristol, after buying out its co-shareholder Macquarie Group in September.

84,"   By Bill Berkrot  Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co broke further away from rival drugmakers in the race to treat lung cancer with a new generation of immune system therapies, adding pressure on the likes of Roche and AstraZeneca to play catch-up.Merck said it would file an application with U.S. regulators in the middle of this year seeking expanded use of its new Keytruda treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the deadly disease. That followed a late Sunday announcement by Bristol-Myers that independent monitors halted a trial of its Opdivo treatment for lung cancer when it became clear the drug extended survival compared with standard chemotherapy.  While the magnitude of the benefit was not yet known, it marked the first time the new class of immunotherapy demonstrated an overall survival benefit in lung cancer.       Some industry analysts expect this class, known as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, to generate more than $30 billion in worldwide annual sales by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative use.Keytruda and Opdivo are already approved to treat advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. They work by blocking a mechanism used by tumors to hide from disease fighting immune system cells. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson sees Merck closing a perceived gap with Bristol-Myers in using their drugs for lung cancer.""The review time for Merck's application could be on the order of a few months,"" implying approval in the second half of 2015, nearly a year earlier than Wall Street had expected, Anderson said in a note. As a result, ""Merck may only be about six months behind Bristol-Myers in bringing its product to market.""Bristol has not said when it expects an approval decision for Opdivo as a treatment for lung cancer. Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note that Merck's rapid advancement may pose a setback to similar programs from Roche and AstraZeneca.

85,"   By Bill Berkrot  Jan 12 Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co broke further away from rival drugmakers in the race to treat lung cancer with a new generation of immune system therapies, adding pressure on the likes of Roche and AstraZeneca to play catch-up.Merck said it would file an application with U.S. regulators in the middle of this year seeking expanded use of its new Keytruda treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the deadly disease.That followed a late Sunday announcement by Bristol-Myers that independent monitors halted a trial of its Opdivo treatment for lung cancer when it became clear the drug extended survival compared with standard chemotherapy.While the magnitude of the benefit was not yet known, it marked the first time the new class of immunotherapy demonstrated an overall survival benefit in lung cancer.Some industry analysts expect this class, known as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, to generate more than $30 billion in worldwide annual sales by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative use. Keytruda and Opdivo are already approved to treat advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. They work by blocking a mechanism used by tumors to hide from disease fighting immune system cells.Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson sees Merck closing a perceived gap with Bristol-Myers in using their drugs for lung cancer.""The review time for Merck's application could be on the order of a few months,"" implying approval in the second half of 2015, nearly a year earlier than Wall Street had expected, Anderson said in a note. As a result, ""Merck may only be about six months behind Bristol-Myers in bringing its product to market."" Bristol has not said when it expects an approval decision for Opdivo as a treatment for lung cancer.Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note that Merck's rapid advancement may pose a setback to similar programs from Roche and AstraZeneca.Roche's timeline for seeking regulatory approval remains unclear, Fernandez noted.

94,"  (Repeats to fix formatting)* Strong dollar may cut up to $12 bln from Q4 U.S. revenue -FireApps* Dupont sees 2015 $0.60/share impact, Bristol-Myers $0.12-$0.14/share* Apple, P&G, Stryker also see headwindsBy Chuck Mikolajczak and Sinead CarewNEW YORK, Jan 27 A slew of U.S. multinational companies, from DuPont to Procter & Gamble, showed that a strong U.S. dollar hurt their earnings, and several blue-chip exporters said the situation will get worse if the greenback holds its strength.All told, the resurgent U.S. currency could shave up to $12 billion off U.S. companies' fourth-quarter 2014 revenue alone, according to currency expert Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FireApps, a data analytics company in Phoenix, Arizona, that examines quarterly reports for currency-related losses.The pain is hitting multiple sectors, including industrial companies such as 3M Co, technology companies like Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc, airlines such as American Airlines Group Inc, healthcare companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc , and consumer firms like Procter & Gamble - which all garner a large portion of their sales from outside the United States.""This is a slow-motion crash,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. It could take a couple of quarters for currency conversion losses to show up, she said.After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar  has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand.The Dow Jones industrial average, composed of large and well-known companies, was hit especially hard on Tuesday as six of seven companies in the index that reported results since Monday evening declined, with only United Technologies gaining.""You have companies who don't normally complain about (the dollar) who are starting to harp on it and it does make sense from an economic perspective that this would be a drag,"" said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. ""It's really the pace that matters - not just whether it is strengthening or weakening."" HEDGING HELP LIMITED WITH SHARP MOVES The choice for multinationals is stark. They can keep customers loyal by maintaining overseas prices and take a revenue hit from a tough conversion to dollars, or raise prices and risk the loss of customers to cheaper local competitors.While many companies successfully use currency hedging to at least partly protect against foreign exchange-related losses, the speed and extent of recent fluctuations have made it more difficult to hedge. This has also hurt Wall Street analysts' ability to estimate losses.One of the worst-hit companies appears to be chemicals giant DuPont, which derives roughly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. DuPont said the strong dollar cut 7 cents per share off fourth-quarter earnings and will shave 60 cents off 2015 earnings per share based on recent currency rates. Procter & Gamble said foreign exchange will reduce its fiscal 2015 sales by 5 percent and its net earnings by 12 percent in what it described as its most significant currency impact ever. Bristol-Myers said it expects foreign exchange rates to cut its 2015 revenue by $800 million and 12 to 14 cents in terms of earnings per share.The impact looks even more abysmal when compared with the 1 cent per share currency impact target that multinationals set for their foreign exchange managers, according to FireApps.American icon Apple Inc is also at risk as it brings in roughly 62 percent of its revenue from overseas. It had to close its online store in Russia temporarily in December due to dramatic currency fluctuations.Currency could shave as much as $3 billion off Apple's 2015 revenue even if its hedging strategy succeeds in halving the impact, technology analyst Shannon Cross at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey, said ahead of its report.Apple's Chief Financial Officer said on Tuesday that foreign exchange is a ""clear headwind"" included in the company's guidance for the year ahead.Shares in Microsoft, which gets nearly three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, finished off 9.2 percent on Tuesday after it said it was hurt by the strong dollar but gave no specifics.Medical device maker Stryker Corp said that if exchange rates stay around current levels, it expects first- quarter and 2015 sales to be hurt by 3 percent to 4 percent.Other notables names citing currency headwinds so far in the earnings season include Johnson & Johnson and IBM .Dollar strength already shaved at least $4 billion off U.S. corporate revenue in the third quarter, according to FireApps. But actual losses may be much higher as many firms citing currency impacts did not disclose the amount, it noted.

That compared with $726 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, including an after-tax charge of 28 cents per share resulting from the transfer of U.S. pension obligations, Bristol-Myers earned 46 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 41 cents. Revenue fell 4 percent to $4.26 billion, coming in above Wall Street expectations of $4.03 billion. Sales would have fallen only 1 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which reduces the value of sales abroad.Bristol-Myers said it expects 2015 earnings of $1.55 to $1.70 per share, assuming current foreign exchange rates. The entire range is below the average analyst forecast of $1.71 per share and reflects earnings as much as 16 percent below those seen in 2014. Many investors expect Bristol-Myers earnings to vault higher in following years thanks to development of potentially lucrative immuno-oncology treatments, drugs that treat cancer by harnessing the immune system.U.S. regulators last month approved its Opdivo medicine to treat patients with advanced melanoma. It competes with Keytruda, a melanoma treatment from Merck and Co that also works by blocking a protein called PD-1 that allows tumor cells to conceal themselves.

105,"   By Bill Berkrot  U.S. health regulators on Wednesday swiftly approved a Bristol-Myers Squibb Co drug that helps the immune system fight the most common form of lung cancer, sending the company's shares up more than 5 percent to a multi-year high.The eagerly anticipated Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug known as Opdivo came only about three months after Bristol provided trial results showing that the medicine extended survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), one of the biggest markets in oncology. The decision also came more than three months ahead of an expected action date by the agency.""This approval will provide patients and health care providers knowledge of the survival advantage associated with Opdivo and will help guide patient care and future lung cancer trials,"" Richard Pazdur, the FDA's head of hematology and oncology product evaluation, said in a statement.Opdivo, known chemically as nivolumab, was approved to  treat non-small cell lung cancer after the disease has progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy, typically the first-line treatment against the disease. It was previously approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Opdivo belongs to a highly promising new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack cancer cells.Opdivo was reviewed under the FDA's priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs the agency believes would provide significant improvement in treating a serious condition. Analysts believe lung cancer could add billions of dollars in annual sales for Opdivo.  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with an estimated 224,210 new cases and 159,260 deaths in 2014. Non-small cell lung cancer is by far the most common type of the disease. Bristol-Myers shares were up 5.3 percent at $65.22 on the New York Stock Exchange, a level last reached in 2001.

107,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON The idea of using vaccines to fight cancer has received a shot in the arm from a $1 billion deal between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Bavarian Nordic.The agreement gives the U.S. drugmaker an exclusive option to the Danish biotech firm's therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine Prostvac and signals that such shots may have a bright future when combined with so-called checkpoint inhibitor drugs.Shares in Bavarian Nordic surged 35 percent on Wednesday on news of the Bristol-Myers tie-up, under which it could receive up to $975 million, including an upfront payment of $60 million.Unlike traditional preventative vaccines, therapeutic ones are designed for people with established disease and the aim is to boost the patient's immune system to keep tumors at bay.Unfortunately, they have run into problems in practice, leading to a series of failures with experimental products such as Merck KGaA's Stimuvax and GlaxoSmithKline's MAGE-A3. The one vaccine to make it to market, Dendreon's Provenge, has not been a commercial success.But Bristol-Myers thinks vaccines, which trigger a response from the immune system's ""foot soldiers"", can play an important role when given in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, like its drug Yervoy, which take the brakes off other immune cells.A week ago, the U.S. company and its Danish partner released early data from a study involving 30 patients showing that 20 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer remained alive 80 months after starting treatment with the most promising dose of Prostvac and Yervoy. The idea of combining therapeutic cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors has gained traction among researchers in recent months and was a talking-point at the European Society of Medical Oncology annual congress in Madrid in September.Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan also told Reuters last year that the Swiss group, which is the world's largest maker of cancer drugs, was exploring ways of combining its checkpoint inhibitors with cancer vaccines. Companies including Roche, Bristol-Myers, Merck & Co and AstraZeneca are investing heavily in ways to harness the immune system against cancer as they chase an immunotherapy market that some analysts predict will eventually generate annual sales of more than $30 billion.

The jump added over $260 million to its market value of $880 million.The agreement gives the U.S. company an exclusive option to license Bavarian's Prostvac drug, an immunotherapy treatment that helps the body's own immune cells fight tumors.Immunotherapy for cancer is a rapidly evolving field which promises better and longer-lasting treatments, although oncology experts warn financial costs are high. Under the deal, Bavarian Nordic stands to receive up to $975 million, including $60 million it will get upfront, if it passes trials and sales milestones, and could also receive royalties.Prostvac is currently undergoing Phase III trials -- the last set of tests before it can be sold on global markets. ""A significant Phase II survival benefit suggests Prostvac immunotherapy has the potential to revolutionize prostate cancer treatment,"" analysts at Jefferies said in a note.Last week Bavarian said results from a small early-stage trial conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, showed Prostvac helped extend survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer significantly. In that trial, patients were treated with Prostvac in addition to escalating doses of Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy, an injectable treatment for advanced melanoma that works by taking the brakes off the body's immune system.Bavarian Chief Executive Paul Chaplin said full results of the Phase III trial are expected by early 2017 but that the company is looking to improve the potential sales position of the drug by combining it with other treatments. ""We will be approved as a monotherapy but what our colleagues at NCI have already shown is that there are synergistic benefits of combining Prostvac,"" he told Reuters.   ""That is where the treatment will be moving."" The two companies said on Wednesday they were preparing for Phase II trials of Prostvac together with Yervoy.""Scientific rationale exists to evaluate Prostvac in combination with Yervoy and other agents from Bristol-Myers Squibb's immuno-oncology portfolio,"" they said in a statement. The deal follows Bavarian's agreement last year with a unit of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to trial an Ebola vaccine, as an outbreak spread across West Africa.Chaplin said the two deals would allow Bavarian to invest more aggressively in its pipeline of drugs that cover infectious diseases including smallpox and cancer because a Phase III trial for such a small company is very costly.""Fortunately we had the sales of the smallpox vaccine, which was driving our ability to invest in this space, but it was limiting our ability to do other things,"" he said.

In total, 11 of the many new drugs set for launch in 2015 are expected to generate $1 billion-plus annual sales within five years, up from three in 2014, Thomson Reuters Cortellis said in its latest ""Drugs to Watch"" report on Monday.

122,"  (Adds details on Keytruda, melanoma, rival Bristol-Myers drug)By Ransdell PiersonMarch 24 Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday that it would stop a large study of its Keytruda melanoma treatment early because an independent monitoring committee determined the drug succeeded in its goal of prolonging survival in previously untreated patients at advanced stage of the disease.The medicine, a PD-1 inhibitor that works by taking the brakes off the immune system, is already approved to treat patients who have failed to benefit from standard treatments, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Yervoy.Patients taking Keytruda showed meaningful improvement in overall survival and in delayed progression of disease, compared with those taking Yervoy, Merck said. The data, if regulators agree, could allow Merck to widen its marketing of Keytruda to people being treated for the first time for the dangerous skin disease.Shares of Merck were up 1 percent at $59.30 in early trading.""Keytruda is the first anti-PD-1 therapy to demonstrate a survival advantage compared to the standard of care for the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma,"" Merck said in a release. It noted that data from the study will be presented at a medical meeting next month in Philadelphia. About 76,000 Americans are diagnosed every year with melanoma, which is highly linked to sun exposure, and more than 9,700 die from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute.Merck said safety of Keytruda in the halted study was similar to that seen in earlier trials, where the most common side effects were fatigue, coughing, nausea and other mostly mild reactions. Keytruda in September became the first PD-1 inhibitor approved by U.S. regulators. Three months later, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Bristol-Myers' Opdivo, also for patients with advanced melanoma who no longer respond to other drugs. It also works by blocking the PD-1 protein.AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers are also developing PD-1 inhibitors, or similar drugs known as PD-L1 inhibitors. Wall Street expects the products to generate combined annual sales of more than $30 billion by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative potential use.Merck aims by midyear to seek U.S. approval of Keytruda for non small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease.Bristol-Myers in January said it was halting a trial of Opdivo for lung cancer, also at the advice of independent monitors, when it became clear the drug extended survival compared with standard chemotherapy.

129,"   By Ransdell Pierson  A large study of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo treatment has been halted after proving the drug is effective against the most common form of lung cancer, the company said, positioning the medicine for far wider use than its already approved lung cancer and melanoma indications.The U.S. drugmaker on Friday said the study, called Checkmate-057, was stopped early after an independent data monitoring committee concluded that Opdivo provided a survival advantage over docetaxel, a standard chemotherapy, among patients with previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The so-called PD-1 inhibitor, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, was approved by U.S. regulators last month to treat the less-common ""squamous"" form of NSCLC that had spread following treatment with chemotherapy.

141,"  April 28 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  reported better than expected quarterly results, helped by cost cuts and a higher estimate of royalties owed the company from sales of its Abilify schizophrenia treatment.The U.S. drugmaker on Tuesday said it earned $1.19 billion, or 71 cents per share, in the first quarter. That compared with $937 million, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 71 cents per share, well above the average forecast of 51 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results were helped by lower spending on marketing and advertising. Company sales rose 6 percent to $4.04 billion, about $200 million above Wall Street expectations. They would have risen 13 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales abroad.

142,"  (Repeats Tuesday story with no changes to text.)By Ransdell Pierson and Bill BerkrotApril 28 Investors betting that Bristol-Myers Squibb will emerge as the leading player in a hot new class of cancer drugs hit the pause button on Tuesday as a rival therapy from Merck & Co showed much higher sales.Bristol shares fell as much as 2.7 percent and closed off 1 percent after reporting sales of Opdivo, a therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, totaled $40 million in the first quarter of the year. That was below Wall Street forecasts of $50 million.Merck said its Keytruda treatment had quarterly sales of $83 million, topping Wall Street estimates of about $70 million, helped by early compassionate use patients converting to paying customers following approval.""When investors saw Opdivo's number was below Keytruda's, that caused concern,"" said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Merck shares closed up 5 percent, though the gains were mostly attributed to positive new safety data on its top-selling Januvia diabetes treatment.Boris and other industry analysts said the early sales data represent only the first skirmish in a long battle for market share between Bristol-Myers and Merck. Some expect both drugs will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer.In addition, excitement over Bristol-Myers' cancer treatments have pushed shares to trade at 28.5 times expected 2016 per share earnings, Boris said. That compares with a multiple of 15.1 for Merck and 17.6 for the pharmaceutical sector. ""Based on price per fundamentals, we like the value of Merck versus Bristol at the moment,"" said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for ESquared Asset Management, which currently holds Merck but not Bristol shares.Ori Hershkovitz, a managing partner at Nexthera Capital in New York, said Bristol-Myers is trading more like a high-flying biotech.""The minute biotech gets pummeled, Bristol bears the brunt,"" he said, noting biotech stocks have retreated sharply in recent weeks on fears they were overly inflated. EARLY ADVANTAGE Opdivo was approved in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it received clearance to treat a common form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early-mover advantage in a much larger market.Keytruda has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and awaits regulatory approval in lung cancer.Both drugs work by blocking a protein called PD-1, helping the immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells. Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc  are also developing similar treatments. Boris forecast Opdivo annual sales reaching $7 billion by 2020 and said Tuesday's weakness in Bristol shares represents a buying opportunity. Opdivo has been shown to prolong survival in melanoma and lung cancer, according to clinical trial data.Keytruda has not yet demonstrated a survival benefit but is expected to do so in coming trials. Boris predicted it will capture annual sales of $3.7 billion by 2020.Bristol Chief Scientific Officer Francis Cuss told analysts on Tuesday that strong data on Opdivo along with the U.S. approvals in lung cancer and melanoma and expected European approval ""really puts us in a very strong competitive position.""The company recently reported strong results from a combination of Opdivo and its older immunotherapy Yervoy in advanced melanoma. It plans to apply for approval of the combination therapy by mid-year.Merck head of global human health, Adam Schechter, told analysts that the market will be big enough to handle several competitors, ""so I don't think it should be looked at as one company versus the other.""Pfizer is racing to catch up with Merck and Bristol-Myers, by beginning late-stage trials this year of its PD-1 inhibitor and conducting trials of four other immuno-oncology drugs.PD-1 treatments ""will be the workhorses for the foreseeable future, but they will need to be added to standard therapies or to (other) immuno-oncology treatments,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview. ""That's where the market will be, and we will be well positioned with those combination agents.""

143,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s (Bristol- Myers, Bristol, BMY) Euro Bond issuance.  The net proceeds from the issuance are expected to be used to fund, in part, the  redemption of the company's existing 2016 and 2022 senior unsecured Euro notes.  A full list of the company's ratings follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch expects Bristol-Myers to operate with leverage below 2.0 times (x)  following the divestiture of its diabetes business. Leverage at Dec. 31, 2014  was 2.1x.  --Fitch anticipates that continued market uptake of Bristol's medicines with  longer patent protection and the successful commercialization of key research  projects will help offset the effects of the patent expirations of Baraclude and  Abilify during 2015. --Bristol has made progress in advancing a number of late-stage pipeline  candidates that treat various cancers and hepatitis C, which will help  longer-term growth.  --Baraclude and Abilify patent expirations will be a headwind to sales and cash  flows in 2015. Nevertheless, Fitch does see meaningful operational improvement  in 2016 as new and established patent-protected drugs continue to gain traction  and patent expiries are more manageable.  --The sale of the company's diabetes business has reduced EBITDA and left  Bristol less diversified. However, Fitch believes the company will benefit from  its narrower strategic focus from gains in operational efficiency and research  productivity in the intermediate to long term.  --Fitch believes Bristol will use a cash deployment strategy that generally  preserves cash through 2015 by moderating its share repurchases. Leverage Expected to Generally Remain Below 2.0x Fitch expects that Bristol will generally operate with gross debt leverage  (total debt/EBITDA) below 2.0x during the forecast horizon. The company paid  down approximately $755 million in debt during the first quarter of 2014 and has  maintained profitability during the past 12 months.  Patent Protected Products Growing Bristol has a number of growth drivers for the intermediate term that will help  to mitigate the roughly 20% of sales at risk to patent expiries through the end  of 2016. The company's longer-dated patented products continue to generate solid  growth. Sprycel (chronic myeloid leukemia), Yervoy (metastatic melanoma) and  Orencia (rheumatoid arthiritis) are generating strong double-digit growth as  favorable clinical outcomes drive increased utilization. Eliquis (blood clots)  revenues have increased eight-fold over the prior year due to positive clinical  data and improved formulary positioning.  Pipeline Progress Bristol-Myers has made meaningful progress with its late-stage pipeline during  the past year, during which it has advanced treatments for cancer and hepatitis  C through its pipeline. Opdivo/nivolumab (cancer) has had numerous positive  developments, including FDA approval in December 2014 to treat skin cancer.  Moderate Impact from Patent Losses in 2015 - 2016 A second wave of drug patent expirations occurs in 2015 - 2016 when Baraclude  and Abilify lose market exclusivity in the U.S. The maturing medicines account  for roughly 20% of total revenues. The patent expiration of Baraclude in the  U.S. is immaterial, although the expected loss of exclusivity in international  markets in October 2016 poses a moderate challenge, as its international sales  account for roughly 8% of total firm sales.  Expected strong performance of Yervoy and Eliquis and continued growth of core  blockbuster medicines, notably Sprycel, Reyataz, and Orencia, should provide  support during the 2015 -2016 patent expiry period. As such, the negative effect  on sales growth and operating margin should be more moderate than what Bristol  experienced during 2012 when Plavix lost most of its sales because of generic  competition after its U.S. patent expired.  Sharpened Strategic Focus In its effort to narrow its strategic focus, Bristol-Myers sold its diabetes  business to AstraZeneca in the February 2014. Fitch believes, over the long  term, the benefits of an increased strategic focus (improved operational  efficiencies and research productivity) will offset the negative effect of  divestiture-related decrease in product portfolio diversification. Bristol received $2.7 billion cash at closing and will receive $800 million in  potential approval milestones and sales performance milestones of potentially  $600 million payable in 2020. The company will also receive specified royalties  on the diabetes' business net worldwide sales through 2025. Soft Near-Term FCF Fitch forecasts relatively soft annual free cash flow (FCF; cash from operations  less dividends and capital expenditures) generation of roughly 500 million to  $700 million during 2014 -2015, mainly the result of top-line pressure from  patent expiries and the loss of contribution from the diabetes franchise. Steady  improvements should follow in 2016 and beyond as new products, recently-launched  and to-be-launched, gain traction. FCF in the latest 12-month (LTM) period ended  Dec. 31, 2014 was $224 million, compared to $699 million in prior year's LTM  period. Cash Preservation through Patent Cliff Fitch believes that Bristol will deploy cash in a relatively conservative manner  throughout 2015. While Fitch expects that Bristol will continue to support its  dividend, the company will likely lean towards cash preservation over  significant share repurchases. During the LTM period ended Dec. 31, 2014, share  repurchases declined and issuances actually exceeded purchases with net proceeds  of $288 million compared to net issuances of $131 million in the prior year  period. KEY ASSUMPTIONS: Fitch's key assumptions for Bristol-Myer's 'A-'/Stable Outlook include: --Modest revenue decline during 2015, primarily driven by the negative effect of  foreign exchange movement and the patent expiries of Abilify and Baraclude; --Established products such as Orencia, Yervoy and Eliquis as well as recently  introduced Opdivo should mitigate some of the headwinds to top-line growth; --EBITDA margin to increase to 25%-26% as mix improves with newer product growth  and ongoing efforts to rein in costs yield savings; --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) to decline to roughly $500 - $600 million during 2015; --Leverage to trend slightly below 2.0x during 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near  term, future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to such  an action include: Given the anticipated operational pressure from expiring drug patents through  2016, Fitch would consider a positive rating action if it believes gross debt  leverage will be maintained below 1.7x and FCF will remain positive through the  forecast period. Drivers of operational improvement that would support a  positive revision include strong demand for new therapeutics, as well as  successful commercialization of promising oral Hepatitis C treatments and the  potential first-in-class oncology drug, Opdivo/nivolumumab.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: Ratings pressure would result if the company is not successful in mitigating the  negative effects in 2015 - 2016 of the Abilify, Sustiva, and Baraclude patent  expirations. A negative Rating Outlook or a one-notch downgrade could follow a  sustained increase in total debt leverage to greater than 2.0x together with  significant FCF contraction resulting from margin compression and incremental  borrowings. Fitch currently rates Bristol-Myers Squibb as follows: --IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'; --Bank loan 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

144,"  FRANKFURT, April 30 Bayer brushed off concern that its stroke prevention pill Xarelto may be losing market share to rival Bristol-Myers Squibb's Eliquis in the United States.The German drugmaker told analysts during a conference call on Thursday that Eliquis was taking business from warfarin and other drugs, but not from Xarelto. It also raised its forecast for Xarelto's 2015 sales growth to 30 percent from 20 percent.

148,"   By Brendan Pierson  A federal judge in New York has thrown out, for the second time, a lawsuit accusing Mylan Laboratories Ltd of breaching an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co to distribute an AIDS drug in developing countries, after being ordered by an appellate court to reconsider. U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who originally dismissed the lawsuit in 2013, said Wednesday that Bristol-Myers had failed to state a viable case even after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave it another chance last October. The decision was another victory for Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which represented Mylan.

149,"  European regulators have recommended approval of Merck & Co Inc's immune system-boosting cancer drug Keytruda, following a similar green light last month for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's rival product Opdivo.Merck's drug, also known as pembrolizumab, was endorsed on Friday by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of melanoma.Both Keytruda and Opdivo are already approved in the United States.The EMA said Keytruda was recommended for use on its own for the treatment of advanced melanoma, the most aggressive type of skin cancer, in both first-line and previously treated patients. (bit.ly/1FrWjYm) Keytruda and Opdivo belong to a highly promising new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system. It is expected to be one of the most commercially successful new drugs to reach major markets this year.  Although Keytruda is still waiting for final regulatory approval in Europe, some patients in Britain are receiving it through a new early-access scheme, under which highly promising new drugs are made available free of charge ahead of formal licensing. Friday's positive European opinion on Keytruda is an intermediary step on the drug's path to market, since it now has to be sent to the European Commission for formal adoption. After that, decisions on price and reimbursement will taken by individual governments around Europe.

151,"   By Deena Beasley and Bill Berkrot  New data to be released this weekend should help deepen the understanding of how broadly new drugs that unleash the body's immune system to fight cancer can be used.Results from key clinical trials will be presented starting Friday in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. These will include studies aimed at defining ahead of time which patients are likely to benefit from the costly drugs.    At the forefront will be rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck and Co designed to block a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1) that is used by tumors to evade the body's natural defenses.""It's going to be an important meeting to get some more (details) on the PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.     Bristol's Opdivo, or nivolumab, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it also received clearance to treat a form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early advantage in the much larger market. Merck's Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and is awaiting regulatory approval in lung cancer treatment.    First-quarter sales of both drugs surprised Wall Street, with Keytruda sales reaching $83 million, compared to $40 million for Opdivo, suggesting an early advantage for Merck in what many expect will be a years-long battle for market share.  Other drugmakers working on similar treatments include Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc. Many industry experts expect the entire class will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer.    On Friday, the ASCO conference will feature studies looking at Opdivo’s use against advanced liver cancer and non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Results will also be presented from a trial of Keytruda in head and neck cancer.     ""Bristol's in a really good position,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. ""My expectation is that they're going to be and will continue to be the leader in the lung cancer space."" Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, is the largest cause of cancer deaths in the United States.     At the same time, he said, Merck may bolster its argument that Keytruda has proven the broadest possible use to date, with ""clear activity in 13 different tumor types.”Other data points that will be closely watched by oncologists and investors include whether the level of PD-1 protein in a tumor can predict how well the new immunotherapies will work. Earlier this month, Roche said that a mid-stage trial of its experimental immunotherapy, MPDL3280A, showed it doubled the likelihood of survival for lung cancer patients with the highest levels PD-L1.     A separate trial of Merck's Keytruda to be released at ASCO was designed to see whether a higher number of genetic mutations in a tumor can lead to better results in treating colorectal and other cancers.Doctors at the meeting will also hear more on the potential for combining different types of immunotherapies to make them more effective, as well as the high costs associated with multiple treatment regimens. Treatment with Opdivo or Keytruda alone in the United States, for example, costs about $12,500 per month, or $150,000 a year.""Really the name of the game is having overall survival data in your label,"" said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris.

178,"   By Ransdell Pierson  An early-stage study shows Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Opdivo treatment can be safely and effectively paired with relatively low and infrequent dosages of the company's other immunotherapy, Yervoy, for patients with previously untreated lung cancer, researchers said on Monday.Opdivo, whose chemical name is nivolumab, is approved to treat advanced melanoma and the less-common squamous type of non-small cell lung cancer. In a recent late-stage study, it improved survival compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with the more common non-squamous form of lung cancer.To bolster the effectiveness of Opdivo, Bristol-Myers is testing it in combination with Yervoy, which is approved to treat melanoma and, like Opdivo, takes the brakes off the immune system.Company researchers on Monday released updated data from a Phase I study, called Check Mate-12, that involved 148 previously untreated patients with squamous and non-squamous lung cancer. It compared results of four available drug regimens that paired Opdivo and Yervoy.In melanoma studies, Opdivo's effectiveness has been greatly enhanced by adding Yervoy, but with a worrisome increase in side effects. Yervoy, typically taken in 3 milligram doses every three weeks for melanoma, in the lung cancer trial was given at a 1 milligram dose every six weeks in one arm of the study, and at 1 milligram every 12 weeks in another arm. It was taken with 3 milligram doses of Opdivo every two weeks, the way it is used against melanoma and previously treated squamous lung cancer.Some 39 percent of patients taking Opdivo plus Yervoy every 12 weeks saw some reduction in tumors, similar to the 31 percent reduction for those taking Yervoy every 6 weeks.Importantly, 10 percent or fewer of patients in the two arms dropped out of the study because of side effects, little different from those who have taken Opdivo alone in other study arms and half the dropout rate seen among patients that have taken Opdivo with chemotherapy. ""A well tolerated regimen has been achieved, with ability to maintain the additive benefit of (Yervoy)"" to Opdivo, Michael Giordano, head of Bristol-Myers' immuno-oncology program, said in an interview.Opdivo and a similar treatment from Merck & Co called Keytruda block a protein called PD-1 whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. Wall Street expects such drugs to capture combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020.   Results of the study were released at the World Conference on Lung Cancer being held in Denver.

179,"  * Opdivo survival 25 months vs 19.6 for Afinitor - study* Sets up drug to be used beyond melanoma and lung cancerBy Ben HirschlerSept 26 Bristol-Myers Squibb's  immunotherapy drug Opdivo extended kidney cancer survival rates by more than two years in a late-stage trial, setting it up to be used beyond melanoma and lung cancer.The U.S. company said in July the study was stopped early because its drug was more effective than Novartis'  established product Afinitor, but detailed results were only disclosed at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna on Saturday.The successful outcome means Opdivo is the first so-called immune checkpoint inhibitor drug to show an improvement in overall survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a common type of kidney cancer. Opdivo is already approved for melanoma and lung cancer, with most attention focused on the big lung cancer opportunity. But analysts noted that RCC prevalence was twice that of melanoma, pointing to significant commercial upside.Drugs like Opdivo work by targeting molecules that play an important role in the immune system's ability to recognise and attack tumours.Padmanee Sharma of the U.S. MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the lead researchers on the study, said patients taking Opdivo had a median overall survival of 25 months as compared to 19.6 months for those taking Afinitor. A greater proportion of patients also had tumours that shrank in response to the Bristol drug than to the Novartis one, with an objective response rate of 25 percent for Opdivo against 5 percent for Afinitor.""The results are significant and clinically meaningful to patients and healthcare professionals alike,"" Sharma said. ""They are likely to change the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer, whose disease has progressed on prior treatment.""The findings were also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. Michael Giordano, Bristol's head of oncology development, told Reuters the company was working towards filing Opdivo for approval in kidney cancer ""very quickly"" but he declined to give a precise date for submission to regulators.Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe Opdivo could be approved for the new use by early 2016 and the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network might endorse its off-label in kidney cancer before the end of 2015.Bristol is also a testing a combination of Opdivo and its drug Yervoy as a first-line treatment for kidney cancer.Opdivo is a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that blocks a mechanism tumours use to hide from the immune system. It competes with Merck's Keytruda.AstraZeneca, Roche and other drugmakers are also developing similar drugs known as PD-L1 inhibitors.

180,"   By Bill Berkrot and Vidya L Nathan  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first combination of two drugs that help the immune system fight cancer, a therapy regimen that could cost $256,000 a year.Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said the FDA had given the green light to combine its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy to treat advanced or inoperable melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, in patients who do not have a mutation of a gene called BRAF.The approval sets the scene for many more such combinations of expensive treatments currently undergoing clinical trials by numerous drugmakers at a time when the soaring cost of prescription medicines have come under intense criticism from politicians, medical societies and patient advocacy groups alike.Merck & Co, for example, is testing its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with other cancer treatments in at least 10 studies.The accelerated approval was based on results of a trial in which far more patients responded to the combination than to Yervoy alone, and is contingent on Bristol-Myers replicating those results in a larger ongoing Phase III study. Four doses of the combination would cost $141,000, about 6 percent more than the cost of Yervoy alone. Those who respond to the combination would continue receiving Opdivo alone, bringing the cost for a year of treatment to $256,000, a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman told Reuters.Opdivo and Yervoy, bought separately, would cost about $295,000 for just under a year's treatment, according to calculations by cancer specialist Leonard Saltz.The drugs block mechanisms which cancer uses to keep the immune system from attacking tumors. Wall Street analysts forecast sales of immuno-oncology drugs exceeding $20 billion a year by 2020. In the trial that led to approval, 60 percent of combination patients experienced significant tumor shrinkage, including 17 percent who were cancer free, compared with an 11 percent response rate for Yervoy alone.The combination delayed worsening of the cancer for an average of 8.9 months, only four months longer than for Yervoy. Bristol does not yet have data available showing the combination helps patients live longer, likely critical to wide acceptance by doctors.Yervoy was approved in 2011 and Opdivo in late 2014.

181,"  * First-ever approval of immuno-oncology combination - company* Two-drug combination to cost $256,000 a year* Drugs separately cost $295,000 a year - cancer specialist   (Recasts; adds study details, patient population size)By Bill Berkrot and Vidya L NathanOct 1 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first combination of two drugs that help the immune system fight cancer, a therapy regimen that could cost $256,000 a year.Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said the FDA had given the green light to combine its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy to treat advanced or inoperable melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, in patients who do not have a mutation of a gene called BRAF.The approval sets the scene for many more such combinations of expensive treatments currently undergoing clinical trials by numerous drugmakers at a time when the soaring cost of prescription medicines have come under intense criticism from politicians, medical societies and patient advocacy groups alike. Merck & Co, for example, is testing its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with other cancer treatments in at least 10 studies.The accelerated approval was based on results of a trial in which far more patients responded to the combination than to Yervoy alone, and is contingent on Bristol-Myers replicating those results in a larger ongoing Phase III study.Four doses of the combination would cost $141,000, about 6 percent more than the cost of Yervoy alone. Those who respond to the combination would continue receiving Opdivo alone, bringing the cost for a year of treatment to $256,000, a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman told Reuters. Opdivo and Yervoy, bought separately, would cost about $295,000 for just under a year's treatment, according to calculations by cancer specialist Leonard Saltz.The drugs block mechanisms which cancer uses to keep the immune system from attacking tumors. Wall Street analysts forecast sales of immuno-oncology drugs exceeding $20 billion a year by 2020.In the trial that led to approval, 60 percent of combination patients experienced significant tumor shrinkage, including 17 percent who were cancer free, compared with an 11 percent response rate for Yervoy alone. The combination delayed worsening of the cancer for an average of 8.9 months, only four months longer than for Yervoy. Bristol does not yet have data available showing the combination helps patients live longer, likely critical to wide acceptance by doctors.Yervoy was approved in 2011 and Opdivo in late 2014. The two drugs had sales of $783 million in the first half of this year.There are about 11,000 U.S. patients with untreated advanced melanoma.

183,"  (Adds analyst comment, updates share prices)By Deena Beasley and Natalie GroverOct 2 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Merck & Co Inc's immunotherapy, Keytruda, for patients with the most common form of lung cancer whose tumors produce a specific biological marker.The FDA approval for Keytruda in advanced non-small cell lung cancer is for patients whose tumors express PD-L1, a protein targeted by the drug, and includes a companion diagnostic, made by a unit of Agilent Technologies Inc, to measure those protein levels. A Merck spokeswoman said clinical trials found that 22 percent of patients with this type of cancer had PD-L1 scores of at least 50 percent.""The restricted label is generally in line with expectations and is likely to broaden over time as data from additional trials support Keytruda's efficacy in a larger patient population,"" JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note.The FDA decision ""has the potential to transform the way that lung cancer is treated,"" Dr. Edward Garon, associate clinical professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and a lead investigator on Keytruda clinical trials, said in a statement. Merck said the price of Keytruda for health insurers and other payers is around $12,500 per month, or $150,000 a year.Keytruda and another similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient's own immune system to attack the cancer. Wall Street analysts expect cancer immunotherapies to earn combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020.Bristol's Opdivo is approved by the FDA to treat melanoma as well as squamous non-small cell lung cancer, a smaller subset of the disease, but without a requirement for protein testing.Keytruda, now approved for both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, is also approved to treat patients with advanced melanoma.

Lung cancer has a far larger patient population than melanoma, with NSCLC accounting for up to 90 percent of all cases, and is seen as a more lucrative use for the new medicines like Opdivo that help the immune system fight the disease.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with an estimated 221,200 new diagnoses and 158,040 deaths in 2015, the FDA said.

Keytruda and Opdivo list for about $150,000 for a year of treatment, and Ibrance goes for about $118,000.In addition, blood clot and stroke preventer Eliquis, which Pfizer and Bristol share, has begun to take off and is on track for annual sales of nearly $2 billion. ""This is the best innovation-based new product cycle in these companies' storied histories,"" said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. ""Eliquis is just knocking the cover off the ball.""Merck and Bristol are testing their new immuno-oncology drugs in numerous combinations and in dozens of different types of cancer.Pfizer said it expected to introduce a drug from the same PD-1 class as Opdivo and Keytruda in 2017, with one or more additional launches each year through 2022. It plans to have 10 new immuno-oncology drugs in clinical testing by next year.The largest U.S. drugmaker said 15,000 U.S. patients had used Ibrance, which is awaiting European approval. It had sales of $230 million for the quarter. ""A whole slew of (future) blockbuster drugs are getting traction today,"" said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management. ""The pipelines look great.""The three drugmakers all invest heavily in research and development, which led to the new medicines.That stands in stark contrast to the business model of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which is known for buying companies and slashing R&D. The Canadian company has come under fire for its business practices, which include sharply raising prices of the drugs it acquires. The high cost of prescription drugs has become a major topic of the current U.S. presidential campaign, with calls by candidates and others to rein in prices and out-of-pocket expenses to patients.Merck Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier called the pricing discussions ""a lot of noise"" that he does not believe will tarnish the industry's reputation.Pfizer CEO Ian Read said he believed that higher co-pays demanded by insurers were more of a problem for patients than prices charged by drugmakers.""We must preserve the market-based system in the U.S. that enables us to develop breakthrough treatments and cures for patients,"" Read said.Bristol-Myers shares were up 2.5 percent at midday, while Pfizer rose 2.2 percent, and Merck gained 1.4 percent.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2015-10-28,BMY,"Wed Oct 28, 2015 | 11:04am EDT",CORRECTED-WRAPUP 1-Top U.S. drugmakers ride new products to strong results,http://www.reuters.com//article/pharmaceuticals-results-wrapup-1-pix-cor-idUSL1N12R1KO20151028?type=companyNews

Dixy declined to comment on the FAS decision but said its board would meet soon to discuss further steps.The company, which owns 33 percent of Bristol, said in June it planned to gain control of the 1,400-store Russian chain by buying more shares from a company controlled by its own biggest shareholder. Some analysts have questioned the deal at a time when Dixy's revenue growth has slowed, hurt by subdued consumer sentiment against a backdrop of high inflation. Dixy Chief Executive Ilya Yakubson flagged in an interview at the Reuters Russia Investment Summit in September that the company might end up scrapping the deal.Its shares closed 1.5 percent higher on Friday against a 0.7 percent drop in the broader market index.

Analysts questioned the deal at a time when Dixy's revenue growth slowed sharply, hurt by subdued consumer sentiment and intensified competition from the discount stores of X5  and Magnit .Dixy cut its 2015 sales growth forecast in August to 16-20 percent from 20-25 percent, saying it had been slow to react to a drop in consumer purchasing power.Chief Executive Ilya Yakubson told analysts on Friday Dixy was sticking to the guidance and expected like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter to grow after they fell 1.8 percent in July-September. He forecast 2016 to be ""much more positive"" than 2015 although said he would not give any guidance until March.INTO THE RED  Russia's competition watchdog FAS last week blocked Dixy's  plan to buy more Bristol shares, saying the firm had failed to provide requested materials.Dixy bought 31.8 percent of Bristol for 1.8 billion roubles  ($28 million) from its controlling shareholder, tobacco distributor Megapolis, in May, adding to the 1.2 percent it already owned.It had said it planned to borrow in order to buy more Bristol shares and by October its net debt had risen to around 36 billion roubles from 25 billion at the end of 2014.Dixy said on Friday a resulting spike in finance costs and a share in Bristol's net losses contributed to its net profit slipping into the red in the third quarter.It made a net loss of 843 million roubles ($13 million) after a profit a year ago, also due to a foreign exchange loss, while its core profit fell because of higher expansion costs.

207,"   By Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Dec 23 A new class of blood thinners that competes with widely used warfarin should get a boost next year when an ""antidote"" that can reverse the medications' effects in an emergency is expected to enter the market, according to top U.S. heart doctors and investors.Xarelto, from Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson , and Eliquis, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, were approved as safer and more convenient alternatives for preventing blood clots and strokes than warfarin.But there was one hitch: there was no way to quickly restore normal clotting for patients in need of emergency surgery or to stop a major bleeding episode, leading many doctors to hold off on prescribing the drugs.""It may be uncommon, but they're memorable when they happen,"" Dr. Charles Pollack, an emergency physician at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, said of major bleeding events.""We didn't have a specific reversal strategy for these drugs, and I think that left people feeling a bit insecure,"" added Pollack, who has done clinical work on a recently approved antidote to Boehringer Ingelheim's rival blood clot preventer Pradaxa.That is about to change.Small drugmaker Portola Pharmaceuticals this month applied for U.S. approval of a drug called andexanet alfa that rapidly reverses the effect of Xarelto and Eliquis. It is expected to enter the market in 2016.""It will make a big difference,"" said Dr. Mariell Jessup, a cardiologist at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. ""I have many physicians, particularly surgeons, who hate these drugs. They're frightened of them because they've had to deal with the consequences of somebody coming in with trauma,"" while using the new blood thinners.The new drugs cause fewer major bleeding episodes than warfarin and do not require dietary restrictions or constant monitoring as with the decades-old medicine. But major bleeding remains the most worrisome risk of all anti-coagulant therapy as it can be fatal or cause debilitating, long-term problems. Bristol-Myers reported $466 million in global third-quarter sales of Eliquis, which won U.S. approval at the end of 2012, about 18 months after Xarelto. J&J posted U.S. Xarelto sales of $461 million in the quarter, while Bayer reported about $509 million in international sales.There is still a lot of room to grow as warfarin, also prescribed under the brand name Coumadin, commands some 60 percent of the blood thinner market. Morningstar expects annual sales for Xarelto and Eliquis could reach $8 billion for each.PAYERS SEE VALUE  The treatments are about 70 times more expensive than pennies-a-day warfarin, according to Express Scripts Holding Co , the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager. But given the superior safety and convenience, Express Scripts said in a statement that ""the overall value is likely justified.""Health insurer Aetna Inc expects approval of the Portola drug to gradually increase use of Xarelto and Eliquis, said Edmund Pezalla, Aetna's national medical director for pharmaceutical policy and strategy.Xarelto and Eliquis are approved to treat patients with a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation that significantly increases stroke risk, as well as to prevent blood clots following hip or knee replacement, and to treat deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs for Johnson & Johnson's Janssen unit, stressed Xarelto's safety but said availability of Portola's drug would enhance doctor comfort levels.The Xarelto partnership is seeking additional approved uses, with trials underway in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and for reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure or peripheral artery disease. Bristol and Pfizer have a direct-to-consumer television ad campaign to increase Eliquis awareness.""We believe that a reversal agent could be an important consideration for physicians when initiating Eliquis and switching appropriate patients from warfarin to Eliquis,"" Bristol and Pfizer said in a joint statement.Portola's reversal drug ""will certainly help sales. Anybody who was waiting on the sidelines will not be fence-sitting anymore,"" said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Capital Management, which holds Pfizer shares.The drug would become Portola's first product on the market.Cowen and Co forecast $355 million in sales by 2020 for the antidote. Portola is also developing a drug to rival Xarelto and Eliquis.Duke University's Dr. Jerrold Levy predicted that all hospitals will stock the Portola antidote.""It increases the safety margin,"" Levy said.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Will Dunham)",2015-12-23,BMY,"Wed Dec 23, 2015 | 7:00am EST",New blood thinner 'antidote' to help doctors move past warfarin,http://www.reuters.com//article/pharmaceuticals-bloodthinners-idUSL1N14A1YE20151223?type=companyNews

It earned $2.01 per share last year.In contrast, Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) on Thursday predicted relatively flat 2016 earnings following strong gains last year, when sales of new cancer and diabetes drugs offset sharp declines in older medicines.Swiss rivals Roche Holding AG ROG.VX and Novartis AG NOVN.VX have also predicted flat 2016 earnings, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) expects growth of 3.6 percent to 6.2 percent, driven by sales of newer medicines.Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) have not yet provided 2016 earnings expectations, but Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expects them next week to forecast growth of 4.2 percent and 8 percent, respectively.Bristol-Myers, whose $17 billion in annual sales are far below its industry peers, has downsized in recent years by selling off its diabetes drugs and cutting costs. ""They've made courageous decisions to streamline expenses, and their reduced revenue base will also fuel earnings growth,"" said Guggenheim Partners analyst Tony Butler.Ashtyn Evans, an analyst with Edward Jones, said she expects Opdivo eventually to generate annual sales of more than $8 billion.Half of Bristol-Myers' revenue will likely come from Opdivo and other cancer drugs by 2020, Evans said, allowing the company to generate average annual earnings growth in the 20 percent range for the next three to five years. ""Bristol is a lot different than it was just a few years ago,"" Evans said, citing its razor focus on potentially lucrative immuno-oncology drugs, while also developing cardiovascular and anti-inflammation medicines.Sales of Eliquis, which Bristol-Myers markets with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), more than doubled to $602 million in the quarter.The pill was approved in 2012 to prevent blood clots among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Growing numbers of doctors are prescribing it as a safer and more-effective alternative to longstanding oral therapy warfarin. Bristol's better-than-expected quarterly earnings were also due to soaring sales of Opdivo, a new treatment for melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer that is also being tested against other cancers. Sales of the injectable medicine, which was approved in late 2014 and works by taking the brakes off the immune system, jumped to $475 million.    The Princeton, New Jersey-based company said on Thursday it had halted a large trial of Opdivo after a monitoring committee concluded that head and neck cancer patients taking the drug survived longer than those taking standard chemotherapy.Analysts said Opdivo could pick up $1 billion in eventual sales for head and neck cancer, if it is approved for that indication. Earlier on Thursday, Roche spooked investors by forecasting stagnant 2016 earnings. Analysts cited concern that growth could slow for Roche's three big cancer treatments: Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin.Novartis on Wednesday also forecast flat 2016 results, amid generic competition for its Gleevec leukemia drug and disappointing sales of new heart failure medicine, Entresto.

213,"  (Corrects that Opdivo trial stopped after drug shown to prolong survival, not stopped after failing to prolong survival)Jan 28 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  forecast 2016 earnings slightly above Wall Street estimates and said it had halted a large trial of its Opdivo immuno-oncology drug after an independent monitoring committee concluded it prolonged survival compared to standard therapy for head and neck cancer.While the U.S. drugmaker posted a fourth-quarter net loss on Thursday, results were stronger than expected, due in part to robust sales of Opdivo and its Eliquis pill to prevent blood clots.Bristol-Myers forecast 2016 earnings of $2.30 to $2.40 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average had expected $2.29, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The full-year outlook would reflect a gain of up to 19.4 percent from 2015 and make Bristol-Myers an earnings-growth pacesetter for the industry.Sales of Eliquis, co-marketed with Pfizer Inc, more than doubled to $602 million in the fourth quarter. The pill was approved in 2012 to prevent blood clots among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Its global sales had risen slowly until the past year, when far more doctors began prescribing it as a safer and more-effective alternative to longstanding oral therapy warfarin. Bristol-Myers results also benefited from gangbuster sales of Opdivo, a new treatment for melanoma and lung cancer that is also being tested against a range of other cancers. The injectable medicine, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, generated sales of $475 million. Bristol said it lost $138 million, or 8 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit of $13 million, or 1 cent per share.Excluding special items, including those from acquisitions of drugmakers Five Prime Therapeutics and Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc, Bristol earned 38 cents per share.

222,"  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) ratcheted up its 2016 profit view after trouncing first-quarter sales and earnings forecasts on strong demand for its new Opdivo immuno-oncology drug and Eliquis blood clot preventer.The U.S. drugmaker, whose shares rose nearly 4 percent, said on Thursday that net income rose to $1.20 billion, or 71 cents per share, from $1.19 billion, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, including litigation costs, Bristol-Myers earned 74 cents per share, well above the analysts' average estimate of 65 cents compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 9 percent to $4.39 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts of $4.25 billion. It would have increased 11 percent if not for the strong dollar, which lowers the value of sales outside the United States.Based on the first-quarter results, Bristol-Myers said it expected full-year earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.

The updated outlook would reflect earnings growth of up to 29 percent from last year.Sales of Opdivo, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, soared 40 percent to $704 million in the quarter, putting them on track for nearly $3 billion this year. Approved in late 2014 to treat melanoma, Opdivo later won approvals to treat lung and kidney cancer and is being tested against a wide array of other types of cancer.

224,"   By Joyce Lee | SEOUL  SEOUL Samsung Biologics Co Ltd, a contract manufacturer of biotech drugs for global pharmaceutical firms, said it was planning an IPO this year, an offering that analysts have estimated as being worth as much as $2.6 billion.The IPO is aimed at helping fund an ambitious expansion in production capacity to make it the world's largest contract manufacturer. It plans to pick advisers for the offering in May, amid a likely record year for Seoul IPOs.Founded in 2011, Samsung Biologics has the third-largest capacity among global contract manufacturers and counts Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) among its clients.Analysts have estimated the company's potential market value at 10 trillion won ($8.7 billion) or more, and the offering size at around 2-3 trillion won. Biotech drugs, which are complex molecules generated by living cells, accounted for seven of the world's ten best-selling drugs in 2015. The global market for biotech drugs is expected to grow to $278 billion in 2020, up 52 percent from 2015 levels, according to data provider Evaluate Pharma, as aging populations in many countries fuel demand for medicine.Samsung Biologics is 51 percent owned by Samsung C&T Corp (028260.KS), the de facto holding company of Samsung Group [SAGR.UL]. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (028260.KS) is the second-largest shareholder with a 46.8 percent stake.  The company owns 91 percent of Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd, an unlisted developer of biosimilar drugs, or copies of biotech drugs.Seoul is expecting a bumper year in IPOs on a stocks revival and conglomerate needs to streamline structures, smooth paths toward management succession or ease debt burdens. Bankers expect this year's proceeds to be at least $10 billion, eclipsing 2010's high of $8.5 billion.Samsung Biologics last year said it would build an additional 180,000 liter plant, bringing combined investment in production lines for the 2011-2018 period to 2 trillion won.

230,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot is a big believer in science, and the biggest experiment of his career is the reinvention of the drugmaker. The $500 million corporate headquarters and research hub emerging amid cranes on the southern edge of the university town of Cambridge symbolizes his aim to create a science-led company with uniquely close ties to academia.For employees, these are uncomfortable times. Thousands of job have been cut globally at the company in the past three years, with more to come. Some staff are also reluctant to move to Cambridge, with its high house prices, from north-west England where the company has a strong presence dating from its time as part of the old ICI chemicals empire. Soriot, however, relishes the chance to shake things up by setting up home near world-renowned university labs - where he says the firm is better placed to hire the ""best of the best"" - while shrinking its operations to focus on core areas like cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular disease. ""In the past, we've had too much stability,"" the CEO said in an interview with Reuters that gives some of the clearest indications yet of the scale of the cultural change he intends to push through at the company.  ""We had people who never moved and turnover of 1 or 2 percent. That might sound good but it's actually not, because you don't have new ideas flowing through the place."" The stakes are high. Two years after spurning a $100 billion bid from Pfizer, AstraZeneca is going through the biggest ""cliff"" of patent expiries the drug industry has ever seen, wiping off more than half of its sales - or $17 billion - in 2011-2017.That has forced Soriot to seek new routes to profit and his overhaul of the company is now entering a pivotal phase, with make-or-break trial results and drug approvals due over the next 12 months, coinciding with the move to Cambridge. As with any experiment, the outcome of Soriot's reinvention is uncertain - and investors are divided. Neil Woodford of Woodford Investment Management, the seventh largest AstraZeneca shareholder, is convinced the company will re-emerge as a successful player focused on specialty drugs like cancer treatments rather than mass-market medicines. He has added to his stake recently. But Andy Smith, chief investment officer at fund manager Mann Bioinvest, says Soriot has yet to prove his plan will pay off. ""The big question hanging over his tenure is how close he can get to showing actual value from the pipeline, rather than promised value,"" he said.   'IMPLODING' No other pharmaceutical company has moved itself wholesale to an academic center. Soriot argues the move is already paying off for some 1,600 staff, nearly a quarter of its UK workforce, now in rented space around Cambridge who are liaising far more closely with academic researchers.""It is fundamentally changing the way we operate,"" said the 56-year-old, who trained as a veterinarian in France. Most of the staff will move into the new building from late 2017.Soriot said he had no choice but to overhaul AstraZeneca when he took over in October 2012, due to the patent ""cliff"".""The company was imploding,"" he said bluntly.His answer has been to invest in internal research and bolt-on acquisitions, including more than $7 billion of deals at the end of 2015, to rebuild the company's drug pipeline.     This includes cancer drugs that boost the immune system, which are the hottest area of drug research right now, although AstraZeneca also has high hopes for other approaches to fighting tumors.That makes oncology the area with the greatest potential to drive future sales at AstraZeneca, as the company grapples with a wave of patent expiries on older products, such as its cholesterol fighter Crestor and stomach acid pill Nexium.Investors are anxious for proof Soriot's prescription will work, since AstraZeneca shares are languishing 28 percent below the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer and earnings are expected to fall in 2016 and 2017.AstraZeneca has also had to cope recently with some senior executive departures, including the loss on Tuesday of its North America head to Novartis. At the height of the takeover battle, the company went public with a forecast that sales would rise by three-quarters to $45 billion by 2023 - a hostage to fortune, perhaps, but a target Soriot remains confident will be met. ""I might not be here to see if we achieve that in 2023 but people won't have to wait until then. If we succeed, the share price will reflect the value of the company much earlier than that,"" he said. ""I think it is going to take another 12 months and then hopefully we can show people what they want to see.""      STEPS FORWARD, BACK   So far, there have been some steps forward, like success with lung cancer drug Tagrisso and with good results for a new asthma drug.  But there have also been setbacks, including the loss of a fast-to-market opportunity for AstraZeneca's big immuno-oncology hope durvalumab. The latter has increased the pressure to prove that a combination treatment mixing durvalumab and tremelimumab can help in lung cancer, giving AstraZeneca a foothold in a market currently dominated by Bristol-Myers Squibb.""Pascal has played his hand well but now he's at the point where it gets harder,"" said one top executive at a rival company. ""He's going down to the valley floor on earnings and we don't know how the clinical data will play out to get the business up the other side.""    AstraZeneca has also used so-called externalization income from licensing out non-core products to underpin profits, leading to criticism over earnings quality from some analysts.  With R&D spending equivalent to 24 percent of sales, AstraZeneca's science budget exceeds the industry average. But Soriot aims to push selling, general and administrative expenses down to 30-32 percent from 35 percent. The CEO says investors need patience to see through a turnaround story that, with luck, will mirror the recovery Bristol-Myers, now the star of the pharma sector.""There will be a tipping point where people see a sufficient number of projects progressing positively and then they can see the future is bright.""

This includes cancer drugs that boost the immune system, which are the hottest area of drug research right now, although AstraZeneca also has high hopes for other approaches to fighting tumors.That makes oncology the area with the greatest potential to drive future sales at AstraZeneca, as the company grapples with a wave of patent expiries on older products, such as its cholesterol fighter Crestor and stomach acid pill Nexium.Investors are anxious for proof Soriot's prescription will work, since AstraZeneca shares are languishing 28 percent below the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer and earnings are expected to fall in 2016 and 2017.AstraZeneca has also had to cope recently with some senior executive departures, including the loss on Tuesday of its North America head to Novartis. At the height of the takeover battle, the company went public with a forecast that sales would rise by three-quarters to $45 billion by 2023 - a hostage to fortune, perhaps, but a target Soriot remains confident will be met. ""I might not be here to see if we achieve that in 2023 but people won't have to wait until then. If we succeed, the share price will reflect the value of the company much earlier than that,"" he said. ""I think it is going to take another 12 months and then hopefully we can show people what they want to see.""      STEPS FORWARD, BACK   So far, there have been some steps forward, like success with lung cancer drug Tagrisso and with good results for a new asthma drug.  But there have also been setbacks, including the loss of a fast-to-market opportunity for AstraZeneca's big immuno-oncology hope durvalumab. The latter has increased the pressure to prove that a combination treatment mixing durvalumab and tremelimumab can help in lung cancer, giving AstraZeneca a foothold in a market currently dominated by Bristol-Myers Squibb.""Pascal has played his hand well but now he's at the point where it gets harder,"" said one top executive at a rival company. ""He's going down to the valley floor on earnings and we don't know how the clinical data will play out to get the business up the other side.""    AstraZeneca has also used so-called externalization income from licensing out non-core products to underpin profits, leading to criticism over earnings quality from some analysts.  With R&D spending equivalent to 24 percent of sales, AstraZeneca's science budget exceeds the industry average. But Soriot aims to push selling, general and administrative expenses down to 30-32 percent from 35 percent. The CEO says investors need patience to see through a turnaround story that, with luck, will mirror the recovery Bristol-Myers, now the star of the pharma sector.""There will be a tipping point where people see a sufficient number of projects progressing positively and then they can see the future is bright.""

247,"   By Carl O'Donnell  Some of the world's largest drug companies are taking out their checkbooks for acquisitions of smaller peers whose cancer drugs have the potential to cure not just patients, but corporate growth prospects as well.After decades in which progress meant extending life by weeks or months, new cancer treatments hold promise of adding years to patients' lives and billions of dollars in revenue to the companies that own them. Some of the most promising, known as immunotherapy, harness the body's own defense system to fight cancer.For many pharmaceutical companies, this wave of innovation couldn't have come at a better time. A generation of mainstay drugs have gone off patent, raising the stakes for companies vying for a foothold in the burgeoning oncology market.In recent months, executives at many big pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in building cancer treatment portfolios through acquisitions.They range from well-established incumbents, such as Roche Holding AG and Amgen Inc, to relative outsiders, including Sanofi and Gilead, according to public statements from the companies and several sources familiar with the companies plans and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.Amgen declined to comment. Roche, Sanofi and Gilead did not respond to requests to comment.Among the most logical acquisition targets are Incyte Corporation and Seattle Genetics, which have respective market capitalizations of about $16 billion and $6 billion, said Michael King, a biotechnology analyst at JMP Securities.Incyte's blood cancer drug, Jakafi, produced more than $600 million in sales last year. Seattle Genetic's lymphoma drug, ADCETRIS, earned revenues of nearly $450 million. Both companies declined to comment.The acquisition of promising cancer drugs is ""going to be a major theme in the life sciences sector for the next several years,"" said Kennen MacKay, a biotechnology analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.MORE DEALS EXPECTED  Acquisitions of cancer drug companies accounted for about 20 percent of the $63 billion in pharmaceutical and biotech M&A announced this year, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Cancer deals accounted for a smaller share - 16 percent - of a larger pharmaceutical M&A pie during the first half of 2015.Deals involving cancer drugs are expected to rise in the second half of the year, as corporate boards of potential target companies begin to accept the lower valuations the sector has seen in recent months and become more open to deals.The Nasdaq Biotech Index, a common measure of life sciences companies' performance, has plunged more than 30 percent from 2015 highs, as political criticism of drug prices fueled investor concerns.Global spending on cancer drugs is on the rise and may reach $178 billion by 2020, up from $107 billion in 2015, according to market research firm IMS Health. About half of that will occur in the United States.That makes oncology medication to be one of the single biggest anticipated drivers of prescription drug revenue growth over the next five years, according to data from consultancy Ernst and Young. ""I think an uptick in activity is very likely,"" said Jeff Greene, global transactions leader for life sciences at EY. ""We have seen some big deals already, and we are likely to see even more, large and small, in the second half of this year.""  Recent deals include AbbVie Inc's $10 billion acquisition of lung cancer company Stemcentryx, Jazz Pharmaceuticals' $1.5 billion takeover of leukemia drug maker Celator Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's roughly $500 million acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals.More dealmaking is on the way. Earlier this month, Medivation Inc, a U.S. prostate cancer drug company with a market capitalization of $10 billion, said it would open its books to Sanofi SA as part of a sale process that sources said also has attracted Pfizer Inc and Celgene Corp.REFRESHING PORTFOLIOS For some, laying claim to a piece of the oncology sector's blockbuster growth could help offset the waning fortunes of mature drugs. For example, Sanofi's blockbuster diabetes drug, Lantus, will face heightened generic drug competition in December. Gilead faces increased pressure on its liver disease franchise, which makes up two-thirds of its revenues.Abbvie, which purchased two oncology companies in the past year, Pharmacyclics and Stemcentryx, is facing potential competition for its biggest drug, Humira, for arthritis. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel recently recommended approval of an application by Amgen to sell a similar product.Best equipped to play a leading role are major pharmaceutical companies because bringing the new generation of cancer medicines under development to market requires scale and resources.""Oncology is a go-big-or-go-home category,"" said Brian Corvino, a life sciences consultant at Decision Resources Group. ""The amount of investment to develop and commercialize oncology drugs is massive and only becomes efficient at a certain scale.""The benefits of scale have only grown in recent years, as insurance companies increasingly have demanded drug makers justify prices in terms of the value they add to patient's health.A large player in oncology is better equipped to partner with health care providers to collect data on a drug's efficacy and argue the case to major insurers, Corvino said.From an acquirer's perspective, the most attractive targets are companies with drugs that are already generating some revenue and are treating diseases where competition is scant.""For players that are looking to build an oncology presence, you need to buy a company that already has a blockbuster out there,"" MacKay said.Companies whose drugs are still in development pose greater risk. Shares of Juno Therapeutics, for example, dropped about 30 percent earlier this month when the FDA placed a hold on a clinical trial for its main leukemia drug after two people died. The hold was later reversed and the stock partly recovered.

252,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co reported disappointing second-quarter sales of its Yervoy melanoma treatment on Thursday, raising concerns about the long-term prospects for one of its most important cancer medicines and sending its shares lower. Sales of Yervoy, often used in combination with either Bristol-Myers' newer Opdivo immuno-therapy or with Merck & Co's similar Keytruda, fell 19 percent to $241 million.BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said Yervoy sales were about $50 million below Wall Street forecasts, as doctors used Optivo or Keytruda instead, as standalone treatments. All three medicines work by taking the brakes off the immune system.""Yervoy appears to be rapidly losing share to (Opdivo and Keytruda)"" outside the United States, Arfaei said in a research note.  The company's shares were down 1.8 percent at $75.09 in late morning trading. Company revenue jumped 17 percent to $4.87 billion, about $200 million above analyst predictions. Still, most of the unexpected sales gains came from hepatitis C medicines that are expected to soon lose ground to newer treatments.    Bristol-Myers' most important medicine is Opdivo, a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that is also approved to treat lung cancer and kidney cancer. Approved in late 2014, its sales hit $840 million in the quarter and is expected to keep growing by leaps and bounds despite competition from Merck's Keytruda.Bristol-Myers shares trade at about 23 times the company's expected 2017 per-share earnings, well above the approximate price-earnings ratio of 16 for its large rivals, based on optimism for widening use of Opdivo and Yervoy.  Strong growth was seen for Eliquis, a pill co-marketed by Pfizer Inc, which is used to prevent blood clots in patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Its sales soared 78 percent to $777 million, helped by clinical data that suggest it is safer and more effective than rival new oral therapies.Sales of Orencia, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, rose 29 percent to $593 million, about $70 million above Wall Street forecasts. Bristol-Myers earned $1.17 billion, or 69 cents a share, compared with a loss of $130 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier, when it took a big acquisition-related charge. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 69 cents per share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of 67 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Bristol-Myers said it now expects 2016 earnings of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, slightly higher than its earlier forecast of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.

Sales of Yervoy, often used in combination with either Bristol-Myers' newer Opdivo immuno-therapy or with Merck & Co's similar Keytruda, fell 19 percent to $241 million.BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said Yervoy sales were about $50 million below Wall Street forecasts, as doctors used Optivo or Keytruda instead, as standalone treatments. All three medicines work by taking the brakes off the immune system.""Yervoy appears to be rapidly losing share to (Opdivo and Keytruda)"" outside the United States, Arfaei said in a research note.  The company's shares were down 1.8 percent at $75.09 in late morning trading. Company revenue jumped 17 percent to $4.87 billion, about $200 million above analyst predictions. Still, most of the unexpected sales gains came from hepatitis C medicines that are expected to soon lose ground to newer treatments.    Bristol-Myers' most important medicine is Opdivo, a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that is also approved to treat lung cancer and kidney cancer. Approved in late 2014, its sales hit $840 million in the quarter and is expected to keep growing by leaps and bounds despite competition from Merck's Keytruda.Bristol-Myers shares trade at about 23 times the company's expected 2017 per-share earnings, well above the approximate price-earnings ratio of 16 for its large rivals, based on optimism for widening use of Opdivo and Yervoy.  Strong growth was seen for Eliquis, a pill co-marketed by Pfizer Inc, which is used to prevent blood clots in patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Its sales soared 78 percent to $777 million, helped by clinical data that suggest it is safer and more effective than rival new oral therapies.Sales of Orencia, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, rose 29 percent to $593 million, about $70 million above Wall Street forecasts. Bristol-Myers earned $1.17 billion, or 69 cents a share, compared with a loss of $130 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier, when it took a big acquisition-related charge. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 69 cents per share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of 67 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Bristol-Myers said it now expects 2016 earnings of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, slightly higher than its earlier forecast of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.

256,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said its blockbuster Opdivo immunotherapy failed to slow progression of symptoms in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, a major setback expected to benefit Merck & Co's rival medicine.Shares of Bristol-Myers fell almost 16 percent to $63.54 on Friday after the company announced failure of the late-stage trial. Shares of Merck gained 8.7 percent to $62.89. ""This is the worst-case scenario"" for Opdivo and Bristol-Myers, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. ""There appears to be no silver lining.""Opdivo had been considered the clear leader in a costly new class of medicines called checkpoint inhibitors that work by taking the brakes off the immune system. Its second-quarter sales of $840 million were more than double those of Merck's Keytruda. Opdivo won approval in March 2015 for treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had previously failed to benefit from chemotherapy. Six months later, Keytruda received approval for a similar patient population. Meanwhile, both companies raced to complete large trials to see if their drugs, which each cost about $150,000 a year, would also benefit patients who had never previously been treated for the most common form of lung cancer. The trials compared the drugs against chemotherapy. ""Obviously the results of this trial are disappointing,"" Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio said in an interview, saying that the data suggests there is no role in the foreseeable future for Opdivo as a standalone medicine for previously untreated lung cancer.Patients in the Opdivo trial had tumors with low levels of PD-L1, a protein whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors. Those in the successful Merck trial, by contrast, were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1 and represented a smaller percentage of the lung cancer population.Caforio said the best hope now for Opdivo in front-line treatment of lung cancer is combination therapy. The company is conducting a late-stage study with more than 2,000 patients in which Opdivo will be combined with Bristol-Myers' other approved immunotherapy, Yervoy. The data is expected by early 2018. ""That study will provide the definitive answer of the role of combination immunotherapy in the front-line lung cancer setting,"" he said.Data in June from a large clinical study showed Keytruda was effective in newly treated patients, not only in delaying progression of lung cancer symptoms but also in prolonging survival. The trial was stopped so that all patients could receive Keytruda.The data spurred hopes that U.S. regulators would soon expand approved use of the Merck drug. Complete data for the study has not yet been released.  Now that Bristol-Myers' drug has failed in that effort, Merck's medicine could have a better chance to catch up with Opdivo's far larger sales. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Opdivo, Keytruda and similar drugs in development had been expected to capture peak annual combined sales of $10 billion to $15 billion from lung cancer, with Bristol-Myers winning the lion's share.""Today's news very much helps level the playing field and is a major boost for Merck,"" Anderson said in a research note.Opdivo and Keytruda are also approved to treat advanced melanoma and are being studied against a wide range of other types of cancer.

259,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shares hit a record high on Friday, breaching for the first time the 55 pounds a share level offered by Pfizer (PFE.N) in 2014 during the U.S. group's abortive $100 billion attempt to buy the drugmaker.The British firm's stock has been on a roll recently, helped by a falling pound and speculation that Switzerland's Novartis (NOVN.S) might be next to launch a bid. However, the shares were lifted to a high of 55.05 pounds by the misfortunes of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N).The failure of Bristol's immunotherapy drug Opdivo to slow disease progression in previously untreated patients with lung cancer as hoped was seen by investors as good news for rivals Merck & Co (MRK.N) and AstraZeneca. Analysts at Leerink, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank said the negative result with Opdivo increased the potential market opportunity for AstraZeneca's keenly watched combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab.Crucial clinical trial results with durvalumab, both on its own and in combination with tremelimumab, are due next year. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes AstraZeneca can become a major player in cancer drugs that bolster the immune system. And its ability to carve out billions of dollars in potential sales hinges not only on the effectiveness of its own products but on the competitive profile of rivals. Cancer is currently the hottest area of research across the drugs industry and some analysts believe this could make AstraZeneca a takeover target once again, with speculation turning last week to Novartis as a bidder.

268,"   By Ben Hirschler | COPENHAGEN  COPENHAGEN The failure of Bristol-Myers Squibb's blockbuster Opdivo immunotherapy in previously untreated lung cancer patients has opened up the market for AstraZeneca, its chief executive believes.""Suddenly, this trial news opens quite some opportunities for us, in both monotherapy and combination therapy,"" Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told Reuters on Saturday, in his first comments since the Opdivo trial flop in August.Soriot is in Copenhagen for the European Society for Medical Oncology congress, where he and his team will be scouring data from competitors to determine how best to fine-tune their own clinical work to maximize its chance of success.The timing has been fortuitous for the British drugmaker, which can now take advantage of the experience of its rivals.At stake is a chunk of a hugely promising new market for cancer treatments that fight tumors by boosting the immune system. Industry analysts forecast such drugs could eventually generate annual sales of $30 billion to $40 billion, with lung cancer seen as the biggest opportunity.Much of the clinical focus is on the best way to select patients likely to benefit from the new and expensive medicines, by using biomarkers to assess their tumors. While the Opdivo trial included patients with low levels of a protein called PD-L1, a separate trial found Merck's similar drug Keytruda worked well in a much smaller group of patients expressing at least 50 percent PD-L1. That gives AstraZeneca the opportunity to steer a path between its two rivals by refining the PD-L1 benchmarks used in its own keenly awaited clinical trial, known as MYSTIC, which is expected to report results early next year.""It gives us a chance to do what BMS was trying to do, but do it in a less risky manner, by expanding the population from the 50 percent PD-L1 cut-off to a bit broader,"" Soriot said.AstraZeneca’s rival to Opdivo and Keytruda is durvalumab, which is being tested on its own and with another immunotherapy called tremelimumab. The British company is currently planning to look at how well its treatment fares among patients with a 25 percent PD-L1 expression level or more, but it has the flexibility to amend this.Roche also has a rival immunotherapy called Tecentriq, which has proved effective in previously treated lung cancer patients, and the fact that AstraZeneca looks like being fourth to market has been viewed negatively by many investors.Soriot argues this ignores the fact his company has the potential to leap ahead in combination therapy, which could well become the main choice for most lung cancer patients.""We're coming from a place where everybody thought we were behind and we have a very good chance to play in both the monotherapy and combination segments,"" Soriot said. ""Even if BMS were to catch up with us in combination, there would still only be two companies with these regimens.""Currently, Bristol's competing immunotherapy combination is not expected to produce clinical trial results until 2018.Furthermore, AstraZeneca has another card up its sleeve in the form of a so-called priority review voucher from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which Soriot said could be used, if needed, to help it seek rapid approval.""Being first is definitely important,"" Soriot said.

269,"   By Ben Hirschler | COPENHAGEN  COPENHAGEN Lung cancer patients on Roche's immune system-boosting drug Tecentriq lived on average 4.2 months longer than those taking chemotherapy in a pivotal study, pressuring Bristol-Myers Squibb's dominant position in the field.The trial involved second-line patients, who have already used chemotherapy, and it found the Roche drug worked even in people with low or no levels of a protein called PD-L1, which is often used to test suitability for immunotherapy.The study results were presented at the annual European Society of Medical Oncology congress on Sunday.Bristol's Opdivo is currently the only immunotherapy drug approved without a PD-L1 test for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease. Merck & Co's Keytruda requires a test. That has favored Opdivo and fueled its sales, but the arrival of a rival with the same broad effectiveness now promises increased competition. U.S. regulators are due to decide whether to approve Tecentriq in lung cancer by Oct. 19. The Roche drug is already cleared for use in bladder cancer.Tecentriq, Opdivo and Keytruda are the first of a highly promising class of immunotherapy drugs that are revolutionizing cancer treatment and are tipped to generate huge sales. Lung cancer, the biggest cancer killer globally, is the top commercial opportunity.Analysts believe Tecentriq sales across all cancers will reach $4 billion in 2021, according to consensus figures compiled by Thomson Reuters. In the 1,225-patient Roche study, the mean survival for patients on Tecentriq was 13.8 months, which was 27 percent better than the 9.6 months seen among those on docetaxel chemotherapy.The benefit of the new drug was greatest in patients with high levels of PD-L1 but even in people with no PD-L1 expression there was still a significant improvement. Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf said the findings suggested doctors had a problem if they planned to use a negative PD-L1 reading as a reason to exclude second-line NSCLC patients from treatment.Companies are also racing to prove that immunotherapy can help in first-line NSCLC, where it would replace chemotherapy as the initial drug given. Here, however, the idea of giving immunotherapy to all patients has proved problematic, as evidenced by the failure of a recent Bristol trial.Roche has eight late-stage Phase III lung studies under way evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other treatments in patients with early and advanced stages of lung cancer.

270,"  * Keytruda cuts risk of death 40 pct in big lung cancer study* Drug also improves outcomes when given with chemotherapyBy Ben HirschlerCOPENHAGEN, Oct 9 Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy.As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker.In contrast to rival Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose Opdivo drug failed to help such first-line patients, Keytruda was targeted at people who express high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy.U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at the annual European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress.The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study.Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low.In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response.Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old.Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer, the biggest cancer killer globally, viewed as the largest market.Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO.These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months.The failure of Opdivo to work for ""all comers"" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.Results of Merck's two trials were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet Oncology journal.

In the 1,225-patient Roche study, the mean survival for patients on Tecentriq was 13.8 months, which was 27 percent better than the 9.6 months seen among those on docetaxel chemotherapy.The benefit of the new drug was greatest in patients with high levels of PD-L1 but even in people with no PD-L1 expression there was still a significant improvement. Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf said the findings suggested doctors had a problem if they planned to use a negative PD-L1 reading as a reason to exclude second-line NSCLC patients from treatment.Companies are also racing to prove that immunotherapy can help in first-line NSCLC, where it would replace chemotherapy as the initial drug given. Here, however, the idea of giving immunotherapy to all patients has proved problematic, as evidenced by the failure of a recent Bristol trial.Roche has eight late-stage Phase III lung studies under way evaluating Tecentriq alone or in combination with other treatments in patients with early and advanced stages of lung cancer.

272,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot  New data is likely to prompt doctors to abandon Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy Opdivo in favor of Merck & Co's rival Keytruda in a large segment of the lucrative lung cancer market, analysts said on Monday.    The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol's shares plunging 10 percent.    The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study. Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them.Opdivo had been considered the leader among the new class of medicines. It generated $840 million of sales in the second quarter, more than double those of Keytruda.The view of the rival drugs began to change in August, with the surprise announcement by Bristol-Myers that Opdivo had failed to best older chemotherapies in the Phase III trial.Details of the trial unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen only heightened those   concerns. Patients on Opdivo went 4.2 months before their disease worsened versus 5.9 months for those on chemo, although the difference was not deemed statistically significant.""This data represented a worst-case scenario for Opdivo,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.  The Opdivo trial enrolled patients regardless of their tumor's level of PD-L1 expression, a protein targeted by the drug whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from treatment with the new medicines.Meanwhile, researchers reported that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression in previously untreated patients, and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy.Patients in the Merck trial were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1, a narrower segment of the lung cancer population than those in the Bristol-Myers study. ""Merck will completely 'own' the segment of first-line lung cancer patients who have high PD-L1 expression levels, and Bristol Myers will capture nothing really,"" Anderson said.Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, but analysts said they expect current off-label prescribing of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer to dry up now.In addition, competition in second-line lung cancer is soon expected to intensify with the anticipated approval of Roche's immunotherapy Tecentriq, which is now approved to treat bladder cancer. Both Keytruda and Tecentriq are given every three weeks, while Opdivo is administered every two weeks, which is seen as a convenience disadvantage.   ""The nearly inexplicable failure of (Opdivo) at every level of PD-L1 expression ... puts Merck in the driver's seat in first-line lung cancer for at least the next 12-18 months,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez.Calling the Keytruda data ""stunning,” Fernandez said, ""We fully expect Merck to retain a significant place at the table long term.""

275,"   By John Miller | ZURICH  ZURICH Roche said on Thursday strong sales of new medicines like cancer immunotherapy drug Tecentriq would help to sustain the company's growth as patents on older drugs start to expire.Chief Executive Severin Schwan is betting he can stay ahead of the sales erosion with new medicines that include five launched in 2016 alone.""That is an unprecedented number of launches of new medicines in a short period of time,"" Schwan said on a conference call after Roche reported third-quarter sales figures. ""Our product pipeline is developing very well.""The Swiss drugmaker's three established cancer blockbusters Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, which account for annual sales of nearly 20 billion Swiss francs ($21 billion), all face biosimilar competition by the end of the decade.But so far this year, Tecentriq has won approval for bladder and lung cancer, Alecensa for lung cancer, Cotellic for skin cancer and Venclaxta for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Roche's multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus is slated for U.S. approval before the year is over. Tecentriq has brought in 77 million Swiss francs ($78 million) since its U.S. approval in May for bladder cancer. That revenue is due to accelerate after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week gave the a green light for the drug to be used against lung cancer. Analysts are counting on it, too, as revenue growth from broad-based cancer drug Avastin, Rituxan for blood cancer, and breast cancer therapy Herceptin begins to slow.All three missed analyst expectations in the third quarter, and Avastin in particular, which fell 3 percent in the third quarter, led by a decline in the United States.  Overall, quarterly sales at the world's biggest maker of cancer drugs rose 3 percent to 12.48 billion francs, missing the average estimate of 12.68 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.""The momentum seems weakening in the haematology and breast cancer franchises in the U.S. and Japanese territories,"" Bruno Bulic, an analyst at Baader Helvea, said. ""We see the entry of Tecentriq coming timely."" He has a ""buy"" recommendation on Roche's shares.They fell 0.2 percent by 0930 GMT, in line with the decline of the European health care sector index. Schwan still expected Roche's 2016 sales to grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate at constant exchange rates, with core earnings rising faster than sales. The company also confirmed its full-year outlook.He declined to comment on Novartis's efforts to sell its $14 billion stake in Roche, saying any disposal was a matter for his cross-town rival to resolve. Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez has said he may sell the stake without demanding a premium.($1 = 0.9889 Swiss francs) (Editing by Michael Shields and Jane Merriman)",2016-10-20,BMY,"Thu Oct 20, 2016 | 10:53am EDT",UPDATE 2-Roche bets on new cancer drugs to offset patent expiries,http://www.reuters.com//article/roche-results-idUSL8N1CQ0PV?type=companyNews

277,"   By Ben Hirschler and Dipika Jain  Merck & Co has won U.S. approval to market its immunotherapy Keytruda for use in previously untreated lung cancer patients two months ahead of schedule, making it the only such drug cleared for first-line treatment. The green light from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced by the U.S. drugmaker late on Monday, confirms Merck's leading position in the hot area of medicines that fight tumors by harnessing the body's immune system.Keytruda's latest approval is for treating first-line metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with high-levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy.The FDA had set a target date of Dec. 24 for deciding on this new use. Expectations for Keytruda, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, have been building since its success in treating selected untreated patients. Annual sales of the drug are now expected to reach $8.1 billion in 2021, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. Rival Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug Opdivo failed in a late-stage trial for the same indication. Bristol had tried to make Opdivo work irrespective of PD-L1 levels. In the event, it disappointed comprehensively in a major study. Keytruda and Opdivo, along with Roche's  rival immunotherapy Tecentriq, are already approved for lung cancer patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy.Keytruda had originally only been cleared in this second-line setting for patients with high PD-L1 levels but the FDA also expanded this on Monday to allow for treatment where PD-L1 expression is just 1 percent or more. Immunotherapy drugs are used additionally in melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the bladder, kidney, head and neck, but lung cancer, the world's biggest cancer killer with an annual death toll of 1.6 million, is the biggest potential market.Although doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, the FDA's first-line clearance of Keytruda could greatly increase the number of patients taking the drug.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said the news should cement Merck's position as leader in the first-line lung cancer field for at least the next 12 to 18 months, after when the battle is likely to shift to new combination therapies. Only a quarter to a third of non-small cell lung cancer patients have tumors with at least 50 percent of cells producing PD-L1, making them suitable for first-line Keytruda, so around 70 percent of the market is still up for grabs.As a result, the race is now on between Merck, Bristol, Roche and AstraZeneca to find smart ways for combining treatments, either by adding chemotherapy or using two different immunotherapies in tandem.Merck's first-line approval was based on data from a late-stage study which showed Keytruda achieved superior progression-free and overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1.

284,"  ZURICH Roche is pressing ahead with two skin cancer trials that combine its immunotherapy Tecentriq with other drugs after early data showed the treatments were well-tolerated and effective in a small number of patients, the company said Monday.One study combined Tecentriq with Cotellic and Zelboraf in 30 patients with untreated BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma, the other Tecentriq with Cotellic for 10 patients with BRAF-wild-type and BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma. Both now move into phase III late-stage pivotal trials.After winning approval for Tecentriq earlier this year, first for bladder cancer and more recently for lung cancer, Roche is now trying it with other drugs in hopes that new combinations will result in potent weapons against cancer. Of Roche's 50 immunotherapy trials underway, 40 are with different combinations of medicines. ""We are encouraged by these early results which demonstrate a high proportion of people responded to these investigational combination therapies,"" said Sandra Horning, Roche's chief medical officer, in a statement. Though the Roche studies are just getting off the ground, analysts said the news so far looks good. ""Even when the data they are presenting was taken from a sample of only a few patients, the efficacy without the use of any chemotherapy is certainly extraordinarily high,"" Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath wrote in a note to investors.Other companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, are also pursuing immunotherapy combinations.

288,"  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Thursday its blockbuster immunotherapy Opdivo helped patients with advanced stomach cancer live longer in a late-stage study, becoming the first drug of its kind to show a survival benefit in these patients.Opdivo met the main study goal of overall survival in patients who failed to respond to or are intolerant of standard chemotherapy, the company said.New York-based Bristol-Myer's shares inched up 1.1 percent to $56.90 in premarket trade.The trial was conducted by Bristol-Myers' partner, Japan's Ono Pharmaceutical Co Ltd in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and compared the effect of Opdivo to a placebo.Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the world, and kills more than 720,000 every year, Bristol-Myers said. Opdivo, like Merck & Co Inc's Keytruda, belongs to a new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that help the immune system unmask hidden cancer cells.Both drugs have secured regulatory approval for several types of cancer, but lung cancer is considered by far the biggest market for cancer drugs.Opdivo and Keytruda are both used in previously-treated lung cancer patients, but Merck's supremacy in this class of drugs was confirmed when Keytruda last month won approval for untreated lung cancer patients, significantly expanding its addressable population. Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG's Tecentriq is another major immunotherapy that has only recently won approvals for multiple types of cancer.As competition heats up, Bristol-Myers has orchestrated a string of deals to strengthen its pipeline. On Wednesday, it announced a collaboration to test Opdivo in combination with an experimental drug from Infinity Pharmaceuticals Inc in patients with advanced solid tumors.Separately on Thursday, Bristol-Myers agreed to pay Japan's Nitto Denko Corp $100 million up front for the right to its early-stage drug for liver fibrosis due to incurable fatty liver disease NASH or hepatitis C.

294,"  Japan's health ministry has set a 50 percent cut in the price of Opdivo, a costly immune system-boosting cancer drug produced by Bristol Myers Squibb Co and marketed in the country by Ono Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Ono Pharmaceutical said.The halving of the price on Opdivo, approved in Japan for treating advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and kidney cancer, will take effect from February 1, 2017, Ono Pharmaceutical said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.Japan's government-run health system typically adjusts drug prices every two years, but Opdivo's high price tag raised costs so much that officials decided to intervene with the steep price  cut, according to local media reports and confirmed by Ono. The company said the new Japanese price for a 20 mg vial of Opdivo will be 75,100 yen, and 364,925 yen for the 100 mg vial. Its current annual list price is 35 million yen ($321,787), based on the volume of drug needed to treat an average-size patient for a year.Opdivo is part of a new class of cancer drugs designed to fight cancer by unleashing the body's own immune system to kill tumors. In the United States, Opdivo's average list price is $13,100 per month, or $157,200 per year, according to Bristol Myers. The company said the U.S. price of Opdivo, first approved in late 2014, was increased by 1.5 percent earlier this year.
