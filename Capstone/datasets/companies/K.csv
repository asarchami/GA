0,"   By Siddharth Cavale  Kellogg Co (K.N), the world's largest maker of breakfast cereals, reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as sales of cereals fell for the third time in a row in the United States.Shares of Kellogg, which also sells Pringles chips and Keebler cookies, fell as much as 3 percent in early trading to their lowest in more than a year.The maker of Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Froot Loops, Special K and Rice Krispies cereals has been battling intense competition from General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and cheaper private-label brands.Increasing popularity of yogurt, frozen egg sandwiches and other breakfast items has also hit Kellogg's U.S. Morning Foods business, where sales fell 4 percent in the fourth quarter.These sales exclude the effects of foreign currency translation, acquisitions, dispositions, and integration costs.""We expect that the sales trends we've seen in several of our businesses in 2013 will continue into 2014 and first-quarter sales could be down slightly,"" Chief Financial Officer Ronald Dissinger said on a conference call with analysts.He expects gross margin in the first quarter to be flat to down slightly.Kellogg said it expected 2014 adjusted earnings to rise 1-3 percent, translating to $3.97-$4.05 per share. It expects internal sales to grow 1 percent. Analysts on average were expecting Kellogg to earn $4.05 per share for the full year.JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman called the forecast ""unimpressive,"" and maintained his ""underweight"" rating on the stock.The company said it plans to invest in packaging, shopper programs, mobile and in-store ads as it looks to reverse the decline in cereal sales.The company will also develop new healthier foods such as those infused with omega 3 and special cakes with quinoa grain to address evolving consumer tastes. To cut costs the company had launched a four-year cost cutting program, called Project K, in November, under which it plans to cut about 7 percent of its workforce by 2017.The company said it expects to save $50 million-$60 million for the full year from Project K.Expenses related to the project are expected to hurt full-year earnings by 60-65 cents per share in 2014, while adjusted gross margins are expected to increase by about 40-50 basis points, Dissinger said.SERIAL DECLINE  Battle Creek, Michigan-based Kellogg reported a 2.8 percent fall in total sales in North America in the fourth quarter.Net income attributable to the company was $818 million, or $2.24 per share, in the fourth quarter ended December 28, compared with a loss of $32 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.Kellogg earned 83 cents per share, excluding items, helped by cost cuts.Revenue fell 1.7 percent to $3.50 billion.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 82 cents per share on revenue of $3.53 billion, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S.

3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 08 (Fitch) Takeover rumors in recent days have led to a  significant widening of credit default swap (CDS) spreads for Kellogg Company,  according to Fitch Solutions in its latest case study. Five-year CDS on Kellogg have widened 46% over the past month. In fact, 'much of  the spread widening for Kellogg has happened since late last week and driven  largely by speculation that they could be targeted for acquisition,' said  Director Diana Allmendinger. Kellogg CDS widening significantly underperformed other North American food and  beverage companies, whose CDS moved out just 3% during the same time period.  After pricing consistently in 'A+' territory, credit protection on Kellogg's  debt is now pricing in line with 'BBB+' levels,' said Allmendinger. Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings for  Kellogg Company (Kellogg) and its subsidiaries:   Kellogg  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+';  --Bank credit facility at 'BBB+';  --Short-term IDR at 'F2';  --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F2'.   Kellogg Europe Company Limited  --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+';  --Short-term IDR at 'F2';  --CP at 'F2'.   Kellogg Holding Company Limited  --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+';  --Short-term IDR at 'F2';  --CP at 'F2'.  Kellogg Canada, Inc.  --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+'.   The Rating Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS:  Strong Brands, but Predominantly in Developed Markets: Kellogg's ratings  incorporate its leading market shares, strong brand equities in breakfast foods  and snacks, as well as ample liquidity. The company has good geographic  diversification, with nearly 40% of its sales generated outside the United  States. However, with 85% of the company's sales in North America and Europe,  Kellogg's growth has been hampered by significant exposure to slow growing  mature markets and modest exposure to faster growing emerging markets. U.S.  Morning Foods and U.S. Snacks were particularly weak in 2013, generating low  single digit top line declines. Improving these businesses, including Kellogg  master brand category building programs, is a key near-term priority.  Pringles Integration Largely Complete: The company's primarily debt financed  $2.7 billion Pringles potato crisps and sticks acquisition in May 2012 provided  it with a stronger snacks platform for product and geographic expansion, but  brought lower margins. Leverage (total debt to EBITDA) is down from its peak  over 3.0x; the integration has gone smoothly and is on track and largely  complete. Pringles provided high single digit internal net sales growth in 2013,  but Fitch believes longer-term growth from Pringles may not be enough to prevent  the need for additional growth acquisitions.   Project K's Substantial Cost: In November 2013, Kellogg announced Project K, a  global four-year efficiency and effectiveness program, to improve its long term  growth prospects and cost structure. Kellogg expects total pretax program  charges of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion plus about $300 million incremental  capital expenditures. The company estimates total cash costs for the program at  $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. The project's substantial cash cost will  negatively impact FCF as discussed below. Kellogg has estimated Project K pretax  savings of $425 million to $475 million annually by 2018, with more than half of  the cost savings coming from the supply chain. Kellogg expects Project K costs  of $300 million to $350 million in 2014, along with modest cost savings of $50  million to $60 million which the company intends to invest back in the business.  FCF Constrained in Near Term: Kellogg generated significant FCF (cash flow from  operations less capital expenditures and dividends), which averaged  approximately $500 million annually during the past three years. The company  provided cash flow guidance for cash flow from operations less capital  expenditures of $1 billion to $1.1 billion in 2014. Fitch estimates that this  will translate into approximately $400 million of FCF including Project K cash  cost and heightened capital expenditures at 4% to 5% of sales. FCF will also be  constrained by these factors in 2015.   Leverage to Remain Approximately Flat: Given lower than historical FCF related  to Project K's cash cost, Kellogg will need to borrow for a portion of its  planned share repurchases. The company expects debt to increase $200 million to  $300 million through 2015, factoring in the positive working capital impact from  a new accounts payable initiative. However, Fitch expects EBITDA improvement,  which should allow leverage (total debt to EBITDA) to remain approximately flat  at 2.7x achieved in 2013. This places leverage at the higher end of the mid 2x  level previously anticipated and does not allow room in the rating for  leveraging transactions or significant operating underperformance beyond current  guidance. For 2013, FFO adjusted leverage was 4.1x and operating EBITDA to gross  interest expense was 11.5x. Both of these measures showed modest improvement  from 2012.   Sizeable Liquidity and Manageable Maturities: Kellogg's $2.3 billion liquidity  included its undrawn $2 billion revolving bank facility plus $273 million cash  and equivalents at Dec. 28, 2013. In February 2014 Kellogg entered into a new $2  billion revolver expiring in February 2019, which replaced the previous  facility. The company had $686 million of CP at Dec. 28, 2013. Kellogg is likely  to refinance upcoming debt maturities, which include CAD$300 million notes  issued by Kellogg Canada Inc. (under a full parent guarantee) due in May 2014,  $600 million notes due in 2015, and $1.3 billion notes due in 2016. In March  2014, Kellogg completed a cash tender for $680.7 million of its notes due in  2020 through 2023 funded with CP.   RATING SENSITIVITIES: Future developments that may, individually or  collectively, lead to a positive rating action include:   --A positive rating action is not anticipated in the near to intermediate term.  However, it could occur with a commitment to maintain leverage in the low 2.0x  range or lower, strong free cash flow, operating margin improvement and top line  growth due to successful expansion into emerging markets.   Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:   --A negative rating action could occur if Kellogg's operating performance does  not support cash outflows from Project K and share repurchases, resulting in  leverage that is likely to be sustained at or above the 3.0x range.  --Material debt financed acquisitions or other leveraging transactions,  continued or accelerating negative volume trends or inability to achieve  targeted Project K cost savings would also support a negative rating action.

6,"  Kellogg Co (K.N) reported a bigger-than-expected fall in quarterly revenue as competition from private-label brands and alternative breakfast items ate into cereal sales in the United States.The world's No. 1 maker of breakfast cereals has been struggling with stiff competition from General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and cheaper private-label brands, as well as the rising popularity of other breakfast items, such as frozen egg sandwiches and yoghurt.Sales at Kellogg's U.S. morning foods business, which includes cereals such as Corn Flakes, Froot Loops and Special K, fell 5.5 percent in the first quarter ended March 29, its fourth straight quarterly decline.The company has invested in packaging, shopper programs and mobile and in-store ads to stem the decline in sales. Kellogg launched in November a cost-cutting program, dubbed ""Project K,"" under which it planned to cut about 7 percent of its workforce and create regional hubs that would put resources closer to its plants.The cost cutting helped Kellogg top first-quarter profit estimates. Excluding items, the company earned $1.01 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of 97 cents. Chief Executive John Bryant said in a statement on Thursday that the company expects top-line performance to improve over time and reiterated its full-year forecast.Net sales at Kellogg, also known for its Pringles chips and Keebler cookies, fell to $3.74 billion, below the average estimate of $3.81 billion. The company's net income jumped 32 percent to $406 million, or $1.12 per share.Kellogg's shares have risen 9.4 percent this year to Wednesday's close of $66.83 on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Maria Ajit Thomas in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",2014-05-01,K,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 9:06am EDT",Competition weighs on Kellogg's quarterly sales,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-kellogg-results-idUSBREA400D020140501?type=companyNews

9,"  * Estimates 4th-qtr profit $0.55/share vs forecast of over $0.60* Says fourth-qtr sales in consumer foods business down 7 pct* Says profits in private brands to be lower than expected for several years* Shares fall as much as 7.4 pct   (Adds details, analyst and spokeswoman comments; updates shares)By Sruthi RamakrishnanJune 18 ConAgra Foods Inc warned that its adjusted fourth-quarter profit would be lower than its forecast, as the company struggles with its big push into private-label foods and sales fall in its consumer foods business.The company's shares fell as much as 7.4 percent to $30.41 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.The maker of Hunt's tomato ketchup and Slim Jim beef jerky estimated an adjusted profit of about 55 cents per share for the quarter ended May 25, lower than its forecast of ""in excess of"" 60 cents. ""This revision is even more dire than we expected,"" Morningstar analyst Erin Lash wrote in a note.ConAgra boosted its private brands business with the $5 billion acquisition of Ralcorp Holdings in January last year as recession-hit shoppers bought cheaper store-branded products.ConAgra, however, cut its full-year profit forecast twice, blaming weak sales in its private-label business and a steeper-than-expected fall in sales of its own brands.The private brands business, which makes cereals, pasta, snacks and sauces that retailers sell as their own, accounted for 24 percent of ConAgra's total sales in the third quarter. Profit from the business is likely to drop by about $60 million in the fourth quarter due to discounts and costs related to the Ralcorp acquisition, ConAgra said.The company said in February that its private-label business was taking longer than anticipated to reach expected operating profit levels, forcing it to cut prices to stem a fall in sales volumes.Chief Executive Gary Rodkin said in May that discounting was likely to pressure margins in the next several quarters. The lower profit estimate was not because of ""new or deeper challenges; it's simply a reflection that it will take time to grow margins,"" ConAgra spokeswoman Teresa Paulsen said in an email on Wednesday.Sales volume in consumer foods, the company's largest business, dropped 7 percent in the fourth quarter. The business sells meals, snacks and desserts such as Act II popcorn and Blue Bonnet spread.A change in consumer attitudes towards heavily processed foods is likely to hit sales at ConAgra and General Mills Inc , Kellogg Co and Campbell Soup Co, Bernstein Research analyst Alexia Howard wrote in a note.ConAgra said it expected to take $681 million in non-cash impairment charges in the fourth quarter, mostly in the private brands business.The company said profits in its private brands business were likely to be lower in the next several years than it had expected. Profit is expected to grow in the mid-single digits for the year ending May 2015.ConAgra is scheduled to report its results on June 26.The company's shares were down 7.3 percent at $30.45 in noon trading.

17,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Aug 13 Global food giant Kellogg's  will set targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from its worldwide supply chain, it announced Wednesday, responding to consumer pressure to be accountable for its contribution to climate change.The maker of popular cereal Corn Flakes and potato chips Pringles announced a series of new climate policy measures, including targets to be set by December 2015 that would be consistent with a global effort aimed at preventing average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celcius.Kellog's will also expand its previous voluntary pledge to ensure net zero deforestation by 2020 by addressing other areas of its supply chain, including soy and sugarcane segments, in which deforestation effects are a high risk.The company had previously made commitments to avoid deforestation and land degredation in other high risk supply chain areas, including palm oil and packaging fiber. ""We recognize that upstream agriculture emissions are the single largest source of emissions in our value chain and will focus our efforts on achieving agricultural emissions reductions,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.The announcement comes two weeks after fellow food giant General Mills announced a similar policy to set emission cutting targets that respond to the United Nations goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by less than 2 degrees C. Both companies worked with NGO Oxfam International's Behind the Brands campaign to push major food companies with global business dealings to be transparent about the climate impact of their production and reduce their carbon emissions.""Kellogg's new commitments add momentum to calls on governments and the wider food and agriculture industry to recognize that climate change is real, it's happening now, and we need to tackle it,"" said Monique van Zijl, Oxfam's manager of that campaign. The Kellogg pledge took General Mills's commitment a step further, according to Oxfam, because it promised to require key suppliers to measure and publicly disclose their emissions and reduction targets.It also committed to creating a climate change adaptation plan for its supply chain that factors in the needs of small farmers in developing countries.Both companies also agreed to assist an advocacy coalition called BICEP (Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy)that pushes companies to work with lawmakers to tackle climate change.The 10 biggest food and beverage companies together emit  greenhouse gases at a level equivalent to the 25th biggest national emitter in the world, according to Oxfam.

25,"  (Adds Abraaj counter offer)By Ehab FaroukCAIRO Nov 26 The battle for control of Egyptian cake and biscuit maker Bisco Misr intensified on Wednesday as Abraaj Investment Management raised its initial bid to trump a rival offer from Kellogg Co.UAE-based Abraaj, the Middle East's largest private equity firm, raised its offer to 80.58 Egyptian pounds ($11.27) per share, exactly two percent above a bid of 79 pounds on Tuesday from Kellogg, the world's biggest breakfast cereal maker.The bidding war is part of flurry of mergers and rights issues boosting activity on the Cairo bourse, an exchange which has struggled to revive investor confidence during the political and economic turmoil that followed the Arab Spring uprisings. Egypt's government this year launched a raft of long-delayed reforms aimed at luring back foreign investors and shoring up growth while cutting a ballooning deficit.The competing bids from Kellogg and Abraaj are the latest sign foreign investors could be returning to the market. Food is seen as a fast-growing sector in the most populous Arab nation of 86 million people and Bisco Misr is a well-known brand with three baking facilities in Cairo and Alexandria.Abraaj, which has about $7.5 billion of assets under management, typically invests in high-growth sectors in emerging markets. It first approached Bisco Misr in July and made a formal offer of 73.91 pounds in November. While shareholders with 56 percent of Bisco Misr agreed to sell to Abraaj, Kellogg's bid forced the private equity firm to return with a higher offer.Egypt's regulator had instructed Abraaj to offer a new price at least two percent above Kellogg's if it wished to make a counter bid.

Samy said the deadline for bids would be extended for five working days with each new offer, up to a maximum 60 days from when the first offer made by Abraaj in early November - then sealed bids would be requested.Kellogg hopes acquiring Bisco Misr would give it a high-profile presence in the Arab world's most populous nation. Food is seen as a potentially lucrative sector in Egypt, with its population of 87 million, and Bisco Misr is an established brand with three factories in Cairo and Alexandria.Angus Blair, chairman of business and economic forecasting think-tank Signet, said Kellogg's industry experience and global reputation would boost Bisco Misr and the Egyptian economy. ""It would attract much wider FDI (foreign direct investment) as well as being better for the company,"" he said. ""It will certainly draw other investors into the market to look at Egypt much more seriously than they have in the past.""For its part, Abraaj has been active in Egypt for almost a decade. It manages about $7.5 billion of assets and targets high-growth sectors in emerging markets.Abraaj has said it would maintain Egyptian management and allocate 100 million pounds worth of shares towards an employee benefits scheme.The offers from Kellogg and Abraaj are for 100 percent of Bisco Misr, and both have said they would accept no less than a 51 percent controlling stake.($1 = 7.1500 Egyptian pounds)   (Editing by Mark Potter and Pravin Char)",2014-12-24,K,"Wed Dec 24, 2014 | 11:42am EST",UPDATE 2-Kellogg and Abraaj up bids in battle for Egypt's Bisco Misr,http://www.reuters.com//article/biscomisr-ma-abraaj-idUSL6N0U816U20141224?type=companyNews

46,"  DUBAI Dec 31 Emerging markets private equity firm Abraaj Group will pull out of the bidding process for the acquisition of Egypt's Bisco Misr, Abraaj said on Wednesday.The company had been involved in a bidding war with Kellogg Co, the world's largest breakfast cereal maker, for the purchase of as much as 100 percent of the Egyptian snack maker. Abraaj did not give a reason for its withdrawal from the bidding process, but said the orderly and transparent process had underlined growing investor interest in Egypt.  Its latest offer of 88.09 Egyptian pounds per share had amounted to a total purchase price for Bisco Misr of about $142 million, but Kellogg subsequently increased its bid to 89.86 pounds, Abraaj said.

47,"  (Adds Jan. 11 bidding deadline, background)CAIRO Jan 6 Shareholders in Egypt's Bisco Misr  have agreed to sell a controlling stake to Kellogg  as the world's largest breakfast cereal maker emerged as the likely winner of an $87 million takeover battle for the cake and biscuit producer.Private equity firm Abraaj said last week it would withdraw from a bidding war with Kellogg that had driven up the offer price by over 20 percent, leaving the U.S. group as the only remaining suitor.Shareholders controlling 59.91 percent of the firm's shares agreed to sell at 89.86 pounds a share, Bisco Misr said in a statement on Tuesday, for a total of just under $87 million.The tussle over Bisco Misr is part of a flurry of mergers and rights issues boosting activity on the Cairo bourse, which has struggled to revive investor confidence in the turmoil that has followed the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Though the values are relatively small, along with a takeover battle for Arab Dairy, the Bisco Misr acquisition suggests growing international interest in the Egyptian market.Kellogg had indicated it was willing to buy 100 percent of Bisco Misr and would only accept a controlling stake. It scuppered an effort by Abraaj to snap up the Egyptian company for an opening gambit of 73.91 pounds a share.Though Kellogg appears almost certain to seal the deal, the regulator last month extended the bidding period to Jan. 11, which means another suitor could yet emerge. Shareholders holding 56 percent of Bisco Misr agreed in November to sell their shares to Abraaj and a deal seemed likely until Kellogg entered the fray.Food is seen as a fast-growing sector in the most populous Arab nation of 87 million people and Bisco Misr is a well-known brand with three baking facilities in Cairo and Alexandria.($1 = 7.1500 Egyptian pounds)   (Reporting by Lin Noueihed; editing by Jason Neely and David Evans)",2015-01-06,K,"Tue Jan 6, 2015 | 7:23am EST",UPDATE 2-Egypt's Bisco Misr shareholders agree to sell stake to Kellogg,http://www.reuters.com//article/biscomisr-ma-kellogg-idUSL6N0UL1C120150106?type=companyNews

49,"  LONDON Jan 8 Tesco delivered its first salvo in a fight back against the growth of discount supermarkets on Thursday by cutting the price of hundreds of branded products such as Hovis bread, Kellogg's cornflakes and Stella Artois lager.Britain's biggest supermarket group, like rivals Asda , Sainsbury's and Morrisons, is losing sales to discounters Lidl and Aldi, whose limited ranges of low-priced products are increasingly popular with British shoppers.Tesco brought in Dave Lewis in September to revive its fortunes but the former Unilever executive was immediately put on the back foot by an accounting scandal and profit downgrades.He is due to outline his turn-around plan later on Thursday when he updates on trading. Analysts expect Tesco's UK like-for-like sales over Christmas to have fallen 2.0-4.3 percent. The battle for Britain's grocery market is increasingly being fought on price, with all of the ""big four"" chains cutting the price of staples such as bread and milk.Analysts have said Tesco is adrift from its rivals, with customers confused by a multitude of offers such as ""buy-one-get-one-free"" promotions. Chief Customer Officer Jill Easterbrook said shoppers wanted to see changes. ""One of the biggest things they've been saying is that they want prices which are simple, consistent and low,"" she said in a statement. ""The changes we're making today are a first step in that direction -- and we've focused on many of the favourite brands customers choose every day.""The average reduction on about 380 branded products would be around 25 percent, the company said, and the lower prices would be in all of its store formats from hypermarkets to convenience stores.It did not give details on how it expected the price cuts to impact sales or profit margins.

51,"  Kellogg Co (K.N), the world's largest maker of breakfast cereals, cut its forecast for long-term annual revenue growth as consumers shift away from cereals and snacks to cheaper private label foods and cook more at home.The Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies maker's shares fell as much as 5 percent to $62.81 in early trading.A long-term target of low-single digit annual revenue growth for cereals and snacks was ""realistic and achievable,"" Chief Executive John Bryant said on a conference call.   The company, which reported lower-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter, cut its outlook for long-term adjusted annual revenue growth to 1-3 percent from 3-4 percent.Kellogg forecast flat adjusted net sales for 2015. It expects adjusted earnings to be flat or down 2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.   Cereals and other processed foods from Kellogg, ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N) and General Mills Inc (GIS.N) are facing stiff competition from breakfast options such as yogurt and frozen egg sandwiches and cheaper private-label brands.Adjusted net sales fell 5.7 percent in its U.S. morning foods business and 2.4 percent in the U.S. snacks business, its biggest, in 2014.       The company also expects a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2015 due to the stronger dollar, Chief Financial Officer Ronald Dissinger said on the call.   Sales outside North America accounted for 34.5 percent of net sales in the quarter ended Jan. 3.Adjusted net sales in the U.S. morning foods business, which includes cereal, fell 7.7 percent in the quarter. Sales in U.S. snacks also fell 3.1 percent, excluding items.        Net loss attributable to Kellogg was $293 million, or 82 cents per share, compared with a profit of $818 million, or $2.24 per share, a year earlier.The latest quarter included a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment of $822 million, driven mainly by changes in interest rates on pension plans. Excluding items, the company earned 86 cents per share.Net sales inched up 0.4 percent to $3.51 billion but still fell short of analysts' average estimate of $3.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to Wednesday's close, shares have risen about 12 percent in the last 12 months.

55,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. consumers are shifting away from weight-management foods, forcing companies ranging from Kellogg Co to Nestle SA to change ingredients and focus their marketing on different health benefits as sales slip.Food companies are grappling with how to market brands such as Lean Cuisine, Healthy Choice and Special K, and come out with new products tailored to changing tastes. These days, companies say, consumers care more about ingredients that are simple to understand than they do about counting calories. They also want more ethnic flavors, as well as foods that are higher in protein and gluten-free.Nestle will shift its Lean Cuisine frozen dinners from a diet brand to one built around ""healthy eating and healthy lifestyles,"" said Jeff Hamilton, president of the prepared food division, in an interview on Thursday.The company, whose 2014 sales fell below its long-term goals, said that its performance in North America was hurt by its frozen foods business. Hamilton said the category has been declining annually at an average of 2 percent in recent years.Instead of retaining the brand's signature white box, which gave it a ""diet"" look, Nestle said, the company will use new packaging with bolder graphics to help Lean Cuisine stand out in the grocery aisle. Nestle is also rolling out new ethnic flavors such as Sweet & Spicy Korean-Style Beef.""We have a heritage of being a diet brand, and we need to move to where the consumer is going,"" Hamilton said in an interview. The changes come at a time when U.S. consumers' perceptions of what is healthy are changing. According to a Nielsen study of 30,000 people released in January, the number of U.S. respondents who said they were cutting down on fats dropped 14 percent between 2011 and 2014. Meanwhile, the number of people who turned to diets low in carbohydrates to lose weight increased 10 percent.Eating smaller portions and fewer processed foods was also popular strategy, the study said. John Bryant, CEO of Kellogg, said in an interview last week that consumers wanted snack bars with ingredients that appear to be natural even if they are not low in calories. ""They're still buying bars, but they're often buying bars that are higher in calories and higher in fat,"" he said. The company is changing the packaging and advertising for its Special K brand to reduce a focus on weight loss, as well as adding varieties of bars with ingredients that consumers can see in the product, such as fruit pieces and rice crisps.Kellogg is making the changes in response to sluggish sales in its U.S. snack business, which declined 3.1 percent when adjusted for currency and acquisitions in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Jan. 3.  Investors should not expect to see immediate results from companies' efforts to rebrand diet foods, however. In Kellogg's case, Special K is ""obviously something that has been challenging the business for some time,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. ""It definitely is not something we expected to change and improve over night.""ConAgra Foods Inc says its new Healthy Choice Simply Café Steamers are made with ""100 percent natural chicken.” ""As the definition of health evolves, we evolve our meals,"" saidJenn Freeman, vice president and general manager, through a ConAgra spokeswoman.Consumers should also be skeptical that the new wave of foods marketed as healthy will help them lose pounds. ""Researchers say that health and wellness foods carry a health halo that seduces people into thinking the products have no calories,"" said Marion Nestle, a professor in the department of nutrition at New York University. ""Alas, they do.""

57,"  Kellogg Co (K.N), the world's largest maker of breakfast cereals, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales as demand rose in Latin America. The maker of Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies said on Tuesday that sales in Latin America rose 6 percent to $295 million in the first quarter ended April 4.The company's sales rose across product lines in Asia Pacific and in its Pringles business in Europe, but a strong dollar more than offset the benefit of this rise. The dollar .DXY has surged about 20 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past year, making sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. Kellogg gets about a third of its revenue from outside North America.  Sales in Kellogg's U.S. morning foods business, which includes cereal, fell almost 3 percent to $776 million. The business has reported a rise in sales only once in the last eight quarters. Net income attributable to Kellogg nearly halved to $227 million, or 64 cents per share, mainly due to higher expenses related to its cost-cutting program and its pension plans. Excluding items, Kellogg earned 98 cents per share.Net sales fell 5 percent to $3.56 billion.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of 91 cents per share and revenue of $3.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Kellogg's shares were little changed at $64.25 in premarket trading on Tuesday.

60,"  CAIRO May 27 The board of Egyptian biscuit maker Bisco Misr has approved a voluntary delisting from the Egyptian stock exchange as requested by controlling shareholder U.S. company Kellogg, the company said on Wednesday.Shareholders in Bisco Misr in January agreed to sell an 86 percent stake to Kellogg for a total of $125 million.Bisco Misr said in a statement its board had approved the delisting and had taken steps to call an extraordinary meeting to seek approval from shareholders. Kellogg, the world's largest breakfast cereal maker, became the only suitor for the biscuit company when private equity firm Abraaj said on Dec. 31 that it would withdraw from a bidding war that had driven up the offer price by over 20 percent. Food is a fast-growing business in Egypt, which has a population of around 90 million. Bisco Misr is a well-known brand with three baking facilities in Cairo and Alexandria. The company also appointed Pharos Investment Banking as an independent financial advisor for the delisting process.(Reporting by Mahmoud Mourad; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Jane Merriman)",2015-05-27,K,"Wed May 27, 2015 | 7:39am EDT",Biscuit maker Bisco Misr approves delisting from Egyptian exchange,http://www.reuters.com//article/biscomisr-kellogg-stocks-idUSL5N0YI1O820150527?type=companyNews

62,"   By Noel Randewich  Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday for a third straight session as investors worried about a rise in interest rates while Apple's shares hit their lowest in over six months.The iPhone maker's shares fell 3.21 percent to $114.64, firmly below their 200-day daily moving average, a key technical level closely watched by traders. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes.A slowdown in China and skepticism over demand for iPhones were contributing to pressure on Apple's shares, traders said.""Apple has been the weak sister in the market today,"" said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist and director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. ""But if you look at the sectors, most everything is down with the exception of materials."" Stocks extended losses after Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart told the Wall Street Journal that September may be the right time for Fed to lift interest rates.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 0.27 percent to end at 17,550.69 and the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.22 percent to 2,093.32. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.19 percent finish at 5,105.55. Eight of the 10 major S&P sectors fell, with the utilities index's .SPLRCU 1.64 percent decline leading the losers. The Fed has said it needs to see a sustained economic recovery before it raises interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.Soft economic data had prompted some investors to argue that the Fed might hold off on raising rates until December. After the Fed meeting last week, investors expected a rate increase in September. ""The market is getting such a mixed bag of rhetoric from the Fed, it seems like the Fed isn't sure what it's going to do,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.After the bell, shares of crafts website Etsy (ETSY.O) fell 9 percent and Walt Disney (DIS.N) lost 1.4 percent after the companies posted quarterly results that disappointed Wall Street. First Solar (FSLR.O) posted better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance and its stock was up 10 percent.During the session, American International Group (AIG.N) fell 2.82 percent after the insurer's underwriting income fell in almost all of its units, while home and auto insurer Allstate (ALL.N) fell 10.15 percent after its profit missed expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1.23 to 1. On the Nasdaq, 1,414 issues fell and 1,376 advanced for a 1.03-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 32 new 52-week highs and 26 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 91 new highs and 127 new lows. Some 6.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the five-day average of 7.0 billion this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

63,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Kellogg Co's Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies are set to turn all-natural soon.The 109-year old company, whose cereals have been a popular breakfast choice for decades, said on Tuesday it was aiming to stop using artificial colors and flavors in its cereal and snack bars by the end of 2018.The world's biggest breakfast cereal maker is the latest in a string of U.S. food companies to bow to growing pressure to remove synthetic ingredients from products due to health concerns.The company said 75 percent of its cereals in North America were being made without artificial colors and more than half without artificial flavors.General Mills Inc, the maker of Cheerios cereals, said in June it plans to have 90 percent of its cereals free of artificial flavors and colors by 2016, up from about 60 percent currently. Sales at both companies have shrunk in the United States due to a growing preference for less processed foods and cooked meals.Kellogg reported second-quarter revenue on Tuesday that topped analysts' expectations, but the 5.1 percent decline in sales was the seventh time in eight quarters that sales had fallen.Sales in the company's U.S. snacks business - its biggest - fell 2 percent, while sales in the U.S. morning foods business, which includes cereals, fell 2.2 percent. Kellogg has been transforming itself – from making healthier products to trimming its costs.The company started a multi-year cost cutting plan in 2013 and is using the savings to refresh its Special K brand and launch healthier foods such as granola and muesli in new markets.Kellogg said sales of its Special K cereal were improving after repositioning the brand as ""wellness"", rather than diet, food and introducing a gluten-free version and new flavors.

81,"  * Many goals pledged, not all science-based* Certified goals seen as meaningful step toward limiting warming   (Adds Kellogg goals, comment)By Barbara Lewis and Emma ThomassonPARIS/BERLIN, Dec 8 Kellogg, Sony , Coca-Cola Enterprises and a group of other companies have committed to targets certified by independent assessors to cut their carbon emissions, they said on Tuesday.The initiative came as negotiators gathered in Paris try to reach an accord on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and is intended to go beyond the often vague promises of corporate action on the issue.U.N. Global Compact, a voluntary U.N. scheme, and non-governmental organisations including the U.S.-based World Resources Institute (WRI) have been attempting to persuade business to set carbon goals following the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The WRI and its partner organisations said more than 100 companies had committed within the next two years to set targets, assessed on the basis of U.N. standards as a meaningful contribution to warding off a global average temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius, viewed as a threshold for potentially catastrophic climate change.Coca-Cola Enterprises (the European bottling partner of Coca-Cola Co ), Dell, Enel, General Mills , Kellogg, NRG Energy, Procter & Gamble, Sony and Thalys have already had goals approved equating to nearly 2 billion barrels of oil not burned over the lifetime of their targets. Kellogg, which like other food companies is sensitive to extreme weather that inflates the cost of ingredients and makes them scarce, committed to a 15 percent reduction in emissions intensity per tonne of food produced by 2020 versus 2015, the joint statement said.Kellogg added it had also set a longer term goal to cut emissions across the value chain, including suppliers, by 50 percent by 2050, and from its own operations by 65 percent.""It's a core business issue in terms of, can we have enough access to foods over time?"" Diane Holdorf, chief sustainability officer at Kellogg, said in Paris. ""Security of supply is critical to our business."" Ignacio Gavilan, sustainability director at Consumer Goods Forum, a grouping of 400 of the world's top retailers and manufacturers, said firms needed to set aggressive climate goals or their brands could come under attack from social media pressure.""Given today's transparency, companies cannot go for the minimum common denominator,"" he said.Some pension funds, which take a long view, say they favour companies that have reduced their carbon exposure and that compelling emissions promises distinguish firms with strategies that can increase shareholder value.(Editing by David Holmes and Susan Thomas)",2015-12-08,K,"Tue Dec 8, 2015 | 12:03pm EST","UPDATE 1-Kellogg, Sony and others sign up to emissions goals",http://www.reuters.com//article/climatechange-summit-companies-idUSL8N13X3EP20151208?type=companyNews
82,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to  Kellogg Company's (Kellogg) $750 million due 2026 and $650 million due 2046.  Proceeds from the notes will be used to tender $440 million of the $1.1 billion  senior unsecured notes due in 2031 and to term out the outstanding $899 million  U.S. commercial paper balance. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that core volume driven growth will be  modestly positive at best through the medium term. Volumes have been negative in  the -0.5% to -2.6% range on a consolidated basis in four of the past five years.  Further, U.S. Morning Foods (mainly ready to eat cereal) and U.S. Snacks, which  represent $6 billion in revenues and roughly 45% of the portfolio, have had  negative organic growth over the past several years. Positive growth in some  categories such as the high single digit levels for the Pringles brand with  nearly $2 billion in revenues have been offset by negative organic growth trends  in other brands.  The company should have some modest price driven growth going forward similar to  historic performance over the last five years but there is uncertainty regarding  if volume growth will be a long term driver of top line improvement. Revenues  have been hampered by significant exposure to slow growing mature markets and  this has been further challenged by recessions in key emerging markets. U.S  Morning Foods, which is mainly cereal, and more than 20% of the company's  portfolio had 10 quarters of negative organic growth before the +1.5% recorded  in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Trends appear to be improving for the cereal category and for Kellogg. Per AC  Nielsen, the cereal category was down -1.2% during 2015 but just -.1% in the  last 12 weeks. More importantly, Kellogg took share in the category with just a  -.5% decline and saw a 2.2% positive increase in consumer take-away in the last  12 weeks. Nonetheless, there is not enough track record to be confident these  trends will be sustained.  Fitch expects leverage to remain in the low 3x range over the next two years,  above the 2.75x average seen from 2011 through 2014. Fitch expects EBITDA to be  roughly flat in the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion range over the next two years,  with near-term pressure on EBITDA due to negative currency translation in 2016.  Debt is expected to remain essentially flat and Kellogg will continue to  allocate $1.4 billion towards share repurchases and dividends annually.  Substantial Restructuring Costs: In November 2013, Kellogg announced Project K,  a global restructuring program with savings expected to reach an annual run rate  of $425 million to $475 million by 2018. Most of the savings are expected to be  reinvested back into business for brand support.  The restructuring costs are expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4  billion and will require about $300 million in incremental capital expenditures.  Estimated cash costs are about $1 billion. The project's substantial cash cost  to date, which is about halfway through, has been largely offset by working  capital improvements. However, free cash flow (FCF) has declined from $603  million in 2013 to $438 million in 2015 due to the decline in EBITDA.  Fitch estimates that FCF will be modestly negative in the $120 million range in  2016, assuming $0.5 billion in remaining cash costs related to the restructuring  program. However, annual FCF should improve meaningfully to the $450 million  range as Project K cash costs subside in 2017.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Revenues decline nearly 4% in 2016 impacted by negative F/X translation with  organic growth expected to be in the 1%-2% range driven primarily by pricing.  This is at the low end of management's public guidance of 1% to 3% organic  growth for 2016 much of which will be driven by pricing to recover currencies  particularly in Latin America. Thereafter, the top line should reflect 1.5% to  2% organic top line growth (with flat to modestly negative volume contribution)  assuming neutral currency impact.  --Adjusted EBITDA margins improve modestly by 100 basis points (bps) to about  19.5% by 2017 as a small portion of Project K savings drops to the bottom line.  --FCF is negative in the $120 million range in 2016 but improves to more than  $450 million thereafter with FCF margins reverting to the historical 3.5% range.  --Leverage (gross debt to EBITDA) remains in the low 3x range in 2016 and 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --A negative rating action could occur if Kellogg's organic growth rate is  negative in the low single digit range. Consistently negative trends would  signal that the company's renovation and brand support efforts are not effective  and/or that emerging markets performance is worse than expected. --Leverage sustained above 3.5x either as a result of poor performance or  material debt financed share buybacks or acquisitions.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --A positive rating action could occur with sustained low to mid-single digit  organic growth with volume trends turning positive and with overall market  shares stable or improving. Additionally, Kellogg would have to maintain  leverage in the mid to high 2x range. LIQUIDITY Kellogg's $2.4 billion liquidity included its undrawn $2 billion revolving bank  facility plus $596 million cash and equivalents at Jan. 2, 2016. While there is  pressure on FCF in 2016, Fitch expects this measure to improve substantially  beginning 2017. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Kellogg as follows:  Kellogg  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB';  --Bank credit facility 'BBB';  --Short-term IDR 'F2';  --Commercial paper (CP) 'F2'.

86,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Kellogg Co's (K.N) sales fell more than expected in the first-quarter as demand stayed sluggish in the United States, and the company said full-year sales would be hurt by the lingering effects of a sales force rejig aimed at reviving growth.Kellogg's sales have fallen for five quarters in a row now as the cereal and snacks maker, like its peers, struggles to adapt to the increasing preference for healthier foods over sugary and processed products.The company, in the latest quarter, overhauled its sales force for its U.S. snacks business – its largest and one that houses Cheez-It crackers and Pringles chips – by changing employees' roles, managers and zones to spark growth.But, the disruptive reorganization led to a 2.6 percent drop in sales at the snacks business in the quarter and is expected to hurt the current quarter as well.Even Kellogg's wholesome snack offerings, such as Rice Krispies Squares, failed to notch sales growth.""The business remains our biggest challenge in snacks,"" said Paul Norman, head of North America.While higher prices are benefiting Kellogg in Venezuela, the sales force rejig, weakness in Europe and Latin America, and frozen food product transitions will hurt sales, said CFO Ron Dissinger, who will retire at the end of 2016. The weak sales and the impending retirement of the company's CFO of six years pushed Kellogg's shares down 2 percent to $75.55.SALES DROP  Kellogg's 2016 sales, excluding those in Venezuela and the effects of currency fluctuations, is now expected to range between no growth to an increase of 2 percent. It had earlier forecast an increase of 1-3 percent.Sales, on the same basis, decreased by 1 percent in the first quarter ended April 2.Another decline, this time of 1.2 percent, in U.S. sales of morning foods such as Corn Flakes and Froot Loops also weighed on overall sales.Kellogg's total sales fell 4.5 percent to $3.40 billion, while analysts on average were expecting $3.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The 110-year old company's net income also fell, mainly due to interest expenses of $217 million.However, cost-saving measures under the Project-K plan helped Kellogg's adjusted profit beat estimates.Net income attributable to Kellogg fell 23 percent to $175 million, or 49 cents per share.Excluding the impact from its Venezuela business and other items, earnings were 97 cents per share. Analysts were expecting 94 cents.

114,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Kellogg Company's (Kellogg) $600 million senior unsecured notes due 2023.  Proceeds from the notes will be used to refinance the $500 million senior  unsecured notes due November 2016 and reduce commercial paper outstanding, which  totaled $420 million at Oct. 1, 2016. A full list of ratings follows at the end  of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Kellogg's ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that organic volume will remain  modestly negative over the medium term given Kellogg's exposure to mature  markets at about 85% of total sales and an underdeveloped natural/organic  offering. Volumes have been negative in the range of -0.5% to -2.6% on a  consolidated basis in five of the past six years.  Changing consumer preferences have had a negative impact on Kellogg's  performance, due to  the company's portfolio orientation toward cereal and  processed foods. U.S. Morning Foods (mainly ready-to-eat cereal) and U.S.  Snacks, which represent over $6 billion of the company's revenues and roughly  45% of the portfolio, have had negative organic growth in the -1.6% to -5.7%  range over the past three years. Positive growth in some brands, such as the  high-single-digit levels for the Pringles brand with nearly $2 billion in  revenues, has been offset by negative organic growth trends in other brands.  Pricing/mix is expected to be modestly positive to the top line driven by mix  shift towards higher-growth categories. While Kellogg's exposure to developing  markets remains low at about 15%, Fitch views this as a long-term positive  despite near-term weakness seen in China, Russia and Latin America that has been  exacerbated by the strong U.S. dollar. Fitch expects leverage to remain in the low-3x range over the next two years,  above the 2.75x average seen from 2011 through 2014. EBITDA is expected to  remain in the $2.5 billion range over the next 24-36 months, in line with 2015  levels. Debt is expected to remain essentially flat and Fitch expects that  Kellogg will continue to allocate $1.4 billion annually to gross share  repurchases and dividends. Substantial Restructuring Costs: In November 2013, Kellogg announced Project K,  a global restructuring program with savings expected to reach an annual run rate  of $425 million to $475 million by 2018. Most of the savings are expected to be  reinvested back into business for brand support.  The restructuring costs are expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4  billion and will require about $300 million in incremental capital expenditures.  Estimated cash costs are about $1 billion. The project's substantial cash cost  to date, which is about halfway through, has been largely offset by working  capital improvements. However, free cash flow (FCF) declined from $603 million  in 2013 to $438 million in 2015 due to the decline in EBITDA. Fitch estimates that FCF (after dividends and cash restructuring costs) will be  around $450 million-$500 million in 2016, given continued cash costs related to  the restructuring program and Fitch's assumption of neutral working capital.  Annual FCF should improve meaningfully to around $600 million-$700 million as  Project K cash costs subside in 2017. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Revenues decline 5% in 2016 due to negative F/X translation with organic  growth expected to be in the 4% range driven by pricing actions primarily in  Venezuela. Organic sales growth is expected to be essentially flat, with volume  growth of -0.5%-1%, offset by modest benefit from pricing/mix.  --EBIT margin is expected to 15.3% in 2016 and expand modestly to around  15.5%-16.0% in 2018. --EBITDA is expected to remain in the range of $2.5 billion over the 24-36  months, in line with 2015 levels.  --FCF after dividends is expected to be $250 million-$300 million in 2016 but  improve meaningfully to around $600 million-$700 million as Project K cash costs  subside in 2017. --Leverage (gross debt to EBITDA) remains in the low-3x range in 2016 and 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --A negative rating action could occur if Kellogg's organic growth rate is  negative in the low single digit range. Consistently negative trends would  signal that the company's renovation and brand support efforts are not effective  and/or that emerging markets performance is worse than expected. --Leverage moving toward mid-3.0x as a result of either poor performance or  material debt-financed share buybacks or acquisitions.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --A positive rating action could occur with sustained low- to mid-single-digit  organic growth with volume trends turning positive and with overall market  shares stable or improving. In addition, Kellogg would have to maintain leverage  consistently below 3x. LIQUIDITY Kellogg's $2.5 billion liquidity included its undrawn $2 billion revolving bank  facility plus $531 million cash and equivalents at July 2, 2016. While there is  pressure on FCF in 2016, Fitch expects this measure to improve substantially  beginning 2017. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Kellogg as follows:  Kellogg  --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB';  --Bank credit facility 'BBB';  --Short-Term IDR 'F2';  --Commercial paper (CP) 'F2'.  Kellogg Europe Company Limited  --Long-Term IDR 'BBB';  --Short-Term IDR 'F2';  --CP 'F2'.  Kellogg Holding Company Limited  --Long-Term IDR 'BBB';  --Short-Term IDR 'F2';  --CP 'F2'.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction.
