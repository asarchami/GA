9,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 17 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) first quarter 2014  (1Q'14) earnings of $1.14 billion were higher relative to both the sequential  and year-ago quarters, thanks in part to a $208 million reserve release in the  quarter, says Fitch Ratings.  These results equated to a good 1.53% return on  average assets (ROA) in 1Q'14, which compares well to other large regional  banks. Not including the reserve release, COF's ROA would have been in the 1.26% range,  which Fitch notes is still a good result.  Additionally, Fitch notes that this  adjusted ROA is likely a good run-rate for COF for the balance of the year, as  Fitch believes reserve releases should begin to abate. Total revenue declined from both the sequential and year-ago quarters given  lower net interest income (NII) due in part to modestly lower loan balances  relative to the sequential quarter, and lower non-interest income despite higher  purchase volumes.  Additionally, the company's net interest margin (NIM)  declined to 6.62% in 1Q'14 from 6.73% in the sequential quarter and 6.71% in the  year-ago quarter. Expenses declined due in part to lower marketing expenses relative to the  sequential quarter and relatively flat marketing expenses relative to the year  ago quarter.  The bigger impact to the expense line item, however, was the  adoption of a new accounting standard for the company's low income housing tax  credits in its commercial business.  This moved these credits out of the expense  line item and into the income tax line item.  Other than the different  accounting classification this didn't have a significant impact on bottom line  results. As previously noted, the overall loan portfolio was down relative to the  sequential quarter.  Domestic credit cards, COF's largest lending category,  declined as did loans in its consumer banking segment which includes auto loans  and legacy mortgages.  In this segment continued growth in auto was largely  offset by the expected run-off of the legacy mortgage loans.  The commercial  banking unit, COF's smallest, which includes traditional C&I lending as well as  some Commercial Real Estate (CRE) lending had some modest growth, but given its  smaller size, was unable to offset the decline in lower card balances. Credit quality for COF--as well as the rest of the industry--continues to be  very strong, with the overall net charge-off (NCO) rate declining to 1.92% in  1Q'14.  Fitch continues to believe that credit quality for COF and the banking  industry continues to be at or near a cyclical trough, and Fitch would expect  some deterioration in credit metrics over a medium-term time horizon. COF's Tier 1 common equity (CET1) ratio under the Basel III standardized  approach was 13% in 1Q'14, and under the advanced approach was above its target  of 8%.  Fitch continues to view COF's capital ratios as adequate, but below the  average of some similarly rated entities.  However, in Fitch's view, this  continues to be offset by COF's superior capital generation abilities relative  to some peers.

13,"  June 16 Capital One Financial Corp has agreed to fundamentally change the way it uses consumer database, ChexSystems, to restrict only customers who land in the database for fraud, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter.The deal stems from a broader investigation by NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman into how U.S. banks use private databases, the newspaper said. (r.reuters.com/syg22w)As part of an inquiry, Schneiderman requested more information from six banks, including Bank of America, Capital One and JPMorgan Chase, sending letters expressing concern that banks might be ""improperly denying or otherwise restricting banking access to New York consumers,"" the New York Times said. Databases such as ChexSystems provide data on how consumers handle deposit accounts at banks. A consumer's ChexSystems report typically contains banking irregularities such as check overdrafts, unsatisfied balances, depositing fraudulent checks, or suspicious account handling. Such databases were intended to weed out serial fraudsters.  However, regulators say banks are screening out potential customers and swelling the ranks of the so-called ""unbanked"" - the roughly 10 million households in the United States that lack even a basic bank account, according to the NYT. Other regulators such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are also starting to examine the role these databases play in restricting access to the banking system, the newspaper said.Capital One and the NY AG's office did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

16,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 18 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) second quarter 2014  (2Q'14) earnings were modestly higher than both the sequential and year-ago  quarters due largely a moderate reserve release as provision expense was less  than net-charge offs (NCO) and higher net interchange revenue on increased  purchase volumes and lower start-up costs on new rewards programs, according to  Fitch Ratings. These results equated to a 1.63% return on average assets (ROA), which Fitch  notes is a good result.  Given that Fitch expects reserve releases to further  abate over the course of the year due to credit quality likely being near or at  a cyclical trough and some loan growth necessitating higher provisioning, Fitch  would expect the company's ROA to trend down at some point over the next couple  of quarters. That said, COF remains sensitive to higher short-term interest rates, so should  they begin to rise (whenever that may be), this could help support the company's  ROA over an intermediate to longer-term time horizon. Total net revenue was up 2% relative to the sequential quarter as growth in net  interchange revenue amid higher purchase volumes and lower costs on some rewards  programs offset continued pressure on asset yields weighed on  net interest  income (NII) and the company's net interest margin (NIM), which came in at 6.55%  in 2Q'14.  Relative to the year-ago quarter total net revenue was down 3% driven  by lower NII and lower services charges on deposit accounts offset by higher net  interchange revenue. Non-interest expenses were up 2% relative to the sequential quarter, but down 1%  relative to the year-ago quarters.  Marketing expense modestly increased  relative to the sequential quarter as did other operating expenses, of which  higher occupancy and professional services costs were the drivers, in part  offset by lower acquisition related expenses.  Given the challenging revenue  environment amid the protracted low interest rate environment, Fitch continues  to expect expense management to be a focus of COF as well as the rest of the  banking industry.  Credit quality continues to be strong across COF's various lending products,  though there has been some very modest reversion in delinquencies and  non-performing assets for the company's auto loans.  Nevertheless this reversion  is off of a very low base.  On balance, Fitch continues to believe that credit  quality for COF, as well as its peer banks, is nearing or at a cyclical trough,  and Fitch would expect some reversion in these metrics over an intermediate to  longer-term time horizon. COF's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the Basel III fully phased in  advanced approach (COF's binding constraint) remained above its target of 8%.   Fitch continues to view COF's capital ratios as adequate, but below the average  of some similarly rated entities.  However, in Fitch's view, this continues to  be offset by COF's superior capital generation abilities relative to some peers.

This is largely  due to COF's comparatively higher net interest margin (NIM) given the company's  higher yielding asset mix compared to peer banks.  Fitch believes COF's good  cost structure has also helped to support earnings. This strength in earnings has, in part, been also boosted by modest quarterly  reserve releases.  Fitch would also note that COF's earnings have been noisy  given merger costs and purchase accounting adjustments impacting results over  the last couple of years.  Nevertheless, earnings remain above peer banks and  are a rating strength of COF. Fitch also views favourably the continued evolution of COF's funding profile,  which over the last several years has moved from one almost entirely reliant on  wholesale borrowings to now being almost entirely reliant on core deposit  funding.  This evolution has been achieved primarily via acquisition, with the  latest having been the ING Direct USA acquisition in 2011.  Additionally, this evolution of COF's funding profile is one of the reasons  ratings have remained largely stable through the credit crisis and subsequently. While Fitch would note that COF's capital ratios are near the average of its  large regional peer group. This is given COF's ability to accrete capital via  growth in retained earnings more quickly than peers due to its earnings power  noted above helps to offset the lower capital ratios. Given the challenging growth environment for COF--and the rest of the banking  industry--COF has been returning a significant portion of earnings to  shareholders via constant dividends and higher buybacks.  Fitch expects this to  continue over a near-term time horizon. COF's credit quality metrics--as well as those for the rest of the  industry--have continued to improve. Fitch believes they are likely at or near a  cyclical trough.  As such, Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit  metrics going forward particularly as competition in auto lending and commercial  & industrial (C&I) lending--two of COF's main businesses--continues to  intensify. Today's rating action encompasses this potential and expected credit  deterioration.  Additionally, Fitch would expect COF's credit metrics to be  above industry averages given its asset and customer mix, which is partially  offset in Fitch's mind by the higher yield (discussed above) earned on those  assets. Finally, Fitch notes that COF's interest rate risk positioning is relatively  neutral, which Fitch views positively from a credit perspective.  That said, it  remains to be seen if banks such as COF with large online banking platforms  experience materially higher deposit repricing (deposit beta) pressures than  those banks with checking and savings deposits originated out of branches. Should the deposit repricing pressure be higher than forecast, it could diminish  the company's asset sensitivity in a rising short-term rate environment should  that ever occur.  While this is a risk that is slightly unclear right now, Fitch  does not believe it is a ratings factor at this juncture. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch's ratings on COF have remained largely stable through the credit crisis  and subsequently. Fitch continues to believe that COF's ratings are well  situated relative to the company's large regional peer group. Fitch believes there is likely only modest upwards rating potential for COF's  ratings. From a creditor's perspective, given COF's concentrated loan portfolio in credit  cards relative to higher rated peers, Fitch would expect capital ratios to be  higher than peer group averages.  While the superior earnings generation noted  above helps to offset this at COF's current rating level, for upwards rating  momentum COF would need to have a consistently more diversified loan portfolio  or to run a higher capital ratios. Alternatively, should COF's asset quality metrics deteriorate faster than  industry averages or should funding costs (discussed above) accelerate at a rate  faster than industry averages, there could be some negative pressure on ratings  or the Rating Outlook over a medium-to-longer term time horizon. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   COF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should COF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. That  said, Fitch views this as unlikely though for COF given the strength of the  holding company liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that COF may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  COF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, COF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  COF's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by COF and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from COF or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by COF and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in COF's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of COF's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of the  subsidiary banks are equalized across the group.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalised with those of COF to reflect  support from their ultimate parent. As such, they are sensitive to changes in  the parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not  expect, or from changes in COF's IDRs.  To the extent that one of COF's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from COF's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS COF's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by COF and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in COF's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Capital One Financial Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Senior Shelf at 'A-' --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+';  --Preferred stock at 'BB'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

21,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 17 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) third quarter 2014  (3Q'14) earnings were down from both the sequential and year-ago quarters,  though in Fitch Ratings' opinion remained good, with the company generating a  1.50% return on average assets (ROA).  Additionally, the company's loan growth  moderately picked up as well. The company's earnings were down to somewhat higher provision expense related to  the company's loan growth noted above as well as higher marketing expenses on  the quarter.  The higher marketing spend likely helped drive some of the  company's growth.  Partially offsetting these higher expenses was the benefit  from a modestly higher net interest margin (NIM) given some mix shift away from  home loans and toward auto and card loans. COF's overall loans grew 2% from the sequential quarter and 5% from the year-ago  quarter, inclusive of the continued run-off of the company's legacy acquired  mortgage loans.  The primary loan growth areas continued to be in domestic  credit card, auto loans, as well as both traditional commercial and industrial  (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) lending. This higher growth largely was the reason for the increase in provision  expenses, which increased by $289 million or 41% from the sequential quarter.   This follows the company having more modest provisioning and some reserve  releases in prior quarters. While credit quality, on balance, continues to be good and likely at or near a  cyclical trough there was an uptick related to auto loan net charge-offs (NCO)  and retail loan NCOs relative to the sequential quarter.  That said, compared to  the year-ago quarter the NCO rates in these lending categories was relatively  flat. Fitch continues to believe that over time credit quality for COF as well as the  rest of the industry will begin to deteriorate as current asset quality trends  are likely unsustainable. COF's deposit balances remained relatively stable during the period with the  average cost of deposits also relatively stable.  Fitch continues to view  favorably the transformation of COF's funding profile away from wholesale  funding and towards deposit funding over the last several years. Fitch considers COF's capital ratios to be good.  The company's Basel III Common  Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the Advanced Approach, COF's binding  constraint, remains above 8%.  This combined with the company's solid earnings  generation helps to support the company's ratings and offset some of the  consumer-related concentration risk in the loan portfolio. Additionally, Fitch would expect COF to continue to execute on its buyback  program over the balance of the year.

28,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 23 (Fitch) Capital One Financial's (COF) fourth quarter  earnings were satisfactory, according to Fitch Ratings. The company's return on  average assets (ROA) clocked in at 1.27%, lower than the sequential quarter, but  an improvement relative to the year-ago quarter. Similarly the company's return  on average equity (ROE) was 8.61%, down from 10.12% in the sequential quarter,  but up from 8.27% in the year-ago quarter. Fitch notes that this result is below the company's long-term averages. This  quarter's ROE was impacted in particular by higher provision expense related to  the company's loan growth as well as higher expenses due in large part to higher  marketing expenses. That said, the higher marketing expense likely helped drive  some loan growth on the quarter. COF's net interest margin (NIM) improved to 6.81% in 4Q'14 due to a higher mix  of credit card receivables in the loan portfolio due to some credit card loan  growth as well as the continued run-off of acquired home loans. Should loan  growth continue, Fitch would expect this to continue as long as card receivables  continue to expand at a similar or greater rate. As noted, loan growth was a bright spot for COF. Total loans grew 3% and 6%  relative to the sequential and year-ago quarters respectively. In particular,  credit card loans (both domestic and international) grew 7% relative to the  sequential quarter and 6% relative to the year-ago quarter. Similarly, auto  loans grew 4% relative to the sequential quarter and 19% relative to the year  ago quarter, as COF continue to move up into the prime auto lending space. However, the loan growth was largely offset by a 4% sequential decline in home  loan and a 15% decline in home loans on a year-over-year basis. Fitch would  expect home loans to continue running off. Fitch notes that COF's overall credit quality remains at or near a cyclical  trough. This is particularly true in auto lending, credit card lending, as well  as commercial lending. Fitch would expect some reversion in COF's -- as well as  the rest of the industry's -- credit metrics over time. In Fitch's opinion the company's funding profile remains good, and has continued  to evolve towards a higher reliance on deposit funding and away from wholesale  funding over the last several years. Total deposits now constitute nearly 78% of  total liabilities. Fitch considers COF's capital ratios to be good. The company's Basel III Common  Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the advanced approach, COF's binding  constraint, remains above 8%.

29,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK American Express Co violated U.S. antitrust law by prohibiting merchants from steering consumers to use lower-cost credit cards, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, in the company's second major setback this month.The decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn followed American Express' loss on Feb. 12 of a lucrative, exclusive partnership with warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp.It is also a victory for the U.S. government and 17 states, which in 2010 sued American Express over allegations it forbade merchants from recommending to consumers which cards to use.The New York-based company's activities ""imposed actual, concrete harms on competition in the credit and charge card network services market,"" Garaufis wrote in a 150-page decision. He said he will decide on remedies later.American Express shares fell 1.7 percent.Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the government said. Those fees have also spurred many years of litigation by the merchants themselves against the card companies.""Today's decision is a triumph for fair competition and for American consumers,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. ""By recognizing that American Express's rules harm competition, the court vindicates the promise of robust marketplaces that is enshrined in our antitrust laws.""APPEAL PLANNED American Express said it will appeal, and that Garaufis' decision would harm competition by ""further entrenching the two dominant payment networks,"" Visa and MasterCard. ""We believe that freedom of choice and fair competition are worth defending,"" American Express said.Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had also been sued by the various governments over their ""anti-steering"" rules for merchants, but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes.""Large retailers can save a good chunk of money by encouraging customers to use cards like Visa and MasterCard,"" said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, an online marketplace. ""If a large retailer can go from paying 5 percent on a transaction to even 4 percent, that is a lot.""American Express has said its ""premium"" services justify its processing fees, which are higher than some rivals charge.It also said its merchant rules help it compete with Visa and MasterCard, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus 55 million for American Express. Garaufis, however, said American Express wrongfully exploited its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market by banning merchants from giving incentives for consumers to use one card over another, or telling consumers they might be better off if they did.""There is nothing to offset credit card networks' incentives - including American Express's incentive - to charge merchants inflated prices for their services,"" the judge wrote. ""This, in turn, results in higher costs to all consumers who purchase goods and services from these merchants.""FREEDOM OF CHOICE Douglas Kantor, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who represents the National Association of Convenience Stores,  welcomed the decision. ""It ought to open up the marketplace for more price competition where there isn't any at all today,"" he said in an interview. ""That helps merchants and consumers, because it can help keep prices down, and spur spending and economic activity.""Richard Dagen, an antitrust partner at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, said the decision may make it easier for small or new rivals to compete with American Express, Visa and MasterCard.""You might have a chance for someone like Discover to make inroads,"" he said, referring to Discover Financial Services . ""Whenever that happens, you're likely to see lower prices for the merchants, which hopefully get passed on to consumers.""Garaufis ruled after presiding over a seven-week non-jury trial last summer.The lawsuit sought to force American Express to give merchants who accept its cards the freedom to encourage consumers ""to use any payment method they choose.""No money damages were sought, but American Express has said a loss could have a ""material adverse effect"" on its business.That could add to the loss of earnings stemming from the demise of its partnership with Costco, which began in 1999 and will end in March 2016.American Express is the only credit payment form accepted at Costco's U.S. stores. Costco last year decided to replace American Express as its card partner in Canada with MasterCard and Capital One Financial Corp.Shares of American Express closed down $1.38 at $78.40. Visa fell 2 cents to $269.10, and MasterCard rose $1.47 to $89.20.The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al. U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 10-04496.",2015-02-19,COF,"Thu Feb 19, 2015 | 5:42pm EST",American Express card rules violated U.S. antitrust law - judge,http://www.reuters.com//article/american-express-antitrust-idUSL1N0VT1N720150219?type=companyNews
30,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 24 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) first  quarter 2015 (1Q15) earnings of $1.12 billion were good, in Fitch Ratings's  view. These results equated to a 1.47% return on average assets (ROAA) in 1Q15,  stronger than the 1.28% ROAA in the sequential quarter, but slightly lower than  the 1.53% ROAA in the year-ago quarter. Fitch notes that COF's earnings performance this quarter puts it near the top of  its regional bank peer group in 1Q15 from an ROAA perspective. Provision expense was a significant driver of COF's earnings this quarter, as  well as in the sequential and year-ago quarters. Relative to the sequential  quarter COF's provision expense declined by $174 million due to better than  expected credit quality, particularly in credit card lending as well as  relatively static overall loan balances. Relative to the year-ago quarter  provision expense was $200 million higher in 1Q15 primarily due to higher loan  balances in 1Q15 relative to the year-ago quarter. As noted, overall credit quality metrics were generally better in 1Q15 than in  the sequential or year-ago quarters, in part supported by improving economic  conditions. The credit quality improvements were particularly true in the card  portfolio, where credit performance continues to be better than expectations. In  the commercial portfolio credit performance continues to be excellent and  stable.  There was some modest deterioration in the auto portfolio, which was not  unexpected given the competitive dynamics of that market, but it still remains  good. Fitch would expect further deterioration in auto loan credit metrics over  time. Fitch notes that it continues to believe that credit quality for COF as well as  the rest of the industry is at or near a cyclical trough, and Fitch expects some  reversion in overall credit metrics over a medium term time horizon. Fitch notes that COF's liquidity position is good and continues to evolve. While  deposit growth has begun to moderate, total deposits in 1Q15 still increased by  2% relative to the sequential quarter and 1% relative to the year-ago quarter.  The company's loan-to-deposit ratio clocked in at 97%, which is satisfactory,  but higher than some peer institutions. As the company continues to gather  deposits, Fitch would expect this ratio to modestly improve (decline) further  over time. Additionally, Fitch believes the company to be in early compliance with the  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) as well. COF's transitionally phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under  the standardized approach was 12.5%, and under the advanced approaches remained  above 8%. Fitch continues to note that while COF's capital ratios have  historically been below those of peers, the company's stronger than peer capital  generation helps offset the lower ratios.

40,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Capital One Financial  Corporation's (COF) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of COF's ratings continues to be supported by strong earnings  performance, which over time has remained above the average of its large  regional peer group. In Fitch's view, this is largely driven by COF's  comparatively higher net interest margin, given the company's comparatively  higher yielding asset mix relative to peer banks. This has also been boosted by  higher interchange revenue over the last year, as COF has benefited from higher  purchase volumes from its customer base. COF also boasts a relatively good efficiency ratio relative to peer banks which  has also helped to support its earnings performance. While COF's 2Q15 earnings  were impacted by a large restructuring charge, the charge was primarily due to  management's efficiency initiatives, which are focused on making the company a  more digitally driven enterprise. Over time, Fitch believes this strategy will  contribute to making COF's business model more scalable and therefore help  maintain its strong earnings performance. Fitch views COF's capital ratios as near the average of some peer banks.  However, given COF's ability to accrete capital via growth in retained earnings  more quickly than some peers due to the earnings power noted above helps to  provide a buffer to these ratios. Fitch believes the long-term evolution of COF's funding profile to be supportive  to today's rating action. Over the last several years, COF has moved away from a  business model almost entirely reliant on wholesale borrowings and  securitizations to one being almost entirely reliant on core deposit funding via  a mix of organic deposit growth and acquisitions. Although COF has a combination of traditional branch banking deposits and  internet based deposits, COF's internet deposit platform allows the company to  offer more competitive deposit rates than others who rely more heavily on a more  expensive branch based distribution model. It remains to be seen how deposit  re-pricing (deposit beta) dynamics will evolve in a rising interest rate  environment for banks like COF that rely more heavily on technology based  distribution model. To the extent that the deposit re-pricing dynamics are more  intense, it could make the company's interest rate sensitivity more muted over a  medium to longer-term time horizon. Credit quality for COF (as well as the rest of the industry) has generally  continued to improve, and Fitch believes is likely at or near a cyclical trough.  Fitch would expect some deterioration in credit metrics going forward, which is  incorporated in today's rating action. Fitch believes the potential for some credit deterioration is more prevalent in  the company's auto loan portfolio, where competition continues to intensify  particularly as some auto-manufacturer owned lenders become more aggressive in  the space. Additionally, areas Fitch is watching for deterioration include COF's  taxi medallion lending portfolio and its energy loan portfolio.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES COF's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a-' for loss  severity. COF's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed due  to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association  (COBNA), Capital One National Association (CONA), and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B.  are rated one-notch higher than COF's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S.  uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference  gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  COF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. The ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The VRs of COBNA and CONA are equalized with COF's VR reflecting Fitch's view  that it is core to COF's business strategy and financial profile.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR COF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, COF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT COF's ratings have remained largely stable over the last several years and are  well situated relative to its peer group. Fitch believes there is likely only modest upwards rating potential for COF's  ratings at this time. From a creditor's perspective COF's loan portfolio is more  concentrated in credit cards and other consumer assets relative to higher rated  peer institutions. In order for some upward rating momentum to build, Fitch  believes COF would need to develop a more diversified loan portfolio at a  measured pace with evidence of strong underwriting discipline and appropriate  risk controls to manage the diversification, all of which may take some time to  eventuate to the extent it ever does. Alternatively, should COF's asset quality metrics deteriorate faster than  industry averages or should funding costs accelerate at a rate faster than  industry averages there could be some negative pressure on ratings or the Rating  Outlook over a medium to longer term time horizon. Additionally, while Fitch views favorably management's strategy of transforming  COF into an even more digitally driven enterprise as it should enhance the  company's economies of scale, to the extent that this also makes the company  more reliant on technology it has the potential to increase some elements of  operational risk. While not anticipated, if a large operational loss were to  occur, Fitch would review COF's ratings at that time to determine if a negative  action were appropriate. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for COF and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to COF's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to COF's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should COF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of COF to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in COF's IDRs.

41,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 23 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) third  quarter 2015 (3Q15) earnings were relatively good as the company delivered a  1.43% return on average assets (ROAA), up from the sequential quarter which was  impacted by a large restructuring charge, but down 8 basis points from the  year-ago quarter. Similarly, return on average equity (ROAE) was 9.54% for 3Q15, up from 7.30%  sequentially, but down from 10.12% year over year.  While Fitch considers this a  good result, it is also below our range of estimates for the company's long-term  cost of equity assumption. It is noteworthy that this quarter also included a $69 million build of  litigation reserves relative to the company's U.K. Payment Protection Insurance  (PPI) reserve.  The build last quarter was $78 million.  For the industry, PPI  insurance was supposed to cover a consumer's debt payments if they were not  employed, but in many cases these policies were alleged to have been mis-sold  and are now creating a liability for the sellers. COF's total net revenue expanded 4% sequentially and 5% from the year over year.  This was the result of higher net interest income (NII) in 3Q15 relative to both  periods, as non-interest income was flat relative to both periods. The NII growth was due to higher loan balances, largely the result of growth in  domestic credit card receivables, which grew 4% sequentially and 12% year over  year.   As the company continues to run-off its legacy acquired mortgage loans, the  growth in the higher yield card receivables noted above as well as one extra day  in the quarter helped to push up the company's net interest margin (NIM), which  ticked up to 6.73% in 3Q15, versus 6.56% sequentially quarter and 6.69% year  over year.   It is noteworthy that COF's purchase volume was up strongly again, climbing 2%  sequentially and 22% year over year.  However, despite this strong purchase  volume, net interchange fees were down 2% sequentially and only up 6% year over  year. Fitch believes much of the interchange generated from purchase volume continues  to fund rewards programs.  Across the industry the competition related to  customer rewards programs remains high.  Fitch believes that this dynamic helped  keep non-interest income flat. Overall non-interest expense was down 4% sequentially, but up 6% year over year.  Given the revenue growth as well as the reasonably good expense management the  efficiency ratio improved to 53.56% in 3Q15.  While Fitch expects management to  remain vigilant on expenses through the balance of the year and into 2016, we  believe the efficiency ratio may modestly tick-up. Overall provision expense was $1.09 billion, down 3% sequentially but up 10%  year over year.   Compared to 2Q15, the story is mixed, with lower provisioning in credit cards  due to still better-than-expected credit performance partially offset by higher  provisioning in the company's commercial portfolio, which has been impacted by  weakness in COF's taxi medallion portfolio and energy lending portfolio. The growth in provision relative to a year ago was due to growth in overall card  balances, growth in auto balances, and the modest credit deterioration in the  commercial portfolios noted above. Despite some of the issues in the commercial portfolio, overall credit metrics  remain good with an overall net charge-off (NCO) rate of 2.96%.  In addition,  the commercial portfolio's the non-performing loan rate was 0.87%, higher versus  the year-ago period, but still a good result. Fitch continues to believe that overall credit metrics for COF - as well as the  rest of the industry - remain near a cyclical trough and would expect some  reversion in credit metrics over time.  Other than the aforementioned areas in  COF's commercial portfolio, we are also cautious on some eventual deterioration  auto loans for COF as well as the rest of the industry.   COF's liquidity position is good and continues to evolve. While deposit growth  has begun to moderate, total deposits in 3Q15 still increased by 1% sequentially  and 3% year over year.  The company's loan-to-deposit ratio ticked up to 100%, which is higher than some  peer institutions. During the quarter, COF used some wholesale funding as well  as deposits to fund its loan growth.  Over time, as COF continues to gather  deposits, Fitch would expect this ratio to modestly improve (i.e. to decline). Additionally, Fitch believes the company to be in early compliance with the  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) as well. COF's transitionally phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under  the standardized approach was 12.1%, and under the advanced approaches remained  above 8%.

48,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 28 (Fitch) Capital One's Financial Corporation's (COF) fourth  quarter 2015 (4Q15) earnings were down due to higher provisioning and some  higher marketing expenses.  The company's overall return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.12% in 4Q15, still a  good result relative to peers but down from 1.43% in the sequential quarter and  1.28% in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, the company's return on average equity (ROE) was 7.36% in 4Q15, down  from 9.54% in the sequential quarter and 8.61% in the year-ago quarter. These  results are below Fitch's estimated range of a cost of equity assumption for COF  of between 10% to 12%. Provision expense for COF increased 26% from the sequential quarter and 24% from  the year-ago quarter. This was due to a number of factors including continued  growth in credit card receivables and auto loans. Provision expense this quarter  also included the impact of higher provisioning in the company's energy loan  portfolio as oil prices continue to decline. That said, the company's energy  loan exposure of $3.1 billion represents only 1.3% of total loans as of 4Q15. COF's marketing expense also increased by 35% relative to the sequential quarter  and 11% from the year-ago quarter, but Fitch notes that this did help drive  higher card balances and purchase volumes during the quarter. Fitch believes  this is a lever management will episodically dial up and down based on market  opportunities. The company also completed its acquisition of GE's healthcare lending business  in December 2015, which boosted ending commercial loans by $8.3 billion, which  also drove $49 million of provision to bring on the new loans and $20 million of  operating expense from deal close costs. Notwithstanding some of the drivers of higher overall expenses noted above, the  company's total revenue increased 5% from the sequential quarter and 11% from  the year-ago quarter.  Net interest income (NII) continues to expand due largely to higher loan  balances during the quarter. In addition, the company's net interest margin  (NIM) in 4Q15 ticked up modestly to 6.79% as there was some mix shift with  lower-yielding mortgages being replaced by higher-yield card and auto loans. Non-interest income was up 5% from the sequential quarter and 7% from the  year-ago quarter due largely to higher purchase volumes which drove net  interchange revenue higher on the quarter. Purchase volume was up 8% relative to  the sequential quarter and 19% relative to the year-ago quarter. Fitch notes that COF's purchase volume growth outpaced growth in credit card  receivables, indicating the possibility that its customer base is skewing more  towards transactional-oriented customers rather than those who maintain  revolving balances. COF's liquidity position is good and continues to evolve. While deposit growth  has begun to moderate, total deposits in 4Q15 still grew by 2% relative to the  sequential quarter and 5% relative to the year-ago quarter.  The company's loan-to-deposit ratio ticked up to 102%, which is higher than that  of some peer institutions. During the quarter, COF used some wholesale funding  as well as deposits to fund its loan growth. Over time, as COF continues to  gather deposits, Fitch would expect this ratio to modestly improve (i.e.  decline). Fitch believes the company to be in early compliance with the Liquidity Coverage  Ratio (LCR) as well. COF's transitionally phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under  the standardized approach was 11.1% down from 12.1% in the sequential quarter  due in part to the GE Healthcare transaction which closed in December 2015.  Under the advanced approaches, COF's Basel III CET1 ratio remained above 8%.  Contact: Justin Fuller, CFA Senior Director  +1-312-368-5472 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

51,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) first  quarter 2016 (1Q16) earnings were down due to higher provisioning across its  platform, but particularly within the company's energy loan portfolio, according  to Fitch Ratings. COF's overall return on average assets (ROAA) was a still good 1.23% in 1Q16  relative to 1.12% in the sequential quarter and 1.47% in the year-ago quarter.   Fitch notes that the 1Q16 ROAA still compares favorably to many regional bank  peers during the quarter. However, the company's annualized return on average  equity (ROE) during 1Q16 was 8.52%, which is below Fitch's estimate range of a  cost of equity assumption for COF of between 10% to 12%. As noted, the main driver of COF's earnings performance this quarter was higher  provisioning.  The overall provision expense in 1Q16 was $1.53 billion due to  auto loan growth as well as incrementally higher auto loan net charge-off rates  (NCO), coupled with higher levels of criticized energy assets. Auto loans grew 3% from the sequential quarter and 10% from the year-ago  quarter.  NCO rates in auto loans were 1.60% in 1Q16, and management expects  this to increase gradually.  Additionally, there was some evidence of used car  values declining during the quarter which also helped to push up the allowance. Within the energy portfolio both criticized assets and non-performing assets  increased in 1Q16, and as a result COF boosted the allowance for loan losses in  the energy portfolio. The total allowance for energy related loans is now $262  million as of the end of 1Q16, which represents 8.15% of loans held for  investment, which Fitch considers reasonable, though below the level of some  peers. To put COF's energy exposure in context, despite some customer draws on their  lines of credit in 1Q16, total oil and gas loans ended the quarter at $3.2  billion, at only 1.5% of total company loans and 6.3% of total equity.  COF's  unfunded energy exposure decreased to $2.7 billion due to the customer draws  noted above as well as some reductions in borrowing bases. Fitch continues to view COF's energy exposure to be manageable within the  context of the company's earnings performance. Total revenue for COF excluding provisions was flat relative to the sequential  quarter but up 10% relative to the year-ago quarter.  This was due to higher net  interest income (NII) given higher loan balances due in part to the closing of  the GE Healthcare transaction as well as continued growth in credit card loans.   It was surprising that COF did not benefit more from the Federal Reserve's  interest rate increase in the latter part of 2015, as the company's interest  costs modestly ticked up on wholesale borrowings while overall asset yields  remained steady.  This asset yield impact was largely due to mix changes given  the closing of the GE Healthcare transaction.  As such, the net interest margin  (NIM) ticked down 4 basis points relative to the sequential quarter to 6.75% at  the end of 1Q16. Non-interest income was down relative to the sequential quarter but up relative  to the year-ago quarter largely driven by changes in interchange net revenue.   This was not overly surprising as purchase volume seasonally declined during  1Q16 relative to the sequential quarter, but was up strongly relative to the  year-ago quarter as COF's QuickSilver and Venture cards continue to gain  traction. Non-interest expenses continue to be comparatively well controlled, as COF  demonstrated the ability to achieve positive operating leverage relative to both  the sequential and year-ago quarters.  As such, the company's efficiency ratio  remained strong at 51.82% as of the end of 1Q16. Fitch continues to consider COF's capital and liquidity positions as appropriate  for its rating category. COF's loan-to-deposit ratio was 100% which is lower than the sequential quarter,  but somewhat higher than most other regional bank peers. Additionally, the company's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio as of  the end of 1Q16 was 11.1% under the standardized approach and remains above 8%  under the advanced approach.

57,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 22 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) second  quarter 2016 (2Q16) earnings were down 7% sequentially due to higher  provisioning in the company's domestic credit card portfolio and higher  operating costs, according to Fitch Ratings. COF's overall return on average assets (ROAA) was a still good 1.13% in 2Q16  relative to 1.23% in the sequential quarter and 1.11% in the year-ago quarter.   Fitch notes that the 2Q16 ROAA still compares favorably to many regional bank  peers during the quarter. However, the company's annualized return on average  equity (ROE) during 2Q16 was 7.64%, which continues to be below Fitch's  estimated cost of equity range for COF of between 10% to 12%. Provision expense was the main driver of COF's earnings performance this quarter  at $1.59 billion mainly due to an 18% sequential increase in the provision for  credit cards. This was driven by COF's ongoing loan growth in this segment as  well as higher anticipated net charge-offs (NCOs) in 2017.  Higher provisions  related to COF's taxi medallion portfolio (discussed below) also modestly  contributed to the increase. Credit card loans grew 5% from the sequential quarter and 11% from the year-ago  quarter.  NCO rates in card loans were 4.02% in 2Q16, and management expects  this to increase into the low-4s in 2017.  Additionally, COF also increased its  auto loan allowance by $58 million due to higher subprime originations and an  expected decline in used car prices from currently high levels.  COF also built an additional $60 million of reserves in its taxi medallion  financing business. This business is small for COF at $854 million of loans, but  nonperforming loans rose to 38% from 30% during the quarter. Pressure from ride  hailing applications, particularly in the Chicago market, have impacted  collateral values in this business by about 60%. Within the energy portfolio, loans decreased by 7% due to lower borrowing bases  from the spring redeterminations. Provisions were minimal after the reserve  build last quarter and the total allowance for energy related loans now stands  at 8.87% of funded exposure. This level increased moderately during the quarter  due to the decrease in loans and is roughly in line with peers. Non-performing  and criticized loans in the portfolio decreased moderately but remain elevated. To put COF's energy exposure in context, total oil and gas loans ended the  quarter at $3 billion, at only 1.3% of total company loans and 6.2% of total  equity.  COF's unfunded energy exposure decreased slightly to $2.7 billion due  to the reductions in borrowing bases noted above. Despite some signs of pressure across COF's various lending businesses, Fitch  continues to believe this is manageable for the company within the context of  its solid earnings profile. Total revenue for COF excluding provisions was up 1% relative to the sequential  quarter and up 12% relative to the year-ago quarter.  This was due to higher net  interest income (NII) given higher loan balances due in part to the closing of  the GE Healthcare transaction as well as continued growth in credit card loans.   The net interest margin (NIM) ticked down 2 basis points relative to the  sequential quarter to 6.73% at the end of 1Q16 due to high deposit costs and  weaker securities yields. Relative to the year-ago quarter it is up 17 basis  points due to the growth in the high-yielding credit card loan portfolio. Non-interest income was flat relative to the sequential quarter but up 2%  relative to the year-ago quarter largely driven by higher interchange net  revenue.  This follows trends also seen at competitors due to higher purchase  volumes and due to COF's QuickSilver and Venture cards continuing to gain  traction. Non-interest expenses continue to be comparatively well controlled, though COF  had a small uptick in growth expenses relative to the sequential quarter.  The  company's efficiency ratio remained strong at 52.7% as of the end of 2Q16. COF's loan-to-deposit ratio was 106% which is modestly higher than the  sequential quarter, and remains somewhat higher than most other regional bank  peers. Fitch continues to view COF's funding profile favorably in the context of  the shift over the past several years towards core deposit funding rather than  wholesale borrowings. Additionally, the company's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio as of  the end of 2Q16 was 10.9% under the standardized approach. The estimated CET1  ratio under the advanced approach remains above 8% and COF announced it no  longer believes this approach will be the long-term capital constraint for the  company. Fitch believes this level of capital continues to be adequate for COF's  rating category. Contact: Justin Fuller, CFA Senior Director  +1-312-368-5472 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

61,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Capital One Financial  Corporation's (COF) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The  affirmation and Stable Outlook are driven by COF's continued solid earnings  performance, still good credit performance, and satisfactory capital ratios for  its business model.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION). Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of COF's ratings continues to be supported by good earnings  performance, which over time has remained above the average of its large  regional peer group. In Fitch's view, this is largely driven by COF's  comparatively higher net interest margin, given its proportionately larger mix  of higher yielding credit card receivables in its loan portfolio relative to  peer institutions. COF also continues to drive a strong efficiency ratio relative to peer banks  which has also helped to support its earnings performance and therefore its  ratings. Going forward Fitch expects COF to continue to have a strong efficiency  ratio given its significant investments in becoming digital in its operations  and customer interfaces. Fitch believes these investments have the potential to  more meaningfully increase scale benefits for COF relative to peer institutions  over time. Fitch continues to believe the long-term evolution of COF's funding profile is  supportive of today's rating action. Over the last several years, COF has moved  away from a business model almost entirely reliant on wholesale borrowings and  securitizations to one being more fully reliant on deposit funding via a mix of  organic deposit growth and acquisitions. While Fitch views this movement positively, COF's loan-to-deposit ratio remains  on the high-end of peer averages, routinely hovering around 100% relative to a  mid-70% average for many other peers.  Fitch views COF's capital ratios as supportive to the rating, particularly when  taken in context of the company's ability to accrete capital via growth in  retained earnings more quickly than some peers. However, Fitch believes the strength of this capital position is partially  offset by the company's higher concentration in consumer lending assets, which  encompass credit card loans, auto loans, and some installment loans. These asset  classes tend to carry higher yields but also have higher loss ratios.  While COF has worked to further balance its loan portfolio, most notably with  the acquisition of General Electric's healthcare lending business in 2015, it  still remains more concentrated than some peers. To the extent that COF  continues to prudently diversify its loan portfolio this could lead to  longer-term upside to the ratings (discussed in the ratings sensitivities  section below). Credit quality for COF (as well as the rest of the industry) has generally  continued to be good, but there is some evidence of the beginnings of a modest  reversion in certain asset classes. This reversion has already occurred in COF's  energy loan portfolio, though at $3 billion energy loans only represent 1.3% of  total company loans. Additionally, there has been some credit deterioration in  COF's relatively small taxi medallion lending portfolio, as pressure from ride  hailing applications, particularly in the Chicago market, has impacted  collateral values in this business by about 60%. However, the taxi medallion  portfolio is only approximately $854 million or 0.36% of total loans. This  deterioration has been manageable for the company in the context of its good  quarterly earnings generation. Fitch believes that some credit deterioration is likely in the company's auto  loan portfolio. Across the auto lending industry Fitch has become cautious about  the extension of loan terms as well as the potential for declines in used car  prices (e.g collateral values) over the next couple of years.  COFs auto loan portfolio has a higher proportion of loans to non-prime customers  than the auto portfolios of other peer institutions. As a result, Fitch believes  COF's auto loan portfolio will exhibit higher delinquency trends and loss rates  on a going forward relative to most other peer banks that have been more focused  on originating only prime auto loans. Fitch generally expects the potential auto loan credit deterioration to be  manageable through COF's quarterly earnings, but credit performance is expected  to be slightly worse than its peers. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  COF has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, COF is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES COF's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a-' for loss  severity. COF's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance. These ratings are in  accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instrument's  non-performance and loss severity risk profiles and have thus been affirmed  based on the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Capital One Bank (USA), National Association  (COBNA), Capital One National Association (CONA), and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B.  are rated one-notch higher than COF's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S.  uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference  gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  COF's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. The ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The VRs of COBNA and CONA are equalized with COF's VR, reflecting Fitch's view  that it is core to COF's business strategy and financial profile.  RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch believes there may be some incremental upward rating potential for COF's  ratings over the long term if COF continues to prudently diversify its loan  portfolio to achieve a more balanced mix between consumer and commercial assets.  Further, the ratings could be upgraded one notch over time if COF achieves loan  portfolio diversification with solid asset quality performance and improved  funding more consistent with peer banks and also maintains current capital  levels.  Alternatively, should COF's asset quality metrics deteriorate faster than  industry averages and not be manageable within the context of quarterly earnings  this could pressure the ratings or Outlook. Additionally, should COF's funding  costs accelerate at a rate significantly faster than industry averages this  could also potentially result in negative ratings pressure. Fitch views very favorably management's strategy of transforming COF into an  even more digitally driven enterprise as it should help the company maintain its  efficiency ratio at better than peer averages. However, to the extent that this  also makes the company more reliant on technology than some peers, it could  potentially increase some elements of operational risk.  While not anticipated, if a large operational loss were to occur, Fitch would  review COF's ratings at that time to determine if a negative action were  appropriate. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Since COF's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for COF and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to COF's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to COF's  long- and short-term IDRs.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should COF's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of COF to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in COF's IDRs.  To the extent that one of COF's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from COF's IDR. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Capital One Financial Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Senior Shelf at 'A-' --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+';  --Preferred stock at 'BB'; --Support at '5';  --Support Floor at 'NF'.

64,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 26 (Fitch) Capital One Financial Corporation's (COF) third  quarter 2016 (3Q16) earnings were good and showed evidence of continued growth  in the company's domestic credit card business and auto loan business, according  to Fitch Ratings. COF's overall return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.18% in 3Q16, up from 1.13%  in the sequential quarter, but down 1.43% in the year-ago quarter. The  year-over-year decline is primarily due to higher provision expense related to  continued growth of the credit card portfolio as well as some problem assets in  the company's energy portfolio and taxi medallion portfolio as well as $63  million of costs related to a build in the U.K. Payment Protection Insurance  customer refund reserve. The company's return on average equity (ROE) was 8.59% in 3Q16 up from 7.64% in  the sequential quarter, but down from 9.54% in the year-ago quarter for the same  reasons noted above. Overall revenue growth, while improved, remains challenging  amid strong competition for card, auto, and commercial loans.  COF's balance sheet has continued to expand, growing 1.7% from the sequential  quarter and 10% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth is due to  both the GE Healthcare acquisition which closed at the end of 2015 as well as  the previously noted growth in the company's large domestic credit card  portfolio, which expanded 3% relative to the sequential quarter and 11% relative  to the year-ago quarter. Fitch believes this growth in the card portfolio is due to COF's continued  efforts in marketing both its QuickSilver and Venture cards, both of which have  comparatively good rewards programs. The cost of these rewards programs have  partially offset some of the benefits to earnings from the growth noted above. COF's deposit portfolio has grown more modestly, expanding 2% from the  sequential quarter and 6% from the year-ago quarter to $226 million as of 3Q16.  Given that loans grew faster than deposits the company's loan-to-deposit ratio  remained elevated at approximately 106% as of 3Q16. COF primarily used  securitizations and modest increases in wholesale borrowing to fund the loan  growth. Given the growth in the loan portfolio, particularly as it relates to  comparatively higher yielding credit card receivables, the company's net  interest income grew 4% from the sequential quarter and 11% from the year-ago  quarter. Similarly the company's net interest margin (NIM) ticked up to a strong  6.79% in 3Q16, up from 6.73% in both the sequential and year-ago periods. While COF's purchase volume increased 12% year-over-year, total non-interest  income only grew 2% from the sequential quarter and 4% from the year-ago  quarter, as Fitch believes COF is continuing to use more of its interchange  revenue to fund its good rewards programs noted above. Total non-interest expenses for COF grew 2% from the sequential quarter and 6%  from the year-ago quarter as the company continues to manage expenses carefully  within the context of its efforts to develop digital operating platforms and  customer interfaces. Relative to both the sequential and year-ago quarters, COF  did deliver positive operating leverage and the company's efficiency ratio  ticked down to 52.02% in 3Q16. As noted provision expense increased significantly increased relative to the  year-ago quarter due to the acquisition of the GE Healthcare portfolio, growth  in credit card and auto loan receivables, and some year-over-year deterioration  the energy and taxi medallion portfolios. Relative to the sequential quarter  provision was flat as provision related to growth in the credit card and auto  loan portfolios was offset by some moderating of the energy loan portfolio. COF's overall credit quality remains good, with the company's net charge-off  (NCO) ratio ticking up modestly to 2.10% in 3Q16 which relative to the last 10  years is still low, though Fitch would note that COF's 30 day+ delinquency ratio  is up nine basis points from the prior year period, still solid compared to  historical averages. Additionally, this quarter's NCO ratio compares to 2.01% in  the sequential quarter and 1.69% in the year-ago quarter.  The up-tick was due to continued seasoning and growth in the domestic credit  card and auto loan portfolios. Fitch continues to believe credit quality in  these portfolios is around cyclical troughs, and would expect further reversion  in NCO ratios over a medium-term time horizon. As noted, in the commercial portfolio both the energy and taxi medallion  portfolios remain problematic. Given the rise in energy prices over the last  several months, there has been some moderating of the deteriorating trends in  the energy portfolio. Total energy loans are down to $5.4 billion, or 3.98% of  the total commercial portfolio, and 1.11% of the total loan portfolio. Given the  lower loan balances, the allowance was down sequentially by $22 million, but the  energy reserve coverage remains good at 9.18% of loans held for investment. COF's taxi medallion portfolio continues to see credit deterioration amid the  proliferation of ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft. However, the  exposure remains modest at 1.16% of commercial loans and 0.32% of total loans.  The allowance for this portfolio is $111mn as of 3Q16, representing reserve  coverage of 14.32% of loans held for investment, but only 1.7% of the total  allowance. COF's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the standardized  approach as of the end of 3Q16 was 10.6% relative to 10.9% at the end of 2Q16.  The decline was attributable to some share repurchases during the quarter as  well as the balance sheet growth noted above. Similar to last quarter, COF noted  that standardized ratio will be the long-term capital constraint for the  company.
