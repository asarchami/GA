4,"  (Corrects paragraph four to show Mason Morfit is Microsoft's youngest, newest member)SEATTLE, March 20 Microsoft Corp said on Thursday Steve Luczo stepped down from its board of directors so he can focus on his job as chief executive of digital storage company Seagate Technology Plc.Luczo's exit comes just six weeks after the appointment of Satya Nadella as Microsoft chief executive, which Luczo played a key role in as a member of the software company's four-man search committee.""With the CEO search completed and Satya off to a strong start, this felt like an appropriate time to make this change so I can turn my full attention to leading Seagate,"" said Luczo in a statement. Luczo, 57, had been a member of Microsoft's board since May 2012. He was the board's youngest and newest member until the appointment of Mason Morfit last week, and was regarded by Wall Street as one of the more tech-savvy directors. Microsoft has had trouble keeping younger board members recently. Netflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings left Microsoft's board in 2012 after five years' service.""This just speaks to evolution that is happening in Redmond,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, referring to Microsoft's headquarters near Seattle. ""We could see more changes to the board over the coming years as new blood enters the board of directors and tries to move this company in the right direction."" The board now has 10 members, including former Chief Executive Officers Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.Microsoft shares rose 2.7 percent on Thursday to hit their highest since mid-2000 on the Nasdaq, closing at $40.33, spurred by hopes that Nadella can revitalize the software giant as it transitions into the era of mobile computing.

6,"   By Noel Randewich and Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 11  SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 11 Improved demand for personal computers after years of declines may not last as emerging markets remain weak and recent corporate upgrades in the United States and Europe may prove fleeting.The latest sign that the PC market's stability could be short-lived came from technology distributor Synnex Corp . Its shares have slumped 16 percent since Chief Executive Officer Kevin Murai warned earlier in July that increased demand was already waning from companies buying new computers to upgrade their operating systems after Microsoft Corp stopped supporting Windows XP in April.Investors have pushed shares in PC mainstays Microsoft and Intel Corp and parts suppliers such as Seagate and Western Digital Corp to decade- or record-highs, partly on bets that the global slump in PC demand that began with Apple Inc's launch of the iPad in 2010 may have hit bottom.But detractors point out the story is far from certain. Demand is still falling in emerging markets such as China, crucial to any sustained comeback. While up to a quarter of the world's PCs still employ the 13-year-old Windows XP, it is unclear how many will choose tablets or Apple and Google Inc  ""Chrome"" computers over PCs, rather than upgrade to newer Windows versions.""If this is only a couple quarters of flat growth and all of a sudden we go down to 5 and 7 percent year-over-year declines again, then people are going to get nervous and say we don't know where the bottom is,"" said Chuck Jones, founder of research firm Sand Hill Insights. Intel reports its second-quarter results on Tuesday, while Microsoft posts earnings on July 22 and both are likely to shed more light on the state of the global PC market. Seagate, which reports on July 17 and Western Digital, which gives its results on July 30, could fill in the picture further.BETTER SENTIMENT  Optimism on Wall Street has grown since Intel unexpectedly raised its quarterly and annual revenue outlooks in June, sending its shares to levels not seen in a decade. Microsoft's stock is at highs last seen in 2000.Shipments of PCs were flat in the June quarter, according to research firm Gartner, a better-than-expected result. ""Market feedback on the PC space is much better than 18 months ago,"" memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc  President Mark Adams told Reuters in June. ""We've been talking and planning about the back half of the year with our customers and  they're pretty focused on making sure we don't take away (DRAM) capacity."" DRAM chips are widely used in PCs.Global tablet shipments in the March quarter fell for the first time ever, according to NPD DisplaySearch. U.S. consumers who once thought they would get by with a tablet are gravitating toward cheap laptops.""The PC is not dead. There is a healthy market under there,"" FBR analyst Chris Rolland said, pointing to a gradually improving U.S. economy.But in China and other developing countries, once major growth engines for the PC industry, shipments of laptops are still falling as consumers choose tablets. It is unclear to what extent people in developing countries will eventually follow wealthier U.S. consumers back to buying both tablets and laptops, said IDC analyst Loren Loverde.Even Microsoft no longer sounds as confident in the PC's prospects. In a recent TV commercial, it described its newest Surface Pro as a ""tablet that can replace your laptop,"" a major shift for a company that still depends on PCs for a sizeable amount of revenue.

Taiwan-based Realtek accused the companies of violating a patent to make an integrated circuit with high frequency and low noise.The commission found that Seagate and LSI, which was purchased by Avago this year, used the same technology as in the patent. But it also found that Realtek does not have a U.S. business and thus could not enforce the patent using the ITC.    The ITC can rule that a patent has been violated if the accused company infringes the patent and if the patent owner uses the patent in the United States.     Realtek filed a complaint with the ITC in September 2012 accusing the two companies of infringing on two of its patents for making integrated circuits used in a wide array of electronics.

16,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to  Seagate HDD Cayman's (Seagate HDD) $300 million of 20-year senior unsecured  notes offering. The notes will be guaranteed by Seagate Technology plc  (Seagate), the parent company of Seagate HDD. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Net proceeds from the debt offering will be used for the redemption of all  outstanding 6.8% senior notes due 2016, of which $331 million were outstanding  as of Oct. 3, 2014. The senior notes offering and concurrent redemption (the  transaction) are consistent with Seagate's efforts to reduce its weighted  average cost of debt and extend its debt maturity schedule. Seagate's net $31 million debt reduction will result in a Fitch estimated  decrease in total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) to 1.36x as of Oct.  3, 2014, from 1.37x prior to the transaction. Fitch anticipates Seagate's  leverage will remain near 1x through the intermediate term.  Fitch anticipates interest coverage (operating EBITDA to gross interest expense)  will remain near 15x through the intermediate term. Fitch estimates this metric  will increase to 13.6x versus 13.4x prior to the transaction. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Ratings and Outlook reflect: --Continued expectations for relatively stable hard disk drive (HDD) pricing due  to a highly consolidated industry structure, with the market leaders, Seagate  and Western Digital Corp. (WDC), controlling approximately 84% of the market;  solid long-term growth in heads and media, key components of an HDD; and tightly  managed capital expenditures across the supply chain that minimizes the risk of  supply and demand imbalances. --Positive profitability trends from a favorable mix shift toward higher  capacity HDDs for cloud computing that utilize greater media and heads per  drive, thereby absorbing a greater amount of fixed-cost investments than lower  capacity PC drives. --Solid liquidity and financial flexibility supported by $2.2 billion in cash,  the vast majority of which is readily accessible without adverse tax  considerations, positive annual free cash flow (FCF), and an undrawn $500  million senior unsecured revolving credit facility due April 2018. --Strong credit protection metrics and management's commitment to conservative  financial policies. --Broad product portfolio, significant scale in the HDD industry and vertically  integrated model, which reduces per-unit manufacturing costs and facilitates  new-product time to market, albeit resulting in a greater fixed cost base that  exacerbates cyclical effects. Fitch's rating concerns include: --Long-term threat of technology substitution from NAND flash-based solid state  drives. Fitch believes, however, the high relative cost of flash-based storage  will continue to limit SSD storage capacity in PCs and tablets, thereby  increasing demand for HDDs in external or cloud storage. Enterprises using SSDs  deploy a multi-tiered storage strategy whereby the vast majority of data is  stored on HDDs and only data for high performance applications is stored on  higher cost SSDs. --Substantial historical volatility in earnings and FCF due to the cyclicality  of HDD demand and significant fixed costs; --Moderating, but still consistent, declines in average selling prices for HDDs  due to low HDD switching costs; --Event risk associated with implementation of aggressive shareholder-friendly  activities, primarily debt-financed share repurchases; --Seagate's ability to sustain a time- to-market advantage critical to achieving  market share gains and maintaining overall profitability, given formidable  competition from WDC. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive:  --Future ratings upgrades are currently unlikely due to the long-term threat of  technology substitution from SSD, where Seagate lacks a dominant product  position relative to HDDs. Negative: --If the cost per gigabyte differential between enterprise HDD and SSD narrows  significantly, resulting in greater than expected cannibalization of enterprise  HDDs, and Seagate's enterprise SSD products are uncompetitive; --If Seagate's enterprise market share materially erodes on a sustained basis  due to more formidable competition from WDC; --If the company pursues more aggressive financial policies, such as sizable  debt-financed share repurchases; --If Ultrabooks with SSD materially cannibalize the traditional notebook market,  SSHs fail to achieve significant penetration in the Ultrabook market, and growth  in near-line enterprise and external HDDs is insufficient to offset the decline  in EBs shipped to the notebook HDDs. Fitch forecasts more than $1.9 billion of annual FCF (cash from operations less  capital expenditures and dividends) through the intermediate term and calculates  FCF was $1.35 billion in the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Oct. 3, 2014. This is  down from $1.39 billion in the corresponding year ago period.

Seagate stock was up 3 percent at $37.40 in morning trading.  Seagate said in a statement that it had reached out to ValueAct to take part in the investment - a twist on the normal activist engagement, which almost always involves the hedge fund approaching the company first. Activists have aggressively targeted U.S. companies over the last five years, pushing for better cash management, leadership changes and new strategies.Companies often resist activist campaigns, and sometimes the contention results in a proxy fight, where the hedge fund tries to replace board members with its own nominees. ""Seagate approached ValueAct to execute this transaction and become an investor in our company, given their commitment to and success in creating long-term value for the companies in which they invest,"" Seagate Chief Executive Officer Steve Luczo said in the statement.Some other companies have also been more receptive toward activists in the last year. Industrial conglomerate General Electric, for example, said it welcomed Trian Partners' purchase of a stake in October.  ValueAct will obtain 9.5 million Seagate shares through a so-called secondary block trade, the company said. That means that rather than buying shares on the open market, it will exchange them with an existing Seagate investor, who was not identified. The sale, which Seagate expects to complete by the end of the month, will make ValueAct one of its largest shareholders.ValueAct's recent investments include a $1.1 billion stake in investment bank Morgan Stanley, where the firm has not yet demanded a board seat or agitated for major changes. The San Francisco-based fund also said in July that it bought a 6.8 percent stake in railcar maker Trinity Industries Inc worth around $111 million. ValueAct, which with more than $16 billion under management is one of the largest activist investors, has invested in Seagate before.

The sale, which Seagate expects to complete by the end of the month, will make ValueAct one of its largest shareholders.ValueAct's recent investments include a $1.1 billion stake in investment bank Morgan Stanley, where the firm has not yet demanded a board seat or agitated for major changes. The San Francisco-based fund also said in July that it bought a 6.8 percent stake in railcar maker Trinity Industries Inc worth around $111 million. ValueAct, which with more than $16 billion under management is one of the largest activist investors, has invested in Seagate before. Other tech industry investments by ValueAct include Microsoft Corp, where it has a board seat. The firm also had a stake in Adobe Systems Inc that it sold.
