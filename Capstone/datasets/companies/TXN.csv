6,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Texas Instruments (TXN.O) said on Thursday it plans to return more cash to its shareholders, expanding a capital management policy that has helped boost the chipmaker's stock to its highest level in more than a decade.Improved manufacturing efficiencies mean Texas Instruments will now be able to turn between 20 percent and 30 percent of its revenue into free cash flow, Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said on a conference call with analysts.That is more than Texas Instruments' previous free cash flow target range of between 20 percent and 25 percent of revenue set last year.In 2013, Texas Instruments promised that, except for money used to pay debts, it would return all of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks in what FBR analyst Chris Rolland called the ""gold standard"" of cash return policies.Texas Instruments will now also return to shareholders the proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, March said.Chipmakers have been growing far less quickly than companies in other areas of the technology industry, like cloud computing and social media. ""So now to entice shareholders they're pushing the cash return story,"" Rolland said of Texas Instruments and other chip companies.CASH GENERATION The changes to Texas Instruments' capital management policy were incremental improvements but not enough to fuel an immediate stock rise, Rolland said. Its firm commitment to dividends and share buybacks over the past year have helped push the company's stock to highs not seen since 2001.The stock is up 31 percent over the past 12 months. However, it slipped 1.3 percent to $45.84 alongside a lower underlying market on Thursday, after the company announced the new cash return policy.""Our capital management strategy reflects our beliefs that free cash flow growth is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term,"" March said. The chipmaker's ability to generate cash has been bolstered by growth in its analog and automotive businesses and by replacing older factories with newer, more efficient ones, he said.Last year, Texas instruments paid out $1.18 billion in dividends and spent $2.87 billion to repurchase stock.Other chipmakers have also made recent commitments to give more cash back to investors.Last week, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) raised its cash dividend by 20 percent after vowing in November to return 75 percent of free cash flow to stock holders.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) in November increased its cash dividend by 13 percent and announced an additional $1 billion for its stock buyback program.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Sophie Hares)",2014-03-13,TXN,"Thu Mar 13, 2014 | 1:05pm EDT",Texas Instruments wants to hand more cash back to shareholders,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-texas-instrument-idUSBREA2C1K920140313?type=companyNews

Still, the day's losses were broad, and nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sector indexes fell. The S&P energy sector index represented the only positive group, up 0.2 percent. U.S. crude oil for August delivery shot up 1.4 percent to settle at $104.59 ahead of Tuesday's contract expiry.Violence escalated in the Gaza Strip despite growing international calls for a cease-fire. The Palestinian death toll rose above 500 while Israel's losses also mounted. While the impact to the U.S. economy is seen as minimal, investors are concerned about the fallout from an extended period of increased violence as well as the prospect that it could spread to other parts of the Middle East. Market participants also kept watch on the uncertain situation in Ukraine, where fighting flared in the city of Donetsk. Last week a Malaysian Airlines jet was shot down over Ukraine, adding to an already tense situation between the country and Russia.The United States and the European Union announced further economic sanctions against Russian interests last week before the Malaysian Airlines jet was shot down, and sanctions could become even more stringent.""We're certainly paying attention to the issues abroad, but right now, they don't seem like the kind of events that will have anything beyond a short-term impact,"" said John Chisholm, chief investment officer at Acadian Asset Management in Boston.

Some analysts have suggested that the low volatility has left the market - which hasn't had a correction, defined as a 10 percent pullback, since October 2011 - vulnerable to a shock.""Markets aren't particularly attractive, and it seems likely that we'll see a correction of 10 to 15 percent, though the timing on that is very difficult to say,"" Chisholm said.After the market closed, Netflix Inc reported a quarterly profit that more than doubled from a year ago, sending shares up 0.7 percent to $455.08 after the bell.

The bullish tone was helped by a Reuters story that said the European Central Bank is considering buying corporate bonds. It led to active futures trading before the opening bell and helped lift European stocks from last week's 13-month low. “That is allowing the market to breathe a little sigh of relief,” said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. “The market has come to fear the absence of central banks.""

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 1 percent to a nearly two-week high, while Japan's Nikkei stock average ended 2.6 percent higher, clawing back ground lost in Tuesday's 2 percent drop.Sentiment also got a lift from a Reuters report that the ECB is considering buying corporate bonds, a step that would help banks free up more of their balance sheets for lending. The ECB might decide on the matter as soon as December with a view to begin purchases early next year, several sources familiar with the situation said.""The news triggered bargain-hunting as Japanese shares have fallen to levels which priced in the worst-case scenario,"" said Toru Ibayashi, executive director at UBS Wealth Management, referring to fears that Europe's economy would fall back into recession.In U.S. trading, shares of Apple Inc and Texas Instruments Inc gained on stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, lifting the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index more than 2 percent. The S&P 500 added 1.96 percent to mark its biggest daily percentage gain since October 2013 and its fourth straight rising session. Japanese trade data released early Wednesday also underpinned buying in Tokyo. Exports rose 6.9 percent in September from a year earlier, the fastest pace in seven months, in a tentative sign that external demand is starting to pick up.The upbeat mood in global equities markets sapped the safe-haven appeal of U.S. Treasuries, pushing their yields away from last week's 17-month lows. The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes stood at 2.211 percent in late Asian trade, up from Tuesday's U.S. close of 2.208 percent.Higher U.S. yields supported bolster the greenback, with the dollar index steady on the day at 85.301.Data on Tuesday showing a stronger-than-expected 2.4 percent rise in U.S. domestic home resales last month provided evidence that the U.S. economic recovery maintained momentum and also put upward pressure on yields. ""Given heightened concern about falling inflation expectations, the attention turns to the U.S. September CPI report,"" strategists at Barclays said.""Our thesis of USD outperformance driven by relative U.S. strength and interest rate divergence remains intact, but is at risk of delay pending soft underlying inflation trends.""The CPI report is due at 1230 GMT. Economists expect annual core CPI inflation to stay flat at 1.7 percent in September, and a cooler reading would add to speculation that the Federal Reserve will wait longer before raising interest rates.The consensus view is that the U.S. central bank will decide to wrap up its asset purchases under its third round of quantitative easing later this month at its Oct 28-29 policy meeting, though short-term interest rates futures implied markets do not expect the Fed to hike rates until late 2015.The dollar inched lower on the day against the yen to 106.91 yen, while the euro nursed its losses after dropping on the ECB news, and edged slightly higher to $1.2727.In commodities markets, Brent crude added about 0.1 percent to $86.31 a barrel after posting solid gains on Tuesday, helped by data showing stronger-than-expected China demand and some technical price recovery after weeks of almost uninterrupted selling.Spot gold was slightly lower on the day at $1,247.80 an ounce, but still not far from a six-week high marked in the previous session.

37,"  * Car companies use Nvidia's ""supercomputer on a chip""* Automotive culture invades Silicon Valley* Chipmaker's rivals include Intel, Texas Instruments* Learning the meaning of ""automotive grade""By Paul LienertDETROIT, May 14 It took Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia Corp the better part of a decade to gain acceptance as a global automotive supplier, a lesson for other technology firms hoping to make a similar transition from consumer electronics to car components.Nvidia had a thriving business in supplying powerful graphics processors for video game consoles and laptop computers when representatives of Volkswagen AG asked if it could adapt the same realistic, three-dimensional displays for the dashboards of Audi luxury cars.That was 10 years ago - several lifetimes in Silicon Valley terms, but just a couple of model changes ago for the big car maker. It took six years for Nvidia to develop the chips to power the 3-D navigation system display that launched on the 2011 Audi A8, the brand's top-of-the-line sedan, compared with three to four years to develop a new chip for gaming applications.Along the way, Nvidia engineers learned the hard way they could not just pop a chip designed for a laptop or a game console into a car.""We had to be taught what 'automotive grade' meant,"" recalls Danny Shapiro, Nvidia's senior director of automotive operations. In simple terms, that meant no reboots - because a dashboard screen that fails to light up means an angry customer and possibly an expensive warranty repair. The decade-long effort enabled Nvidia to make the jump from the world of computers and game consoles into the fast-growing market for advanced automotive displays and automated driving systems. It is a leap that other Silicon Valley tech companies want to emulate to cash in on the convergence of automobiles and digital connectivity.Nvidia's success in landing processors on cars including the Audi A8 and the Tesla Model S sedan illustrates the growing willingness among automakers to look beyond their traditional suppliers to obtain a technological edge.""They offer us computing systems with the strength"" to process vast amounts of data required by new driver assistance systems and displays, said Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi's head of technical development.Nvidia is still a niche player with a long way to go to crack the top league of traditional automotive chip suppliers. Much larger companies, including Japan's Renesas Electronics Corp and U.S. chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc, Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, dominate the automotive chip business.Nvidia's automotive sales represented just 4 percent of the company's $4.7 billion annual revenue in its most recent fiscal year. That in turn is just one-tenth of the $1.86 billion in automotive semiconductors that Texas Instruments sold last year. Brooke Williams, TI's business manager for driver assistance systems, said his company already knows how to deal with automakers' demands after 35 years of supplying products for vehicles. ""We understand the automotive design cycle and how the vehicle manufacturers and suppliers work.""SELF-DRIVING CARS Nvidia has made the leap to infotainment systems in vehicles, but not yet to self-driving cars.The company had just $23 million in sales in the automotive segment in 2011. Growth has surged since. This year, the company expects automotive revenue of $183 million, and says it has booked more than $2 billion in future automotive business, most of that involving chips for digital displays and infotainment. By 2020, Nvidia expects to have chips on more than 32 million vehicles. The company is pushing to crack the emerging market for driver assistance systems, which include such tasks as self-parking and semi-automated steering and braking. Those systems require huge amounts of computing power in very small packages. Nvidia has developed and begun selling a chip called the Tegra X1 for automotive and gaming uses, which it says can put the power of a supercomputer in a package about the size of a postage stamp.""Nvidia brings unparalleled graphics capabilities that could prove critical building blocks"" for driver assistance systems, said Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore.Nvidia got coaching from automotive customers who liked the company's technology but were not sure of its ability to measure up to their standards.Early in their relationship, Audi executives took Nvidia engineers on a trip to Audi's home factory in Ingolstadt, Germany.""We told the Nvidia guys, 'you make one part, but we assemble a car here from 10,000 pieces,'"" said Mathias Halliger, Audi's senior systems architect for connected vehicle technologies. ""If even one part is bad, we have a problem.""To drive home the point, an Audi tour guide noted that one of the luxury cars had been rejected because of a tiny flaw in the paint.The plant tour, Halliger said, ""helped Nvidia to understand our requirements. It showed dramatically what we were looking for.""There was more for Nvidia to learn. A typical automotive production cycle can run five years or more, compared with one year for many consumer products. Nvidia had to go back to its suppliers to make sure that key components, from memory to power supply, could be upgraded as needed over that longer life cycle.""When you work with car companies and you engage in these developments with them, over the years you adopt their culture,"" said Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang, whose personal automotive stable includes two Ferraris and two Teslas.  ""But the car is dying to be reinvented.""

38,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Texas Instruments Inc (TI) (TXN.O) could be gearing up to make the next big deal in what has already been a record-breaking year for semiconductor M&A, industry bankers and analysts said.The Dallas, Texas-based chipmaker, which has a market capitalization of $56 billion, has so far stayed on the sidelines as peers Intel Corp (INTC.O), Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) made acquisitions worth tens of billions of dollars earlier this year.TI is looking for large acquisitions as well, according to people familiar with the matter. It held talks to acquire Maxim Integrated Products Inc (MXIM.O) late last year but discussions broke off when Maxim, which has a market capitalization of about $10 billion, decided not to sell itself, the people said. TI also considered buying Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N before Freescale agreed to be acquired by NXP in March for $11.8 billion, the people said.  A TI spokeswoman said the company has a long-standing policy to not comment on market rumors and speculation or competitor activity. Maxim declined to comment and Freescale did not respond to a request for comment.If Texas Instruments chief executive Rich Templeton doesn't make a move soon, the company could run out of high value targets, FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland said. TI should act by the end of the year while NXP, one of its fastest growing rivals, is tied up awaiting approval for its merger with Freescale, he said. ""If I was TI, I would think of what NXP's next target would be and should I get there first,"" Rolland said. Driving TI's appetite for M&A, according to the sources, is a desire to improve on its profitability and increase its share in the fragmented market for analog chips, which process signals such as sound, light and temperature and convert them into digital signals, and are central to smart phones and devices connected to the Internet.To be sure, TI is not the only big semiconductor company on the hunt for a large deal. Larger peer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which has a market capitalization of $110 billion, may look to make a substantial acquisition to bulk up its data center and cloud businesses, as its mobile phone customers see their markets mature, some of the people said. Qualcomm declined to comment. The right deal could boost TI's operating margins and profits by increasing the utilization rates in TI's 21 fabrication plants in nine countries. This could be done by tapping the production volumes from the acquisition target over a number of years, according to analysts. In addition to Maxim, TI could look at Analog Devices Inc (ADI.O), Linear Technology Corp (LLTC.O), Microchip Technology Inc (MCHP.O), Intersil Corp (ISIL.O) and Atmel Corp ATML.O, a $4 billion microcontroller company which Reuters reported last week was exploring options, analysts said. Microcontrollers are small computer processors designed to do tasks that are used in a variety of electronics. TI has a microcontroller business.       ANALOG CHIPS Semiconductor dealmaking has reached $79.7 billion so far this year, an amount that already surpasses every full-year period on record, with the exception of 2000, when M&A in the sector hit $115.5 billion. TI focuses on analog and embedded chips, which are used in products ranging from cars to televisions and account for the bulk of the company's revenue. TI's chief financial officer Kevin March said on a conference call with analysts last fall that TI would prefer to buy an analog company that sells into the industrial and automotive markets, or one that provides catalog parts which are non-custom silicon parts.Some analysts said however that TI is very price conscious. Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees said TI has done well by not pursuing big M&A for four years, focusing instead on its core competencies in analog and microcontrollers.Since it bought National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion in 2011, its last large scale acquisition which some analysts have argued it overpaid for, TI developed a reputation as an M&A skeptic, preferring to use its cash flow to buy back shares and pay dividends. ""There's no question that TI gets a first look at everything but they have a real rigid strategy in terms of what they expect for their return on invested capital. If it doesn't fit that box, they don't acquire it,"" Van Hees said.  (Reporting by Liana B.

40,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK, July 6  NEW YORK, July 6 Hedging activity is rising for U.S. semiconductor stocks as investors fear that sector earnings may be weak, and share prices may fall after a recent flourish in mergers and acquisitions.Options bets on an exchange-traded fund that tracks the sector have long been bearish, but there was a noticeable rise in hedging activity in June.The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index lost 9 percent in June, more than twice the 4.4 percent fall for the broader S&P 500 Information Technology Index.The Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF touched an all-time high of $60.13 in June but has lost 9 percent, and was down 48 cents at $54.64 on Monday. ""The price action in both the ETF and the semiconductor index are indicating that there is trouble ahead,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.Sentiment has been hurt after Micron Technology Inc  gave a dismal earnings forecast in late June, citing a further drop in personal computer chip prices due to weak demand for PCs.Since Micron's forecast, puts activity has increased for Intel and Texas Instruments, two of the ETF's top holdings. With analysts expecting a choppy earnings season for chip companies, options traders have been lapping up the ETF's put, usually used to place bearish bets.Overall open interest, which had dropped to 70,000 contracts mid-May, has nearly trebled with puts outnumbering calls nearly 5-to-1. The ETF's puts had attracted heavy hedging activity earlier this year as well, when puts outnumbered calls by about 10-to-1. ""The sheer volume in the puts leads me to believe that traders are hedging for earnings or general market volatility,"" said Jim Smith, options strategist at OTR Global.Big mergers in the sector, including Avago Technologies Ltd's $37 billion deal for Broadcom and Intel Corp's $16.7 billion purchase of Altera, have put the spotlight on the sector as the largest players look to beef up capabilities.Most semi stocks currently include some M&A premium, and this could be problematic for companies that do not get acquired, analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group said in a recent note. Weak personal computer demand and slowing tablet growth could also be affecting sentiment.Buyers of August puts at the $57 and $53 strike prices have pushed up open interest in the SMH ETF, with the two strikes now making up for about a fifth of the total open interest in the ETF's options.

Industrial and communications equipment markets accounted for nearly half of TI's 2014 revenue, with PCs making up for less than 10 percent.Smaller rival Linear Technology Corp also reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, hurt by weak bookings in its industrial business.TI's revenue from its analog business, under which it makes chips that convert real-world signals such as sound and temperature into digital data that can be processed by microprocessors, rose 3 percent to $2.05 billion. Revenue from its embedded processing business, under which it makes microcontrollers and connectivity products, declined 1.8 percent to $690 million, hurt by lower sales of processors.TI forecast a profit of 62-72 cents per share and revenue of $3.15 billion-$3.41 billion for the third quarter.
