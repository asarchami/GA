8,"  * FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.6 pct, hits 2-month low* Chip makers hurt by Microchip's sales warning* Lipper data shows weekly outflows from Europe stocksBy Blaise RobinsonPARIS, Oct 10 European shares dropped on Friday, extending their recent pull-back and tracking steep losses in equities worldwide on mounting worries over the pace of global growth.Chip makers featured among the biggest losers, with Infineon  down 4.9 percent and STMicroelectronics down 3.7 percent after a sales warning from U.S.-based Microchip . It said it believes an industry correction has begun and that more bad news will be coming from other chip makers.Microchip cut its forecast for fiscal second-quarter results, after experiencing subdued sales in September, especially in China, a month that is normally peak production season for devices destined for consumers buying electronics ahead of the year-end holidays.The company is seen as an early indicator of demand in the global semiconductor industry because it is a highly diversified supplier of electronic components to some 80,000 customers and because it recognizes revenue when its distributors book sales to customers rather than simply when Microchip itself ships its products. ""Microchip noted that it was disappointed with the level of business activity and that sales in September did not materialize according to expectations. It also noted that the revenue miss was led by China. This is negative for both Infineon and STM,"" a Paris-based trader said.Shares of mining and energy firm Vedanta Resources Plc  also fell sharply, by 6.4 percent, after the company reported lower quarterly output at its oil and gas, zinc and Zambian copper businesses.At 0740 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.6 percent at 1,305.99 points, hitting a level not seen since early August. The benchmark index has tumbled 7.5 percent since mid-September. The sell-off comes on the back of weak data from Germany, Europe's biggest economy. On Thursday, data showed German exports in August fell the most since January 2009, and figures earlier in the week showed steep drops in industrial orders and output.European markets were tracking a sell-off in equities globally, which saw major U.S. stock indexes slide 2 percent on Thursday on worries about the global growth outlook.""Bad economic data is now being viewed as bad, and the dovish signals from central banks are now being taken as a sign of weakness rather than a reason to ramp up equities,"" Jonathan Sudaria, a trader at Capital Spreads, said in a note.The sell-off has prompted U.S.-based investors to cut their exposure to Europe, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper which shows European equities suffering their biggest outflows in two months in the seven-day period ended Oct 8. A Lipper poll of 109 U.S.-domiciled funds invested in European stocks, which include exchange-traded funds' (ETFs) holdings, shows net outflows of $329 million, the biggest weekly redemptions since mid-August.Europe bourses in 2014: link.reuters.com/pap87vAsset performance in 2014: link.reuters.com/gap87vToday's European research round-up(Additional reporting by Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier and Eric Auchard; Editing by Susan Fenton)",2014-10-10,MCHP,"Fri Oct 10, 2014 | 4:11am EDT",European stocks extend sell-off on global growth jitters,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-europe-idUSL6N0S512V20141010?type=companyNews

12,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microchip Technology Inc (MCHP.O), which three weeks ago forecast a broad downturn in semiconductor demand, said on Thursday that the worst was over and the dip would be minor.    Shares of Microchip rose 4 percent in extended trade after the company forecast earnings per share for fiscal third quarter, which ends in December, in line with analysts' expectations. Chief Executive Officer Steve Sanghi told analysts on a conference call he expects weak business activity in China that hurt the company in the September quarter to have recovered by the end of March.""Some of these smaller inventory corrections have come every couple of years or so, so it's really one of those,"" Sanghi said. ""This is a very mild one."" On Oct. 10, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX sank nearly 7 percent in reaction to a warning by Microchip that it had detected a broad slowdown in ordering by distributors who sell its products. ""It would seem things are maybe not as bad as the worst-case scenario we were girding for earlier,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy after Microchip's call on Thursday.Sanghi noted that several other chipmakers have recently provided weak revenue forecasts for the December quarter. Microcontroller maker Atmel ATML.O on Wednesday gave a current-quarter revenue forecast below Wall Street's expectations, in part blaming macroeconomic conditions affecting the whole chip industry. ""If it turns out that Microchip was wrong in making a cycle call, I would look in the mirror and personally take responsibility to correct whatever may be wrong in our business,"" Sanghi said.

13,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Oct 30 Microchip Technology Inc , which three weeks ago forecast a broad downturn in semiconductor demand, said on Thursday that the worst was over and the dip would be minor.Shares of Microchip rose 4 percent in extended trade after the company forecast earnings per share for fiscal third quarter, which ends in December, in line with analysts' expectations.Chief Executive Officer Steve Sanghi told analysts on a conference call he expects weak business activity in China that hurt the company in the September quarter to have recovered by the end of March. ""Some of these smaller inventory corrections have come every couple of years or so, so it's really one of those,"" Sanghi said. ""This is a very mild one.""On Oct. 10, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index sank nearly 7 percent in reaction to a warning by Microchip that it had detected a broad slowdown in ordering by distributors who sell its products. ""It would seem things are maybe not as bad as the worst-case scenario we were girding for earlier,"" said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy after Microchip's call on Thursday.Sanghi noted that several other chipmakers have recently provided weak revenue forecasts for the December quarter. Microcontroller maker Atmel on Wednesday gave a current-quarter revenue forecast below Wall Street's expectations, in part blaming macroeconomic conditions affecting the whole chip industry.""If it turns out that Microchip was wrong in making a cycle call, I would look in the mirror and personally take responsibility to correct whatever may be wrong in our business,"" Sanghi said.

The group also said it expects the chip market to rise 3.4 percent in 2015 to $345 billion and 3.1 percent to $355 billion in 2016, assuming a further recovery in the global economy.French broker Bryan Garnier said the revised outlook suggests higher than expected growth for 2015 but a dip in WSTS's forecast for 2016.SEMI now predicts sales of chip equipment to rise 19.3 percent to $38 billion instead of the 20.8 percent to $38.4 billion that it predicted in its last market forecast in July.But the trade group expects significantly stronger growth in 2015 of 15.2 percent to $43.76 billion, up from the 10.8 percent forecast it previously made for sales of production equipment next year. However, it cautioned that 2016 sales were expected to dip slightly to around $43.68 billion.

Microchip and Atmel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Atmel makes smaller processors called microcontrollers used in a wide array of electronics as well as touch screen and encryption technology. It said the unsolicited offer allows shareholders to receive $9 in cash per share or elect to receive up to $1 billion in the acquirer's stock. Microchip shares rose 2.5 percent to $45.70 per share on the news while Atmel shares fell 0.8 percent to $8.65 per share.Atmel entered in a merger agreement with the London-based Dialog on Sept. 20 to be acquired for $4.65 per share in cash and 0.112 of a Dialog American depositary share for each Atmel share. Atmel said the deal with Dialog will stay in effect while it speaks to the acquirer. Atmel shareholders are set to vote on the Dialog deal in March.It is not the first time Microchip has tried to buy Atmel. Microchip lobbed an unsolicited bid to buy Atmel in 2008 and then launched a proxy fight which it later withdrew.  (Reporting by Liana B.
