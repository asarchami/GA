0,"  * Leucadia unit settles with U.S. Justice Dep't, SEC* Ex-Jefferies trader faces Feb. 18 TARP fraud trialBy Jonathan Stempel and Aruna ViswanathaJan 28 Jefferies Group LLC has agreed to pay $25 million to settle U.S. criminal and civil probes into purchases and sales of mortgage-backed securities after the 2008 financial crisis.In a regulatory filing Tuesday, the Leucadia National Corp  unit said it reached a nonprosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut and a civil settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, subject to that agency's approval.Jefferies said it will pay a $10 million fine to the U.S. Attorney's office, a $4 million fine to the SEC, and $11 million to counterparties harmed by suspect trades.The financial crisis caused fixed-income markets to dry up for all but the safest, most liquid securities, causing hundreds of billions of dollars of losses worldwide. Many mortgage securities remained hard to trade after markets improved. While much of the U.S. Department of Justice's focus on mortgage securities abuses has concerned debt sold before the crisis, federal prosecutors in Connecticut this month said the government is probing transactions linked to the $700 billion federal bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program.Jefferies said the probes it was resolving arose from a matter that surfaced in late 2011, when it terminated a mortgage-backed securities trader who was indicted by the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut in January 2013 and separately charged by the SEC in a civil complaint.That description fits Jesse Litvak, a former Jefferies trader who was indicted for allegedly defrauding customers on post-crisis residential mortgage-backed securities trades.Litvak has pleaded not guilty, and faces a Feb. 18 trial in a federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, with jury selection to begin on Feb. 3. His lawyer Patrick Smith, a partner at DLA Piper, declined to comment. Thomas Carson, a spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly in Connecticut, declined to comment, as did SEC spokesman John Nester. Jefferies spokesman Richard Khaleel declined to comment. Leucadia and Jefferies are based in New York.Nonprosecution agreements can let companies resolve allegations of wrongdoing without facing formal charges.'MAJOR FRAUD'  Litvak's case was the first brought under a 2009 law banning ""major fraud"" against the United States through TARP.Prosecutors accused Litvak of cheating customers out of more than $2 million on trades from 2009 to 2011, by lying about the prices he paid and inventing an imaginary seller of bonds that Jefferies already held.They said Litvak did this to boost Jefferies' revenue and offset trading losses, both factors in his compensation.Prosecutors said the United States was a victim because some of the bond buyers had taken part in TARP's Public-Private Investment Program, which was intended to help rebuild a market for troubled mortgage debt.Litvak has said the mark-ups charged on his bonds were within industry norms, and that his alleged victims were sophisticated enough to decide whether the prices were fair. He had worked in a Jefferies office in Stamford, Connecticut.Jefferies said it recognized $23.2 million of costs related to the probes in its fiscal fourth quarter ending last Nov. 30.",2014-01-28,LUK,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 4:34pm EST",Jefferies pays $25 million to settle MBS trading probes,http://www.reuters.com//article/jefferies-settlements-idUSL2N0L21L620140128?type=companyNews

4,"  By Aruna Viswanatha and Jonathan StempelMarch 12 Jefferies LLC will pay $25 million to resolve U.S. criminal and civil investigations into its mortgage bond trading, after one of its former traders was convicted for defrauding clients, and authorities said they are investigating whether other individuals broke the law.The settlements announced on Wednesday by the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI resolve charges that Jefferies failed to properly supervise traders who cheated clients that took part in a federal program to kick-start bond markets after the 2008 financial crisis.""Jefferies management in the fixed income division learned of the fraud and did nothing to stop it, let alone report it,"" FBI special agent in charge of the New Haven, Connecticut unit Patricia Ferrick said in a statement. ""Such egregious conduct supports the $25 million dollar penalty and underscores the need to investigate and prosecute all responsible parties.""Richard Khaleel, a Jefferies spokesman, declined to comment. The payout includes $14 million of fines and $11 million of restitution to customers, authorities said.Now part of Leucadia National Corp, Jefferies agreed to a non-prosecution agreement with U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly in Connecticut, in exchange for its cooperation and improved oversight of its employees. Its settlements are among the first to address misconduct in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.They were announced five days after jurors in New Haven, Connecticut found former Jefferies trader Jesse Litvak guilty on all 15 counts he faced for allegedly defrauding clients on mortgage bond trades.""Not only did management tolerate these illegal practices, but the culture within the division encouraged the fraudulent conduct,"" Daly said in a statement. ""Our investigation of individuals continues."" LITVAK GUILTY VERDICT Prosecutors accused Litvak of cheating clients out of more than $2 million from 2009 to 2011 by inflating prices, lying about how much Jefferies paid for bonds, and inventing sellers.They said the United States was a victim because some clients had traded through an initiative to energize the mortgage bond market, and which was created through the $700 billion bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Lawyers for Litvak said throughout the trial that their client's activity was considered normal at Jefferies and common in the bond industry, and that Jefferies left him alone until a major client objected and threatened to pull its business.The defendant is expected to appeal his conviction. He had worked in a Jefferies office in Stamford, Connecticut.In January, the government had disclosed that it was investigating fraud in the trading of residential mortgage-backed securities, including in transactions stemming from the bailout.The SEC, in papers relating to the civil settlement, said Jefferies had a policy that required supervisors to review traders' communications in order to flag misleading information provided to customers.But it said these supervisors did not cross-check these communications against actual trades, or review Bloomberg group chats through which some misrepresentations were made.""Had Jefferies better targeted its supervision to the risks faced by its mortgage-backed securities desk, many of the misstatements made by its employees could have been caught,"" SEC enforcement director Andrew Ceresney said in a statement.",2014-03-12,LUK,"Wed Mar 12, 2014 | 3:06pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Jefferies to pay $25 mln to settle mortgage bond trading charges,http://www.reuters.com//article/jefferies-settlement-idUSL2N0M91CG20140312?type=companyNews
5,"  CBS Outdoor Americas Inc's CBSO.N said it priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, valuing the outdoor advertising company at about $3.36 billion.CBS Outdoor, part of media conglomerate CBS Corp (CBS.N), will raise about $560 million from the offering of 20 million shares at that price, which is at the high-end of its planned $26 and $28 range.The company's shares will start trading on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""CBSO.""CBS, which will reduce its stake to 83 percent after the offering, plans to convert CBS Outdoor into a real estate investment trust (REIT).As a REIT, it can avoid paying corporate-level income taxes if it distributes at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. CBS Outdoor had about 330,000 displays in the United States and about 26,200 displays across Canada and Latin America as of December 31. The company has displays in some of the most heavily trafficked locations such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles and Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York City.The New York-based company counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O), McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), Sony Corp (6758.T) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) among its major customers. Outdoor advertising companies have been converting their traditional billboards to digital billboards as it allows them to run multiple ads on each display. As of December 31, 2013, CBS Outdoor had 373 digital billboard displays in the United States.CBS has moved to diversify its revenue away from advertising, in part by selling shows to subscription video on-demand services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Hulu Plus. ""We've changed from a company that was 70 percent dependent on advertising to a company that's down to close to only 50 percent dependent on advertising,"" Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said at a Morgan Stanley conference earlier this month. CBS Outdoor, which competes with Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc (CCO.N) and Lamar Advertising Co (LAMR.O), said net income rose 27 percent to $143.5 million on revenue of $1.29 billion for the year ended 2013.Goldman Sachs & Co, BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P.

""What investors like are big established companies with high barriers to entry.""CBS Outdoor's shares touched a high of $30.46 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after its initial public offering was priced at $28 per share, the top end of the expected price range.King's shares fell as much as 16 percent on Wednesday after one of the most hyped initial public offerings the year.CBS Outdoor has long been seen as an awkward fit for a CBS Corp, owner of the most-watched TV network in the United States.""This seemed like a very good financial idea to do a transaction that would unlock the value in CBS Outdoor,"" CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves told Reuters ahead of the IPO.""It enables us to get quite a bit of capital to go forward with our desire to increase our profile in the content business,"" he said. The IPO raised about $560 million. CBS Outdoor's shares were up 6.25 percent at $29.75 in early afternoon trading, while those of CBS Corp, which has a market value of about $36.5 billion, were up 1.6 percent at $62.46.CBS Outdoors Chief Executive Jeremy Male said he aimed to convince big advertisers to move more of their spending to his company's billboards and other displays.U.S. outdoor media represents less than 5 percent of advertising spending, compared with 8 percent in the rest of the world, Male said in an interview.""The top 50 advertisers only spend 2 percent of revenue on outdoor,"" said Male, who joined the company in September after serving as a top executive at JCDecaux SA (JCDX.PA), the world's largest outdoor company.""We see a great opportunity to work hard and develop that advertiser base,"" he said. CBS Outdoor counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O), McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and Sony Corp (6758.T) among its clients.CBS Outdoor's offering reduced CBS Corp's stake in CBS Outdoor to 83 percent. Its holding will drop to about 81 percent if underwriters fully exercise options to buy additional shares.Goldman Sachs, BofA Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are lead underwriters of the offering.SPLITOFF LATER  CBS Corp plans to divest the rest of shares through a tax-free splitoff later this year, after which CBS Outdoor will trade as a tax-efficient real estate investment trust (REIT).CBS Outdoor has about 329,100 displays in the United States - many in desirable locations such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco and Grand Central Station in New York - and about 26,100 displays across Canada and Latin America.Male said CBS Outdoor would invest to make more of its displays digital. About 1.5 percent are in digital format now.Outdoor advertising companies have been converting their traditional billboards to digital billboards as this allows them to run multiple ads on each display.""If you are looking for cover and frequency on a particular demographic, people's travel patterns are repetitive,"" Male said. ""It's a great argument for greater efficiency for advertising dollars.""CBS Outdoor's competitors include Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc (CCO.N) and Lamar Advertising Co (LAMR.O).CBS Outdoor reported revenue of $1.3 billion and net income of $143.5 million for 2013.

15,"  Investment bank Jefferies Group LLC, owned by Leucadia National Corp (LUK.N), said it was in talks to sell its commodities and financial derivatives brokerage, which has been struggling with high costs and falling fees.Jefferies, which also reported a fourth-quarter loss, is the latest bank to retreat from the commodities futures market as stricter regulation increases costs and intense competition and a decline in fees squeeze profit margins.Brokers, which make money clearing and executing trades for clients ranging from commercial hedgers to hedge funds, have also been hit by the rise of electronic trading, which allows customers to execute trades on their own screens.Jefferies' move reverses a push into commodities that started with its $430 million purchase of the more than 130-year old business, formerly known as Prudential Bache, in 2011.""As a result of the growth and margin challenges we have recently faced in the Bache business ... we are pursuing strategic alternatives for this business,"" Jefferies Chief Executive Richard Handler said in a statement on Tuesday. Commodities trading has become tougher this year as the market has fallen out of favor with investors who have been betting on strong growth from China for raw materials such as copper and crude oil.Newedge, one of the world's top commodities brokerages, cut jobs in its London, New York and Chicago financial derivatives teams last week. ICAP, another commodities brokerage, is exiting base metals broking business at the end of the year.  WEAK RESULTS Jefferies' investment banking revenue fell 24 percent to $316 million the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 due to lackluster fixed income trading in a tepid trading environment.Revenue in its fixed income business dropped 73 percent to $61 million.

16,"  (Adds background)Dec 16 Investment bank Jefferies Group LLC, owned by Leucadia National Corp, said it was in talks to sell its commodities and financial derivatives brokerage, which has been struggling with high costs and falling fees.Jefferies, which also reported a fourth-quarter loss, is the latest bank to retreat from the commodities futures market as stricter regulation increases costs and intense competition and a decline in fees squeeze profit margins.Brokers, which make money clearing and executing trades for clients ranging from commercial hedgers to hedge funds, have also been hit by the rise of electronic trading, which allows customers to execute trades on their own screens.Jefferies' move reverses a push into commodities that started with its $430 million purchase of the more than 130-year old business, formerly known as Prudential Bache, in 2011.""As a result of the growth and margin challenges we have recently faced in the Bache business ... we are pursuing strategic alternatives for this business,"" Jefferies Chief Executive Richard Handler said in a statement on Tuesday.Commodities trading has become tougher this year as the market has fallen out of favor with investors who have been betting on strong growth from China for raw materials such as copper and crude oil.

ICAP, another commodities brokerage, is exiting base metals broking business at the end of the year.WEAK RESULTS  Jefferies' investment banking revenue fell 24 percent to $316 million the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 due to lackluster fixed income trading in a tepid trading environment.Revenue in its fixed income business dropped 73 percent to $61 million.Net loss attributable to the company was $92.4 million for the quarter, compared with a profit of $109.9 million a year earlier, the company said on Tuesday.

20,"  (Adds details of Leucadia/FXCM deal)By Anirban Nag and Steve SlaterLONDON Jan 16 The Swiss franc shock reverberated through currency trading firms around the world on Friday, wiping out many small-scale investors and the brokerages that cater to them and forcing regulators to take a closer look at the sector.Some major banks also lost out when the Swiss National Bank scrapped its three-year-old cap on the franc against the euro  without warning on Thursday, including Britain's Barclays which lost ""tens of millions"" of dollars, an industry source said.Retail broker Alpari UK filed for insolvency on Friday, while New York-listed FXCM Inc, one of the biggest platforms catering to online and retail currency traders, said it looked to be in breach of regulatory capital requirements after its clients suffered $225 million of losses.FXCM had to turn to Leucadia National Corp, the parent of investment bank Jefferies, to quickly broker a $300 million loan that was expected to close Friday afternoon.In the past 15 years, retail currency trading has grown quickly, attracting individuals staking their own money with long trading hours, low transaction costs and the ability to take on huge risks for a relatively small sum.Retail currency trade makes up nearly 4 percent of global daily spot turnover of nearly $2 trillion, the latest survey from the Bank of International Settlements shows, having grown from almost nothing in the 1990s.This small share means the sector poses limited risk to the financial system but retail brokers are much more vulnerable to big losses than banks. Regulators in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Britain and the United States said they were checking on brokers and banks after reports of volatility and losses.The move ""caused by the SNB's unexpected policy reversal of capping the Swiss franc against the euro has resulted in exceptional volatility and extreme lack of liquidity,"" Alpari, the shirt sponsor of English Premier League soccer club West Ham, said in a statement.""This has resulted in the majority of clients sustaining losses which exceeded their account equity. Where a client cannot cover this loss, it is passed on to us. This has forced Alpari (UK) Limited to confirm that it has entered into insolvency."" Online trading services provider London Capital Group Holding put its franc-related losses at up to 1.7 million pounds ($2.6 million).The franc surged as much as 40 percent to a high of 0.8500 per euro after the Swiss central bank lifted its 1.20 per euro cap.New Zealand foreign exchange dealer Global Brokers NZ Ltd closed due to hefty losses. The national Financial Market Authority said it would ""be seeking assurances that the client funds have been protected and segregated"".The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it was ""following up with the banks on their practice in this regard ... to understand the implication, if any, but we would not comment on the situation of individual banks."" Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said it was talking to Alpari, while the U.S. National Futures Association said it was monitoring the foreign exchange brokers it oversees.BROKER WOES, REGULATORY POWERS FXCM Inc shares fell nearly 90 percent in pre-market hours before being halted for the regular trading session on the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours action, it resumed trading, rebounding from the premarket losses, but still down 70 percent from Thursday's close.Top executives from FXCM went through company books until at least 5 a.m. EST (1000 GMT) on Friday, according to a source close to FXCM. Regulators were in FXCM's offices in downtown Manhattan on Friday, according to two sources. A spokesperson for the U.S. National Futures Association said it was in ""constant"" contact with FXCM, and had been ""watching the volatility"" as a result of the Swiss central bank move. NFA rules allow a leverage ratio of 50 to 1 on transactions in the Swiss franc, which means even a 2 percent move can wipe out a position.Not all brokerages suffered. GAIN Capital Holding Inc  said on Friday it generated a profit on Thursday from trading, and that its strong financial position will allow it to win market share. Its shares closed up 2.9 percent at $8.52.Canada-based foreign exchange broker OANDA said in a statement it ""will pardon our clients' negative account balances associated with this market event"" and would not ""re-quote or amend"" clients' trades on the Swiss currency.But Denmark's Saxo Bank, one of the biggest players in retail foreign exchange trading, said late on Thursday it would potentially set different rates for its clients' transactions.Saxo Bank chief financial officer Steen Blaafalk told Reuters some clients had suffered losses but the bank was well capitalised. Retail investors, some of whom face huge losses, protested when Saxo said it might set different rates.Lawyers said this could be contested.""I think there will be litigation and disputes over automatic close-outs,"" said a financial services lawyer.Hong Kong media reported clients of HSBC Holdings  were able to buy the Swiss currency at below-market rates for several hours through its online system, making several thousand dollars in profits on the trades.HSBC said online foreign exchange trading for the Swiss franc ""is currently operating normally and we will investigate reports that customers could trade at old rates initially after the cap was lifted.""

27,"  MELBOURNE/NEW YORK Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) is in talks to buy Jefferies Group LLC's [JGLL.UL] commodities and financial derivatives brokerage, three sources said, as the Australian bank continues to expand its commodities business while rivals retreat.The Australian bank is one of several suitors interested in a business that was built largely around Prudential Bache, one of the world's oldest commodities futures brokers. Jefferies bought PruBache four years ago, but the business struggled in an increasingly tough regulatory environment. It suffered more recently from heavy losses tied to a bunker fuel bankruptcy.A deal could be possible in the next few months, said the sources, who are unauthorized to speak to the media.Spokespeople for Macquarie and Jefferies declined to comment on Thursday.News of the talks come just a month after the U.S. investment bank, owned by Leucadia National Corp (LUK.N), said it was looking for strategic alternatives, including a sale. Jefferies reported a fourth-quarter loss of $93 million, partly due to a bad-debt provision of some $52 million tied to money owned by one of its clients, bankrupt OW Bunker.For Macquarie, it would be the latest push deeper into commodities, handing it a mid-tier global player in the highly competitive business of clearing and executing oil, base metals and agricultural futures trading for customers ranging from grain elevators to hedge funds. Jefferies held some $2.1 billion in customer funds at the end of November, making it the 17th largest futures commission merchant (FCM) in the United States, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That was bigger than the $1.6 billion held by Macquarie Futures USA.In recent years, the bank has beefed up its physical presence, unencumbered by the tighter regulations that have forced U.S. rivals like JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to retreat from the volatile and lucrative market.Commodities have become an increasingly important profit driver at Australia's largest investment bank, which is targeting a 20 percent jump in annual profit this year.

28,"  MELBOURNE/NEW YORK Jan 29 Macquarie Group Ltd  is in talks to buy Jefferies Group LLC's  commodities and financial derivatives brokerage, three sources said, as the Australian bank continues to expand its commodities business while rivals retreat.The Australian bank is one of several suitors interested in a business that was built largely around Prudential Bache, one of the world's oldest commodities futures brokers.Jefferies bought PruBache four years ago, but the business struggled in an increasingly tough regulatory environment. It suffered more recently from heavy losses tied to a bunker fuel bankruptcy.A deal could be possible in the next few months, said the sources, who are unauthorized to speak to the media.Spokespeople for Macquarie and Jefferies declined to comment on Thursday. News of the talks come just a month after the U.S. investment bank, owned by Leucadia National Corp, said it was looking for strategic alternatives, including a sale.Jefferies reported a fourth-quarter loss of $93 million, partly due to a bad-debt provision of some $52 million tied to money owned by one of its clients, bankrupt OW Bunker. For Macquarie, it would be the latest push deeper into commodities, handing it a mid-tier global player in the highly competitive business of clearing and executing oil, base metals and agricultural futures trading for customers ranging from grain elevators to hedge funds.Jefferies held some $2.1 billion in customer funds at the end of November, making it the 17th largest futures commission merchant (FCM) in the United States, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That was bigger than the $1.6 billion held by Macquarie Futures USA. In recent years, the bank has beefed up its physical presence, unencumbered by the tighter regulations that have forced U.S. rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to retreat from the volatile and lucrative market.Commodities have become an increasingly important profit driver at Australia's largest investment bank, which is targeting a 20 percent jump in annual profit this year.Still, Macquarie's interest comes as FCM are struggling with ultra-low commission fees and interest rates and the growing popularity of electronic trading, while overcapacity in the industry and high regulation.Larger rivals in the sector like Newedge and ICAP are retrenching.

31,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 10 A divided federal appeals court in New York allowed more than 100,000 potential plaintiffs to pursue class action litigation accusing Leucadia National Corp  and a law firm of fraudulently cutting corners to win default judgments in debt collection cases.Tuesday's 2-1 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came after the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Trade Commission warned that a contrary ruling could undermine the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a 1977 law designed by Congress to police unscrupulous debt collectors.The lawsuit focused on ""sewer service,"" a long-running practice where debt collectors fail to serve complaints on debtors, and later falsely certify to courts that service was made and that the cases have merit.Sewer service often ends in default judgments because debtors do not know to appear in court. It can lead to bank account seizures, wage garnishments and ruined credit scores.Four New York City residents, led by Monique Sykes of the Bronx, challenged lawsuits filed from 2006 to 2009 in New York City civil courts on behalf of Leucadia, which like rivals buys consumer debt at pennies on the dollar and tries to collect in full.Leucadia was represented in more than 99 percent of the collection lawsuits by the Mel S. Harris law firm, a debt collection specialist that the plaintiffs called a ""default judgment mill."" A process server, Samserv Inc, was also sued. In September 2012, Circuit Judge Denny Chin certified class actions arising from the Harris firm's lawsuits.Writing for the 2nd Circuit majority, Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler agreed that the plaintiffs' claims had enough in common to allow a class action.Pointing to allegations that one Harris employee supposedly certified the merits of 20 lawsuits per hour, Pooler said it was ""undisputed"" that he did not review the underlying documents. Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs dissented. He said there were too many individual issues to justify a ""unwieldy"" class action where ""hungry lawyers"" might earn a big payday.""This is class litigation for the sake of nothing but class litigation,"" Jacobs wrote.Leucadia also owns the Jefferies Group investment banking and securities firm. The company, its lawyer Miguel Estrada, the Harris firm's lawyer Paul Clement, and a Samserv lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The plaintiffs' lawyer Matthew Brinckerhoff welcomed the decision.""The problem of unscrupulous debt collectors is nationwide,"" he said in an interview. ""This class action provides a framework to obtain relief for a large number of victims.""In a brief supporting the debtors, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and FTC said the 1977 debt protection law was meant to curb abuses that could cause bankruptcies, marital instability, job losses and privacy invasions.They said ""the act's purposes would be disserved"" by accepting defense arguments that debtors could not recover because any false statements were directed at the civil court, not the debtors themselves.The AARP and the National Consumer Law Center also supported the plaintiffs.The case is Sykes et al v. Mel S. Harris and Associates LLC et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-2742.

32,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Leucadia National  Corporation's (Leucadia) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'. The  Rating Outlook remains Stable. See the full list of ratings at the end of this  rating action commentary. The ratings of Leucadia and its main operating subsidiary, Jefferies Group LLC  (Jefferies), continue to be equalized, as Fitch considers Jefferies a core  subsidiary of Leucadia. This is based on Jefferies' significance relative to  Leucadia's balance sheet (Jefferies accounted for 42% of Leucadia's common  equity, ex-goodwill and intangibles, as of Dec. 31, 2014), the strong  operational linkages between the two companies including shared leadership, and  the likely role Jefferies will play in the combined company's future strategic  direction.  Fitch has also affirmed Jefferies' ratings with a Stable Outlook. For more  information, see the Rating Action Commentary entitled 'Fitch Affirms Jefferies'  'BBB-/F3' Long- and Short-Term IDRs; Outlook Stable' dated March 5, 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs and SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of Leucadia's rating reflects its modest balance sheet leverage,  solid liquidity position, attractive debt maturity profile, and maintenance of  relatively conservative operating parameters articulated by management at the  time of its merger with Jefferies. Ratings are constrained by the firm's  sizeable concentration in two of its largest investments, Jefferies and National  Beef, which accounted for 61% of the company's total equity as of Dec. 31, 2014,  variable operating performance as measured by recurring cash flow, and dividends  from portfolio companies, and key man risk. Fitch continues to assess Leucadia's strategic direction and investment approach  under the new management team, which are both at early stages of their  implementation. The company deployed $1.3 billion of capital in the 12 months  ending Dec. 31, 2014 in various investments including $317.5 million in a  diversified holding company (Harbinger), $423.2 million in two oil and gas  exploration and development companies, $345.1 million in seeding various asset  management initiatives (Leucadia Asset Management), and $70.9 million in a  gold/silver mining project (Golden Queen). In addition, the company has invested  or identified $700 million of investments thus far in 1Q'15, including $300  million of rescue financing in the form of a senior secured loan provided to  FXCM Inc. in January 2015 and $400 million of seed capital commitment to Folger  Hill Asset Management, a multi-manager hedge fund platform, which is expected to  be funded in 1Q'15. Fitch views the combined $2 billion in investments as  significant and will monitor the performance of these investments over time.  The company continues to maintain a conservative capital and funding structure.  Leverage, measured as parent company debt-to-tangible equity, was 0.21x at Dec.  31, 2014 (parent company debt includes $125 million of 3.25% cumulative  convertible preferred shares). The company has also stated a debt-to-equity  operating parameter of 0.50x, which excludes the two largest assets and deferred  tax assets from equity. On this basis, leverage measured 0.71x at Dec. 31, 2014,  which is higher than management's stated maximum operating parameter. However,  pro forma for the repayment of $459 million of senior notes due September 2015,  leverage falls to 0.50x. Fitch expects further cushion will be built from  retained earnings. Given that this is a self-imposed operating parameter by  Leucadia, temporary breaches of the metric do not, in and of themselves, impact  the ratings. The company's next debt maturity is not until October 2023 (excluding the  September 2015 debt maturity), which is viewed positively. Furthermore, the  company is not expected to issue any additional parent company debt in the  near-- to intermediate-term.    As a result of the recent investment activity, liquidity has declined from  all-time-high levels recorded in 2013, but is still considered solid in the  context of the parent company's debt levels and holding company expenses.  Liquidity, defined as cash, available-for-sale investments, and certain other  investments that are easily convertible into cash measured $2.1 billion at Dec.  31, 2014, compared to $3.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2013. Fitch notes that liquidity  is expected to be further impacted by $700 million of investments in 1Q'15, as  noted above. Still, the company is expected to maintain a sizeable liquidity  cushion compared to holding company expenses, including interest expense,  operating expense and dividends on common equity.  The nature of Leucadia's portfolio and the strategic focus on generating  long-term investment returns versus earnings growth tends to dampen operating  results and create variable overall operating cash flow. On a GAAP basis, net  income was down 45% to $204 million in 2014 from $369 million in 2013, mainly  driven by $157.6 million of one-time charges related to discontinued operations  (Lake Charles clean energy project), settlement of class action lawsuits filed  against Jefferies over its merger with Leucadia, and a bad debt provision  recorded at Jefferies. Excluding these charges, net income was almost flat at  $362 million.  Coverage of recurring cash flows/dividends from portfolio companies to parent  company's operating and interest expense was above 1x for the 12 months ended  December 2014, which is viewed as adequate when considered together with  available holding company liquidity. However, the coverage falls below 1x if the  dividends paid on Leucadia's common shares, which totaled $93 million in 2014,  are factored in. Fitch expects this coverage to improve in the future with the  seasoning of its recent investments, particularly the low capital-intensive,  cash flow-generative asset management businesses. Key man risk continues to be a concern for both Leucadia and Jefferies, although  Fitch recognizes that Jefferies has broadened and deepened its bench over the  past several years. RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs and SENIOR DEBT Potential positive rating drivers for Leucadia could include demonstrated  longer-term performance of the recent sizeable investments, reduced investment  concentration, consistent operating performance with strong coverage of  portfolio company cash flows to parent company expenses including dividends,  while maintaining a conservative liquidity and leverage profile. Ratings could be negatively affected by increased concentration of investments,  sustained weakening performance at portfolio companies leading to lower  cash/dividend distributions, a fundamental shift in financial policy leading to  increased debt relative to parent company liquidity or cash flows from portfolio  companies, and/or a less conservative leverage profile.  Fitch expects to pay particular attention to the performance of Leucadia's  investments in the asset management space given the magnitude of the investments  (approximately $1 billion to date), the management team's varied track record in  the asset management space, and the fact that the investments often represent  stakes in funds in addition to asset managers.  Leucadia's ratings are equalized with those of Jefferies' given the ownership  structure and operational and management linkages between the two companies. As  a result, changes in Jefferies's ratings would influence Leucadia's credit  profile as well. Leucadia operates its business similarly to a closed-end alternative fund and  serves as the holding company for Jefferies among other investments. As of Dec.  31, 2014, it had roughly $52.6 billion in consolidated assets and $10.3 billion  in book equity. In addition to Jefferies, Leucadia's portfolio includes  significant equity stakes in other private and public companies as well as  Treasuries and other fixed income and equity securities. KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES The $125 million of 3.25% cumulative convertible preferred shares issued by  Leucadia are notched down twice from the company's IDR in accordance with  Fitch's criteria 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial Corporates  and REIT Credit Analysis'. The two-notch differential from the IDR reflects  Fitch's view of the subordinated nature of the instrument and the lack of a  standard mandatory conversion feature. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Leucadia National Corp. --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-', Outlook Stable; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB-'; --Preferred Stock at 'BB'.

Total non-interest expenses rose 13.3 percent to $706.8 million, driven mainly by higher compensation benefits.

42,"  Lennar Corp (LEN.N), the second-largest U.S. homebuilder, reported a better-than-expected jump in quarterly profit as it sold more homes at higher prices across the United States, especially in the West and Southeast Florida markets.The company's stock rose as much as 7 percent to a nearly three-month high of $52.38, making it the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 on Wednesday morning.Lennar's strong results boosted the entire sector, sending the PHLX Housing Index .HGX up almost 1 percent.Homebuilders Meritage Homes Corp (MTH.N), KB Home (KBH.N), PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N), D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N) and many of the sector's other stocks were trading 1-3 percent higher after Lennar's results.Lennar's new home orders climbed about 18 percent in the second quarter ended May 31 from a year earlier, and grew at about the same pace as in the first quarter.Orders grew across the United States, except Houston, led by 34.4 percent growth in the West, which includes California and Nevada, and is Lennar's second-biggest market in terms of revenue. Orders in the East, its biggest market, rose 19 percent.Houston orders fell 9 percent. The region accounted for about 10 percent of Lennar's revenue in 2014.""Our recent channel checks suggest ... recent severe rainfall is delaying land development and construction (in Houston),"" UBS analyst Susan Maklari wrote in a note. Lennar also benefited from accelerating U.S. job growth and higher wages. The U.S. economy created 280,000 jobs in May, the largest gain since December, the Labor Department said earlier this month. The average sales price of homes delivered rose 8 percent to $348,000 in the quarter, and Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said ""the homebuilding market is well positioned for multi-year growth ahead"".

43,"   By Olivia Oran and Dan Wilchins | NEW YORK, Sept 18  NEW YORK, Sept 18 For U.S. banks' bond trading desks, the Federal Reserve just made a bad quarter even worse, accentuating a longer-term decline in what was once their most lucrative business, executives, analysts and traders told Reuters.Bond trading volume is likely to drop globally in the coming weeks, after the Fed decided on Thursday to keep rates unchanged. Many investors are reluctant to take too much risk in bonds and related derivatives until they have a better sense of when the U.S. central bank will start hiking rates, traders said.""The market is queasy, and is not taking bad news well,"" said Michael Sobel, managing partner at TruMid, an electronic trading platform for corporate bonds, and former head of junk bond trading at Barclays. It is harder to get some trades done, he added.Weaker bond trading results will weigh on the bottom line at major banks, which can get as much as a third of their revenue from the business, and have already been hit by low interest rates and tepid demand for many kinds of loans. Some analysts already had been reducing their earnings estimates for banks over the last month. For Goldman Sachs Group Inc, for example, three analysts have cut estimates over the last 30 days, by an average of nearly 6 percent.The quarter was tough for bank trading revenue even before the Fed announcement. The Greek debt crisis kept many investors out of markets entirely, and China's slowing growth resulted in the kind of steep market movements that hurt profits for many traders. Generally, banks do best when there's a degree of uncertainty, which spurs investors to reposition their portfolios. But when events become completely unpredictable, and markets move wildly, trading volume can dry up, analysts said.""Banks are getting the bad kind of volatility now,"" said Charles Peabody, a veteran banking analyst at Portales Partners in New York.Chief executives from Citigroup, Bank of America Corp , and JPMorgan Chase & Co, speaking at a Barclays conference, all said this week that their overall trading revenue is likely to fall by around 5 percent in the current quarter. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan blamed the drop mainly on weaker bond trading results, which he said were partly offset by stronger stock trading.Jefferies Group, an investment bank that is part of the Leucadia National Corp conglomerate, said on Thursday that a measure of its earnings plunged by nearly 50 percent thanks to slow bond trading and big writedowns on distressed debt tied to the energy industry. Bond trading revenue has been falling at major banks since the financial crisis, as banks have been barred by regulators from making big market bets with their own money. Coalition, an investment banking consulting firm, estimates annual industry revenue from bond trading at around $70 billion, about half its level in 2009.In the last few years, revenue has been stabilizing, and results from the business still occasionally jump. In the first quarter of this year, for example, bond trading revenue surged at most major banks, as the Swiss central bank scrapped a cap on the franc, the Fed seemed likely to tighten monetary policy soon, and the European Central Bank announced a quantitative easing program.Morgan Stanley posted bond trading revenue of $1.9 billion, a 15 percent gain from the same period last year and its highest level in three years.But times have changed, and with this week's Fed move, a source at a major investment bank said his customers are in limbo now.""There would definitely be more client activity if they had raised rates,"" he said.

48,"  Online trading company IG Group Holdings Plc (IGG.L) said it had agreed to buy news and research portal DailyFX and its associated assets from U.S. retail broker FXCM Inc (FXCM.O) for $40 million.IG Group said the deal, which is expected to close by the end of October, would add about 5 million pounds ($6 million) to ongoing operating costs annually and add to earnings from IG's 2018 financial year.The British company also said it expected to account for the purchase price at a constant rate spread over 10 years. Analysts said this meant total costs of 8 million pounds, after adding 3 million pounds in amortization annually.IG Group, which has over 152,600 active clients according to its website, said the deal would ""significantly enhance"" its ability to bring on new clients and improve the retention rates of  current clients.""Our discussions with IG this morning indicate that IG is not buying a revenue stream but instead a client recruitment engine,"" RBC analysts said.""While client recruitment and retainment are positives, this acquisition does add to an already rapidly increasing cost base,"" the analysts added. IG Group said this month that financial markets had become ""increasingly subdued"" in the two months after Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union, presenting clients with limited trading opportunities.Upon completion, the DailyFX business along with its web domains, source code, content and 34 employees will be transferred to IG, FXCM said.Assuming a cost base of 8 million pounds and revenue per client of 2,000 pounds, DailyFX needs to add 4,000 customers every year to break even, Barclays analysts said.  FXCM, which is the largest U.S. retail broker, with about 200,000 customers worldwide and 88,000 in the United States, said it would use the proceeds from the sale to repay debt owed to Leucadia National Corp (LUK.N).FXCM, reeling after customers lost more than $200 million from the surging Swiss franc early in 2015, borrowed $300 million from Leucadia to keep operating. reut.rs/2drwhuW""While DailyFX is a high quality asset and was not a targeted asset to sell, the opportunity came along and it was something we felt we should take advantage of,"" FXCM CEO Drew said.
