17,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 05 (Fitch) Time Warner, Inc.'s (Time Warner) 'BBB+' Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) is not affected by the company's decision to increase its  net leverage target to up to 2.75x from 2.5x, according to Fitch Ratings. A full  list of Fitch's ratings on Time Warner follows at the end of this release. The  company had approximately $20.2 billion of debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2013.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Time Warner's consistent financial policy and capital allocation strategy  continues to focus on investing in its business while maintaining a strong  balance sheet; --The contemplated spin-off of Time Inc. will benefit the company's operating  profile but is not expected to have a material impact on the company's credit  profile; --Time Warner's strong portfolio of cable networks anchors the ratings. Time Warner's new leverage target remains within the context of Fitch's 3.5x  total leverage target for the current rating. In Fitch's opinion the positive  operating momentum coupled with predictable, recurring free cash flow (FCF)  generated by Time Warner's strong portfolio of businesses is leverageable,  providing a sound basis to accommodate Time Warner's revised net leverage target  within the context of the current 'BBB+' rating. Time Warner generated  approximately $2.2 billion of FCF (Fitch defined as cash flow from operations  less capital expenditures and dividends adjusted for one-time acquisition costs)  during the year-ended 2013 led by the revenue, operating margin, and low capital  requirement characteristics of the company's cable networks business segment.  Fitch expects the company to generate annual FCF in excess of $1.9 billion  during the ratings horizon. The FCF generation affords the company significant  financial flexibility. Fitch acknowledges that the contemplated level of share  repurchases is expected to exceed annual FCF generation; however, the company  maintains the ability to reduce share repurchases to maximize financial  flexibility should the need occur. Fitch anticipates that Time Warner will gradually increase leverage over the  ratings horizon to meet its new leverage target. Shareholder returns that exceed  free cash flow generation are incorporated into current ratings to the extent  that leverage remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold which remains  unchanged. Fitch remains convinced that Time Warner is well positioned to address the  threats and opportunities presented the evolving media landscape, including the  growing prominence of alternative distribution platforms, providing sufficient  flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate the company's revised  leverage target. Fitch also believes demand for high-quality content remains  strong across all major end-markets (broadcast, cable networks and subscription  video on demand) and that large, well-capitalized content providers, such as  Time Warner, will remain crucial to the industry. Time Warner's capital allocation strategy remains consistent and is centered on  investing in its business to strengthen its product portfolio, maintaining a  strong balance sheet and returning excess capital to its shareholders. The  company returned approximately $4.8 billion of capital to its shareholders  during 2013 including $3.7 billion of share repurchases. Time Warner maintains  an appropriate balance between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of  dividends and share repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its  business in Fitch's estimation. Total debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2013 was approximately $20.2 billion,  reflecting a modest 1.5% increase relative to year-end 2012. Consolidated  leverage was 2.5x (calculated on a gross basis) and 2.3x (calculated on a net  debt basis) as of year-end 2013.  Overall, Fitch's ratings on Time Warner reflect strong and consistent FCF, solid  credit protection measures, sound liquidity, leading market positions in core  businesses, and strong content brands. In addition, Time Warner's lower exposure  to cyclical advertising revenues relative to its peer group, and lack of  exposure to the hyper-cyclical local advertising markets, provides incremental  support to the ratings. Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. The size and scale of Warner Bros.  television studio enables Time Warner to capitalize on strong demand for  television content while providing meaningful diversification of revenue  sources. Fitch is cognizant of the inherent volatility of hit-driven content in  the film and television production business. Fitch also acknowledges Time  Warner's strong track record of consistently generating desirable content.  Fitch believes Time Warner's decision to spin off Time Inc. to its shareholders  will benefit the company's operating profile but is not expected to have a  material impact on Time Warner's credit profile. The proposed transaction,  expected to be completed by the end of second-quarter-2014 (2Q'14), enables Time  Warner to moderately de-risk its business profile while increasing strategic  focus on its Networks, and Film and TV Entertainment segments. Time, Inc's  initial capitalization is expected to include approximately $1.3 billion of net  debt.  Outside of a material change to its financial strategy or event-driven merger  and acquisition activity, rating concerns center on Time Warner's ability to  balance escalating programming expense and production costs with the requirement  to consistently deliver programming that drives incremental share of viewing  audience while maintaining or expanding operating margins.  Time Warner's liquidity is strong and supported by $1.9 billion of cash on hand,  $5 billion in available credit facilities (nearly all of which was available as  of Dec. 31, 2013), and expected FCF generation. Time Warner's revolver  commitments mature on Dec. 18, 2018. Time Warner has no debt scheduled to mature  during 2014 and $1 billion during 2015.   RATING SENSITIVITIES: Fitch does not contemplate additional positive rating actions over the current  ratings horizon. That notwithstanding, positive rating action would likely  coincide with Time Warner adopting a more conservative financial policy.  Meanwhile, Time Warner will need to demonstrate that its operating profile is  sustainable amid ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption  patterns and evolving technology platforms. Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretional actions of  Time Warner's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a  more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition  activity that drives leverage beyond 3.5x in the absence of a creditable  de-leveraging plan. Additionally, negative rating actions could result should  Fitch begin to observe a weakening of Time Warner's ability to produce desired  film and television content or secure programming on its cable networks that  consistently delivers viewing audience ratings, leading to lower subscription  fee or adverting revenues. Further, a weakening of Time Warner's competitive  position due to its failure to adopt to emerging distribution platforms could  prompt Fitch to take negative rating actions.  Fitch currently rates Time Warner as follows: Time Warner Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures at 'BBB+', --Commercial paper at 'F2'. Time Warner International Finance Limited --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+', --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

23,"  * Cisco falls after results, outlook* Comcast to buy Time Warner* Whole Foods drops after cutting forecast* Initial claims rise, retail sales fall* Indexes up: Dow 0.15 pct, S&P 0.22 pct, Nasdaq 0.4 pctBy Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK, Feb 13 U.S. stocks advanced on Thursday, erasing earlier declines as investors discounted weaker-than-expected data on consumer spending and the labor market, but a disappointing outlook by Cisco Systems kept gains in check on each of the major indexes. Cisco fell 4.2 percent to $21.90 as one of the biggest drags on all three major U.S. indexes after the network-gear maker forecast a drop of 6 to 8 percent in revenue in the current quarter.Indexes managed to recover from earlier weakness as investors looked past soft data on the consumer and labor market due to harsh weather conditions. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose last week and retail sales fell in January, while December retail sales were also revised lower.""I don't think we're going to see clean data until probably April, since March is still expected to have bad weather, though not as severe as the winter months,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""Right now markets are still giving the economy the benefit of the doubt.""Comcast Corp said it would buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in an all-stock deal that combines the two largest U.S. cable operators. Time Warner Cable shares rose 6.7 percent to $144.35 while Comcast shed 3.9 percent to $53.10.

24,"  (Corrects paragraph one stock symbol for Comcast. The error first occurred in Update 1)By Liana B. BakerFeb 13 Comcast Corp's proposed $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc could face close scrutiny from U.S. antitrust regulators because of the deal's potential to reshape the country's pay TV and broadband markets.The company resulting from the merger of the top two U.S. cable service providers would boast a footprint spanning from New York to Los Angeles, with a near 30 percent share of the pay TV market as well as a strong position in providing broadband Internet services.The all-stock deal, announced on Thursday, would put Comcast in 19 of the 20 largest U.S. TV markets, and could give it unprecedented leverage in negotiations with content providers and advertisers.The friendly takeover came as a surprise after months of public pursuit of Time Warner Cable by smaller rival Charter Communications Inc, and immediately raised questions as to whether it would be blocked by the Department of Justice or the Federal Communications Commission.Time Warner Cable shares jumped 6.8 percent to $144.50, still substantially short of the $158.82 per share value that Comcast put on its offer, indicating investors' worries about regulatory clearance. Comcast shares fell 3.5 percent, cutting the per-share offer value to $154.""I don't know if the deal is too big to fail to be approved but it is definitely too big to sail through either the Department of Justice or the FCC without serious, serious examination,"" said former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.""Only Comcast could have paid this price and the combined company, if approved, would tilt the balance of power at every negotiating table in media and content and broadband and equipment industries.""Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said he was confident about getting the green light from regulators as the two companies plan to divest 3 million subscribers, so that their  combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. He said no decisions have been made on which markets to sell.The new cable giant would still tower over U.S. satellite competitor DirecTV, which has about 20 million video customers.Comcast argued that the acquisition would be beneficial to consumers in that it would roll out its more advanced cloud-based set-top boxes to Time Warner Cable customers. It also said the deal would eventually result in higher broadband speeds. ""Significantly, it will not reduce competition in any relevant market be because our companies do not overlap or compete with each other,"" Roberts said. ""In fact, we do not operate in any of the same zip code.""The new partners are concentrated in different cities. Comcast would fill in its New Jersey and Connecticut portfolio with Time Warner Cable's New York City customers, for instance, and add major markets such as Los Angeles and Dallas.Hedge fund manager John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co is one of Time Warner Cable's top 10 shareholders, called the merger ""a dream combination.""ADVERTISING SYNERGIES If successful, the deal will be the second time in little more than a year that Comcast has helped reshape the U.S. media landscape after its $17 billion acquisition of NBC Universal was completed in 2013. ""The negative is that NBC Universal ownership further complicates regulatory approval with implications even for usage-based pricing,"" Wunderlich Securities Matthew Harrigan said in a research note.Representatives for the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department could not be reached for comment.Comcast's offer price is roughly what Time Warner Cable demanded from Charter and a 17 percent premium from the No. 2 cable provider's closing price on Wednesday. Charter shares slid 6.2 percent.Comcast and Time Warner Cable expect to create $1.5 billion in operating savings, with 50 percent of those savings expected in the first year. The proposed deal will be accretive to Comcast, which plans to expand its stock buyback program to $10 billion at the close of the transaction.Comcast is interested in advertising synergies it would gain by owning the New York City market as well as the opportunity to expand its business services unit, its fastest-growing cable division, to a larger footprint. ""For Comcast, adding New York and Los Angeles has advertising potential, along with Time Warner Cable's sports assets, which provides an acquisition target that is simply too compelling to ignore, especially with an (under-leveraged) balance sheet,"" said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield.The two companies expect to close the deal, which would give roughly 23 percent of the merged company to Time Warner Cable shareholders, by the end of the year. Unusually for a transaction of this size, there is no break-up fee.Analysts noted that smaller cable operator Charter, which went hostile this week by nominating a slate of directors to replace the entire board of Time Warner Cable, could still be a candidate to acquire some of the assets to be divested.Charter offered $132.50 per share in a cash and stock deal last month that was rejected as too low. Officials at the company did not respond to a request for comment.SPORTS NETWORKS Talks between Comcast and Time Warner Cable started about a year ago, but negotiations gathered pace in recent weeks, people familiar with the matter said. Time Warner Cable had told Comcast it considered Comcast to be its preferred buyer once Charter had approached them, the sources said.Comcast had also been in talks with Charter about the possibility of carving up Time Warner Cable markets, but opted not to participate in a hostile situation, the people said.Comcast also likely was attracted to Time Warner Cable's two regional sports networks in Los Angeles, where it has spent billions on local TV rights for LA Lakers basketball and LA Dodgers baseball.The deal would be a coup for Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus, who just ascended to the top job on Jan 1. Filings show that the former mergers and acquisitions attorney is set to pocket $50 million if Time Warner Cable is sold and he is replaced while he is CEO.J.P. Morgan, Paul J. Taubman, and Barclays Plc acted as financial advisors to Comcast. Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company, Citigroup and Centerview Partners are financial advisors to Time Warner Cable on the deal.

Initial claims are expected to come in at 300,000, a slight drop from the 331,000 reported in the prior week.* Comcast Corp said it would buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in an all-stock deal that combines the two largest U.S. cable operators.* Time Warner shares rose 9.4 percent to $148 in premarket while Comcast shed 3.2 percent to $53.50. Shares of Charter Communications Inc, which had also pursued Time Warner, fell 6.2 percent to $129 before the opening bell. * S&P 500 e-mini futures fell 8 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures lost 59 points and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 18.25 points.* A deadly winter storm gripped the southeastern United States on Wednesday, crippling travel, grounding flights, knocking out power to 363,000 customers.* A scheduled hearing by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in front of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Thursday was postponed due to the snowstorm in the U.S. East Coast. Yellen's testimony Tuesday helped fuel strong gains on Wall Street. * Whole Foods Market Inc lost 8.9 percent to $50.55 in premarket after the largest U.S. organic and natural food retailer stunned investors on Wednesday by cutting its 2014 sales forecast for the second time in three months.* PepsiCo Inc reported a 5 percent jump in quarterly profit, helped by strong sales of Frito-Lay chips in the Americas and cost-cutting measures.* Of 365 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 67.7 percent have beaten profit expectations, above the long-term average of 63 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.* The S&P 500 closed lower on Wednesday, with a four-day rally in the index just barely coming to an end after Procter & Gamble cut its outlook.* European stocks snapped a week-long winning streak on Thursday, weighed by a batch of disappointing updates from blue-chip companies including Swiss food group Nestle  and French bank BNP Paribas.* Asian shares stepped back from three-week highs on Thursday, snapping a five-session winning streak that was underpinned by receding concerns about global growth prospects and reassurance over U.S. monetary policy.",2014-02-13,TWX,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 7:56am EST","US STOCKS-Futures slip ahead of retail sales, claims data",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-usa-stocks-idUSL2N0LI0NF20140213?type=companyNews
28,"   By David Ingram | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) will again be working with its longtime antitrust counsel at Davis Polk & Wardwell, as the communications and entertainment group seeks to navigate the U.S. approval process to merge with rival Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N.Comcast has used the New York-based law firm repeatedly for antitrust matters, most notably its successful bid to buy a majority of NBC Universal from General Electric Co (GE.N). A team of Davis Polk lawyers helped win U.S. Justice Department approval for that deal in January 2011.The two cable giants are proposing a $45.2 billion combination that is likely to face scrutiny from antitrust enforcers because of the deal's potential to reshape pay TV and broadband markets in the United States.The antitrust team will be led by Arthur Burke, a Comcast spokeswoman said. Burke is a member of Davis Polk's litigation department, according to the firm's website.Burke was involved in the 2011 settlement with the Justice Department which allowed Comcast to take control of NBC Universal.In a news release, the companies said that Comcast's legal advisers were Davis Polk as well as Willkie Farr & Gallagher and that Time Warner Cable's legal advisers were Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.The firms all declined to comment on their roles. Two of the firms worked with the same clients in at least one past lawsuit. In 2006, the America Channel, a cable network dedicated to telling the personal stories of Americans, sued Comcast and Time Warner Cable, alleging that they violated federal antitrust law by refusing to carry the channel.A U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota dismissed the lawsuit the next year. Davis Polk represented Comcast, while Paul, Weiss represented Time Warner Cable.Davis Polk has also worked for Comcast in an ongoing antitrust class action in federal court in Philadelphia, where local subscribers have accused the company of running an illegal monopoly. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated an order for class certification and sent the case back to U.S. District Court, where a new motion for certification is pending. POTENTIAL REUNION Another lawyer who worked on the Comcast-NBC deal was Bill Baer, who at the time was a partner at Arnold & Porter representing General Electric, which then owned NBC Universal.Baer is now the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, setting up a potential reunion at the negotiating table if the Justice Department turns out to be the agency that reviews the latest Comcast deal.The Justice Department shares antitrust review authority with the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.

The three models, wearing just bikini bottoms and knee-deep in light blue water, coyly turn their heads and smile with their backsides facing the camera on the cover.Aldridge, who is best known as a Victoria's Secret underwear model, is the first Sports Illustrated model to grace the cover in her first appearance in the magazine since Klum did so in 1998.

31,"  LOS ANGELES Feb 21 Dish Networks Inc  Chairman Charlie Ergen said the proposed merger between Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc will cause a ""seismic shift"" in the media business and his company is considering how to respond.Ergen said the transaction would concentrate broadband, video and content in a ""nationwide player.""""That's going to send a seismic shift across our industry in ways that maybe we can't predict today,"" he said on Friday on a conference call after the satellite TV provider released quarterly earnings. Dish is reviewing the deal's impact and will present options to its board, Ergen said.Comcast, the largest U.S. cable operator, said on Feb. 13 it had agreed to acquire Time Warner Cable in an all-stock deal for $45.2 billion. The proposal faces reviews from U.S. regulators who will study its effect on competition. Comcast has argued the combination would not reduce competition because the two cable providers do not compete in any markets. The company pledged to divest 3 million subscribers, so the combined customer base of 30 million would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market.Ergen said the deal, if approved, ""certainly doesn't hurt the case for consolidation"" of satellite TV providers. The U.S. government blocked a proposed merger of Dish and rival DirecTV  in 2002. ""If you take the No. 1 and 4 providers and put them together, it would be hard to see why you couldn't put the No. 2 and 3 providers together,"" he said.A Comcast spokesman had no comment on Ergen's remarks.",2014-02-21,TWX,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 4:12pm EST","UPDATE 2-Dish Chairman: Comcast, Time Warner deal to cause 'seismic shift'",http://www.reuters.com//article/dish-comcast-idUSL2N0LQ1WB20140221?type=companyNews

38,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB+' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) on Time Warner Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook  remains Stable. A full list of Fitch's ratings on Time Warner follows at the end  of this release. The company had approximately $20.2 billion of debt outstanding  as of Dec. 31, 2013.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Time Warner's consistent financial policy and capital allocation strategy  continues to focus on investing in its business while maintaining a strong  balance sheet; --The contemplated spin-off of Time Inc. will benefit the company's operating  profile but is not expected to have a material impact on the company's credit  profile; --Time Warner's strong portfolio of cable networks (Turner and Home Box Office)  anchors the ratings. Fitch anticipates that Time Warner will gradually increase leverage over the  ratings horizon to meet its net leverage target of up to 2.75x. Shareholder  returns that exceed free cash flow generation are incorporated into current  ratings to the extent that leverage remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage  threshold, which remains unchanged. Total debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2013 was approximately $20.2 billion,  reflecting a modest 1.5% increase relative to year-end 2012. Consolidated  leverage was 2.5x (calculated on a gross basis) and 2.3x (calculated on a net  debt basis) as of year-end 2013. Fitch anticipates that Time Warner's leverage  will increase over the next two years as it moves to its net leverage target of  up to 2.75x.  Time Warner's capital allocation strategy remains consistent and is centered on  investing in its business to strengthen its product portfolio, maintaining a  strong balance sheet and returning excess capital to its shareholders. Fitch  expects that 2014 total shareholder returns will exceed the $4.8 billion of  capital (including $3.7 billion of share repurchases) the company returned to  its shareholders during 2013. Time Warner maintains an appropriate balance  between returning capital to shareholders, in the form of dividends and share  repurchases, and investing in the strategic needs of its business in Fitch's  estimation. Time Warner's leverage target remains within the context of Fitch's 3.5x total  leverage target for the current rating. In Fitch's opinion the positive  operating momentum coupled with predictable, recurring free cash flow (FCF)  generated by Time Warner's strong portfolio of businesses is leverageable,  providing a sound basis to accommodate Time Warner's net leverage target within  the context of the current 'BBB+' rating. Time Warner generated approximately  $2.3 billion of FCF (Fitch defined as cash flow from operations less capital  expenditures and dividends adjusted for one-time acquisition costs) during the  year-ended 2013 led by the revenue, operating margin, and low capital  requirement characteristics of the company's cable networks businesses. Fitch  expects the company to generate annual FCF in excess of $1.9 billion during the  ratings horizon. The FCF generation affords the company significant financial  flexibility. Fitch acknowledges that the contemplated level of share repurchases  is expected to exceed annual FCF generation; however, the company maintains the  ability to reduce share repurchases to maximize financial flexibility should the  need occur. Overall, Fitch's ratings on Time Warner reflect strong and consistent FCF, solid  credit protection measures, sound liquidity, leading market positions in core  businesses, and strong content brands. In addition, Time Warner's lower exposure  to cyclical advertising revenues relative to its peer group, and lack of  exposure to the hyper-cyclical local advertising markets, provides incremental  support to the ratings.  Time Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring dual  stream revenue profile, high operating margin and free cash flow generation  characteristics attributable to its cable network business. Key operating  strategy within its cable network businesses will be to leverage increased  investment in original and sports programming to accelerate domestic affiliate  fee revenue growth. However, Time Warner's businesses face continued audience  fragmentation across devices and networks, stagnant multichannel video  subscription growth, a growing preference for time-shifted viewing as well as  stronger competition from online video sources. These factors, along with  potential cable industry consolidation have the potential to hamper anticipated  affiliate fee revenue growth over the longer term.  The company plans to increase its investment in original programming across all  of its cable networks which should improve viewership and network brand and  translate into higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Fitch expects  mid-single-digit top line growth, stable margins and high free cash flow  conversion over the next several years, driven by domestic affiliate fee growth  and international expansion.  Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. The size and scale of Warner Bros.  television studio enables Time Warner to capitalize on strong demand for  television content while providing meaningful diversification of revenue  sources. Fitch is cognizant of the inherent volatility of hit-driven content in  the film and television production businesses. Fitch also acknowledges Time  Warner's strong track record of consistently generating desirable content. Fitch remains convinced that Time Warner is well positioned to address the  threats and opportunities present in the evolving media landscape, including the  growing prominence of alternative distribution platforms, providing sufficient  flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate the company's revised  leverage target. Fitch also believes demand for high-quality content remains  strong across all major end-markets (broadcast, cable networks and subscription  video on demand) and that large, well-capitalized content providers, such as  Time Warner, will remain crucial to the industry. Fitch believes Time Warner's decision to spin off Time Inc. to its shareholders  will benefit the company's operating profile but is not expected to have a  material impact on Time Warner's credit profile. The proposed transaction,  expected to be completed by the end of second-quarter-2014 (2Q'14), enables Time  Warner to moderately de-risk its business profile while increasing strategic  focus on its Turner, Home Box Office and Warner Bros. segments. Time Inc.'s  initial capitalization is expected to include approximately $1.3 billion of net  debt.  Outside of a material change to its financial strategy or event-driven merger  and acquisition activity, rating concerns center on Time Warner's ability to  balance escalating programming expense and production costs with the requirement  to consistently deliver programming that drives incremental share of viewing  audience while maintaining or expanding operating margins.  Time Warner's liquidity is strong and supported by $1.9 billion of cash on hand,  $5 billion in available credit facilities (nearly all of which was available as  of Dec. 31, 2013), and expected FCF generation. Time Warner's revolver  commitments mature on Dec. 18, 2018. Time Warner has no debt scheduled to mature  during 2014 and $1 billion during 2015.  RATING SENSITIVITIES: Fitch does not contemplate additional positive rating actions over the current  ratings horizon. That notwithstanding, positive rating action would likely  coincide with Time Warner adopting a more conservative financial policy.  Meanwhile, Time Warner will need to demonstrate that its operating profile is  sustainable amid ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption  patterns and evolving technology platforms. Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretional actions of  Time Warner's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting a  more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition  activity that drives leverage beyond 3.5x in the absence of a creditable  de-leveraging plan. Additionally, negative rating actions could result should  Fitch begin to observe a weakening of Time Warner's ability to produce desired  film and television content or secure programming on its cable networks that  consistently delivers viewing audience ratings, leading to lower subscription  fee or advertising revenues. Further, a weakening of Time Warner's competitive  position due to its failure to adopt to emerging distribution platforms could  prompt Fitch to take negative rating actions.  Fitch affirms Time Warner's ratings as follows: Time Warner Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures at 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. Time Warner International Finance Limited --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

43,"   By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Executives from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N are expected to defend their plan to merge as they go before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, the first hearing since the $45.2-billion deal was announced in February.The proposed merger has stirred the ire of public interest groups who worry that a bigger Comcast would have too much clout over fast-growing broadband, free rein to raise cable rates and more power over what Americans watch on television.David Cohen, executive vice president of Comcast, and Arthur Minson, TWC's finance chief are expected to argue that their cable and broadband services do not compete with each other. Time Warner customers also stand to get faster Internet speeds and better cable service, the companies have said.Further, they are likely to reiterate that Comcast faces competition in both Internet and video markets from the likes of Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) - an argument Comcast made in filings with the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday. A primary concern for Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and chair of the committee, is ""diverse and independent video programming.""""Cable companies play a dominant role in how many people in this country get information. Consumers deserve to know how a merger between two of the largest companies in this industry will impact them,"" Leahy said in prepared testimony.Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of the committee's antitrust panel and a Minnesota Democrat, is worried about both cable and broadband. ""I will specifically be looking at how the proposed merger will impact prices and service, how it would affect Comcast's control over programming and what people are able to watch, and how it would change Comcast's control over people's access to the Internet,"" she said in a statement. Also due to appear on Wednesday is Gene Kimmelman, head of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and a vocal opponent of the merger. Kimmelman was at the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in 2011 when it approved the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal but stopped AT&T's (T.N) proposed purchase of T-Mobile USA (DTEGn.DE).""The merger will even more firmly entrench Comcast as the gatekeeper at the crossroads of Internet, television, and communications innovation,"" Kimmelman's testimony says. In an effort to win approval Comcast has pledged to divest 3 million subscribers so the combined company's customer base of 30 million would be just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television market. The combined company would also serve between 20 and 40 percent of the high-speed Internet market, Comcast said in Tuesday's filing.Rounding out Wednesday's panel are James Bosworth from Back9Network, an independent golf channel; Richard Sherwin from Spot On Networks, a managed Wi-Fi provider; and Christopher Yoo, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.The Justice Department will review the merger to ensure it complies with antitrust law. The Federal Communications Commission has a broader public interest standard. Attorneys general from Florida, Indiana and several other states are also looking at the deal.(Reporting by Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh; Editing by Ros Krasny, Bernard Orr)",2014-04-09,TWX,"Wed Apr 9, 2014 | 1:09am EDT","Comcast, Time Warner to face lawmakers on merger plan",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-comcast-timewarnercable-idUSBREA380B920140409?type=companyNews

46,"  (Adds legal analysis and sponsors status, comments from Players Association, Jesse Jackson)By Scott Malone and Larry FineNEW YORK, April 29 The National Basketball Association banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the game for life on Tuesday and fined him $2.5 million for racist comments that drew outrage from players, fans, commercial sponsors and even President Barack Obama.Sterling, the longest-tenured owner of any of the 30 NBA teams, will be barred from any role in the operations of his team or be able to serve as one of the league's governors, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told a news conference in New York.Silver also urged the other owners to vote to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, a move that would require approval of three-quarters of the current owners.Asked whether Sterling could end up as essentially an absentee owner if the league fails to force a sale of the team, Silver replied, ""I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him.""The controversy began over the weekend when the celebrity website TMZ.com released an audio recording with a voice said to be Sterling's criticizing a woman friend for associating with ""black people."" The recording included Sterling asking his friend not to invite former Los Angeles Laker star player Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson to games.""The views expressed by Mr. Sterling are deeply offensive and harmful,"" Silver told reporters as he confronted his first major crisis since he was named commissioner in February.An investigation concluded the male voice on the recording, and on a second recording said to be from the same conversation and made public on Sunday, was Sterling's, Silver told reporters. He said Sterling confirmed it was his voice but did not apologize.""He has not expressed to me directly any other views,"" Silver told reporters as the NBA responded to an uproar in a league that was at the forefront of racial integration in U.S. professional sports and where most of the players are black. Obama, the first black U.S. president, called Sterling's comments ""incredibly offensive racist statements.""Sterling could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. LEGAL OPTIONS It was not immediately clear whether Sterling would seek to challenge the ban in court. But lawyers with expertise in sports law gave him little chance of successfully suing the NBA.""Having agreed to the NBA constitution and bylaws, I think courts will generally make him adhere to the agreement that he freely entered into,"" said Jeffrey Kessler, a partner with the Winston & Strawn law firm and outside council to the NBA Players Association.Nathaniel Grow, a University of Georgia assistant professor who studies sports law, agreed, saying the NBA commissioner is ""almost like a judge and executioner, and whatever he says goes.""Meanwhile, the decision to ban Sterling drew praise from around the league. The Clippers said in a statement that the team ""wholeheartedly"" supports the NBA's move, and members of the cross-town rival Los Angeles Lakers joined Mayor Eric Garcetti at a news conference in a show of support for Silver. ""I want to personally thank Commissioner Silver for bringing down the hammer, for being as strong as he could be,"" Garcetti said. ""You might be able to buy a team, but you don't own this city. This is our town.""Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a former NBA player himself now serving as a special adviser to the NBA Players Association, also hailed the move. ""Adam Silver is not only the owners' commissioner, he is also the players' commissioner, and we're proud to call him our commissioner,"" Johnson said.Civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson praised Silver for having ""handled this matter emphatically and decisively."" He said the banning of Sterling ""lays the groundwork for defining a threshold for racist conduct.""WILL HE SELL?  The ban may not be enough for some critics who called on Sterling to immediately give up ownership of the Clippers, though observers said the other 29 owners of NBA franchises would be hesitant to back any move that could set a precedent that would undermine their property rights.""Every owner would be worried that it would create a situation where people later came after them,"" said Robert Boland, chairman of the sports management department at New York University.The recording on TMZ.com included part of an argument between Sterling and a model who uses the name V. Stiviano about photographs posted to Instagram. ""People call you and tell you that I have black people on my Instagram. And it bothers you,"" the voice said to be Stiviano's says.""Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to promo ... broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?"" the voice said to be Sterling's says.A lawyer for Stiviano declined to comment on the decision.A series of Los Angeles Clippers' commercial sponsors moved to distance themselves from the team. Auto dealer CarMax Inc, Virgin America airlines said after Tuesday's announcement they were ending their sponsorship, and State Farm said it was ""continuing the pause"" in its sponsorship.Samsung said it was reinstating its advertising of the Clippers' playoff game Tuesday night against the Golden State Warriors.Sterling bought the Clippers, then based in San Diego, in 1981 for $13 million at a time when basketball was far less commercially successful. The franchise could now be worth as much as $800 million, Boland estimated. The team, long a perennial underdog, moved to Los Angeles in 1984.Sterling was sued as a property owner in 2003 for discrimination in housing by the U.S. government. The lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles accused him of telling his staff to rent to Asian tenants but not black or Hispanic people.Silver said the decision to ban Sterling from the game had not taken his past history into account. He said, however, that   when the owners vote on whether to force him to sell, ""they will take into account a lifetime of behavior.""

50,"   By Jason Hovet | PRAGUE  PRAGUE CME (CETV.O), the central and eastern European broadcaster controlled by Time Warner (TWX.N), expects to return to profit this year as it slowly wins back advertisers after scaling down an ill-fated rise in prices.The company, whose full name is Central European Media Enterprises (CETV.PR), is being helped to recover from the toughest period in its two-decade existence by a financial lifeline from its main shareholder.It said on Wednesday that financing deals with the U.S. media group, which closed last week, would cut interest costs and improve its cashflow beginning next year.CME, started by U.S. billionaire Ronald Lauder, fell into deep losses last year when many of its advertising customers in its largest market, the Czech Republic, deserted it following a hike in prices introduced by previous management that was meant to regain income lost in a slumping TV advertising market.The company was forced to scale down the increases and is now getting back some customers, but said on Wednesday it would take more than a year to regain lost market share.Still, a rebound in advertising helped CME narrow its loss in the first quarter and it forecast operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) to reach $80-90 million in 2014 after a $46.5 million loss in 2013. ""We continue to expect a significant improvement in net revenues in the Czech Republic in 2014 when compared to 2013, but do not expect to reach 2012 levels this year as it will take more than one year for us to regain the market share lost during 2013,"" CME said in a regulatory filing.""Given the significance of this segment to the company, we expect a similar trend in the consolidated results.""FIRST IMPROVEMENTS First-quarter revenue was up in five of CME's six markets, rising by 15.3 percent year-on-year to $153.1 million overall, in line with the average estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts.

51,"  * Revenue up in most markets, losses shrink* Sees 2014 OIBDA of $80-90 million* Winning back advertisers after scaling back price hikes* Time Warner financing deals give CME breathing room   (Updates with OIBDA forecast, market outlook, shares, quotes)By Jason HovetPRAGUE, May 7 CME, the central and eastern European broadcaster controlled by Time Warner, expects to return to profit this year as it slowly wins back advertisers after scaling down an ill-fated rise in prices.The company, whose full name is Central European Media Enterprises, is being helped to recover from the toughest period in its two-decade existence by a financial lifeline from its main shareholder.It said on Wednesday that financing deals with the U.S. media group, which closed last week, would cut interest costs and improve its cashflow beginning next year.CME, started by U.S. billionaire Ronald Lauder, fell into deep losses last year when many of its advertising customers in its largest market, the Czech Republic, deserted it following a hike in prices introduced by previous management that was meant to regain income lost in a slumping TV advertising market. The company was forced to scale down the increases and is now getting back some customers, but said on Wednesday it would take more than a year to regain lost market share.Still, a rebound in advertising helped CME narrow its loss in the first quarter and it forecast operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) to reach $80-90 million in 2014 after a $46.5 million loss in 2013.""We continue to expect a significant improvement in net revenues in the Czech Republic in 2014 when compared to 2013, but do not expect to reach 2012 levels this year as it will take more than one year for us to regain the market share lost during 2013,"" CME said in a regulatory filing.""Given the significance of this segment to the company, we expect a similar trend in the consolidated results."" FIRST IMPROVEMENTS First-quarter revenue was up in five of CME's six markets, rising by 15.3 percent year-on-year to $153.1 million overall, in line with the average estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts.OIBDA showed a loss of $2.3 million, improving on the $20.7 million loss a year ago, while the firm's operating loss (EBIT) also shrank to $14.4 million from $35.1 million. ""The first quarter of 2014 demonstrates tangible results from our operating priorities, including increases in television advertising revenue and carriage fees,"" co-Chief Executive Officer Michael Del Nin said.CME shares gained more than 4 percent, hitting a one-week high.""It is the first quarter where the company is showing an improvement, so the market is taking that positively,"" J&T Banka analyst Pavel Ryska said.CME last week completed a series of deals with Time Warner that allowed it to use more than $400 million to redeem 11.625 percent senior notes due in 2016.

55,"   By Steve Gorman | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The National Basketball Association on Friday installed former Time Warner CEO and chairman Richard Parsons as interim chief executive of the Los Angeles Clippers while preparing for an unprecedented bid to force out the team's owner, Donald Sterling.Parsons was named chief executive officer three days after Sterling's longtime top lieutenant, Andy Roeser, was placed on indefinite leave as team president, and more than a week after the NBA banned Sterling over racist comments that sparked outrage from players, fans and commercial sponsors.Sterling, 80, who has owned the Clippers for 33 years, now faces an attempt by the league to force a sale of his franchise in a scandal that has unfolded during the team's best season on record.An NBA committee of 10 fellow owners or their representatives initiated the process of terminating Sterling's ownership by voting unanimously last week to move ahead ""as expeditiously as possible.""Parsons, 66, a senior consultant at the investment firm Providence Equity Partners and a one-time member of President Barack Obama's economic advisory team, is one of a relatively few African-Americans to have headed major U.S. corporations.He joined Time Warner in 1995 as president of the media conglomerate and was chairman and CEO there from 2002 until 2008. He later served as chairman of Citigroup until stepping down from that post in 2012.""I believe the hiring of Dick Parsons will bring extraordinary leadership and immediate stability to the Clippers organization,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. Parsons himself played college basketball while attending the University of Hawaii and went on to earn a law degree.Beginning his career in the 1970s as a staff lawyer for then-New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, Parsons followed Rockefeller to Washington when he was named U.S. vice president by President Gerald R. Ford in the aftermath of Watergate.'DEEPLY TROUBLED'  In his own statement, Parsons said: ""Like most Americans, I have been deeply troubled by the pain the Clippers' team, fans and partners have endured."" He also praised the coach, players and staff for showing ""great strength of character during a time of adversity.""Sterling came under fire on April 25 when the website TMZ.com posted an audio recording with a voice said to be his criticizing a female friend for associating with black people.Four days later, the NBA fined Sterling $2.5 million and banned him from pro basketball for life. Silver also has called on the league's 29 other owners who sit on the NBA's governing board to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, a first-time use of such a sanction that would require a three-quarters vote by the board.Sterling has not publicly addressed the controversy, but experts have said they do not expect him to give up his team without a fight.He purchased the Clippers in 1981 for $12.5 million when the team was still based in San Diego and moved the club to Los Angeles in 1984. The team is now estimated to be worth at least $575 million, according to Forbes magazine, but some have estimated it could fetch as much as $1 billion.Sterling's wife, Shelly, who shares ownership of the team through a family trust, issued a statement on Friday endorsing Parsons as interim CEO, calling him ""an ideal choice to run the franchise until the ownership issues are clarified.""Shelly Sterling has said she intends to defend her 50-percent ownership interest in the Clippers in court.

65,"   By Jennifer Saba and Liana B. Baker  Shares of Time Inc ebbed on Monday in the magazine publisher's first trading session since its spinoff from Time Warner Inc, even as CEO Joe Ripp vowed to expand a business he said had been starved of capital for years.Time Inc, whose titles include People, Sports Illustrated and its namesake Time magazine, will now operate without the cushion provided by such lucrative Time Warner Inc cousins as the HBO family of pay-TV channels or the Warner Bros movie studio.The spinoff, which follows a strategy pursued by News Corp and other media companies, is a response to a steady decline in magazine circulation and advertising revenue as consumers shift to reading news and entertainment content on smartphones and tablets.Ripp said in an interview on Monday that Time Inc, no longer beholden to its parent for capital, could now plow more cash back into its business and take the company beyond its core print products. He sees acquisitions in newsletters and the digital sector as a possibility. ""I think you're going to be seeing lots of acquisitions from us. Some smaller and some a little bit bigger, but I'm not looking at anything for a $1 billion right now,"" Ripp said. There's nothing like that in my sights.""Shares closed 18 cents lower, or 0.8 percent, at $23.30, after trimming a decline of as much as 6 percent.  As part of the spinoff, Time Warner shareholders received one share of Time Inc stock for every eight shares of Time Warner stock. Based on 110 million shares outstanding, Time Inc had a market value of roughly $2.6 billion. Time Inc publishes more than 90 titles, including the business magazine Fortune, and operates 45 websites. The magazine unit has slashed its workforce in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue under Ripp. The company, which cut 600 jobs in 2013, now has about 7,800 employees. Ken Doctor, a research analyst at Outsell Inc, said Time Inc won't have an easy time as it plays catch-up with faster-growing Internet-based media companies. ""You can manage declines but at some point you've got to have a way to turn around that story,"" Doctor said. Ripp acknowledged the difficulties facing his company but said it could follow some of the strategies that are working for its competitors.  He said the company could find new revenue streams by offering products that are not necessarily print-based but are related to specialty areas it serves. For example, the company, which has two magazine titles dealing with wine, could acquire wine-oriented newsletters, sponsor vineyard tours and other events, produce videos, create apps and cull related data. Between 2011 and 2013, Time Inc's revenue fell 9 percent to $3.35 billion, while operating profit dropped 40 percent.    The company has also taken on $1.4 billion in debt, partly to help fund a one-time dividend to Time Warner shareholders.Several media companies, including News Corp, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal and owner of Fox News, have recently separated their print properties from faster-growing TV and cable businesses.Tribune Co also plans to cleave off its newspaper properties from its TV stations this year.

67,"  June 9 Time Inc, the magazine company that is home to People, Sports Illustrated and Time, will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday as print based companies face serious hurdles.Led by Chief Executive Joe Ripp, Time Inc is spinning off from its parent Time Warner Inc and will operate as a stand-alone public company no longer buffered by its lucrative cousins, pay-TV channel HBO or movie studio Warner Bros.The move comes as magazines are beset by declining circulation and advertising revenue as consumers shift to reading on smartphones and tablets.The magazine unit has been slashing jobs over the years - in 2013 it cut about 600 positions - a trend that will likely continue as Wall Street scrutinizes costs. The company employs approximately 7,800.Time Inc said revenue fell about 2 percent in 2013 to $3.35 billion compared to the prior year. Its adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization dropped 5 percent to $587 million and its free cash flow declined 10 percent to $384 million. With that declining trend line, Time Inc has taken on $1.4 billion in debt partly to help fund a one-time dividend to Time Warner shareholders.Time Warner shareholders received one share of Time Inc stock for every eight shares of Time Warner stock. Several media companies have split in recent years in order to separate print properties from faster-growing TV and cable properties.News Corp separated its publishing division which includes newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and Times of London, HarperCollins book publisher, and stakes in Australian pay-TV and online real estate companies.

73,"  (Jim Gaines, Reuters Global Editor-at-large, is the former editor of TIME and LIFE magazines and the author of several works of history. The opinions expressed are his own.)By Jim GainesJune 19 I learned what a trickster history can be 20 years ago at Hanoi airport. After everything the United States gave and lost in Vietnam while trying to keep it safe from Communism, who would have thought you would find the lion lying down with the lamb at a business convention? But there it was, capitalism in capital letters, a billboard advertising VIETNAMERICA EXPO!Who won that war again?Things like that change how you understand the world - if only by teaching you to wonder about even those things you think you know for an absolute fact.It happened again last weekend. I read something that laid waste one of the most common assumptions of Cold War history: that an expert 1953 CIA covert operation in Iran overthrew a democratically elected prime minister to put the shah back back in control of his country. Ray Takeyh, an Iranian-American historian and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues persuasively in the July/August issue of ""Foreign Affairs"" that President Dwight Eisenhower's CIA did not actually bring down Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh after all.Hunh? There had to be some mistake. Could it be that the United States is not the Great Satan the Middle East has made it out to be all these years? That the Iranians embraced the shah all on their own? Maybe that is the reason why the people of Iran have always evinced more affection for the U.S. and its citizens than their government does. They knew all along what U.S. historians did not - the truth.Takeyh can see it clearly. "" he CIA's impact on the events of 1953,"" he writes, ""was ultimately insignificant.""This is historic revisionism that cuts deep. The ""truth"" being revised has been the subject of soul-searching by U.S. presidents from Harry Truman, who refused to authorize covert ops in Iran, to Barack Obama, who, with implied contrition, invoked the CIA's role in ""the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government"" during his much-covered speech to the Arab world in 2009. The notion that the U.S. deposed Mossadegh and reimposed the shah on the people of Iran is one of the founding myths of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and among the most poignant intricacies of the American-Iranian relationship-one that is right now poised at a moment of great danger and great potential.With the region being fractured by sectarian violence, with extremists on the far side of al Qaeda taking over whole swaths of Syria and Iraq and threatening to carve a radical Sunni heartland out of the desert borderlands now only nominally controlled by Damascus and Baghdad, Iranian and U.S. officials actually met this week to discuss cooperation to keep Iraq from blowing up entirely. And while negotiations are far from concluded, the outlines of a deal that would contain Iran's nuclear ambitions are already coming clear.This makes Takeyh's rewriting of history of more than academic interest. His point, in brief, is that while the CIA and MI6 did plot to bring Mossadegh down, the written record proves that their plotting was ineffective and that everyone knew it. General Walter Bedell Smith gave the news to Eisenhower straight. ""The move failed,"" he wrote. ""We now have to take a whole new look at the Iranian situation""Only after Western intelligence backed off was Mossadegh brought down-not by the CIA or MI6, not even by the shah, but by the Iranians themselves, in a coalition of disaffected politicians, military officers, members of parliament, and Iranians of all stripes who took to the streets - led by none other than the most important religious leader in the country, Ayatollah Abul-Qasim Kashani and fellow Iranian clergy.""You have to understand that Iran in the 1950s was a different place,"" Takeyh said in an interview. ""The shah was tentative, deferential, not the megalomaniac he would become in the '70s. The clergy was more quietist and moderate than they are now, and apart from a few relatively minor disputes they had very good relations with the monarchy.""Takeyh's careful scholarship is bound to be contradicted by historians and politicians in both countries who have published the conventional story or have an interest in sustaining it, but the evidence for his case is strong, and it comes at a time when the need for a ""reset"" in U.S.-Iranian relations is compelling.Though the correction of a 60-year-old mistake is unlikely to produce a breakthrough in Syria, Iraq or nuclear negotiations, it does subtly change one of the negotiators - from helpless victim of the imperialist dog to a country that, however much its leaders may wish to distance themselves from it, shaped its own history.

74,"  (Adds comments on reduction of prices, Comcast/Time Warner competition, rewrites throughout)By Marina Lopes and Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON, June 24 U.S. lawmakers grilled AT&T Inc and DirecTV on Tuesday over a proposed merger that some Democrats and public interest groups fear will result in higher costs and less competition.The chief executives of the No. 2 wireless carrier and the largest U.S. satellite TV service provider testified about their proposed $48.5 billion deal at hearings in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and said the scale the merger would allow them to save on the high costs of negotiating rights to video content.But there were some tough reactions in Washington.""I am very, very skeptical as a senator, not just as a consumer,"" senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said at a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.Blumenthal asked AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson whether he could commit to pass on the savings from lower content fees to consumers dollar-for-dollar. ""No sir, I can't,"" Stephenson said, but added he hoped the merger would result in slower price increases for consumers.""One would have to believe in the market and the market pressures, and that market pressures will compete margins away and cost savings will find their way into prices.""Michael White, DirecTV's Chief Executive added that he expected customers to see better value bundles. ""It's pretty hard to commit to lower prices on pure-play TV because of the price of content,"" he said.The companies say their merger would also allow them to better compete with cable companies and provide improved Internet service to rural areas.But representatives of content producers and smaller cable operators spoke out against the deal, saying the combined company might wield too much power over the creation, distribution and costs of programming. The AT&T/DirecTV merger is one of several roiling the cable and wireless industries. Consumer advocates are worried that consolidation might result in fewer choices and higher prices for consumers.The others mergers are Comcast Corp's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc and Sprint Corp's  potential bid for T-Mobile US Inc.The Justice Department, which ensures mergers comply with antitrust law, and the Federal Communications Commission, which has a broader public-interest standard, will have to approve the deal. Lawmakers, although influential, do not have a formal role in deciding the fate of deals.Earlier on Tuesday, Stephenson also told House Judiciary Committee lawmakers that AT&T's proposed purchase of DirecTV does not compare with other mergers that are shaking up the telecommunications industry because the companies largely provide different services.Comcast, however, has stressed that its bid for Time Warner Cable would combine two companies that serve different markets, while AT&T and DirecTV overlap in serving about 25 percent of U.S. households.

80,"   By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the “disciplined determination” to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component – 40 percent - to win the prize.Murdoch's proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary. A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.""It's a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,"" a person close to the situation said. ""There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does."" Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch's approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.    In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox's shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons.""To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,"" the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters. Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate's employees in a videotaped appearance that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer.The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only Time Warner's disastrous takeover of AOL in 2000. In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox's stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main ""currency"" of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table.According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner's 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday.Shares of Fox dropped 6.2 percent to $33. The offer, first reported by The New York Times, was worth  about $80 billion, or $85 a share, when it was made in June.Fox estimates that a combined company, which would have $60 billion in annual revenue, would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, the people familiar with the matter said.    Detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal even more potential savings, they said, which may then justify sweetening the offer.Fox said no talks were under way, and it has no desire to go hostile or to bid against itself with a higher offer, the people familiar with the matter said.Either way, a takeover by Fox could win the blessing of many of Time Warner's shareholders, a majority of whom also own Fox's non-voting stock. In addition, Time Warner does not have a staggered board and its bylaws allow as few as 15 percent of shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid.A number of Time Warner shareholders said Twenty-First Century Fox and Murdoch might have to raise the bid to as high as $95 per share from $85 when the bid was made in June to wrap up a merger. Murdoch also would do well to offer more cash upfront, investors said. Time Warner has no controlling shareholder, meaning the company could easily go into play, said Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel LLC, which owns shares in both companies. “It’s going to be tough to say no,” he said during a conference in New York.Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, said he expects a technology company with more cash than Fox, such as Apple or Amazon, could emerge with a bid. “It’s not a dynamic I want to dismiss out of hand. They have a currency, and they understand the value of content,” he said of the tech companies."" Gamco's funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner and about 10.5 million Fox shares.              SEEKING DANCE PARTNERS     Fox's overtures are likely to reverberate across the industry, accelerating a wave of consolidation that is already well underway. Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, offered in February to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in stock.

81,"   By Jennifer Saba  If Rupert Murdoch succeeds in buying Time Warner Inc and CNN is put up for sale, the 24-hour cable news network could be worth $5 billion, according to one analyst's estimate.Gabelli & Co's Brett Harriss said CNN is worth about 11 times annual estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $450 million.He based the valuation on recent media deals such as Discovery Communications Inc's purchase of a controlling interest in Eurosport International and AMC Networks Inc's acquisition of Chellomedia. Both transactions were valued at 10.5 times to 11 times EBITDA, Harriss said.Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc said on Wednesday it made an offer to buy Time Warner for about $80 billion. Fox has indicated it would sell Time Warner's CNN, a direct competitor of Fox News, to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to people familiar with the situation.While Time Warner rebuffed Fox's offer, the 83-year-old Murdoch is unlikely to abandon his pursuit, the sources said.  Time Warner, which also owns pay-TV channel HBO and the Warner Bros movie studio, does not break out financial data for CNN. Time Warner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Harriss said that Walt Disney Co's ABC network, which does not have a cable news channel, could be a potential bidder for CNN. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.CBS Corp is another possible suitor, according to people familiar with the broadcast network. Over the years, CNN and CBS have mulled some type of merger though the issue of control was always a sticking point, these people said. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. Founded in 1980 by media mogul Ted Turner, CNN was the first cable news network in the United States and now has more than 40 news bureaus across the globe, with distribution in more than 200 countries.But CNN is struggling with declining ratings and advertising revenue as competition - especially from Fox News and Comcast Corp's MSNBC - gained ground. Jeff Zucker, the former CEO of NBC Universal, was tapped in 2012 to try to turn around CNN. He has focused the network on developing original programming, such as celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain's ""Parts Unknown"" series, in addition to covering major breaking news events, such as the missing Malaysian Air plane. Still, CNN continues to lag both Fox News and MSNBC with prime time audiences, according to the latest ratings from Nielsen. CNN averaged 493,000 total viewers during the hours of 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, while Fox News averaged 1.7 million and MSNBC had 621,000. A decade ago, CNN's average total viewers was 802,000 during prime time.CNN's advertising revenue, which is based on the number of viewers watching a show, fell to $319.8 million in 2013 from $327.7 million in 2012, according to data from SNL Kagan.Though the price per subscriber a cable distributor pays CNN to carry the channel climbed to 60 cents per subscriber per month in 2013 from 58 cents in 2012, according to SNL Kagan.

82,"  (Recasts, adding quote from Bewkes)By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK, July 16 Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the ""disciplined determination"" to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component - 40 percent - to win the prize.Murdoch's proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary.A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc  and Amazon.com Inc.""It's a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,"" a person close to the situation said. ""There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does.""Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch's approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox's shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons.""To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,"" the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters.Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate's employees in a videotaped appearance that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer.The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only Time Warner's disastrous takeover of AOL in 2000.In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox's stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main ""currency"" of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table.According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner's 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday. Shares of Fox dropped 6.2 percent to $33.The offer, first reported by The New York Times, was worth  about $80 billion, or $85 a share, when it was made in June.Fox estimates that a combined company, which would have $60 billion in annual revenue, would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, the people familiar with the matter said.Detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal even more potential savings, they said, which may then justify sweetening the offer. Fox said no talks were under way, and it has no desire to go hostile or to bid against itself with a higher offer, the people familiar with the matter said.Either way, a takeover by Fox could win the blessing of many of Time Warner's shareholders, a majority of whom also own Fox's non-voting stock. In addition, Time Warner does not have a staggered board and its bylaws allow as few as 15 percent of shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid.A number of Time Warner shareholders said Twenty-First Century Fox and Murdoch might have to raise the bid to as high as $95 per share from $85 when the bid was made in June to wrap up a merger. Murdoch also would do well to offer more cash upfront, investors said.Time Warner has no controlling shareholder, meaning the company could easily go into play, said Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel LLC, which owns shares in both companies. ""It's going to be tough to say no,"" he said during a conference in New York.Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, said he expects a technology company with more cash than Fox, such as Apple or Amazon, could emerge with a bid.""It's not a dynamic I want to dismiss out of hand. They have a currency, and they understand the value of content,"" he said of the tech companies."" Gamco's funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner and about 10.5 million Fox shares. SEEKING DANCE PARTNERS Fox's overtures are likely to reverberate across the industry, accelerating a wave of consolidation that is already well underway.Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, offered in February to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in stock. Overseas, Fox's 39 percent-owned British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc is negotiating to buy Fox's Sky Italia and its Sky Deutschland subsidiary in a deal that could net Fox as much as $13 billion.As a consequence of the Murdoch bid, ""the urgency to find a dance partner will increase across the sector,"" said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger.U.S. media shares closed higher on the deal, with top gainers including Discovery Communications Inc, up 6.3 percent; Viacom Inc, which rose 3.3 percent; and AMC Networks Inc, ending 4.5 percent higher.Murdoch started thinking about a potential merger with Time Warner as he was separating Twenty-First Century Fox, which mostly consists of media properties, from News Corp, focused on the Wall Street Journal and other publishing assets, people familiar with the company said.The separation, triggered by the British phone-hacking scandal which dragged Murdoch before the British parliament, has in the end positioned Fox to become a powerful consolidator of media properties, people familiar with the matter said.Fox has indicated it would sell Time Warner's CNN cable channel, a direct competitor of Fox News, to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to the people.At least one antitrust expert, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said it was unlikely that any issues that arise would kill a Fox deal for Time Warner.

90,"   By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an audacious offer for Time Warner Inc that if it succeeds would transform the American media landscape and cement the 83-year-old's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.While Time Warner, whose assets include the HBO cable channel and the Warner Bros movie studio, rejected the $80 billion bid, Murdoch is unlikely to abandon the pursuit and has the “disciplined determination” to get the deal done, people close to the situation said. Investors expect he will eventually raise the offer and increase the cash component – 40 percent - to win the prize.Murdoch's proposal, fresh on the heels of his high-profile divorce and a damaging phone-hacking scandal that involved his British tabloids, is aggressively bold even for a media mogul whose ambitions are legendary. A combined Fox-Time Warner would have a massive array of media and sports content and be in a very powerful negotiating position with cable and satellite distributors - some of whom have themselves announced mega-deals and newer ways of getting to consumers, such as online video distributors Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.""It's a chance to put some great programming and content assets under one umbrella,"" a person close to the situation said. ""There are other alternatives, but none of them fit anywhere near as well as this does."" Still, Time Warner pushed back strongly against Murdoch's approach, insisting the offer undervalued the media conglomerate and raising fears about the dominating role that his family would play, another person close to the situation said on Wednesday.    In particular, the board is worried about the future value of Fox's shares, which represented 60 percent of its cash-and-stock proposal. Those fears were magnified by a lack of voting rights, the source said, as that would concentrate too much power in the hands of Murdoch and his sons.""To do a merger of this scale and size where Time Warner shareholders have no insight into the destiny of the company is very troubling,"" the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters. Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes told the conglomerate's employees in a videotaped appearance that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer.The acquisition, if ever completed, would mark the second-largest media deal ever, when debt is included, trailing only the disasterous takeover of Time Warner by AOL in 2000. In the end, a Time Warner deal is likely to hinge on price. The source pointed out that Fox's stock has traded at the highest multiple of its peer group and Time Warner - prior to its 17 percent rally on Wednesday - was trading at the lowest. Time Warner worries that the stock - the main ""currency"" of the deal - may be ripe for a pullback, lowering the value that is currently on the table.According to StarMine SmartEstimates, Fox shares trade at a multiple of about 19.5 times 12-month forward earnings, above the group median of 17.8 and now in line with Time Warner's 19.5 times - a valuation substantially above where the shares closed on Tuesday.Shares of Fox dropped 6.2 percent to $33. The offer, first reported by The New York Times, was worth  about $80 billion, or $85 a share, when it was made in June.Fox estimates that a combined company, which would have $60 billion in annual revenue, would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, the people familiar with the matter said.    Detailed negotiations with Time Warner could reveal even more potential savings, they said, which may then justify sweetening the offer.Fox said no talks were under way, and it has no desire to go hostile or to bid against itself with a higher offer, the people familiar with the matter said.Either way, a takeover by Fox could win the blessing of many of Time Warner's shareholders, a majority of whom also own Fox's non-voting stock. In addition, Time Warner does not have a staggered board and its bylaws allow as few as 15 percent of shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid.A number of Time Warner shareholders said Twenty-First Century Fox and Murdoch might have to raise the bid to as high as $95 per share from $85 when the bid was made in June to wrap up a merger. Murdoch also would do well to offer more cash upfront, investors said.Time Warner has no controlling shareholder, meaning the company could easily go into play, said Ken Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel LLC, which owns shares in both companies. “It’s going to be tough to say no,” he said during a conference in New York. Mario Gabelli, chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors, said he expects a technology company with more cash than Fox, such as Apple or Amazon, could emerge with a bid. “It’s not a dynamic I want to dismiss out of hand. They have a currency, and they understand the value of content,” he said of the tech companies."" Gamco's funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner and about 10.5 million Fox shares.   SEEKING DANCE PARTNERS     Fox's overtures are likely to reverberate across the industry, accelerating a wave of consolidation that is already well underway. Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider, offered in February to buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in stock. Overseas, Fox's 39 percent-owned British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc is negotiating to buy Fox's Sky Italia and its Sky Deutschland subsidiary in a deal that could net Fox as much as $13 billion. As a consequence of the Murdoch bid, ""the urgency to find a dance partner will increase across the sector,"" said Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger. U.S. media shares closed higher on the deal, with top gainers including Discovery Communications Inc, up 6.3 percent; Viacom Inc, which rose 3.3 percent; and AMC Networks Inc, ending 4.5 percent higher.Murdoch started thinking about a potential merger with Time Warner as he was separating Twenty-First Century Fox, which mostly consists of media properties, from News Corp, focused on the Wall Street Journal and other publishing assets, people familiar with the company said. The separation, triggered by the British phone-hacking scandal which dragged Murdoch before the British parliament, has in the end positioned Fox to become a powerful consolidator of media properties, people familiar with the matter said. Fox has indicated it would sell Time Warner's CNN cable channel, a direct competitor of Fox News, to clear any regulatory hurdles, according to the people.At least one antitrust expert, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said it was unlikely that any issues that arise would kill a Fox deal for Time Warner. The source pointed out that there were five major content companies in the United States, plus numerous smaller ones.News of the Time Warner bid comes as Fox is reorganizing its television business, aiming to lift its network out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters.Fox is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners, while Time Warner is working with Citigroup, people familiar with the matter said. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs would lead any financing required for the bid.Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is providing legal advice to Fox, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore is legal adviser to Time Warner.

92,"   By Ronald Grover  and Diane Bartz  Twenty-First Century Fox's plan to buy Time Warner could create an upheaval in the sports television world, creating the first meaningful challenge to Walt Disney Co's ESPN.Time Warner's board has rejected an $80 billion bid, but Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch is unlikely to walk away quickly. A deal would bring him college basketball's ""March Madness"" championship tournament, prime time National Basketball Association (NBA) games, and Major League Baseball (MLB) games.Fox's sports rights include National Football League games, professional baseball games and NASCAR racing. In 2015 it gets the rights to women's World Cup soccer and in 2018 the men's World Cup.Disney's ESPN, with Monday Night Football, Major League Baseball games, NBA games and college football, will still be the team to beat, but for once there might be a match. ""You start to put it all together and you create a significant competitor to ESPN for ratings and advertising dollars,” said Marc Ganis, a sports TV consultant. In an age of DVRs and on demand viewing, sports stands out for its ability to draw television audiences which are large and watch live, two traits crucial for selling advertising, says Ed Desser, a former president of NBA Television and New Media Ventures, who advises teams and league's on their TV contracts.""It's TV's growth engine,"" he says. ""It drives subscriber fees and keeps people watching.""Ganis speculates that some key Time Warner sports, such as its professional basketball doubleheaders, could move from TNT to Fox Sports 1. Fox Sports 1 already airs major league baseball, motor sports, mixed marital arts and college football and basketball games from the larger conferences. The additions could allow Fox Sports 1, now in about 90 million homes, to add subscribers and raise the affiliate fees from cable and satellite operators that make up the majority of its revenues.ESPN is in more than 100 million homes, not too far ahead of Fox.However, ESPN currently can charge cable companies $6.04 per month for each subscriber, according to data compiled by consultant SNL Kagan. By comparison, Fox Sports 1 is paid 68 cents for each of its subscribers. Thanks in part to its National Basketball Association games, TNT gets $1.48 per subscriber.  SPREADING THE COSTS Murdoch could also use Time Warner's collection of channels to outbid competitors for key sporting events, spreading the costs among its Fox network and cable channels, said Derek Baine, Research Director at SNL Kagan.""One of the things driving this deal is that Fox will be more aggressively bidding on sports rights, so this will give them more fire power,"" Baine said in an email. ""Like NBCU with the Olympics, they can spread games across multiple networks."" Combining the two would also eliminate a major buyer of sports programming, which may raise concerns at the U.S. Justice Department when it reviews a deal, said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School.Carstensen says the review may focus on specific parts of the content business -- movies, sports, news -- rather than a new company's entire offering of content.""My guess is that enforcers are less likely to be concerned by the overall programming,"" he said. ""If you're not going to take the general market view, you may have to divest some sports programming.""Fox also will have to convince sports leagues or conferences to alter existing contracts to shift around the sports, said Desser. Contracts usually tightly prescribe where games can be shown, and leagues are loath to change them for fear of upsetting other TV rights holders.Fox already airs NBA games on many of its 22 regional sports cable channels, he says.""But anything is possible, and deals get rewritten,"" he said. ""Sports are such a pure growth engine that they may try.""

Murdoch offered about $85 a share when the bid was made in June.""Rupert has got to figure out a way to get more cash in the deal,"" said Mario Gabelli, Chairman and CEO of Gamco Investors .Gamco's funds own about 3.6 million shares of Time Warner. Like many other shareholders, Gamco also owns stock in Murdoch's company -- about 10.5 million shares -- and Gabelli said some of his own investors are not eager to increase the number of those shares as part of a merger.Another executive at one of Time Warner's large institutional shareholders also said he would look for Murdoch to offer a higher ratio of cash to firm up the value of the deal. Prospects for gains in Fox stock in the near term could be constrained by the difficulties of merging the two businesses, including wringing out cost savings, and the effect of the likely debt burden Fox assume after borrowing billions of dollars. ""Cash is cash, so you know exactly what the value is,"" this person said.Even though this executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of company policy, said he thought the overall value of the proposed deal was fair, Murdoch can still raise his bid.""It's a corporate poker game for sure, and Murdoch never plays his best card first.

Twenty-First Century Fox shares fell 6 percent to $33.Time Warner said the strength of its own strategy and ""significant risk and uncertainty as to the valuation"" of Fox's stock were reasons for rejecting the bid. It also noted the stock did not have voting rights, a type of share that typically trades at a discount.A Time Warner spokesman declined further comment. A spokesman for Twenty-First Century Fox declined to comment.

98,"   By Soyoung Kim and David Gaffen | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Many investors say the best trading strategy around a potential takeover of Time Warner Inc by Twenty-First Century Fox is to wager that media baron Rupert Murdoch will pay up to get what he wants. The trick is that it may be too late to place the obvious bets.Time Warner said on Wednesday it had rebuffed Twenty-First Century Fox's roughly $80 billion bid, or $85 per share, in recent weeks over valuation and concerns that the Murdoch family will have too much power. But people familiar with Twenty-First Century Fox said Murdoch is determined to buy the rival media giant.Hedge fund traders and options strategists said the traditional merger arbitrage trade - short Twenty-First Century Fox and buy Time Warner - played out when the news broke.Arbitrageurs seek to profit on the difference in stock prices between an acquirer and the target. In a deal that involves the swap of stock, that generally involves buying the target's shares and betting the acquirer's will fall. Murdoch made a stock and cash offer for Time Warner.But these traders said that the time for that bet may have passed. Time Warner's stock has risen 21 percent to $86.12, since the news broke. Twenty-First Century Fox has fallen nearly 7 percent.""Fox shares will spike higher if this deal is killed or if Time Warner bids for something,"" making a defensive acquisition, one arbitrageur said. ""Time Warner will also remain range-bound, unless there is a higher bid or it does something that destroys the process, or something to buy another company.""So investors who missed that window must now make bolder bets if they still want in on the trade.  Sources have said that Twenty-First Century Fox could see more than $1 billion in synergies from a deal.One hedge fund manager said in his reckoning synergies from the deal could be as high as $1.5 billion, which would allow Twenty-First Century Fox to pay as much as $95 per share to $100 per share and still have a deal be substantially accretive to 2016 earnings. The hedge fund manager said many arbitrageurs are remaining long in shares of Time Warner, given Murdoch's reputation as a tenacious dealmaker. Murdoch, for example, overcame stiff resistance from some members of the Bancroft family to buy Dow Jones in 2007. But he did not raise his bid at the time. ""The key right now for me is, 'What is my downside?'"" said one hedge fund trader. ""The price on the table is not the right price. It's not going to get it done."" The trader said he owns a relatively small position in Time Warner and is evaluating how -- and whether -- to place a bigger bet.AN OPTION  One way to put less money on the line while betting that Twenty-First Century Fox will raise its bid is to buy Time Warner stock options. Activity in the options market already shows investors are optimistic that either a bidding war could occur or Murdoch could end up raising his initial offer.  There was substantial activity in Time Warner call options expiring in mid-August with a $90 strike price - bullish bets that the stock will hit that level by that expiration. ""For you to buy an August $90, you have to believe there's a higher bid in the next month here or an increased bid by him,"" said William Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at vFinance Investments.There were also notable new positions taken in call options expiring in mid-October at the $95 and $100 strike prices, which also suggests a belief that shares will keep rising. Nearly 2,000 new contracts were purchased at the $100 strike price for October, according to Thomson Reuters data.But the bid-ask spread in August options contracts is at a very wide range – between 40 and 60 cents for a number of contracts. That makes it more expensive to make such a bet. The better bet may be in the stock market, which has tighter spreads. Arbitrageurs will usually play in the market with tighter spreads because of efficiency, said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.  WHITHER HEDGES? There are few other options at the moment to arbitrage this deal, traders said.In a sign that investors think Fox shares have fallen as much as they will, short interest is muted.As of Wednesday, short interest in Twenty-First Century Fox was around 2.8 percent of the outstanding shares, a relatively low amount, according to data firm Markit. The credit default swaps market, another avenue to hedge or bet on the trade, may not work out either, one arbitrageur said. ""These names are great credits, so even if Fox levers up to do a deal, it won't widen much. I doubt there's much to be done in CDS on this one,"" the arbitrageur said. Twenty-First Century Fox's 5-year CDS price jumped about 20 percent Wednesday to their highest since February, but they moved no further on Thursday and remain relatively low. Time Warner's dropped nearly 6 percent.

99,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rupert Murdoch looks to have been canny in his $80 billion takeover approach to Time Warner Inc, cornering the media giant at a time when potential ""white knight"" bidders are busy absorbing their own large deals.The absence of potential counter-bidders leaves Time Warner's investors with a dilemma. They can either engage with Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to negotiate a higher price, or play for time and wait until there are more potential buyers available. Time Warner, owner of many highly-prized assets from  HBO to Warner Bros, has rejected Fox's initial cash-and-stock proposal of $85 per share. An eventual deal would transform the U.S. media landscape and cement Murdoch's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.When Time Warner's board rebuffed the approach it indicated it believes now is the wrong time to sell because the environment isn't conducive to getting the best price, people familiar with Time Warner's thinking said on Wednesday. That is mainly because a range of major media, telecom and technology companies are for various reasons not in a position to make a rival offer. Verizon Communications Inc, which last year paid $130 billion to buy Vodafone out of its U.S. wireless business Verizon Wireless, is hampered by the $140 billion debt load that it took on as a result.Comcast Corp, which completed the acquisition of NBC Universal last year, has its hands tied while waiting for the government to approve its proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable. Bidding for Time Warner while that is going on could scuttle the chances of getting the cable deal approved.Elsewhere, AT&T Inc, another large telecom company that hardly produces any programming, is trying to close its $48.5 billion takeover of satellite TV company DirecTV, which is also awaiting regulatory approval.As the media industry landscape evolves, technology companies such as Google, Apple or Amazon could also be tempted into bidding for Time Warner as opposed to trying to produce video content on their own, people familiar with Time Warner's thinking said.  Time Warner shareholder Mario Gabelli told Reuters Insider TV on Wednesday that he thought both Google and Apple were possible bidders. But for now, Google's investment in content is focused on its YouTube unit while Amazon has spent money on original TV shows for its online video service. Apple's media bets have so far been on music, illustrated by its purchase of Beats Music in May for $3 billion. ""If I were Time Warner, I would wait. A year or two from now, they will have competition for the assets actually,"" said an industry banker who is not involved either with Time Warner or Fox.""The only downside of waiting is if you believe that multiples are going to contract in the next year or two.

100,"  (Adds Breakingviews, How To Play It links)By Liana B. BakerNEW YORK, July 18 Rupert Murdoch looks to have been canny in his $80 billion takeover approach to Time Warner Inc, cornering the media giant at a time when potential ""white knight"" bidders are busy absorbing their own large deals.The absence of potential counter-bidders leaves Time Warner's investors with a dilemma. They can either engage with Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to negotiate a higher price, or play for time and wait until there are more potential buyers available.Time Warner, owner of many highly-prized assets from  HBO to Warner Bros, has rejected Fox's initial cash-and-stock proposal of $85 per share. An eventual deal would transform the U.S. media landscape and cement Murdoch's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.When Time Warner's board rebuffed the approach it indicated it believes now is the wrong time to sell because the environment isn't conducive to getting the best price, people familiar with Time Warner's thinking said on Wednesday. That is mainly because a range of major media, telecom and technology companies are for various reasons not in a position to make a rival offer.Verizon Communications Inc, which last year paid $130 billion to buy Vodafone out of its U.S. wireless business Verizon Wireless, is hampered by the $140 billion debt load that it took on as a result.Comcast Corp, which completed the acquisition of NBC Universal last year, has its hands tied while waiting for the government to approve its proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable. Bidding for Time Warner while that is going on could scuttle the chances of getting the cable deal approved.Elsewhere, AT&T Inc, another large telecom company that hardly produces any programming, is trying to close its $48.5 billion takeover of satellite TV company DirecTV, which is also awaiting regulatory approval. As the media industry landscape evolves, technology companies such as Google, Apple or Amazon could also be tempted into bidding for Time Warner as opposed to trying to produce video content on their own, people familiar with Time Warner's thinking said.Time Warner shareholder Mario Gabelli told Reuters Insider TV on Wednesday that he thought both Google and Apple were possible bidders. But for now, Google's investment in content is focused on its YouTube unit while Amazon has spent money on original TV shows for its online video service. Apple's media bets have so far been on music, illustrated by its purchase of Beats Music in May for $3 billion.""If I were Time Warner, I would wait. A year or two from now, they will have competition for the assets actually,"" said an industry banker who is not involved either with Time Warner or Fox.""The only downside of waiting is if you believe that multiples are going to contract in the next year or two.

101,"  (Adds Breakingviews, Dealtalk links)By Soyoung Kim and David GaffenNEW YORK, July 18 Many investors say the best trading strategy around a potential takeover of Time Warner Inc  by Twenty-First Century Fox is to wager that media baron Rupert Murdoch will pay up to get what he wants. The trick is that it may be too late to place the obvious bets.Time Warner said on Wednesday it had rebuffed Twenty-First Century Fox's roughly $80 billion bid, or $85 per share, in recent weeks over valuation and concerns that the Murdoch family will have too much power. But people familiar with Twenty-First Century Fox said Murdoch is determined to buy the rival media giant.Hedge fund traders and options strategists said the traditional merger arbitrage trade - short Twenty-First Century Fox and buy Time Warner - played out when the news broke.Arbitrageurs seek to profit on the difference in stock prices between an acquirer and the target. In a deal that involves the swap of stock, that generally involves buying the target's shares and betting the acquirer's will fall. Murdoch made a stock and cash offer for Time Warner.But these traders said that the time for that bet may have passed. Time Warner's stock has risen 21 percent to $86.12, since the news broke. Twenty-First Century Fox has fallen nearly 7 percent.""Fox shares will spike higher if this deal is killed or if Time Warner bids for something,"" making a defensive acquisition, one arbitrageur said. ""Time Warner will also remain range-bound, unless there is a higher bid or it does something that destroys the process, or something to buy another company.""So investors who missed that window must now make bolder bets if they still want in on the trade.Sources have said that Twenty-First Century Fox could see more than $1 billion in synergies from a deal. One hedge fund manager said in his reckoning synergies from the deal could be as high as $1.5 billion, which would allow Twenty-First Century Fox to pay as much as $95 per share to $100 per share and still have a deal be substantially accretive to 2016 earnings.The hedge fund manager said many arbitrageurs are remaining long in shares of Time Warner, given Murdoch's reputation as a tenacious dealmaker.Murdoch, for example, overcame stiff resistance from some members of the Bancroft family to buy Dow Jones in 2007. But he did not raise his bid at the time.""The key right now for me is, 'What is my downside?'"" said one hedge fund trader. ""The price on the table is not the right price. It's not going to get it done."" The trader said he owns a relatively small position in Time Warner and is evaluating how -- and whether -- to place a bigger bet.AN OPTION  One way to put less money on the line while betting that Twenty-First Century Fox will raise its bid is to buy Time Warner stock options. Activity in the options market already shows investors are optimistic that either a bidding war could occur or Murdoch could end up raising his initial offer.There was substantial activity in Time Warner call options expiring in mid-August with a $90 strike price - bullish bets that the stock will hit that level by that expiration.""For you to buy an August $90, you have to believe there's a higher bid in the next month here or an increased bid by him,"" said William Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at vFinance Investments.There were also notable new positions taken in call options expiring in mid-October at the $95 and $100 strike prices, which also suggests a belief that shares will keep rising. Nearly 2,000 new contracts were purchased at the $100 strike price for October, according to Thomson Reuters data.But the bid-ask spread in August options contracts is at a very wide range - between 40 and 60 cents for a number of contracts. That makes it more expensive to make such a bet. The better bet may be in the stock market, which has tighter spreads. Arbitrageurs will usually play in the market with tighter spreads because of efficiency, said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.WHITHER HEDGES? There are few other options at the moment to arbitrage this deal, traders said.In a sign that investors think Fox shares have fallen as much as they will, short interest is muted.As of Wednesday, short interest in Twenty-First Century Fox was around 2.8 percent of the outstanding shares, a relatively low amount, according to data firm Markit.The credit default swaps market, another avenue to hedge or bet on the trade, may not work out either, one arbitrageur said.""These names are great credits, so even if Fox levers up to do a deal, it won't widen much. I doubt there's much to be done in CDS on this one,"" the arbitrageur said.Twenty-First Century Fox's 5-year CDS price jumped about 20 percent Wednesday to their highest since February, but they moved no further on Thursday and remain relatively low. Time Warner's dropped nearly 6 percent.(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins, Jennifer Ablan and Daniel Burns; Writing by Paritosh Bansal, editing by Peter Henderson)",2014-07-18,TWX,"Fri Jul 18, 2014 | 5:12pm EDT",UPDATE 1-HOW TO PLAY IT-Murdoch's tenacity is the trade in Time Warner-Fox face-off,http://www.reuters.com//article/time-warner-fox-trading-idUSL2N0PT2DL20140718?type=companyNews

The hedge fund manager said many arbitrageurs are remaining long in shares of Time Warner, given Murdoch's reputation as a tenacious dealmaker.Murdoch, for example, overcame stiff resistance from some members of the Bancroft family to buy Dow Jones in 2007. But he did not raise his bid at the time.""The key right now for me is, 'What is my downside?'"" said one hedge fund trader. ""The price on the table is not the right price. It's not going to get it done."" The trader said he owns a relatively small position in Time Warner and is evaluating how -- and whether -- to place a bigger bet.AN OPTION  One way to put less money on the line while betting that Twenty-First Century Fox will raise its bid is to buy Time Warner stock options. Activity in the options market already shows investors are optimistic that either a bidding war could occur or Murdoch could end up raising his initial offer.There was substantial activity in Time Warner call options expiring in mid-August with a $90 strike price - bullish bets that the stock will hit that level by that expiration.""For you to buy an August $90, you have to believe there's a higher bid in the next month here or an increased bid by him,"" said William Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at vFinance Investments.There were also notable new positions taken in call options expiring in mid-October at the $95 and $100 strike prices, which also suggests a belief that shares will keep rising. Nearly 2,000 new contracts were purchased at the $100 strike price for October, according to Thomson Reuters data.But the bid-ask spread in August options contracts is at a very wide range - between 40 and 60 cents for a number of contracts. That makes it more expensive to make such a bet. The better bet may be in the stock market, which has tighter spreads. Arbitrageurs will usually play in the market with tighter spreads because of efficiency, said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.WHITHER HEDGES? There are few other options at the moment to arbitrage this deal, traders said.In a sign that investors think Fox shares have fallen as much as they will, short interest is muted.As of Wednesday, short interest in Twenty-First Century Fox was around 2.8 percent of the outstanding shares, a relatively low amount, according to data firm Markit.The credit default swaps market, another avenue to hedge or bet on the trade, may not work out either, one arbitrageur said.""These names are great credits, so even if Fox levers up to do a deal, it won't widen much. I doubt there's much to be done in CDS on this one,"" the arbitrageur said.Twenty-First Century Fox's 5-year CDS price jumped about 20 percent Wednesday to their highest since February, but they moved no further on Thursday and remain relatively low. Time Warner's dropped nearly 6 percent.

108,"  Time Warner Inc's board moved to prevent its shareholders from calling special meetings, effectively throwing up a hurdle to any quick move to approve a potential takeover by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox.  Fox made an offer for Time Warner for about $80 billion or about $85 per share in a mix of stock and cash that Time Warner rebuffed, both companies disclosed last week. Time Warner previously allowed as few as 15 percent of its shareholders to call a special meeting, factors that could help a takeover bid. The move, revealed in a regulatory filing on Monday, was not preempted by any particular investor buying large amounts of Time Warner shares but rather to give the board the ability to defend itself from an unsolicited bid, two sources close to the matter said.The sources said the board believed the move was in the best interests of all its shareholders. ""When you are facing a hostile bid, you don't want to give the bidder the ability to artificially preempt that process,"" one of the sources said. The amended bylaw is temporary, however, as the board said it plans to reinstate the special meeting provision during its 2015 annual meeting, according to the filing.     Similar moves have been taken by other takeover targets in recent years, including Airgas Inc, which eventually implemented a poison pill that blocked a $5.9 billion hostile bid from Air Products and Chemicals Inc. The sources, who declined to identified because the discussions are private, would not speculate whether Time Warner's board would also put a poison pill in place.    A spokesman for Time Warner, which owns cable networks TNT and CNN, pay-TV channel HBO and Warner Bros movie studio, declined to comment.Time Warner Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes told his employees in video that the company's standalone strategic plan would create value ""superior to any proposal"" that Fox could offer. Part of the issue involves the mix of cash and stock and lack of control of Time Warner's shareholders if a deal should go through, sources told Reuters last week. Murdoch controls Fox through a 39 percent stake in special shares that were not part of the offer. Fox offered 60 percent in common stock and 40 percent cash.Several Time Warner shareholders told Reuters last week that Fox may have to raise the bid to as much as $95 a share boosting its cash component to seal a merger.

111,"   By Ronald Grover  Rupert Murdoch's plan to buy Time Warner would help the Twenty-First Century Fox chairman make larger inroads in China, a fast-growing market that media moguls are finding hard to crack.Time Warner's board rejected Murdoch's $80 billion offer, but the Fox chairman is expected to continue the chase. A deal would create a giant with more than $37 billion a year in revenues in the United States and Canada. It would also nearly double the revenues Fox generates from the emerging media markets in Latin America and Asia/Pacific.""He sees 3 billion new consumers coming into the market and a rising middle class in China and India, and mobile devices and strong demand for content,"" said Mario Gabelli, the CEO of GAMCO Investors, in an interview with Reuters Insider, ""He's going to be able to create Netflixes of his own.""Gabelli owns shares of both Fox and Time Warner.Last year, Fox generated 42 percent of its revenue outside the United States and Canada. The company's Asian revenues, including those in Japan and China, grew by 40 percent, to $2.1 billion, over two years.Time Warner's collection of cable channels would complement Fox's programming in key territories. In Latin America, where Fox faces off against large local players, Time Warner's Turner unit operates Chilevision, a large broadcaster in Chile, and also shows its TNT entertainment channel, Cartoon Network and locally tailored regional channels such as the kids channel Tooncast.    Turner offers three well-regarded channels in India, POGO, Cartoonito and Toonami, which could help Murdoch's Indian programming behemoth Star India, which broadcasts 44 channels in seven languages.HBO would likely be Fox's big draw in foreign markets. The pay channel, with a history of hit programs such as ""The Sopranos,"" has around 84 million subscribers outside the United States, beaming its shows into more than 70 countries, and sells programming from HBO and Cinemax into 150 countries.  In China, with Time Warner in the fold, Murdoch would be able to focus more squarely on profiting from what movies and TV shows the government allows. In January, he sold Fox's 47 percent stake in Star China TV, which owns three 24-hour Mandarin channels, and in October sold off Fox's remaining stake in Chinese TV company Phoenix Satellite Television. These move come in the face of restrictions on foreign ownership of China media assets.""Murdoch is not unique. The Chinese government says, 'We cannot let these people control our media,'"" said William Yu, an economist at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, who focuses on emerging Asian economies. A Fox spokesman had no comment. In recent earnings calls and conferences, Fox President Chase Carey has stressed the company's strategy of selling off assets it couldn't own.""Long term, I still think that you ultimately want to either own and operate or monetize,"" he said at a UBS media conference in December. Doug Young, a professor at Fudan University Journalism School, cautioned against overestimating the potential in China. ""Taking two studios and combining, you’ll get a company with twice as many growth prospects in China, but in terms of either having many assets in China, it’s just a market for licensing and selling,"" he said.Still, the China potential is alluring. Consulting and audit firm EY estimates revenue from China's media and entertainment industry will reach $138 billion by 2015, from $59 billion in 2010. The country already has embraced streaming video and EY sees advertising revenue jumping.Its mobile web users, the most in the world, are expected to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.Currently, China limits to 34 the total number of movies foreign companies can import. China's box office last year grew 27 percent, to $3.6 billion, second only to the $10.9 billion million U.S. market. ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" a movie distributed by Viacom's Paramount studio, has so far sold more tickets in China than the United States. With its muscular films such as the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy franchises, Time Warner's Warner Brothers studio gets frequent quota approval. ""China is a great market and we've all wanted to be there for years,"" said former Viacom president Frank Biondi, one of the first U.S. media executives to visit the country. ""But for all the upside, there's the obvious downside that the government controls everything - what gets put into movie theaters, what's put on TV.""A merger would allow Murdoch to use the Warner Brothers studio to claim more quota slots. In 2013, seven Warner Brothers films were granted a release in Chinese theaters, and six for Fox, according to Box Office Mojo. Fox's Hollywood studio last year produced 14 movies, to Warner Brothers' 25 films. Fox has also agreed to co-produce five Chinese language films with Chinese studio Bona Film Group.Warner's movies generated $155.9 million from three of its films that ranked in China's top 20 last year, including ""Gravity"" and ""Man of Steel."" Fox's three films in the top 20, including ""The Wolverine,"" generated $80 million, according to Box Office Mojo. A few of Time Warner's Cartoon Network shows appear on the state-owned China Central Television, and its HBO pay channel provides a five-hour block of programming as well. HBO's offering included a censored version of its fantasy hit ""Game of Thrones"". ""It's a huge opportunity,"" said former Paramount President Sid Ganis, whose Jiaflix company advises movie companies in China, ""and media companies are only now beginning to figure the market out.""(This version of the story says complement instead of compliment in paragraph 7.)

112,"  (Corrects name in para 25 to Sullivan from Williams)* BSkyB in talks to buy Fox's German and Italian units* Italian business hit by macro economic pressure* German market constrained by strong free offering* Analysts put price between 7-10 bln eurosBy Kate Holton, Danilo Masoni and Harro Ten WoldeLONDON/MILAN/FRANKFURT, July 18 BSkyB's  plan to buy Rupert Murdoch's pay-TV assets in Italy and Germany for perhaps as much as 10 billion euros is a bold bet on long-term growth at the expense of short-term profit, but the pioneering British media firm has pulled off such gambles before.Facing the toughest market conditions in its 25-year history, BSkyB has opened talks with Murdoch's 21st Century Fox  to acquire Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia to create a European powerhouse with 20 million subscribers.BSkyB, also 39 percent-owned by the Australian-born media mogul, has set the standard in Britain for technological innovation such as its award-winning Sky+ set-top box, streaming TV app and Europe's first 3D channel.Having seen off a string of challengers to dominate the British pay-TV market, BSkyB, which is in more than 10 million homes in Britain and Ireland, is now betting that the time is right to enter two European markets where pay-TV is not yet as popular or profitable.""The asset is too good and the opportunity is too big to ignore it,"" one top 10 shareholder in BSkyB told Reuters on condition of anonymity, adding that they would view the deal positively as long as they could agree reasonable terms.Analysts have put the likely price at between 7 billion and 10 billion euros. Sources familiar with the deal have told Reuters the talks are progressing well but that there are still many areas they need to find agreement on.BSkyB, which declined to comment, has history in making expensive but ultimately winning gambles.Back in 2006, it set out plans to offer broadband for free, spooking analysts and investors who feared the gamble would be costly, but the strategy paid off by luring new customers who took its other subscription services. It also led the way in investing in high definition programming, which also proved extremely popular, boosting the amount customers paid each month.Analysts and investors are divided over whether the new deal is aimed at creating scale so it can better compete with new online challengers such as Netflix or is more a reflection of Sky's saturated home market, which is forcing it to look overseas to find growth. Many see the hand of Murdoch behind the deal since it would give Fox billions of euros in cash at a time when the 83-year old mogul is looking to expand in content.Fox revealed on Wednesday it had tried and so far failed to buy media conglomerate Time Warner Inc, with a source putting the price at roughly $80 billion.A separate source close to the Sky talks said they did not expect Murdoch to raise his holding in BSkyB, which would be contentious in Britain, where rivals and some politicians believe he controls too much of the media.APPEALING TO THE MASSES BSkyB, which is facing a new challenge at home from telecoms group BT, which is aggressively bidding for content and customers, would expand its potential market to 95 million households by moving into Italy and Germany.A larger group would be able to better absorb higher programming costs, co-produce content and be well placed to buy broadcasting rights on a pan-European basis if that ever replaces the current country-by-country basis. It could also save some costs on procurement and back-office functions, while generating increased revenue by rolling out services into Italy and Germany that have sold well in Britain, such as targeted advertising and betting services.Analysts however are divided over the potential cost and revenue synergies for the deal, with Berenberg struggling to see meaningful savings, while UBS forecasts synergies of up to 380 million pounds per year.""This is not a massive synergy story,"" Berenberg analyst Sarah Simon said. ""It's more about accessing higher growth because these are markets with low penetration.""However, it could take a while for the benefits of creating a so-called Sky Europe to pay off, as the risks of entering Germany and Italy are not inconsequential.Sky Italia, 100 percent owned by Fox, is Italy's biggest pay-TV operator in a market where those willing to pay for TV  has slumped during the downturn, to 34 percent of households in 2013 from almost 40 percent just four years earlier, according to Bernstein Research.With its 4.75 million subscribers unable to provide much revenue growth, Sky Italia has kept a tight lid on costs.Against that background it did well in late June to win exclusive rights to more Serie A soccer matches at roughly the same price as before, but it has lost the Champions League matches to rival Mediaset Premium, owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's TV group Mediaset. GERMAN QUESTIONS In Germany, the market is less constrained by economic pressures than by long-established habit.According to industry research, less than 20 percent of German households pay for television, well below the 54 percent in Britain, due in part to the strong position of German free-to-air TV.While the Sky Deutschland business is growing strongly in terms of customer additions and revenue, due to the appeal of its soccer programming, it has not made an operating profit in recent years and is only expected to turn positive next year, according to Reuters data.BSkyB is unlikely to radically change the way the business is run - Sky Deutschland's CEO Brian Sullivan spent 13 years at BSkyB - but the timing of the deal in terms of its recovery and growth profile could be good for the British firm.A large factor in whether BSkyB shareholders will back the deal will be whether it acquires all of Sky Deutschland or just the 57 percent owned by Fox. Under German takeover rules a deal for the Fox stake would trigger a mandatory offer for the rest.That in turn would affect how much BSkyB would need to pay, and whether it would need to issue equity or pay for the deal with debt and cash. On Thursday it said it had sold a 6.4 percent stake in British broadcaster ITV for 481 million pounds to cable group Liberty Global.That move by Liberty, which is in 12 European countries and has recently invested in a small content producer, also shows why the Sky assets may need to join forces in the region if they are going to be competing against ever larger groups.If the price is between 7 billion and 10 billion euros, BSkyB's net debt could rise to more than three times its core earnings from the current level of around one. That in turn could force it to temper its share buyback and dividend programmes.Analysts at Nomura warned that that could also leave BSkyB vulnerable in its fight with BT when it comes to bidding for Premier League soccer rights.The two, which spent more than 3 billion pounds in 2012 to share the rights for three years, are likely to go head to head again in the auction for the three seasons beginning with the 2016/17 campaign.Were BSkyB to push ahead with the European deal, it would need to strike the right balance between investing in Britain to ward off BT while growing its two new assets in Europe.""BSkyB has always been a company with a great history of innovation and bold risk taking,"" Numis analyst Paul Richards said. ""The challenges within the two assets are both a drawback and an opportunity.""

113,"   By Eric Kelsey | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The Los Angeles Clippers could face an exodus of players, sponsors, fans and their coach if embattled owner Donald Sterling is still associated with the team, Richard Parsons, the franchise's interim chief executive, said on Tuesday at a trial over the NBA team's $2 billion sale.Parsons, the former Time Warner CEO who was installed by the NBA to run the Clippers in May, testified that the team would likely lose profitability and its overall value if sponsors, one of its top revenue streams, leave because of Sterling.""We have a bunch of sponsors who are sitting at the edge of the pool and they don't want to go into the water,"" Parsons told Los Angeles Superior Court a day after failed settlement talks between Sterling, 80, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who won the bidding for the team. The real estate billionaire has been banned for life by the NBA for taped racist remarks that were made public. He has vowed to block the NBA-record sale that his estranged wife brokered with Ballmer because of the way the league treated him, his lawyers said.Also on Tuesday, Sterling filed a lawsuit against his wife Shelly Sterling, the NBA, its commissioner Adam Silver and the corporation that owns the Clippers, alleging that all the shares of the team belong to him after he revoked his family trust.Parsons testified it was imperative that a new owner be in place before the start of the season in October or it could throw the team into a ""death spiral."" ""If none of your sponsors want to sponsor, if the coach doesn't want to coach and if the players don't want to play for you, what do you got?"" Parsons said.Parsons testified that head coach Doc Rivers told him he did not believe he could coach the team if Sterling remained as owner.Shelly Sterling, 79, has asked a probate court to confirm her as having sole authority to sell the Clippers after physicians said her husband has early Alzheimer's disease and could not handle business affairs, which would hand her control of the team according to terms of the family trust. Sterling contends he could get $2.5 million to $5 billion for the Clippers because of booming sports media rights.Parsons said he believed Ballmer paid above-market value for the Clippers, calling it a ""knock-out price.""""There is no way you can get to this price on any metric basis,"" Parsons said. ""It's like buying a Faberge egg."" The NBA has said it could confiscate the Clippers and put the franchise up for auction if the sale is not approved by Sept. 15.Anwar Zakkour, an investment banker with Bank of America who helped facilitate the sale, testified that Ballmer's $2 billion bid outpaced their most generous projections of $1.8 billion.""None of us believed we would get $2 billion when we started,"" Zakkour said, adding he valued the team between $1 billion and $1.3 billion.

114,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 24 (Fitch) Significant widening in Twenty-First Century Fox,  Inc.'s (FOX) five-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads is likely in reaction  to news that the media giant had made an offer to buy Time Warner Inc.,  according to Fitch Solutions.  CDS on FOX have widened 50% since July 4, compared to just 3% widening observed  for Fitch Solutions' North America Media CDS Index over the same time period.   Additionally, CDS liquidity for FOX has increased notably over the past few  weeks, and is currently trading in the 15th regional percentile, up nine  rankings since July 8. Increased CDS liquidity reflects higher levels of market  uncertainty over the future direction of spreads for the media giant.  Time Warner has reportedly turned down an $80 billion acquisition offer from  FOX. The offer was at about a 25% premium of the stock price a day prior. If  formed, the combined company would be valued at roughly $150 billion and would  form one of the largest media firms globally.  We believe the deal makes strategic sense for both companies. FOX would benefit  from the acquisition by adding more leverage in deal-making with cable  companies, expand its rights to broadcast sporting events, while Time Warner  would add to its already impressive Hollywood studio. Rating concerns for Time Warner, apart from M&A activity, center on the  company's ability to balance escalating programming expenses and production  costs with the requirement to consistently deliver programming that drives  incremental viewer share while maintaining or expanding operating margins. Time  Warner's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'BBB+' and the Rating Outlook is Stable.  For FOX, exposure to cyclical advertising revenues within the company's local  television and Fox Network ad sales highlights rating concerns, as does the  company's capacity to adapt to ever-changing media consumption patterns and  technology platforms. FOX's IDR is currently 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook.

115,"   By Ronald Grover , Jennifer Saba and Liana B. Baker | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Chase Carey, Twenty-First Century Fox's president and chief operating officer, may be feeling pressure to stay in his job for several more years both from his boss, Rupert Murdoch, and from the company Murdoch is trying to buy, Time Warner Inc.As Murdoch mulls his next step following Time Warner’s rejection of his $80 billion offer, some Time Warner investors say they are concerned about who might succeed the 83-year-old chairman and chief executive.

117,"   By Liana B. Baker, Jennifer Saba and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK If Twenty-First Century Fox succeeds in buying Time Warner Inc, it's likely to sell CNN and pay billions of dollars in taxes rather than go through the headaches of spinning the cable news channel off to shareholders of the merged company, according to people familiar with the matter.Fox plans to get rid of CNN because it already operates its own namesake news network and would likely face opposition from regulators even if it wanted to keep it. Potential buyers include CBS and Walt Disney's ABC - two broadcast news juggernauts in search of a cable news outlet.A sale would mean a tax hit of about 40 percent of the proceeds, which could range between $6 billion and $10 billion, according to tax experts and industry analysts. The entire sale price would be taxable because CNN is carried on Time Warner's books at near-zero, people familiar with the company said. ""That's an additional cost to the deal and that tax liability is going to reduce the amount they are able to pay to Time Warner shareholders,"" said corporate tax and accounting analyst Robert Willens, referring to Fox. The 40 percent figure comes from a combination of federal, state and local taxes, Willens said.Fox isn't considering spinning off CNN, a structure that's popular with media companies when there is a dearth of buyers, according to people familiar with the matter. Time Warner recently cleaved off its magazine division Time Inc as a standalone public company after a possible merger with Meredith Corp fell through. Tribune Co also plans to spin off its newspaper assets from its faster-growing broadcast division next month. Fox would likely face tax consequences in a spin-off as well, a person familiar with the situation said.CNN would have difficulties as a standalone company because, unwound from a cable bundle, it would likely see its subscriber fees plummet, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN makes money from advertising sales and by charging cable companies to carry the channel. It's currently packaged with other Turner channels such as TBS and TNT. The average price cable operators pay CNN has been steadily climbing from 50 cents per subscriber per month in 2009 to 63 cents in 2014, according to estimates from SNL Kagan.Fox itself estimates that CNN would fetch about $6 billion to $7 billion in a sale, according to a person familiar with the matter. That would represent a low double-digit multiple of CNN's estimated annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of roughly $500 million, the person added. At those prices, Rupert Murdoch's media colossus would still reap about $3.5 billion to $5 billion after paying the tax bill.Many media assets have a low tax basis, and in CNN's case, its value has increased dramatically from when it was first acquired. In these cases, the seller is taxed on the proceeds of the gains in value.Time Warner got CNN as part of its $7.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting in 1996, a deal that included the Cartoon Network, the Atlanta Braves baseball team and other properties. Founded in 1980 by media mogul Ted Turner, CNN was the first cable news network in the United States and now has more than 40 news bureaus across the globe, with distribution in more than 200 countries.Representatives from Time Warner and Fox declined to comment.  DISCIPLINE The idea to divest CNN was part of Fox's offer that Time Warner rebuffed worth $85 per share in a mix of cash and stock, which both companies disclosed on July 16.Sources told Reuters last week that Time Warner's board was concerned about the structure of the deal because the stock that Fox had on the table was only common shares, not the special class of voting stock that gives Murdoch control. To make a deal more appealing to Time Warner's board, Fox will have to come up with a significantly higher amount of cash, people familiar with Time Warner have suggested.While it remains to be seen how much more Murdoch is willing to put on the table eventually, one person said Fox currently is not considering a bid above the $90 to $95 per share range.The relatively high tax hit on CNN may play into that calculus, because it would force Murdoch to look elsewhere for additional funds for any premium. On Friday, Fox announced a deal to sell its European pay-TV assets in Germany and Italy to BSkyB in a deal worth $9 billion. Fox holds a 39 percent stake in British pay-TV channel BSkyB in a deal that will net Fox after-tax proceeds of around $7.2 billion. Some of the cash proceeds could be used to support a potential higher bid for Time Warner, but Fox plans to be prudent in its pursuit and will likely use part of the money toward buying back shares, people familiar with the matter said.Moody's analyst Neil Begley said he sees Fox as having enough financial flexibility to pay down debt over time, which could help it pursue a higher bid without sacrificing the company's investment grade credit rating.  ""Mr. Murdoch is a smart guy. I'd be very surprised if he's suddenly willing to bet the farm here,"" Begley said.  (Reporting by Liana B. Baker, Soyoung Kim and Jennifer Saba in New York.

119,"  * New company will have 20 million customers* Will pay in cash, debt, TV stake, share placing* Murdoch likely to use proceeds to pursue Time Warner* Risks seen in creation of ""Sky Europe""* BSkyB shares fall 5 pct   (Adds names of banks that advised on the deal)By Kate Holton and Leila AbboudLONDON/PARIS, July 25 Britain's BSkyB  has agreed to pay $9 billion to buy the Rupert Murdoch's pay-TV companies in Germany and Italy, taking its hunt for growth into Europe by creating a media powerhouse with 20 million customers.Under the deal, BSkyB will pay Murdoch's 21st Century Fox  for the pay-TV companies using cash, debt, its stake in a TV channel and a placing of shares that represents around 10 percent of its issued share capital. Murdoch is also the largest shareholder of BSkyB.The deal, which will make BSkyB the leading pay-TV provider in Europe, adds to a flurry of consolidation in the global media sector as traditional entertainment companies seek to bulk up to compete against more nimble Internet rivals.Fox is expected to use the proceeds to fuel its pursuit of Time Warner, which recently rejected a bid by Fox of  $80 billion.BSkyB had flagged a possible deal for Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia in May. The price announced on Friday was slightly lower than expected by some analysts and the cost and revenue benefits higher.But BSkyB's shares fell 5 percent, pulled lower by the plan to issue stock and suspend a share buy-back.""It is a bit of a step in the unknown for Sky,"" said Conor O'Shea, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets. ""For the first time, it will go from UK-focused to European and be asked to prove that it can add value from being larger.""O'Shea has a ""buy"" rating on BSkyB shares.Facing the toughest market conditions in its 25-year history, BSkyB has decided its future growth lies in creating a European pay-TV leader that will operate in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy. BSkyB dominates British pay-TV, offering its premium sports, movies and U.S. drama programming to more than 10 million homes. Of 97 million households in the five countries it wants to target, 66 million are yet to take pay-TV.""Sky is clearly taking the strategic view that pay TV, already ingrained in the U.S. culture, will become prevalent in Europe,"" said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown.EUROPEAN TIE-UP Fox owns 100 percent of Sky Italia, 57 percent of Sky Deutschland and 39 percent of BSkyB. BSkyB will pay 2.45 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) for Sky Italia and 2.9 billion pounds for Fox's 57 percent stake in Sky Deutschland.Under German takeover law, BSkyB also has to make an offer for the minority investors in Sky Deutschland, but with only a small premium on the table, analysts doubt that many will sell. The overall price for the deal would rise to around 7 billion pounds if German investors did sell out. For Sky Italia, the price will be made up of cash and BSkyB's 21 percent stake in the National Geographic Channel, valued at around 382 million pounds.Fox said it would subscribe to the share issue to keep its stake in BSkyB stable, meaning it will take net proceeds from the deal of around $7.2 billion. The placing raised 1.4 billion pounds, according to traders.In the eyes of many media executives and investors, programming and content are now seen as more valuable than the infrastructure that carries it to people's homes.That change has been driven in part by firms such as Netflix  and Google's Youtube, which have taken away viewers from traditional pay-TV services delivered by satellite operators or cable companies.The shift has led some like Murdoch's Fox to concentrate more on content, but for those like BSkyB that remain in both content and distribution, they need to invest heavily in technology and fresh programming to see off the challenge.DRIVE DOWN COSTS BSkyB's deal is a bet that it can squeeze out costs on everything from set-top boxes to broadcasting rights. It aims to reap 200 million pounds of annual cost savings by the end of the second financial year, with revenue synergies coming after that. It will compete with John Malone's Liberty Global, which is available in 12 European markets.Analysts said the deal could make BSkyB an attractive takeover target in the future for a group such as Vodafone  which has been buying fixed-line assets in Europe to bolster its mobile offering.Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao told reporters the deal could make BSkyB more appealing in terms of the content sharing agreements the two companies already have.""It demonstrates that in a world which is increasingly digital it is important to have scale and cross-country presence, which is exactly what Vodafone has,"" he said.The increased scale, and the fact the group has not hiked its leverage too high, should also bolster BSkyB when it goes up against telecoms group BT in the next auction for English Premier League rights - its most important offering for many of its subscribers.RISKS INVOLVED The deal is not without risks, however, and it could take a while for the creation of a ""Sky Europe"" to pay off.Sky Italia, Italy's biggest pay-TV operator, has lost 220,000 customers since its peak in 2011 as the country's prolonged economic downturn led more people to ditch their monthly TV packages.Sky Deutschland is growing strongly in terms of customer additions and revenue, helped by the appeal of its domestic and European soccer matches, but the percentage of those willing to pay for TV in Germany remains low - below 20 percent.The company's credit rating is likely to be downgraded. Its ratio of debt to core earnings will also move to just below 3 from the current level of 1. As a result, the group said it would not resume share buybacks or do any further acquisitions until its leverage target was achieved.Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said he did not envisage any regulatory problems with the deal. Barclays and Morgan Stanley acted as advisers for BSkyB, while J.P. Morgan co-led the financing. Herbert Smith was BSkyB's legal adviser. Deutsche Bank, Lazard Ltd, Goldman Sachs and law firm Allen & Overy advised Fox.($1 = 0.5888 British Pounds)   (Additional reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Tom Pfeiffer, Tom Heneghan, Catherine Evans and Leslie Adler)",2014-07-25,TWX,"Fri Jul 25, 2014 | 4:11pm EDT",UPDATE 6-BSkyB to pay $9 billion to create Sky Europe,http://www.reuters.com//article/bskyb-europe-idUSL6N0Q01DM20140725?type=companyNews

121,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.'s  (FOXA) decision to transfer its European direct broadcast satellite businesses  to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc (BSkyB) in a transaction valued at  approximately $9.3 billion improves the company's liquidity position and overall  financial flexibility.  Consideration for the exchange consists of $8.6 billion  of cash and BSkyB's 21% interest in National Geographic Channels International  and will generate approximately $7.2 billion of net cash proceeds. The  transaction is in line with the company's objective to streamline its  organizational structure. FOXA also announced a renewed share repurchase authorization that will be  executed during the company's fiscal year 2015. Shareholder returns that exceed  FCF generation are incorporated into FOXA's current ratings provided that  leverage remains below Fitch's 3.0x leverage threshold for FOXA's current 'BBB+'  rating. From Fitch's perspective FOXA has the necessary financial flexibility, primarily  through monetization of non-core assets, including the transaction announced  today, along with expected free cash flow (FCF) generation, to maintain strong  'BBB' ratings should the company elect to continue pursuing an acquisition of  Time Warner, Inc. (TWX). Time Warner previously rejected FOXA's unsolicited bid  of $85 per share consisting of 1.531 FOXA non-voting common stock and $32.42 in  cash per Time Warner share.   Should a transaction between FOXA and Time Warner materialize, Fitch will have a  level of tolerance within the existing rating level should the combined company  initially operate outside the parameters of the 'BBB+' rating, provided a  creditable de-leveraging plan is in place that reduces leverage to a level more  reflective of the rating within Fitch's rating horizon (typically 12 to 18  months for M&A related activity). Fitch believes the de-leveraging plan would  likely include asset sales including FOXA's DBS business in Italy and Germany in  addition to asset divestures required to gain regulatory approval.  In Fitch's opinion, a potential acquisition of TWX does not address any apparent  material strategic deficit within FOXA's asset and business portfolio. Fitch  holds FOXA's overall strategic positioning in high regard as its businesses  consist of a strong collection of cable networks, leading television and film  studios, national television network with robust sports-programming rights,  local television broadcast assets and international direct broadcast satellite  business. Each of FOXA's businesses have the scale characteristics to operate at  high margins and generate meaningful levels of free cash flow (FCF) and  positions the company to address the secular threats and opportunities presented  by changing media consumption patterns and continued audience fragmentation  across the media and entertainment landscape.  Nonetheless, Fitch recognizes the potential scale benefits related to a Time  Warner acquisition, which in turn can facilitate further investment in  programming and production leading to stronger content creation and brand  development. At the same time, Fitch also recognizes the potential execution,  operational and regulatory risks associated with the transaction. Demand for  high-quality content remains strong across all major end-markets (broadcast,  cable networks and subscription video on demand). Fitch continues to believe  that the entities which control the creation and production of high-quality,  'must have' video content will be better positioned to address secular issues  including evolving media consumption patterns, the emergence of alternative  distribution platforms, growing preference for time-shifted viewing, and growing  competition from online video sources, all of which lead to continuing audience  fragmentation. The potential transaction with Time Warner comes amid  transforming consolidation within the telecommunications and pay-TV sector  including Comcast Corporation's pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable, Inc.  and AT&T, Inc.'s proposed purchase of DIRECTV creating further risk to the  operating profile.  The centerpiece of any potential transaction with Time Warner would be the  creation of a powerful film and television studio, including premium pay  television programmer HBO, with the ability to create, produce and distribute  high-quality content with a broad audience appeal across multiple distribution  platforms on a global basis. The addition of Time Warner's cable network  business (including an enviable sports rights portfolio associated with those  networks) and the strong competitive position of Time Warner's film and  television studios at Warner Bros. enhances FOX's existing asset portfolio and  could enable FOX to maintain healthy pricing models for their businesses and  protect their ability to attract viewing audiences.  From a credit perspective, Fitch's base case assumes a purchase price of $100  per share with consideration consisting of $50 per share in cash and the  remainder in FOXA non-voting common stock. Fitch notes that its base case should  not be construed as a valuation of Time Warner common stock, or a threshold or  limitation for any rating category, but put forth for illustrative purpose.  Fitch further assumes that there will not be any debt structure issues and  bondholders will benefit from both FOX and Time Warner's businesses and cash  flows. Fitch estimates FOX will issue approximately $40 billion of debt to  facilitate the transaction (in the absence of proceeds from anticipated asset  sales) leading to pro forma leverage of 5.6x as of the LTM period ended March  31, 2014. Pro forma leverage includes $1 billion of anticipated expense  synergies. Pro forma leverage declines to 4.9x assuming $10 billion of net asset  sale proceeds. Fitch case further assumes FOX adopts a conservative capital  structure policy by largely eliminating share repurchases, reducing dividends  and direct free cash flow generation to debt reduction. Fitch's base case  estimates that the combined entity's FCF generation approximates 9% of revenues  initially and grows to nearly 11% of revenues within Fitch's rating horizon.  Additionally leverage trends below 3.5 within the same timeframe and drops to 3x  within three years of the transaction closing likely positioning FOX's credit  profile strongly within the 'BBB' category.  Conversely should the combined entity adopt a more aggressive capital allocation  policy or if FOXA's accepted transaction terms are more aggressive than Fitch's  base case, Fitch maintains that it would be difficult for the combined entity to  maintain the current ratings. However under such a scenario Fitch would expect  that negative rating action would be limited to two notches.

Some investors expect it to return with a higher offer. Fox announced the sale of its Sky Italian and German pay-TV units to BSkyB in cash and assets on Friday.Murdoch said in a statement about the Sky deal that Fox's ""number one priority is increasing shareholder value in a disciplined manner"" and ""we will only consider transactions that fully support this objective."" Fox is signalling to investors it will not go beyond its financial means to buy Time Warner, said Bernstein research analyst Todd Juenger. ""Fox and Time Warner are now both engaged in posturing. Fox is trying to reassure investors that it will not overpay,"" Juenger said.Fox did not signal it would use the proceeds for a major deal. It said in a statement that the Sky transaction improves the liquidity on its balance sheet and will support its key principles including ""the consistent return of capital to shareholders.""Fox also pledged on Friday to keep up its new share buyback program ""regardless of any potential acquisition or investment activity by the company."" It will unveil its new share buyback program on Aug. 6 when it reports its quarterly results.   (Reporting by Liana B.

125,"   By Tim Reid | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission told Time Warner Inc on Tuesday to end its dispute with DirecTV and other cable operators that has left most fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team unable to watch games on local television.In a strongly worded letter, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler expressed ""strong concern"" over Time Warner Cable's actions to charge fees to other cable networks to air the games.Time Warner Cable, which operates the SportsNet LA channel that carries Dodger games, wants other TV operators to pay SportsNet LA fees of as much as $5 a month per subscriber, which they say they have to pass onto their subscribers.In a letter to Time Warner Cable's CEO Robert D. Marcus,  Wheeler wrote: ""I am troubled by the negative impact that your apparent actions are having on consumers and the overall video marketplace.""""Inaction is no longer acceptable,"" Wheeler added.

130,"   By Jennifer Saba and Soyoung Kim  Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) decided to pull its $80 billion offer to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) on Tuesday, abandoning plans to create one of the world's largest media conglomerates.The surprise announcement appeared to cut short what many investors had viewed as an inevitable battle of attrition over a deal that would have joined two of Hollywood's biggest studios and TV networks from TNT to Fox News.     Murdoch, who is Fox's chairman and CEO, cited Time Warner's management and its board's refusal to come to the table to discuss a takeover as one reason for the stunning turnabout.    ""Our proposal had significant strategic merit and compelling financial rationale and our approach had always been friendly. However, Time Warner management and its board refused to engage with us to explore an offer which was highly compelling,"" he said in a statement released after the market closed on Tuesday.    Murdoch also cited Fox's share price - down about 11 percent since the offer was unveiled on July 16 - saying it had become undervalued, making the deal ""unattractive to Fox shareholders."" Time Warner, which had fiercely resisted Murdoch's advance,  issued a statement saying it was committed to enhancing long-term value. ""We look forward to continuing to deliver substantial and sustainable returns for all stockholders,"" the statement said.    Shares of Fox rose 10.4 percent in after-market trade after closing at $31.30. Shares of Time Warner fell 10.7 percent after closing at $85.19.A source familiar with the matter said that there were no other likely bidders for Time Warner at this point. Still, Time Warner shares are trading at a premium to the offer suggesting that some investors believe another buyer could emerge or Fox may return. Fox, which split off from News Corp last year, is serious about walking away from Time Warner, additional people familiar with the matter said, citing its announcement of a $6 billion stock buyback at the same time. The people were not authorized to speak to the media about the deal. 'NEGOTIATING STRATEGY'?   Still, Fox's withdrawal will raise pressure on Time Warner to justify its refusal to engage in negotiations, the drop in its stock price after the announcement and the fact that bolstered takeover defenses by barring its shareholders from calling a special meeting, said Brett Harriss, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, who said Fox could still try again later.""This could easily be part of their negotiating strategy,"" he said.Both Fox and Time Warner are set to report their quarterly earnings on Wednesday and will face questions from investors and analysts about their future strategies.The combined companies would have created a media powerhouse with two major studios, cable networks, sports programming and pay-TV channel HBO. A tie-up would have added more muscle to negotiate against media distribution companies that have been going through their own mergers like Comcast's (CMCSA.O) deal to buy Time Warner Cable TWC.N and AT&T's (T.N) proposal to takeover DirecTV DTV.O. The move to walk away is an uncharacteristic one for Murdoch, the 83-year-old media mogul known for his deal-making prowess. He pounced on Dow Jones in 2007, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, after making an offer to the Bancroft family that was too good to refuse.At $5 billion, representing roughly a 67 percent premium, many thought that Murdoch overpaid.

131,"  (Adds Fox shareholder comment, details about Time Warner)     By Jennifer Saba and Soyoung Kim     Aug 5 Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox  decided to pull its $80 billion offer to buy Time Warner Inc on Tuesday, abandoning plans to create one of the world's largest media conglomerates.     The surprise announcement appeared to cut short what many investors had viewed as an inevitable battle of attrition over a deal that would have joined two of Hollywood's biggest studios and TV networks from TNT to Fox News.      Murdoch, who is Fox's chairman and CEO, cited Time Warner's management and its board's refusal to come to the table to discuss a takeover as one reason for the stunning turnabout.     ""Our proposal had significant strategic merit and compelling financial rationale and our approach had always been friendly. However, Time Warner management and its board refused to engage with us to explore an offer which was highly compelling,"" he said in a statement released after the market closed on Tuesday.     Murdoch also cited Fox's share price - down about 11 percent since the offer was unveiled on July 16 - saying it had become undervalued, making the deal ""unattractive to Fox shareholders.""     Time Warner, which had fiercely resisted Murdoch's advance,  issued a statement saying it was committed to enhancing long-term value. ""We look forward to continuing to deliver substantial and sustainable returns for all stockholders,"" the statement said.     Shares of Fox rose 10.4 percent in after-market trade after closing at $31.30. Shares of Time Warner fell 10.7 percent after closing at $85.19.     A source familiar with the matter said that there were no other likely bidders for Time Warner at this point.     Still, Time Warner shares are trading at a premium to the offer suggesting that some investors believe another buyer could emerge or Fox may return.      Fox, which split off from News Corp last year, is serious about walking away from Time Warner, additional people familiar with the matter said, citing its announcement of a $6 billion stock buyback at the same time. The people were not authorized to speak to the media about the deal.                  'NEGOTIATING STRATEGY'?      Still, Fox's withdrawal will raise pressure on Time Warner to justify its refusal to engage in negotiations, the drop in its stock price after the announcement and the fact that bolstered takeover defenses by barring its shareholders from calling a special meeting, said Brett Harriss, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, who said Fox could still try again later.     ""This could easily be part of their negotiating strategy,"" he said.     Both Fox and Time Warner are set to report their quarterly earnings on Wednesday and will face questions from investors and analysts about their future strategies.     The combined companies would have created a media powerhouse with two major studios, cable networks, sports programming and pay-TV channel HBO. A tie-up would have added more muscle to negotiate against media distribution companies that have been going through their own mergers like Comcast's deal to buy Time Warner Cable and AT&T's proposal to takeover DirecTV.     The move to walk away is an uncharacteristic one for Murdoch, the 83-year-old media mogul known for his deal-making prowess.      He pounced on Dow Jones in 2007, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, after making an offer to the Bancroft family that was too good to refuse.     At $5 billion, representing roughly a 67 percent premium, many thought that Murdoch overpaid. News Corp had to write down  half the value a few years later.     Jason Subotky, partner and portfolio manager at Yacktman Asset Management, a large Fox shareholder said, ""They showed a willingness to be bold with the proposal and yet were very disciplined. We think this is recognition that buying their own shares back is the most attractive use of capital at this point.""      For now, today's statement from Murdoch signals that shareholder value trumps desire.       ""This significant return of capital underscores the company's ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation and returning value to shareholders in a meaningful way,"" Murdoch said in a statement, referring to the buyback plan.

""Obviously, the consensus for a long time has been that the market has been due for a correction, so it was ripe for sentiment to change very quickly,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.The S&P is down 3.4 percent from its record closing high of 1,987.98 points reached on July 24.The energy index ended 2.1 percent lower, dragged down by concerns about oversupply of oil and disappointing results from Pioneer Natural Resources. Pioneer lost 5.6 percent and was the worst-performing S&P energy name.

This is our resolute decision,"" Fox Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch said in a rare appearance on the company's conference call late Wednesday.Murdoch, conceding defeat, was further explaining the company's rational for pulling its bid on Tuesday.Fox Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey backed up Murdoch and went further: ""Let me be clear, we are done ... We have no plans to pursue any other third party content company as an alternative to Time Warner."" Earlier, Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes, speaking on the company's own earnings conference call, also weighed in on the scuttled Fox bid, which the CNN and Warner Brothers studios owner had aggressively resisted, as well as the merits of megadeals in general.""I would just encourage everybody to look at all sides of the issue when contemplating the benefits and risks of putting very large companies together,"" Bewkes said to an analyst.Indeed, since taking the helm of the media conglomerate in 2008, Bewkes has trimmed down Time Warner - shedding properties like AOL AOL.N, Time Warner Cable TWC.N, and Time Inc (TIME.N) - and making it an attractive target for acquisitive-hungry rivals.Bewkes said he feels that Time Warner is already at scale, especially for its studio business Warner Bros which he described as the ""biggest producer of content in the world"" to its collection of cable networks which also dominate.""We are not lacking something we need,"" he said. Time Warner needs to show it can go it alone after fiercely refusing to engage in talks with Fox, which offered to buy it in a deal for about $80 billion and would have created one of the world's largest media companies with two major studios, a bevy of cable networks and pay-TV channel HBO.   Time Warner reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday and boosted its share buyback program by an additional $5 billion. ""When faced with a hostile takeover bid, Time Warner did exactly what they should have done. They crushed the numbers,"" wrote Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson Research in a note to investors.The strong results and shareholder-friendly measure could not prevent Time Warner's stock from sliding. The shares closed down 13 percent at $74.24 - well below the $85 per share offer from Rupert Murdoch's Fox.Time Warner said it will host an investor's day in the fall to unveil more details about its long-term strategy. 'GAME OF THRONES' Revenue from Time Warner's Home Box Office unit jumped 17 percent to $1.42 billion for the second quarter, helped by the popularity of ""Game of Thrones"" and other HBO shows.    The company said the fourth season of ""Game of Thrones,"" which ended in June, was the most watched season of an original series in HBO's history. The Emmy award-winning fantasy epic had an average gross audience of 19 million viewers. The company's Turner Networks unit — home to CNN, TBS and TNT — also posted an increase in revenue on higher subscription and advertisement sales.Net income from continuing operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders rose to $843 million, or 94 cents per share, for the three months ended June 30, from $698 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 98 cents per share.Revenue increased to $6.79 billion from $6.61 billion.Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 84 cents a share on revenue of $6.87 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company forecast full-year 2014 adjusted profit growth in the low teens in terms of percentage, off a base of 2013 adjusted earnings of $3.51 per share.Time Warner said in April it expected its full-year adjusted profit to grow in the low- to mid-teen percentage range, or better, for at least the next three or four years.

139,"   By Akane Otani | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Major U.S. stock indexes ended little changed on Wednesday, as tensions in Ukraine and Russia and a failed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile offset gains in consumer staples shares.An initial selloff took the S&P 500 to its 100-day moving average, but by the last hour of trading, the benchmark index was back near the unchanged mark. Sectors posted mixed performances, with four of the S&P's 10 industry sectors ending with gains. The S&P 500 telecom services sector .SPLRCL slipped 1.3 percent and was the worst-performing industry, with AT&T (T.N) and Verizon (VZ.N) down on news that Sprint (S.N), facing regulatory resistance, gave up its bid for T-Mobile TMUS.N.Investors have been expecting a correction, but selloffs this year have generally been brief.""We've had a lot of forces pushing the markets, whether it's earnings season, employment numbers or geopolitical concerns, but I think if people were really concerned about an invasion in Ukraine or the Middle East, you would see more than a 2 or 3 percent selloff,"" said Gary Flam, portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles.  NATO reported that Russia has around 20,000 combat-ready troops on the eastern border of Ukraine that it could use to invade. Further souring the mood, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Moscow's biggest economic response to Western sanctions so far.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 13.87 points, or 0.08 percent, to 16,443.34.

Walgreen Co WAG.N shares fell 14.3 percent to $59.21 after the largest U.S. drug retailer it said it would not use a full takeover of Europe's biggest pharmacy chain, Alliance Boots, to domicile overseas - a move that would shield Walgreen from U.S. taxes.On the upside, Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP.N) gained 5.8 percent to $71.08 after better-than-expected earnings, helping lead consumer staples companies higher. Twenty-First Century Fox Corp (FOXA.O) was another winner, its shares up 3.3 percent to $32.33, a day after the company pulled its $80 billion offer to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). Time Warner slid 12.9 percent to $74.24.

142,"  (Repeating story that first ran on August 5 to additional subscribers)By David GaffenAug 5 Many options traders who had taken bets on a successful buyout of Time Warner Inc by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc are facing a grim lesson in the risks of betting on deals.Murdoch pulled the $80 billion offer after the close of trading on Tuesday, saying Time Warner management had refused to engage in discussions. He also cited the sharp drop in Fox's share price since the proposal last month, saying it ""makes the transaction unattractive to Fox shareholders.""Time Warner shares dove about 10 percent to $76.80 from $85.19 following news of the offer's withdrawal, while Fox's stock gained around 9 percent.Expectations that Fox would increase its bid to at least $90  a share and even above $100 a share had prompted traders and investors to put down a series of bets.There are more than 25,000 out-of-the-money call option contracts expiring in mid-October that anticipate Time Warner to close at a price anywhere between $90 a share and $105 a share.Each call or put option contract represents the right to buy or sell 100 shares at a particular price. There are more than 12,700 outstanding contracts that bet on Time Warner shares to close above $92.50 by mid-October. Just after the Fox bid, those options surged to trade at a peak of $3.09 each.Since then hopes of a deal had diminished as Time Warner made it clear it didn't want to talk to Fox about a deal.The mid-October options closed Tuesday at $1.20 each and are expected to fall sharply when the market opens on Wednesday. If a trader had bought all those contracts at the peak, the cost would have been about $3.92 million. They are now worth about $1.52 million and the value is expected to drop much further.Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research, in Austin, Texas, said that if Time Warner shares do indeed open about $10 lower on Wednesday, the mid-October options would likely see their value drop to about 10 or 11 cents. ""You're looking at a 90 percent drop in value,"" he said. ""Unless they got those positions before the announcement, they probably paid a lot and were looking to get a small gain.""Indeed, that looks like a distinct possibility if Tuesday's after hours swoon in Time Warner shares continues into trading on Wednesday.VALUATION CONCERNS  There are also plenty of positions expiring in August and September that are in danger of turning into losers. More than 17,000 call options contracts in Time Warner that expect a close above $85 currently trade at $1.65 each option - and they expire next week. At their peak, those contracts would have cost $6.89 million and are now worth about $2.81 million.Notably, trading on Time Warner options on Tuesday was dominated by put buying, according to J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade. Activity in puts outweighed action in calls by nearly a three-to-one ratio, which Kinahan said was primarily investors buying puts as a protective move by those holding Time Warner shares.At least one asset manager who bailed on the stock before the announcement said Time Warner just looked too pricey at the Fox offer price of around $85 a share.""We compared Time Warner to Netflix and Amazon and felt it was way too rich in terms of valuation,"" said Diane Garnick, CEO of asset management firm Clear Alternatives LLC in New York. Her firm sold the stock last week.She said millennials represent a growing part of those who view content but don't use cable as much as older generations.One event investor, who are commonly called arbitrageurs, said he was relieved he had avoided the temptation to get in on the buy-Time Warner-sell-Fox trade after Fox's offer was first made public in mid-July.""Thankfully we stayed away,"" said the investor, who declined to be identified. ""Lots of event and arb funds had the long Time Warner and short Fox trade on. I don't think many avoided it.""

It has closed below that level just four times this year, the last one in mid April. Markets kept an eye on eastern Europe as Moscow imposed a ban on imports of many Western foods, retaliating against sanctions imposed for its support of rebels in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. Russia will ban various imports from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada and Norway in a measure that isolates its consumers from world trade to a degree unseen since Soviet days.""The Russian situation has gone from bad to worse,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, adding that ""imposing an import restriction on agricultural products will likely lead to rapid inflation.""However, he said the recent volatility and pullback are not foreshadowing a market correction. ""Earnings are robust, revenues are rising, and interest rates are likely to go up gradually,"" Jacobsen said. ""These are not the conditions that create market corrections.""The sanctions by Moscow are seen as possibly hurting European economies more than the United States due to closer ties between Russia and Europe. Such a scenario could favor U.S. equities and other assets as foreign cash looking for yield may head towards the world's largest economy. The full extent of the impact, however, is yet to be known.""Geopolitical risks are heightened, are higher than they were a few months ago.

150,"  (Adds Time Warner's comment)By Jim Finkle, Marina Lopes and Alina SelyukhBOSTON/WASHINGTON Aug 27 Time Warner Cable Inc , the No. 2 U.S. cable operator, suffered a massive network outage on Wednesday due to suspected human error that cut Internet services to some 11 million businesses and residences, prompting a New York state investigation.The outage to all of its Internet customers across 29 states began at about 4:30 a.m. EDT (0830 GMT), said company spokesman Bobby Amirshahi. Services were restored by 7.30 a.m, he said.The outage came at a critical time for Time Warner, which is working to win FCC approval of a $45 billion proposed merger with Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable provider as market experts say that customers are frustrated by the frequency and handling of previously disclosed service disruptions.The company blamed a technical glitch for bringing down the network. It said an ""erroneous configuration"" had been inserted when technicians conducted routine, overnight maintenance on its Internet backbone. ""A failure of this size is very serious and we are taking the necessary steps to improve our processes with the objective of making sure this doesn't happen again,"" Amirshahi said.The outage affected 2 percent of all U.S. Internet networks, according to Renesys, a firm that monitors global Internet activity.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the state's Department of Public Service to investigate the disruption as it reviews the company's planned merger with Comcast. ""Dependable Internet service is a vital link in our daily lives and telecommunications companies have a responsibility to deliver reliable service to their customers,"" Cuomo said in a statement.""We apologize for the early morning disruption in service and we intend to discuss any of the governor's concerns with him as well as the many consumer merits of our merger,"" Amirshahi said.Such wide-scale outages are rare in the United States, said Jim Cowie, chief scientist with Renesys' parent DYN. The outage came one day after the company agreed to pay $1.1 million to U.S. regulators who found it did not properly disclose multiple network outages last year, highlighting an issue that has long been a sore point with some customers.A recent study by consulting firm CG42 found that 59 percent of customers were frustrated by their cable provider, in part because of outages and disruptions.Customers are often not reimbursed for disruptions and frustrated by lack of information about when to expect service to be restored, said CG42 founder Steve Beck.Todd Mitchell, an analyst at Brean Capital who has a ""buy"" rating on Time Warner Cable stock, said that the company has not invested enough money in its network.""One would hope that any company that operated a network of this scale would put in the appropriate redundancies so that something like this wouldn't happen,"" he said.

151,"  (Adds Bewkes comments, context about Viacom/Sony programming deal)By Sam Adams and Lisa RichwineNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, Sept 10 Time Warner Inc  and CBS Corp signaled on Wednesday that they were increasingly open to one day making HBO and Showtime available directly to consumers over the Internet without a subscription to a cable television service.Separate comments by CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes at an investor conference were the latest sign that pressure from rival services such as Netflix Inc could make streaming cable TV delivered via broadband a reality. Such a move, which could run into fierce resistance from cable and satellite TV operators who are already losing clients to Web-based programming on Netlix, Hulu and Amazon.com Inc , would be a boon for consumers eager to cancel pricy subscriptions.At the Goldman Sachs Group Inc Communacopia Conference, Moonves was asked if he was thinking about making the Web-based on-demand Showtime Anytime service available to viewers who do not have a cable subscription. ""Is there some time in the future that could happen? Absolutely,"" Moonves said. ""I don't know when it is.""At the same conference, Bewkes said offering HBO subscriptions directly to consumers is ""becoming more viable, more interesting."" Bewkes has been dropping hints for more than a year that HBO is studying the option, but has repeatedly said the economics do not make sense, with cable operators providing a large part of the network's profit. ""The broadband-only opportunity, up until now, wasn't a digital prize that would be smart to move from one to the other,"" Bewkes said on Wednesday. ""So now the broadband opportunity is getting quite a bit bigger, and the ability of the plan to deliver something robust is getting stronger.""Showtime and HBO both currently offer programs to viewers online, but customers have to be subscribers to a cable package and pay extra fees for the premium channels.Separately on Wednesday, Sony Corp said it had secured the rights to carry 22 Viacom Inc channels, including Comedy Central and MTV, on its planned cloud-based television service.

155,"   By Liana B. Baker and Lisa Richwine  The NBA's agreement on a new more than $20 billion multi-year contract with broadcast partners Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc was overshadowed by news that Disney’s ESPN is joining with the basketball league to create an Internet sports channel available without a pay TV subscription.A new streaming channel planned by ESPN, which sources familiar with the plans said would be widened to include other sports, is an early step that could upend the traditional cable and satellite companies if it leads more consumers cancelling their pay TV service. Cable and satellite providers pay Disney and Time Warner richly for their sports-heavy content. ESPN executives insist they are committed to the current pay TV system, and that any programming sold directly to consumers will complement rather than compete with the content available through pay TV packages.But others said the streaming channel could have the same kind of transformative effect on sports programming that Netflix Inc has had on dramas and sitcoms. ""This is the first crack in the structure of the television business that has been in place for decades,"" said Forrester analyst Jim Nail. Under the new deal, ESPN will make a limited number of regular season NBA games available on the streaming channel, the sources said. The offerings will be expanded to include other sports, they said. The sources could not speak on the record because terms of the deal were not public.ESPN said in May that it was considering selling online access to live Major League Soccer games to consumers without pay TV subscriptions.  The network said in a statement on Monday it has a framework in place with the NBA for the streaming service, and that the league would have an equity interest in the product. ESPN offered the equity interest to the NBA as an incentive for the league to choose the streaming service - rather than a new programming partner such as Fox - for certain games, the sources said. The games being made available are those not already being shown on television ESPN and Turner as part of the rights renewal package, they said. NBA DEAL  Disney and Time Warner Inc's Turner Broadcasting System will more than double their annual payments to the NBA under the new nine-year deal, people familiar with the matter said.Starting in the 2016-17 season, the two networks will pay more than $2.5 billion, an increase from $960 million per year in the past agreement. Over nine years, the deal could be worth upwards of $22.5 billion. ESPN paid a bigger share than Turner because its deal includes international and radio rights, as well as WNBA games, according to people familiar with the matter. The agreement comes just days after satellite provider DirecTV agreed to pay $1.5 billion a year to extend its exclusive contract to sell its ""Sunday Ticket"" package of National Football League games.  Both deals are a reminder of the unique allure of sports programming for broadcasters and cable networks, whose non-sports lineups have been losing viewers to streaming services like Netflix or are being watched on digital video recorders that allow users to skip commercials.     ABC and ESPN, both owned by Disney, will televise 100 regular-season games per year, and TNT, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, will televise 64, the NBA said. ESPN said it will increase its NBA-focused programming with 750 new hours of content.

162,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ten years ago, Walt Disney Co, having fended off a hostile bid from Comcast, had to make a case why it was better off as an independent company.It succeeded. Disney's shares have soared more than 250 percent since.Now, Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes faces a similar moment of reckoning after rejecting a bid for $85 a share from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox. Bewkes and other top brass will be under pressure at a meeting with analysts and investors next Wednesday to show they can repeat Disney's magic.""Disney pleaded the case to get its share price up on their own,"" said David Miller, an analyst with Topeka Capital Markets.""We think that Mr. Bewkes will attempt to drive home the same concept,"" he said, adding it remained to be seen if Bewkes would manage to replicate Disney's sterling stock performance.Time Warner is trading at around $73 - more than twice its price since Bewkes took over as CEO in 2008, but still below Murdoch's original $85 bid. Fox had considered boosting the offer to as high as $95 a share, people familiar with the matter said.  Rejection has had its price. Time Warner shares have dropped 15 percent since Aug. 5, when Fox walked away from its offer. Fox shares are up 5.7 percent over the same period.""It's too simple to say that Bewkes has to get the stock price over $85,"" said Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss.  ""He has to tell us why he said no to Fox. Time Warner has said nothing - only that at no price would it combine with Fox.""Gabelli, an asset management firm, holds shares in Time Warner. Harriss thought a combined Fox and Time Warner would benefit both companies. Bewkes, who last stood in front of investors during a similar meeting four years ago, will lay out a long-term vision for the company's Warner Bros movie studio, Turner Broadcasting cable networks and pay TV channel HBO. Those plans could include letting consumers buy HBO without a cable subscription, given the popularity of the HBO GO mobile app, some analysts have said. Topeka's Miller said that a new broadband-only product similar to Netflix could crack open new markets.Topeka estimates that there are approximately 9 million households in the United States with Internet access but no pay TV and roughly 66 million households with pay TV but no HBO. Indeed, Bewkes has slowly changed his tune about Netflix that he once derided as a ""200-pound chimp."" He said Monday, at a conference hosted by Hollywood website The Wrap, that he wished he personally owned the streaming video service, given its market value of around $30 billion.There are other signs of Time Warner's long-term plan that have emerged over the past weeks. Turner Broadcasting and Disney's ESPN more than doubled their annual payments to the NBA under a new nine-year deal worth more than $22 billion. Collectively, TBS and ESPN will pay more than $2.5 billion, starting in the 2016-17 season, to the basketball league. The networks coughed up more to keep the rights out of the hands of Fox - which started its own sports network - and those of other rivals.The pricey content deal comes as Turner, which also operates the 24-hour news channel CNN, attempts to crack down on costs. The company, which employs about 14,000 full-time staffers, is poised to slash 10 percent of its workforce.Focusing on internal operations is how Disney jolted it shares, noted Topeka's Miller - a strategy likely to be embraced by Bewkes.

163,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Time Warner Inc's HBO will launch a standalone online streaming service next year to make hit shows such as ""Game of Thrones"" available to people who do not subscribe to cable television. The move to take HBO ""over-the-top"" - media jargon that means consumers can watch the channel with only a broadband connection - is a significant milestone for a channel long dependent on cable distributors. It could be a further catalyst spurring more people to dump their cable subscriptions by cutting the cord. It could also prompt other media companies to follow HBO's lead.HBO's chief executive, Richard Plepler, announced the move during an investor day on Wednesday where Time Warner's other top executives laid out plans to boost the company's growth.""In 2015 we will go beyond the wall and launch a standalone,  over-the-top service with the potential to produce hundreds of millions in revenue,"" Plepler said, making a reference to HBO's massive hit show ""Game of Thrones.""""We will use all means at our disposal to grow. This is the most exciting inflection point both domestically and internationally in the modern history of HBO.""Plepler cited that 10 million homes in the United States are broadband-only, without cable subscriptions. Half of those homes subscribe to streaming video services. ""These consumers have no access to HBO. It's a large opportunity that should not be untapped,"" he said.Shares of Time Warner, also home to movie studio Warner Bros and cable network channels Turner Broadcasting, rose 2.2 percent to close at $72.21, still short of the $85 per share offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc which it rejected over the summer.

164,"  (Adds comment from Netflix investor letter)By Jennifer SabaNEW YORK Oct 15 Time Warner Inc's HBO will launch a standalone online streaming service next year to make hit shows such as ""Game of Thrones"" available to people who do not subscribe to cable television.The move to take HBO ""over-the-top"" - media jargon that means consumers can watch the channel with only a broadband connection - is a significant milestone for a channel long dependent on cable distributors.It could be a further catalyst spurring more people to dump their cable subscriptions by cutting the cord. It could also prompt other media companies to follow HBO's lead.HBO's chief executive, Richard Plepler, announced the move during an investor day on Wednesday where Time Warner's other top executives laid out plans to boost the company's growth.""In 2015 we will go beyond the wall and launch a standalone,  over-the-top service with the potential to produce hundreds of millions in revenue,"" Plepler said, making a reference to HBO's massive hit show ""Game of Thrones.""""We will use all means at our disposal to grow. This is the most exciting inflection point both domestically and internationally in the modern history of HBO."" Plepler cited that 10 million homes in the United States are broadband-only, without cable subscriptions. Half of those homes subscribe to streaming video services. ""These consumers have no access to HBO. It's a large opportunity that should not be untapped,"" he said.Shares of Time Warner, also home to movie studio Warner Bros and cable network channels Turner Broadcasting, rose 2.2 percent to close at $72.21, still short of the $85 per share offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc which it rejected over the summer.Streaming video provider Netflix Inc, which announced quarterly results on Wednesday, said it had long viewed HBO as its top competitor.""It was inevitable and sensible that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application,"" said Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings in a letter to investors.

168,"  Oct 15 Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes stood in front of analysts and investors on Wednesday to seek to convince them that the company is better off alone after rejecting a bid from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox.In doing so, he forecast adjusted earnings per share of $6 by 2016 and $8 by 2018.Shares of Time Warner, which include movie studio Warner Bros, cable network Turner Broadcasting, and pay TV channel HBO, were up 2 percent at $72.05 in morning trading. Bewkes is under pressure to boost Time Warner's share price after the company rebuffed an $85 per share bid from Fox. The two combined companies would have resulted in one of the world's largest media conglomerates, with two major movie studios, a portfolio of broadcast and cable networks, and rights to lucrative sports programming.

170,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) decision to make its prized HBO channel available to people who don't subscribe to Pay TV may delight such ""cord cutters"" but will likely crank up tensions with cable and satellite TV service providers.By going over-the-top - media lingo for being able to watch TV with only a broadband connection - HBO has paved the way for a rocky period of negotiations with cable and satellite companies - with issues of pricing and distribution likely to loom large.Indeed, CBS Corp (CBS.N) upped the ante when it announced on Thursday a digital product that provides content like ""The Good Wife"" without a cable subscription for $5.99 per month. ""Truth be told, there is no way to put a positive spin on this for the distributors,"" said Craig Moffett, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson.  Details about HBO's standalone product, slated to launch next year, were scant. HBO Chief Executive Richard Plepler did not discuss price or potential partners on Wednesday when he revealed the news before Time Warner investors and analysts.Still, the proposed online streaming service adds to a lengthening list of ways for consumers to circumvent pricey cable subscriptions, from Hulu to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and even a possible ESPN Internet channel. ESPN is owned by Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).  HBO is likely to face pressure from distributors to set the price for its new offering at a level that will not cannibalize existing subscriptions within the cable bundle. Barclays analysts speculated in a research report that the service was likely to cost $18 a month, which would be higher than the roughly $15 a month that cable systems typically charge for HBO.Some cable executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expect price and other issues to be points of tension in looming talks over how the service will work. In setting the price, HBO will face a balancing act between growing its subscriptions and undercutting the cable companies, analysts said.  Both Time Warner and its distributors are expected to bring carrots and sticks to the negotiating table. HBO is targeting the 10 million broadband only households in the United States who do not have cable subscriptions.Part of the reason Time Warner is launching a standalone product is to gain more leverage against the cable companies that it feels do not do enough to promote HBO as a premium channel. Some cable systems have as few as 14 percent of their subscribers taking HBO, while others have as much as 44 percent, according to Plepler. ""They want to have the threat,"" said Thomas Lieu, portfolio manager with Westwood Group, which has a stake in Time Warner. Cable companies unhappy at being undercut by the freestanding HBO Go could retaliate by cutting their promotion budgets for the premium channel, one cable industry source said.     Other ""sticks"" could include slowing down delivery of the freestanding HBO Go, reviving battles that cable operators such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) fought earlier this year with Netflix, which ended with the streaming service agreeing to pay the cable operator for faster transmission speeds. Plepler invoked ""The Sopranos"" mob character Paulie Walnuts when he said that when these deals come up, ""we will get our taste."" But as HBO thrashes out new commercial arrangements with distributors, it will hardly have a monopoly on strong-arm tactics.

172,"  * Vivendi and ITI review options for 51 pct stake in Poland's TVN* Time Warner and 21st Century Fox seen as potential buyers* TVN shares jump 7 pct on newsBy Adrian Krajewski and Gwénaëlle BarzicWARSAW/PARIS, Oct 17 American media giants have been touted as potential buyers for Polish broadcaster TVN  after France's Vivendi and Poland-based holding company ITI signalled that they could sell their joint 51 per cent stake.ITI and Vivendi announced late on Thursday that they will conduct a review of their options for TVN, lifting shares in the broadcaster by as much as 7 poercent in early trading on Friday.A sale would open an opportunity for another big media player to enter Poland's rebounding market of 38 million people, with analysts naming Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox as prospective buyers.Vivendi's Canal Plus agreed to buy into TVN, one of Poland's two largest private broadcasters, three years ago. A wider deal also included a merger of the two sides' pay-TV platforms into nc+, which made Poland Vivendi's second-largest market.Canal Plus said it would rather focus on nc+, Poland's second-largest pay TV platform with 2.2 million users, as part of a broader strategy of moving away from free-to-air television, where advertising revenues are threatened by the Internet and on-demand TV viewing. ""The timing is not bad,"" Espirito Santo analyst Konrad Ksiezopolski said. ""The advertising market in Poland is gaining steam, TV ads are rising and despite the Internet's growing popularity it is still the strongest advertising channel.""""Per capita spending on TV advertising is still low in Poland, even in comparison with the Czech Republic or Hungary, which indicates a chance for growth.""TVN and Canal Plus originally expected their tie-up to bring in annual savings of more than 250 million zlotys ($76 million) in its third year, with core profit of 550 million zlotys in 2015. Instead, the third year could bring an ownership overhaul.""No timetable has been set. Every option is open,"" a source familiar with the matter said, adding that Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan have the mandate for the option review. The source added that the Polish TV market is becoming increasingly competitive, with a possible launch by U.S. video-streaming company Netflix next year.SELLING SPREE Canal Plus is losing customers in its domestic market to widely available free channels, prompting the move to expand internationally by focusing on businesses in Poland, Vietnam, French-speaking Africa and more recently in Canada. Under a two-year strategic overhaul, Vivendi sold its French telecoms operator SFR and video games maker Activision Blizzard.After the SFR sale, Canal Plus will be Vivendi's largest results driver, bringing in about 40 percent of operating profit, compared with 33 percent for Vivendi's Universal Music Group and 27 percent for its Brazilian telecoms business GVT, which is also for sale.ITI, which has moved into multimedia from such disparate businesses as electronics imports and potato chips, is finishing its own clearout to cut debt costs, with TVN the last of its most-prized assets.Analysts told Reuters that Time Warner - owner of movie studio Warner Bros, cable network Turner Broadcasting and pay-TV channel HBO - could merge TVN with its Czech broadcaster CME.Time Warner rival Discovery Communications and Germany's Bertelsmann and RTL Group could also join the race.""If the transaction happens, it will be with a market premium,"" Raiffeisen analyst Dominik Niszcz said. ""Vivendi paid over 20 zlotys per share for its TVN stake and it can be assumed that it would want to book over 20 zlotys now.""After their initial jump, TVN shares were trading at 14.45 zlotys at 1435 GMT, up 0.3 percent on the day, valuing the company at about 5 billion zlotys.

176,"   By Ronald Grover  and Jennifer Saba  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Nov 2, CBS Corp  and Dish Network Corp are far apart on talks for a new distribution deal, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations, setting up the possibility that the satellite provider's subscribers could lose access to the most-watched U.S. TV network next month.The current agreement, signed on January 5, 2012, is set to expire in late November, according to the person. The two sides continue to talk.CBS and Dish are at odds over the monthly price per subscriber the satellite operator, which has 14 million subscribers, would pay to carry CBS.According to media consultant SNL Kagan, CBS's TV stations were averaging 54 cents per subscriber from TV distributors when the Dish deal was signed in 2012. CBS currently averages 89 cents but recent deals have been richer, according to SNL senior research analyst Justin Nielson. The standoff comes as cable, satellite and telecom video distributors increasingly are playing hard ball with program providers, resisting demands for steep price increases at a time when viewers are being drawn to Netflix and other forms of entertainment.Last year, CBS notched a high-profile victory in a fight with another distributor when Time Warner Cable was forced to back down and mostly give in to CBS's demands after a month-long programming blackout that incensed the cable company's subscribers. In that instance, CBS was asking for an agreement in which its fee would escalate to more than $2 per subscriber when the contract ended, according to reports at the time.CBS has argued in contract talks that the price it is seeking is justified by its status as the most watched TV network in the United States, with highly rated shows like ""NCIS"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"" and sports programming that includes NFL football. CBS spokeswoman Shannon Jacobs and Dish spokesman Bob Toevs had no comment.Dish is already locked in a contract standoff with Time Warner Inc's Turner Broadcasting and has removed several of its channels including CNN and the Cartoon Network. The two sides continue to talk, according to a person with knowledge with the Dish-Turner talks.The person said both Dish and Turner were making progress on price and hashing out details over Dish's streaming video service before the blackout on Oct. 21. The sticking point involved Turner's other two networks, TNT and TBS, which are under separate contracts, the person said.Negotiations about TNT and TBS are expected to start in a couple of weeks.

Few details have emerged about the offering, including the price and potential partners to deliver HBO's popular programs like ""Game of Thrones"" with only a broadband connection.In the third quarter, revenue from the HBO rose 10 percent and accounted for about 21 percent of Time Warner's total revenue. Warner Bros, the company's movie and TV studio unit, reported a 3 percent rise in revenue, helped by subscription video-on-demand from its television products.

201,"  (Adds details on agreement paragraphs 6, 8)By Lisa RichwineLOS ANGELES Jan 15 The Fox News and Fox Business channels returned on Thursday to satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp's lineup after both sides agreed to a multiyear deal.The channels owned by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc had been blacked out for Dish's 14 million customers since Dec. 21 when the companies failed to agree on a new contract.Pay TV providers and programmers have sparred in recent months over the fees paid to carry networks. Digital rights to provide shows online and on mobile devices also have complicated the negotiations. In a video also posted online on Thursday, Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen thanked customers who were ""supportive of our stance for fair rates and terms.""""I know this has been a frustrating several weeks for some of our customers,"" Ergen said. A source close to the negotiations said Dish agreed to pay an average monthly fee of $1.50 per subscriber for Fox News, the most-watched cable news network. The fee is ""significantly higher"" than what Dish paid previously, the source said.""We thank the viewers of Fox News and Fox Business and Dish customers for their patience throughout this process,"" Tim Carry, executive vice president of distribution for Fox News and Fox Business, and Warren Schlichting, Dish senior vice president of programming, said in a joint statement. The deal does not include rights for Dish to put the Fox channels on its new Sling TV online service, the source said. Sling TV is a slimmed down $20-a-month package that the company will launch later this month to reach customers who do not want to pay for the more expensive traditional TV service.Dish has battled recently with other content providers, including CBS Corp and Time Warner Inc's Turner Broadcasting. Dish customers faced a 12-hour blackout of CBS and went for a month without Turner networks including CNN and Cartoon Network before deals were reached to restore them.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker)",2015-01-16,TWX,"Thu Jan 15, 2015 | 8:20pm EST","UPDATE 2-Dish reaches deal that brings back Fox news, business channels",http://www.reuters.com//article/dish-fox-idUSL1N0UU31L20150116?type=companyNews

205,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Time Warner's TWX.N HBO is preparing to sell a standalone service over the Internet for the first time, in one of the most closely watched moves in pay TV history. Yet the road to the launch has been far from an easy one - marked by changes in strategy, deadlines, and the departure of its chief technology officer along with two of his lieutenants.Otto Berkes, who was previously a Microsoft executive, resigned from the CTO position in December, only a matter of months before HBO is expected to start selling the new product, and two senior vice presidents on the technology team, Mark Thomas and Drew Angeloff, are also leaving, sources familiar with the situation said.The original plan discussed by the network's top executives was to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a sophisticated streaming platform that would make HBO, one of the best-known premium channels in the United States, capable of challenging streaming video services from Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O head on. Berkes, who was also a cofounder of Xbox, was a key part of that ambitious project - he had been hired by HBO in 2011 to set up a new office in Seattle, initially hiring 80 engineers with plans to grow much bigger.The idea was that the technology would not only support HBO but potentially other Time Warner offerings, such as Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros. The platform, which would power a product that doesn’t require a cable subscription, would be used globally and was supposed to be ready in 2016, said the sources, who worked on that effort.But these sources said that much of the plan was changed when Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O made a surprise takeover bid for Time Warner last summer.To justify to shareholders why they shouldn't consider the Australian-born media tycoon's overtures, Time Warner said that its own strategic plan would deliver more value to shareholders than Murdoch could.COST CUTTING  In October, at its first investor day in four years, Time Warner outlined a series of measures aimed at bolstering revenue growth and cutting costs. Among those was an announcement by HBO’s CEO Richard Plepler that the standalone HBO was going to launch in 2015, news that quickly became the main headline from the event.""Time Warner needed to show investors that they had a plan that the Murdoch bid was not factoring in,"" said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson research.At the time, HBO also decided to cancel the internal technology investment, and to use a third party to provide the new HBO service, a move in sync with a cost efficiency plan driven by Time Warner's Chief Financial Officer Howard Averill.The more ambitious platform was going to eat up too many dollars and be too slow to come to market, sources familiar with Time Warner’s thinking said.The sources said the decision to speed up the standalone product was not related to the battle with Murdoch. They said this year was viewed as simply the right time for the initiative given that rival media companies were starting to debut online offerings outside of a traditional cable subscription. Dish Network is launching its own $20 per month Internet service later this month and CBS CBS.N has said that its Showtime network, the biggest direct competitor to HBO, will sell its own separate offering later this year. Shortly after the October announcement, HBO told its engineering team about the decision to cancel plans to develop its own technology platform. Instead of being developed internally, technology would be handled by MLB Advanced Media, a subsidiary of Major League Baseball best known for powering the technology that streams live baseball games. Going with this vendor would save millions, one of the sources close to Time Warner said.A person who had worked on the earlier HBO strategy said that pulling back from building its own platform may come back to haunt the network. “HBO and Time Warner lost the appetite for the investment required to go big here,” the person said. “Old media lost its nerve.”The people who worked on the earlier effort say there are drawbacks to having a third-party handle distribution of the product, including having less control over how subscribers experience it. They say HBO could be missing out on the long-term potential of owning all of the software behind the standalone service.An HBO spokesman, in a statement, said “any business strategy undergoes many iterations,” and that it was confident in its decision. ""We believe we landed in exactly the right place with MLB Advanced Media as our partner, and we will deliver a great product later this year that fully lives up to the reputation of the HBO brand,"" he said. DEPARTURES Among the casualties of the decision was Berkes. He left amid tensions with HBO management over his role following the change in strategy, the people who worked on the effort said. Thomas and Angeloff are leaving for similar reasons, these people said.The 80 or so employees in Seattle still have jobs but HBO is without a CTO and has no immediate plans to hire a new one.HBO declined to comment on the departures.As for the big debut, the launch plans are still vague. Company insiders had anticipated an April start date to leverage off the fifth season of the top HBO series Game of Thrones. But a source close to the matter said HBO has other big shows beginning in the summer, such as a new series of True Detective, that any launch could leverage off.The pricing of the new product and how it will be sold could not be learned. The company is exploring a number of options, including selling the standalone through pay-TV providers like Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, and through the likes of Apple AAPL.O and Amazon, one source close to the company said.

206,"   By Sai Sachin R and Lehar Maan  Time Warner Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by higher subscription fees for channels under its Turner Broadcasting and HBO units.Revenue from Turner, which owns channels such as CNN, TNT and Cartoon Network, rose 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter.  Revenue from HBO, whose popular shows include ""Game of Thrones"" and ""True Detective"", increased 6.2 percent. The two businesses together account for more than half of Time Warner's total revenue. The company's shares were little changed at $80.76 in afternoon trading. ""Subscription revenue growth will slow materially this year before re-accelerating well into the double digits in 2016 and beyond,"" Chief Financial Officer Howard Averill said on a conference call. A stronger dollar is expected to hurt subscription revenue to some extent, he said.  Time Warner cut jobs in its Turner unit last year to reduce costs and spun off its publishing business Time Inc to focus on its more profitable broadcasting businesses.Time Warner is now a ""much leaner, faster, quicker organization,"" Topeka Capital Markets analyst David Miller told Reuters on Wednesday.As a result, the company's margins are expected to grow through 2016, he said. Time Warner reported margins of 23.4 percent for 2014, adjusting for the separation of Time Inc, compared with 24.3 percent for 2013.  The company is also foraying into video-streaming, with a standalone product for HBO that will make the channel available to people without cable subscriptions this year.The company forecast adjusted profit of $4.60-$4.70 per share from continuing operations for 2015. Analysts were expecting earnings of $4.66 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Macquarie Research analyst Timothy Nollen said the company's profit forecast was good, given the negative impact of a stronger dollar.

218,"  Dish Network Corp and Time Warner reached a new agreement on Wednesday that will allow Dish subscribers continued access to Turner Broadcasting and HBO programming.The new contract caps months-long tension between the two companies. For a brief period late last year some of Turner Broadcasting's networks, including CNN and the Cartoon Network, were pulled from Dish, affecting 14 million subscribers. Those networks were restored with a deadline extension for  hashing out an agreement that included Turner's TBS and TNT networks. The new contract, the details of which were not disclosed, was announced by Turner and Time Warner on Wednesday.""We're pleased that the Dish customers we all serve can continue to enjoy Turner and HBO's popular programming on multiple platforms,"" Turner Broadcasting said in the statement. Additionally, Dish's video streaming service, Sling TV, said it will carry HBO Now - the new Internet-only product - for an additional $15 in time for the premier of the hit series ""Game of Thrones"" on April 12. Sling TV's core package, which includes content from Turner Broadcasting and ESPN, costs $20 per month.Carriage agreements - industry lingo for contracts between distributors and media companies - have been at the center of several standoffs in recent years, often resulting in programming blackouts.

221,"   By Tom Brown  HBO on Tuesday sought to turn the tables on the British sporting goods company suing it for libel over a report about child labor in India, telling a federal jury in Manhattan the claims against it were baseless.The trial, which opened Monday, follows years of litigation over the report on ""Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,"" which first aired in September 2008. The report accused British sporting goods company Mitre Sports International of turning a blind eye to contractors or subcontractors who allegedly used underaged workers to produce Mitre-branded soccer balls in India.Mitre denies the claims and says it opposes child labor.In his opening statements, HBO's lawyer Dane Butswinkas acknowledged that the report may not have been ""perfect."" But he said it took two years and ""careful detective work and follow-up"" to produce the 21-minute report.""The report was responsible, if not generous to Mitre,"" Butswinkas said, rebutting claims by Mitre's attorney that it was ""fraudulently irresponsible journalism."" Mitre, which is owned by the London-based Pentland Group, has called the report a “hatchet job.""In opening statements for Mitre on Monday, attorney Lloyd Constantine said evidence would show that children depicted in the report as stitching Mitre soccer balls together for 5 cents per hour or less were induced by HBO to pretend on camera that they were child laborers.HBO has disputed this claim. The defamation trial against Home Box Office, a Time Warner Inc subsidiary, is the first in years featuring a U.S. national broadcaster. Mitre has said it is seeking ""tens of millions of dollars"" in damages.Following HBO's opening statements on Tuesday, the 12-member jury saw a videotaped deposition from India's Kailash Satyarthi, who shared the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for his work as a children's rights activist and campaigner against child labor.Satyarthi also appeared in the Real Sports report,  alternately titled “Childhood Lost” and “Children of Industry.” He testified that local contractors or subcontractors, seeking to exploit the cheapest workers available were the biggest obstacle to ending child labor.Despite many pledges of corporate responsibility ""a company like Mitre is not able to control the supply chain,"" Satyarthi said.""The people responsible at Mitre for all the good work can never come to know the truth,"" he said.The case is Mitre Sports International Limited v.

222,"   By Tom Brown  A federal jury in Manhattan heard charges about fiction masquerading as fact on Monday, at the opening of a trial in which HBO faces libel claims over a report on child labor in India.The trial is the culmination of years of litigation over the report on ""Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,"" which first aired in September 2008. The report accused British sporting goods company Mitre Sports International of turning a blind eye to the use by contractors or subcontractors of underaged workers for the production of Mitre-branded soccer balls in India.Mitre denies the charges and says it opposes child labor. In his opening statements Lloyd Constantine, a lawyer for Mitre, said the evidence would show that children depicted in the report as stitching Mitre soccer balls for 5 cents per hour or less were induced to pretend on camera that they were child laborers. ""These poor kids are just characters,"" Constantine said, after jurors watched the 22-minute report.Gumbel's Real Sports program ""is supposed to report real news, not fiction,"" Constantine told the jury, as he went over segments of the report that he described as ""concocted"" or ""flat-out lies.""""These scenes were all staged and HBO is very good at that. They make good movies,"" Constantine said. Mitre, which is owned by the London-based Pentland Group, has called the report a “hoax” and a “hatchet job,” aimed at tarnishing the reputation of a company at the forefront of global efforts to eradicate child labor.Home Box Office Inc says it stands by the report, alternately titled “Childhood Lost” and “Children of Industry.” Ray Stallone, a spokesman for the Time Warner Inc subsidiary, has repeatedly dismissed the libel case as “without merit” and said none of the report's video footage was fabricated.The premium channel is better known for entertainment than news. But HBO also has a reputation for producing top-notch news documentaries and that reputation could take a hit if it is found guilty of ""staging"" any part of a news report. Lawyers have declined to detail the damages Mitre is seeking. But the company’s lawsuit, filed on Oct. 23, 2008, said the amount would total “tens of millions of dollars.""U.S. District Judge George Daniels said during jury selection early on Monday that the trial was expected to take up to four weeks.The case is Mitre Sports International Limited v.

223,"   By Liana B. Baker, Alina Selyukh and Diane Bartz | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Comcast Corp's board was meeting late on Thursday to finalize plans to abandon its proposed $45 billion merger with  Time Warner Cable Inc, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.An announcement is expected as early as Friday, the person added, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.Representatives of Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment.The news came a day after officials of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest U.S. cable companies, met with reviewers at the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Comcast planned to drop its offer in the face of opposition from U.S. regulators.The Justice Department is weighing whether the deal hurts competition while the FCC is weighing whether it is in the public interest.Both agencies expressed concerns, though sources told Reuters it was the FCC's strong stance that particularly tipped the scales to kill the deal.FCC reviewers told the agency staff at a Wednesday briefing that they planned to recommend taking the merger issue to an administrative law judge for a hearing, which would amount to the FCC blocking the deal.The FCC's move is its latest flex of muscle under Chairman Tom Wheeler, who recently imposed the strictest-ever regulations on Internet providers and in 2014 helped scuttle a potential merger between wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US. IMPACT ON OTHER DEALS Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy group, and an opponent of the deal, said Wall Street would now reconsider some aggressive deals. ""I thought this was an uphill battle and a real long shot,"" he said of opposition to the Comcast-TWC deal, indicating how the opposition's apparent success would influence other deals. The Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal faced vocal criticisms from some politicians, media company executives and diverse public and industry groups, who worried it would create a massive monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV. Though the two companies largely do not compete against each other, opponents have been drilling into the combined company's broadband reach and raising concerns about its potential gate-keeping power over the online video market, among others.""If reports of the collapse of the deal are true, it would be a huge victory for American consumers.” said U.S. Senator Al Franken, a Democrat of Minnesota and a vocal opponent of the merger. ""This transaction would create a telecom behemoth that would lead to higher prices, fewer choices and even worse service. We need more competition in this space, not less,"" Franken said in a statement.Earlier this week, six senators sent a letter to the FCC urging that they reject the merger.If the deal falls through, investment bankers also look to suffer as they are worried about whether they will get paid, with smaller advisory firms particularly on edge. Last week, Bloomberg reported that attorneys at the Justice Department's antitrust division were nearing a recommendation to sue to block the merger, citing concerns for consumers.Earlier, Charter Communications Inc had lost out to Comcast in a bid to acquire Time Warner Cable.A Charter spokesman had no comment on the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal or what Charter plans to do next. However, Charter's controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, has indicated continuing interest.At an investor day last November, when asked if he would pursue Time Warner Cable if the Comcast bid fell through, Liberty Media Chairman John Malone said, ""Hell yes.""Greg Maffei, chief executive of Liberty Media, had no comment on Thursday.Shares of Comcast closed up 0.8 percent at $59.23 and Time Warner Cable closed down 0.6 percent at $148.76.

It also filed its complaint because Mitre, a unit of Britain's Pentland Group, was the only soccer ball brand named in ""Children of Industry.""Pentland claims to stand at the forefront of global efforts to eradicate child labor from the sporting goods industry.Mitre's case against HBO centered largely on claims that some children shown hand-stitching Mitre soccer balls in the report, for 5 cents per hour or less, were not actual child stitchers. The company's lawyers produced sworn depositions from three of the children to bolster its contention that children were induced to pretend on camera that they were underage workers. HBO disputed those claims and countered that child laborers in Jalandhar, India, where much of ""Children of Industry"" was filmed, live in what Butswinkas described as a ""climate of fear"" and were coerced into signing false affidavits.Mitre lawyer Lloyd Constantine circled back to what he told jurors at the start of the trial in his own closing arguments on Thursday, saying ""Children of Industry"" was nothing but ""a pack of lies targeting Mitre.""HBO may have taken two years to produce the report, he said, but all it came up with was ""clever staging"" and ""fabrication.""The case is Mitre Sports International Limited v.

238,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB+' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of Time Warner Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook  remains Stable. A full list of Fitch's ratings on Time Warner follows at the end  of this release. The company had approximately $22.5 billion of debt outstanding  as of March 31, 2015. In addition, Fitch has assigned a 'BBB+' issue rating to Time Warner's proposed  issuance of benchmark-sized 10-year notes and 30-year debentures.  Proceeds from  the issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purpose including  share repurchases and the retirement of the company's 3.15% notes due July 2015.  The notes and debentures will be issued by Time Warner Inc. under the indenture  dated March 11, 2010. They will be guaranteed by Time Warner's wholly owned  subsidiary Historic TW Inc., a holding company that owns Home Box Office, Inc.  (HBO), Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS), and Warner Bros. Entertainment  Inc. (Warner Bros). In addition, HBO and TBS will guarantee Historic TW Inc.'s  guarantee of the notes and the debentures. This is the same guarantee structure  as other notes and debentures issued since November 2006. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Time Warner's consistent financial policy and capital allocation strategy  continues to revolve around investing in its businesses to strengthen its  product portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet (2.75x net leverage  target) and returning excess capital to its shareholders. Fitch does not  anticipate any change to Time Warner's financial policy, namely its 2.75x net  leverage target or its capital allocation strategy.  Shareholder returns that  exceed free cash flow (FCF - defined as cash flow from operations less capital  expenditures and dividends) generation are incorporated into the current ratings  to the extent that leverage remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold. --The stability, recurring revenue, and FCF generation of the cable networks  businesses (Turner and Home Box Office) underpin Time Warner's ratings. Time  Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring dual-stream  revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation characteristics  attributable to its cable networks businesses.  Fitch expects these businesses  will continue to generate a significant amount of Time Warner's earnings and  cash flow. --Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros.  The size and scale of Warner Bros.  television studio enables the company to capitalize on strong demand for  television content while providing meaningful diversification of revenue  sources.  --Time Warner is well positioned to address the secular threats and  opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and  continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Overall, Fitch's ratings on Time Warner reflect strong and consistent FCF, solid  credit protection measures, sound liquidity, leading scale and market positions  in core businesses, and strong content brands. In addition, Time Warner's lower  exposure to cyclical advertising revenues relative to its peer group, and lack  of exposure to the hyper-cyclical local advertising markets, provides  incremental support to the ratings.  Time Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable networks businesses. A key operating  strategy within its cable networks businesses will be to continue to leverage  increased investment in original and sports programming to accelerate domestic  affiliate fee revenue growth. Fitch recognizes the ongoing secular shifts within  the pay television industry, including changing media consumption patterns, a  growing preference for time-shifted viewing, and intensifying competition from  emerging distribution platforms, that continue to drive audience fragmentation  and mute multichannel video subscription growth as subscribers migrate away from  the traditional pay television ecosystem.  These factors, along with potential  cable industry consolidation, have the capacity to hamper anticipated affiliate  fee revenue growth over the longer term. Fitch believes that Time Warner has  successfully secured renewed affiliation agreements with the majority of leading  multichannel video programming distributors which removes a significant portion  of the risk related to expected affiliation fee increases during the rating  horizon.  In addition, Turner networks have been included in emerging OTT  platforms, providing further evidence of demand for its content across  distribution platforms, and to the extent the new platforms are successful can  help mitigate modest subscriber declines in the traditional multichannel  ecosystem. Fitch expects mid-single-digit top line growth, expanding margins and  high FCF conversion over the next several years, driven by domestic affiliate  fee growth and international expansion.   The company plans to increase its investment in original programming across all  of its cable networks, which should improve viewership, strengthen network  brands and translate into higher affiliate fees and stable advertising revenues.  Turner has its sports rights portfolio under long-term contracts with the new  NBA deal in place and starting during the 2016/2017 season.  Sports rights are  expected to represent a growing portion of Turner's overall programing budget.   From Fitch's perspective the investment in sports programming is critical to  securing affiliate rate increases and advertising revenue growth.  Additionally,  Time Warner's investment in original programming across domestic networks is  expected to grow.  Overall, Turner expects to double the number of original  programming hours on TNT and TBS between 2014 and 2020. The company will seek to  diversify its programming with more distinctive and younger skewing programs.   HBO added approximately 2.8 million subscribers during 2014, ending the year  with 46 million domestic subscribers.  Central to HBO's growth plans is to  leverage its continuing investment in original programming to increase domestic  penetration of HBO's service, convert non-revenue-generating subscribers and  address a growing market of potential subscribers outside the multichannel video  service universe.  Fitch believes the launch of a streaming OTT service is in  step with HBO's operating objectives to maintain content and programming  leadership, and invest in technology to improve customer experience and service  capabilities while increasing domestic subscriber penetration and capitalizing  on revenue growth opportunities. Key to HBO's operating profile is securing  affiliate agreement renewals on favorable terms that can translate into an  acceleration of subscription revenue growth over the ratings horizon.   Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. Their size and scale enable Time  Warner to capitalize on strong demand for television content while providing  meaningful diversification of revenue sources. Warner Bros. strategic priorities  include expanding its leadership in TV production beyond broadcast, focusing on  global franchises to grow its theatrical business and improving margins through  cost reduction efforts.  Embedded in the strategy is more collaboration with  Turner networks in scripted and kids programming.  Fitch is cognizant of the  inherent volatility of hit-driven content in the film and television production  businesses. Fitch also acknowledges Time Warner's risk mitigation processes  (film co-financing arrangements, etc.) and strong track record of consistently  generating desirable content.  Fitch remains convinced that Time Warner is well positioned to address the  threats and opportunities present in the evolving media landscape, including the  growing prominence of alternative distribution platforms and audience  fragmentation within the context of a stagnant multichannel video subscriber  base, providing sufficient flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate  the company's leverage target and capital allocation strategy. Fitch also  believes demand for high-quality content remains strong across all major  end-markets (broadcast, cable networks, and subscription video on demand) and  that large, well-capitalized content providers, such as Time Warner, will remain  crucial to the industry. Outside of a material change to its financial strategy or event-driven merger  and acquisition activity, ratings concerns center on Time Warner's ability to  balance escalating programming expense and production costs with the requirement  to consistently deliver programming that drives incremental share of viewing  audience while maintaining or expanding operating margins. Leverage and Financial Policy Time Warner's financial structure and strategy remain relatively consistent.  In  Fitch's opinion the positive operating momentum coupled with predictable,  recurring FCF generated by Time Warner's strong portfolio of businesses is  leverageable, providing a sound basis to accommodate Time Warner's net leverage  target within the context of the current 'BBB+' rating. Fitch anticipates that Time Warner will increase debt over the ratings horizon  to meet its net leverage target of 2.75x. Shareholder returns that exceed FCF  generation are incorporated into current ratings to the extent that leverage  remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold, which remains unchanged. Total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2015 was approximately $22.5 billion,  which is in line with total debt outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2014 and an 11%  increase relative to March 31, 2014.  Consolidated leverage was 2.9x (calculated  on a gross basis excluding restructuring and programming impairments) and 2.6x  (calculated on a net debt basis) as of the LTM ended March 31, 2015.  SHAREHOLDER RETURNS Time Warner's capital allocation strategy remains consistent and is centered on  investing in its businesses to strengthen its product portfolio, maintaining a  strong balance sheet and returning excess capital to its shareholders. Fitch  believes the ratings provide sufficient capacity to accommodate the company's  capital allocation policy.  Shareholder returns that exceed FCF generation are  incorporated into the current ratings to the extent that leverage remains below  Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold.  Fitch acknowledges that Time Warner's  share repurchase authorization and dividend payment represents a significant use  of cash; however, Fitch believes that the company would reduce the level of  share repurchases should the operating environment materially change, in order  to maximize flexibility.   Time Warner returned over $6.6 billion of capital to its shareholders during  2014 representing 206% of FCF before dividends.  Shareholder returns benefited  during 2014 from the company's decision to increase its net debt leverage target  from 2.5x to 2.75x and the cash generated from the sale of space in the Time  Warner Center office building ($1.3 billion).  Fitch expects that 2015 total  shareholder returns will be lower than in 2014 and will be managed within the  context of the company's 2.75x net leverage target.   FCF and Liquidity Time Warner generated approximately $1.4 billion of FCF (Fitch defined as cash  flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends) from continuing  operations during the LTM ended March 31, 2015.  This follows the generation of  approximately $2.1 billion of FCF from continuing operations during the  year-ended Dec. 31, 2014.  Fitch expects TWX's FCF generation during 2015 will  be suppressed by severance payments related to 2014 restructuring actions, and  higher working capital use related to large syndication sales and to a lesser  extent by higher cash taxes and interest payments.  Fitch expects that the  higher investment in programming, production and capital expenditures will  translate into strong FCF generation during the ratings horizon.  Fitch believes  the strong FCF profile will be led by the revenue, operating margin, and low  capital requirement characteristics of the company's Turner and Home Box Office  businesses. The FCF generation affords the company significant financial  flexibility.  Time Warner's liquidity is strong and supported by $2.26 billion of cash on hand  as of March 31, 2015, $5 billion in credit facilities (all of which was  available as of March 31, 2015), and expected FCF generation. Time Warner's  revolver commitments mature on Dec. 18, 2019. These facilities provide liquidity  back-up for Time Warner's $5 billion commercial paper program.  There was no  commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2015. Time Warner's debt maturity  profile is well laddered and within Fitch's FCF expectations.  Scheduled  maturities include $1 billion during July 2015, $1.15 billion during 2016, and  $500 million during 2017.  Fitch expects the company to refinance this debt with  either new long-term debt or issuance of CP. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --The model assumes that the Turner cable networks businesses' revenues continue  to grow at a mid-single-digits pace, driven by higher affiliate fees and stable  advertising revenues.     --HBO revenues are expected to grow mid-single digits driven in large part by  affiliate rate increases (as opposed to subscriber growth).  Fitch expects HBO's  operating margin will benefit from cost restructuring efforts taken during 2014  and the operating leverage present within the business.  --The film and television studios are anticipated to grow at low- to mid-single  digits during the forecasted periods.  This segment is benefited by continued  demand for television content, international expansion, and digital delivery,  offset by ongoing declines in DVDs.  --Stable operating margins due to positive operating leverage of its businesses  and higher margin profile of digital delivery versus physical offset somewhat by  higher overall investment in programming and production. -- Increased programming and production investment in the businesses.   --The base case assumes that shareholder returns continue so the company can  manage to its 2.75x net leverage target. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not contemplate additional positive rating actions over the current  ratings horizon. That notwithstanding, positive rating action would likely  coincide with Time Warner adopting a more conservative financial policy provided  Time Warner continues to demonstrate that its operating profile is sustainable  amid ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption patterns and  evolving technology platforms. Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary actions  of Time Warner's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting  a more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition  activity that drives leverage beyond Fitch's 3.5x threshold in the absence of a  creditable de-leveraging plan. Additionally, negative rating actions could  result should Fitch begin to observe a weakening of Time Warner's ability to  produce desired film and television content or secure programming on its cable  networks that consistently delivers viewing audience ratings, leading to lower  subscription fee or advertising revenues. Further, a weakening of Time Warner's  competitive position due to its failure to adapt to emerging distribution  platforms could prompt Fitch to take negative rating actions. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch affirms Time Warner's ratings as follows: Time Warner Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures at 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. Time Warner International Finance Limited --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

239,"  Time Warner Inc unit HBO is considering moving film production of the Emmy award-winning show ""Veep"" to California from Maryland for better tax incentives, a spokesman said on Wednesday.""Veep,"" the comedy starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a U.S. vice president, is one of four shows selected to receive tax credits for relocating production to California, according to the California Film Commission.The panel has earmarked $6.5 million in film tax credits to ""Veep"" if the show moves to California, the commission's executive director, Amy Lemisch, said in a statement on Tuesday.HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer said: ""We're exploring our options right now.""Other shows that were selected for California tax credits are FX's ""American Horror Story,"" ABC's ""Secrets and Lies,"" and VH1's ""Hindsight."" ""Veep"" has been filmed in Maryland for four years, primarily in Columbia, Baltimore and Sykesville.""Veep"" received $13.9 million in tax credits in its first three seasons, said Karen Bell Hood of Maryland's Department of Business and Economic Development. The state has not earmarked tax credits toward the next season, she said.In November, Maryland lawmakers proposed ending the tax credits in 2016. In a report, they said the program was too costly to taxpayers and filming production brought little economic benefits.

241,"  (UPDATES with launch)     By Davide Scigliuzzo     NEW YORK, July 9 (IFR) - US cable giant Charter Communications finally made its way to the high-grade bond market on Thursday, launching a US$15.5bn bond to help fund its US$56bn takeover of Time Warner Cable.     The split-rated trade had amassed more than US$40bn of orders at the time it was launched, allowing Charter to tighten pricing on all six tranches.     Goldman Sachs was global coordinator on the deal - rated Ba1/BBB-/BBB- by Moody's, S&P and Fitch - with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse as active books, and Deutsche Bank and UBS as passives.     Charter was expected to pay about 8bp-15bp in new issue concessions compared with Time Warner outstandings - an impressive result given the recent volatility in the market.     The bonds were quoting about 5bp tighter than their launch levels in the gray market.         The senior secured notes are part of what is expected to be a US$31bn M&A funding package that will also include high-yield bonds and bank debt.

BakerSept 17 U.S. cable TV operator Cablevision Systems Corp has agreed to a $17.7 billion takeover offer by European telecommunications company Altice, according to two people familiar with the matter, the latest acquisitions in a sector struggling with declining viewership.Shares of Cablevision, which is controlled by New York's Dolan family, jumped as much as 16 percent to $33.12 after the bell as details of the takeover deal, which includes Cablevision's debt, became public. The New York Times had earlier reported on the deal. (nyti.ms/1F3kZKc) The sources said Altice will pay $34.90 per share for Cablevision and will finance the deal through banks and by selling additional shares.As part of the deal, BC Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the minority stake holders of Suddenlink , may buy 30 percent of Cablevision's equity, the sources added.The sources declined to be identified as the matter remained confidential. Altice and Cablevision could not be immediately reached for comment. Cablevision, which operates primarily in the Greater New York area, was valued at $7.89 billion as of Wednesday's close based on its outstanding shares as of July 31. Its debt levels were not immediately known.Altice Group is a multinational cable and telecommunications company which has said it was keen to acquire more U.S. cable TV firms. The Cablevision takeover is its second this year. In May, it agreed to buy Suddenlink, the seventh largest U.S. cable company, for $9.1 billion from private equity investors, its first move across the Atlantic.U.S. cable companies are struggling with declining subscriber numbers, with viewers shifting to cheaper and more flexible streaming services offered by the likes of Netflix Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Hulu, triggering a wave of acquisitions in the sector this year.AT&T Inc became the largest U.S. pay-TV company in July after it completed its $48.5 billion merger with the biggest satellite-TV provider DirecTV.Time Warner Cable Inc said in July that it was working towards closing a deal to be bought by Charter Communications Inc.Earlier this year, Altice held talks with Time Warner about a possible deal.

246,"  PRAGUE Oct 1 Broadcaster Central European Media Enterprises (CME)  has secured a 235.3 million euro ($264 million) credit facility backed by its main shareholder, Time Warner, to refinance debt maturing this year.But CME, which runs TV stations in six central and eastern European markets, still has to refinance its most expensive debt, the 2017 payment-in-kind (PIK) notes issued as part of a financing deal with Time Warner in 2014Those notes carry a 15 percent interest rate and their principal accounts for $467.4 million of total debt. Company executives told Reuters this month refinancing those notes was a priority. CME has undergone a programme of restructuring, cost cuts and divestments in the past two years, backed by cash injections and financing deals from Time Warner.The latest deal, which CME had flagged earlier this year, will result in more than half of CME's debt being in euros, mitigating some risk as it grapples with a stronger dollar against the local currencies it operates with in its markets. The credit agreement, maturing in November 2019, will bear an interest rate of 3-month Euribor plus 1.07-1.90 percent, depending on the credit rating of Time Warner, CME said. The company will also pay Time Warner a guarantee fee of 8.50 percent minus the interest rate paid under the credit agreement, multiplied by the principal amount of loans outstanding under the agreement, which can be paid in cash or in kind.CME had net debt of $1.02 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $979.7 million three months before.

Analysts on average had expected $5.60.

The company, which has exceeded profit estimates in the first three quarters of 2015, kept its full-year adjusted profit forecast of $4.60-$4.70 from continuing operations.Time Warner's total revenue rose 5.1 percent to $6.56 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30.Net income attributable to shareholders rose 7 percent to $1.04 billion, or $1.26 per share.Excluding items, Time Warner earned $1.25 per share.Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.09 per share on revenue of $6.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to Tuesday's close of $70.77, Time Warner's stock had fallen about 9.5 percent this year.

EARNINGS BEAT ESTIMATES At the shares' low, the selloff wiped out about $6.5 billion of market value.Time Warner said it now expected adjusted earnings of $5.25 per share for 2016, down from its earlier forecast of ""close to $6"". Analysts on average had expected $5.60.The company's shares were down slightly in earlier trading after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit and revenue, boosted by higher HBO subscription fees and a rise in licensing revenue at its Warner Bros. studio business. Revenue at Warner Bros. rose about 15 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30, helped by the releases of the ""LEGO Dimensions"" and ""Mad Max"" videogames.The syndication of TV shows ""2 Broke Girls"" and ""Person of Interest"" also boosted revenue at the studio, which accounts for about half of Time Warner's total revenue.Revenue at HBO rose 4.8 percent as more people signed up for popular shows such as ""Game of Thrones"" and ""True Detective"".The company, which has exceeded profit estimates in the first three quarters of 2015, kept its full-year adjusted profit forecast of $4.60-$4.70 from continuing operations.Time Warner's total revenue rose 5.1 percent to $6.56 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30.Net income attributable to shareholders rose 7 percent to $1.04 billion, or $1.26 per share.Excluding items, Time Warner earned $1.25 per share.Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.09 per share on revenue of $6.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to Tuesday's close of $70.77, Time Warner's stock had fallen about 9.5 percent this year.(Reporting By Arathy S Nair and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Ted Kerr)",2015-11-04,TWX,"Wed Nov 4, 2015 | 12:46pm EST","UPDATE 4-Time Warner warns on ad revenue as ratings fall, shares plunge",http://www.reuters.com//article/time-warner-results-idUSL3N12Z4JY20151104?type=companyNews

256,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to Time  Warner Inc.'s (Time Warner) issuance of benchmark-sized senior unsecured notes  due 2026 (2026 notes) and senior unsecured debentures due 2045 (2045  debentures). The 2045 debentures constitute an additional issuance of the  existing $600 million 4.85% Debentures due 2045. The net proceeds will be used  for general corporate purposes. Fitch currently has a 'BBB+' Issuer Default  Rating for Time Warner, with a Stable Outlook. The company had approximately  $22.9 billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2015.  The issuance is consistent with Fitch's expectation that Time Warner will  increase its debt over the ratings horizon to meet its net leverage target of  2.75x. Shareholder returns that exceed free cash flow (FCF) generation are  incorporated into current ratings to the extent that leverage remains below  Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold, which remains unchanged. Consolidated  leverage was 2.8x (calculated on a gross basis excluding restructuring and  programming impairments) and 2.6x (calculated on a net debt basis) as of the LTM  ended Sept. 30, 2015.  The notes will be issued by Time Warner Inc. under the indenture dated March 11,  2010. They will be guaranteed by Time Warner's wholly owned subsidiary Historic  TW Inc., a holding company that owns Home Box Office, Inc. (HBO), Turner  Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS), and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (Warner  Bros.). In addition, HBO and TBS will guarantee Historic TW Inc.'s guarantee of  the notes and the debentures. This is the same guarantee structure as Time  Warner's other notes and debentures issued after November 2006. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Time Warner's consistent financial policy and capital allocation strategy  continues to revolve around investing in its businesses to strengthen its  product portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet (2.75x net leverage  target) and returning excess capital to its shareholders. Fitch does not  anticipate any change to Time Warner's financial policy, namely its 2.75x net  leverage target or its capital allocation strategy. Shareholder returns that  exceed FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and  dividends) generation are incorporated into the current ratings to the extent  that leverage remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold. --The stability, recurring revenue, and FCF generation of the cable networks  businesses (Turner and Home Box Office) underpin Time Warner's ratings. Time  Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring dual-stream  revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation characteristics  attributable to its cable networks businesses. Fitch expects these businesses  will continue to generate a significant amount of the company's earnings and  cash flow. --Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. The size and scale of Warner Bros.  television studio enables the company to capitalize on strong demand for  television content while providing meaningful diversification of revenue  sources.  --Time Warner is well positioned to address the secular threats and  opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and  continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Overall, Fitch's ratings on Time Warner reflect strong and consistent FCF  generation, solid credit protection measures, sound liquidity, leading scale and  market positions in core businesses, and strong content brands. In addition,  Time Warner's lower exposure to cyclical advertising revenues relative to its  peer group, and lack of exposure to the hyper-cyclical local advertising  markets, provides incremental support to the ratings.  Time Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable networks businesses. A key operating  strategy within its cable networks businesses will be to continue to leverage  increased investment in original and sports programming to accelerate domestic  affiliate fee revenue growth. Fitch recognizes the ongoing secular shifts within the pay television industry,  including changing media consumption patterns, a growing preference for  time-shifted viewing, and intensifying competition from emerging distribution  platforms, that continue to drive audience fragmentation and mute multichannel  video subscription growth as subscribers migrate away from the traditional pay  television ecosystem. These factors, along with the potential shift to skinny  bundles video service offering from cable MSO'sS, have the capacity to hamper  anticipated affiliate fee revenue growth over the longer term. Fitch believes  that Time Warner has successfully secured renewed affiliation agreements with  the majority of leading multichannel video programming distributors, which  removes a significant portion of the risk related to expected affiliation fee  increases during the rating horizon. In addition, Turner networks have been  included in emerging OTT platforms, providing further evidence of demand for its  content across distribution platforms, and, to the extent the new platforms are  successful can help mitigate modest subscriber declines in the traditional  multichannel ecosystem. Fitch expects mid-single-digit top-line growth,  expanding margins and high FCF conversion over the next several years, driven by  domestic affiliate fee growth and international expansion.  Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. Their size and scale enable Time  Warner to capitalize on strong demand for television content while providing  meaningful diversification of revenue sources. Warner Bros. strategic priorities  include expanding its leadership in TV production beyond broadcast, focusing on  global franchises to grow its theatrical business and improving margins through  cost reduction efforts. Embedded in the strategy is more collaboration with  Turner networks in scripted and kids programming. Fitch is cognizant of the  inherent volatility of hit-driven content in the film and television production  businesses. Fitch also acknowledges Time Warner's risk mitigation processes  (film co-financing arrangements, etc.) and strong track record of consistently  generating desirable content.  Fitch remains convinced that Time Warner is well positioned to address the  threats and opportunities present in the evolving media landscape, including the  growing prominence of alternative distribution platforms and audience  fragmentation within the context of a stagnant multichannel video subscriber  base, providing sufficient flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate  the company's leverage target and capital allocation strategy. Fitch also  believes demand for high-quality content remains strong across all major  end-markets (broadcast, cable networks, and subscription video on demand) and  that large, well-capitalized content providers, such as Time Warner, will remain  crucial to the industry. Outside of a material change to its financial strategy or event-driven merger  and acquisition activity, ratings concerns center on Time Warner's ability to  balance escalating programming expense and production costs with the requirement  to consistently deliver programming that drives incremental share of viewing  audience while maintaining or expanding operating margins. Leverage and Financial Policy Time Warner's financial structure and strategy remain relatively consistent. In  Fitch's opinion the positive operating momentum coupled with predictable,  recurring FCF generated by Time Warner's strong portfolio of businesses is  leverageable, providing a sound basis to accommodate the company's net leverage  target within the context of the current 'BBB+' rating. Fitch anticipates that Time Warner will increase debt over the ratings horizon  to meet its net leverage target of 2.75x. Shareholder returns that exceed FCF  generation are incorporated into current ratings to the extent that leverage  remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold, which remains unchanged. Total debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2015 was approximately $22.9 billion,  which is in line with the $22.5 billion in total debt outstanding as of Sept.  30, 2014. Consolidated leverage was 2.8x (calculated on a gross basis excluding  restructuring and programming impairments) and 2.6x (calculated on a net debt  basis) as of the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2015.  SHAREHOLDER RETURNS Time Warner's capital allocation strategy remains consistent and is centered on  investing in its businesses to strengthen its product portfolio, maintaining a  strong balance sheet and returning excess capital to its shareholders. Fitch  believes the ratings provide sufficient capacity to accommodate the company's  capital allocation policy. Shareholder returns that exceed FCF generation are  incorporated into the current ratings to the extent that leverage remains below  Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold. Fitch acknowledges that Time Warner's  share repurchase authorization and dividend payment represents a significant use  of cash; however, Fitch believes the company would reduce the level of share  repurchases should the operating environment materially change, in order to  maximize flexibility.  Time Warner returned approximately $3.9billion of capital to its shareholders  through Sept. 30, 2015 representing 142% of FCF before dividends. Shareholder  returns of $6.6 billion during  2014 benefited from the company's decision to  increase its net debt leverage target from 2.5x to 2.75x and the cash generated  from the sale of space in the Time Warner Center office building ($1.3 billion).  Fitch expects that 2015 total shareholder returns will be lower than in 2014 and  will be managed within the context of the company's 2.75x net leverage target.  FCF and Liquidity Time Warner generated approximately $2.5 billion of FCF (defined as cash flow  from operations less capital expenditures and dividends) from continuing  operations during the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2015, a 18% increase relative to FCF  generation during the year ended Dec. 31, 2014. Fitch expects that the higher  investment in programming, production and capital expenditures will translate  into strong FCF generation during the ratings horizon. Fitch believes the strong  FCF profile will be led by the revenue, operating margin, and low capital  requirement characteristics of the company's Turner and Home Box Office  businesses. The FCF generation affords the company significant financial  flexibility.  Time Warner's liquidity is strong and supported by $1.8 billion of cash on hand  as of Sept. 30, 2015, $5 billion in credit facilities (all of which was  available as of Sept. 30, 2015), and expected FCF generation. Time Warner's  revolver commitments mature on Dec. 18, 2019. These facilities provide liquidity  back-up for Time Warner's $5 billion commercial paper (CP) program. There was no  CP outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2015. Time Warner's debt maturity profile is well  laddered and within Fitch's FCF expectations. Scheduled maturities include $150  million during 2016, and $500 million during 2017. Fitch expects the company to  refinance this debt with either new long-term debt or issuance of CP. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --The model assumes that the Turner cable networks businesses' revenues continue  to grow at a mid-single-digits pace, driven by higher affiliate fees and stable  advertising revenues.  --HBO revenues are expected to grow mid-single digits driven in large part by  affiliate rate increases (as opposed to subscriber growth). Fitch expects HBO's  operating margin will benefit from cost restructuring efforts taken during 2014  and the operating leverage present within the business.  --The film and television studios are anticipated to grow at low- to mid-single  digits during the forecasted periods. This segment benefits from continued  demand for television content, international expansion, and digital delivery,  offset by ongoing declines in DVDs.  --Stable operating margins due to positive operating leverage of its businesses  and higher margin profile of digital delivery versus physical are offset  somewhat by higher overall investment in programming and production. --Increased programming and production investment in the businesses.  --The base case assumes that shareholder returns continue so the company can  manage to its 2.75x net leverage target. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not contemplate additional positive rating actions over the current  ratings horizon. That notwithstanding, positive rating action would likely  coincide with Time Warner adopting a more conservative financial policy provided  it continues to demonstrate that its operating profile is sustainable amid  ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption patterns and evolving  technology platforms. Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary actions  of Time Warner's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting  a more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition  activity that drives leverage beyond Fitch's 3.5x threshold in the absence of a  creditable de-leveraging plan. Additionally, negative rating actions could  result should Fitch begin to observe a weakening of Time Warner's ability to  produce desired film and television content or secure programming on its cable  networks that consistently delivers viewing audience ratings, leading to lower  subscription or advertising revenues. Further, a weakening of its competitive  position due to its failure to adapt to emerging distribution platforms could  prompt Fitch to take negative rating actions.

257,"  TORONTO Nov 19 Canada's BCE Inc is expanding its control of HBO content in Canada, scooping up distribution rights in the west of the country from Corus Entertainment Inc and inking an extensive deal with the premium U.S. cable network that includes online delivery.BCE, Canada's largest telecom company and a major media company, will pay Corus C$211 million ($158.7 million) for  those rights, the two companies said in statements on Thursday.The deal directly with Time Warner Inc's HBO will give BCE's Bell Media unit exclusive rights for its linear, on-demand, and over-the-top platforms ""well into the next decade,"" BCE said. Financial terms for that agreement were not disclosed. BCE has spent billions to buy media companies over the last five years but struggled to deal with the loss of a lucrative sports contract and competition from streaming services such as Netflix.The deal means first-run programming of HBO content such as Game of Thrones could be pushed to BCE's Crave TV subscription service, which it plans to make available to any Canadian with an Internet connection from January. The media landscape in Canada is in flux as companies jostle ahead of the 2016 implementation of new rules that will force them to offer a smaller basic package of television channels to subscribers who can then add individual channels. Bell Media already served up HBO content in eastern Canada via The Movie Network channel, while Corus had been offering it from west of Ontario.Corus said the axing of its pay TV business in Western Canada was part of a strategic focus on core national media brands targeting kids, women and families.

258,"  * For other news from Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, click hereBy Jessica ToonkelNEW YORK Nov 19  It is not just millennials looking to cut the cable television cord: famed 73-year old billionaire value investor Mario Gabelli is planning to make a similar move.""I just got my bill for cable and it was outrageous,"" Gabelli said at the Reuters Global Investment Summit in New York on Thursday. ""So I'm going to start cutting.""Gabelli, chief executive officer of Rye, New York-based GAMCO Investors Inc, addressed the rapidly shifting landscape of the media, cable and technology industries. More and more consumers - especially teenagers and younger adults known as the millennial generation - now prefer to watch TV and movies on demand on a variety of devices, and that change in habit is reshaping the way media creators and distributors do business.""We do think there is going to be a lot of cord-cutting,"" Gabelli said, referring to people dumping their pricey cable and satellite subscriptions in favor or smaller packages delivered by streaming video services. Gabelli said he dropped his subscription for satellite TV provider DirecTV as well.As a result, he and other like-minded consumers will increasingly want high-speed broadband, said Gabelli. As that demand grows, he said big players such as Alphabet Inc  and Amazon.com Inc will have to pay more for their share of network traffic as they hog high-speed bandwidth. ""So who is going to maintain that highway and how are they going to get paid for it?,"" Gabelli asked, referring to the cable operators and telecommunications companies which provide broadband services.Cablevision Systems Corp is one of the top holdings of the Gabelli Asset Fund and the Gabelli Value 25 Fund, which Gabelli co-manages. The cable operator held by the Dolan family has agreed to sell it to Patrick Drahi's Altice in deal valued at $17.7 billion. Gabelli said he expects another round of consolidation in the cable industry, as well as in media in general.While Time Warner Inc, owner of premium cable network HBO, deflected a bid from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc  last year, Gabelli expects Time Warner to be involved in a deal at some point.""Something is going to happen,"" he said.

273,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A California administrative law judge recommended approving Charter Communications Inc's (CHTR.O) proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable TWC.N and Bright House Networks with some significant conditions, according to a decision made public late on Tuesday.California is the last state where the deal still faces approval. The approval by various states is in addition to a decision by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which is continuing its review of the transactions that would make Charter the No. 2 U.S. internet and cable company after Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).In California, the decision faces a vote by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as early as May 12.Charter said last May it would buy Time Warner Cable, the fourth-largest U.S. cable company, in a $56 billion cash-and-stock deal. Charter also announced in March 2015 it would buy Bright House Networks in a $10.4 billion deal.In his proposed decision, CPUC Administrative Law Judge Karl Bemesderfer found that the merger was ""in the public interest."" But the 70-page proposed decision imposes significant conditions on Charter. Within two and a half years of closing the transaction, Charter must convert all households in its California service territory to an all-digital platform with download speeds of not less than 60 Mbps - higher speeds than many users currently have.In addition, Charter must offer all customers in California the option of acquiring their own modems and cable set-top boxes without any price increases.The proposed decision also says Charter must comply with the FCC's open internet ""net neutrality"" order - even if a federal appeals court strikes it down. A court ruling on the FCC order could come as early as this week. California's five-member commission often amends a proposed decision before approving it. A commissioner could also propose an alternate decision.Charter said in a statement late Tuesday it was ""pleased the regulatory process is moving forward and will continue our productive engagement at the California Public Utilities Commission as we work toward obtaining final approval in the weeks ahead and bringing the benefits of New Charter to more Californians.” The proposed decision would impose other restrictions on Charter for three years: It could not adopt fees for users to use specific third-party internet applications and could not engage in usage-based billing or impose data caps during that time frame.Last week, Charter's chief executive met with the head of the FCC on the proposed tie-ups.New Charter would be the third-largest pay-TV provider in the country, serving roughly 17.3 million customers, and the second-largest broadband provider, with 19.4 million subscribers in nearly 40 states.

283,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to Time  Warner Inc.'s (Time Warner) $800 million issuance of 2.95% senior unsecured  notes due 2026 (the 2026 notes). Net proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes. Fitch currently rates Time Warner Long-Term 'BBB+' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) with a Stable Outlook. The company had approximately $23.7 billion  of debt outstanding as of March 31, 2016. The issuance is consistent with Time Warner's capital allocation and financial  policy including maintaining a net leverage target of 2.75x. Shareholder returns  that exceed free cash flow (FCF) generation are incorporated into current  ratings to the extent that leverage remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage  threshold, which remains unchanged. Consolidated leverage was 2.9x (calculated  on a gross basis excluding restructuring and programming impairments) and 2.7x  (calculated on a net debt basis) as of the LTM ended March 31, 2016. The notes will be issued by Time Warner Inc. under the indenture dated March 11,  2010. They will be guaranteed by Time Warner's wholly owned subsidiary Historic  TW Inc., a holding company that owns Home Box Office, Inc. (HBO), Turner  Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS), and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (Warner  Bros.). In addition, HBO and TBS will guarantee Historic TW Inc.'s guarantee of  the notes. This is the same guarantee structure as Time Warner's other notes and  debentures issued after November 2006. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Time Warner's consistent financial policy and capital allocation strategy  continues to revolve around investing in its businesses to strengthen its  product portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet (2.75x net leverage  target) and returning excess capital to its shareholders. Fitch does not  anticipate any change to Time Warner's financial policy, namely its 2.75x net  leverage target or its capital allocation strategy. Shareholder returns that  exceed FCF (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and  dividends) generation are incorporated into the current ratings to the extent  that leverage remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold. --The stability, recurring revenue, and FCF generation of the cable networks  businesses (Turner and Home Box Office) underpin Time Warner's ratings. Its  operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring dual-stream revenue  profile, high operating margin and FCF generation characteristics attributable  to its cable networks businesses. Fitch expects these businesses will continue  to generate a significant amount of the company's earnings and cash flow. --Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. The size and scale of the Warner  Bros. television studio enables the company to capitalize on strong demand for  television content while providing meaningful diversification of revenue  sources.  --Time Warner is well positioned to address the secular threats and  opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and  continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Overall, Fitch's ratings for Time Warner reflect strong and consistent FCF  generation, solid credit protection measures, sound liquidity, leading scale and  market positions in core businesses, and strong content brands. In addition,  Time Warner's lower exposure to cyclical advertising revenues relative to its  peer group, and lack of exposure to the hyper-cyclical local advertising  markets, provides incremental support to the ratings.  Time Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable networks businesses. A key operating  strategy within its cable networks businesses will be to continue to leverage  increased investment in original and sports programming to continue driving  healthy domestic affiliate fee revenue growth. Fitch recognizes the ongoing secular shifts within the pay television industry,  including changing media consumption patterns, a growing preference for  time-shifted viewing, and intensifying competition from emerging distribution  platforms that continue to drive audience fragmentation and mute multichannel  video subscription growth as subscribers migrate away from the traditional pay  television ecosystem. These factors, along with the potential shift to the  skinny bundles video service offerings from cable MSOs, have the capacity to  hamper anticipated affiliate fee revenue growth over the longer term. Time  Warner has successfully renewed affiliation agreements with the majority of  leading multichannel video programming distributors, which removes a significant  portion of the risk related to expected affiliation fee increases during the  rating horizon. In addition, Turner networks have been included in emerging OTT  platforms, providing further evidence of demand for its content across  distribution platforms, and, to the extent the new platforms are successful, can  help mitigate modest subscriber declines in the traditional multichannel  ecosystem and continues to pursue new opportunities outside of the traditional  ecosystem to take advantage of the shift of consumption patterns and help drive  incremental growth. Fitch expects mid-single-digit top-line growth, expanding  margins and high FCF conversion over the next several years, driven by domestic  affiliate fee growth and international expansion.  Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. Their size and scale enable Time  Warner to capitalize on strong demand for television content while providing  meaningful diversification of revenue sources. Warner Bros. strategic priorities  include expanding its leadership in TV production beyond broadcast, focusing on  global franchises to grow its theatrical business and improving margins through  cost reduction efforts. Embedded in the strategy is more collaboration with  Turner networks in scripted and kids programming. Fitch is cognizant of the  inherent volatility of hit-driven content in the film and television production  businesses. Fitch also acknowledges Time Warner's risk mitigation processes  (film co-financing arrangements, etc.) and strong track record of consistently  generating desirable content.  Fitch remains convinced that Time Warner is well positioned to address the  threats and opportunities present in the evolving media landscape, including the  growing prominence of alternative distribution platforms and audience  fragmentation within the context of a stagnant multichannel video subscriber  base, providing sufficient flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate  the company's leverage target and capital allocation strategy. Fitch also  believes demand for high-quality content remains strong across all major  end-markets (broadcast, cable networks, and subscription video on demand) and  that large, well-capitalized content providers, such as Time Warner, will remain  crucial to the industry. Outside of a material change to its financial strategy or event-driven merger  and acquisition activity, rating concerns center on Time Warner's ability to  balance escalating programming expense and production costs with the requirement  to consistently deliver programming that drives an incremental share of viewing  audience while maintaining or expanding operating margins. Leverage and Financial Policy Time Warner's financial structure and strategy remain consistent. In Fitch's  opinion the positive operating momentum coupled with predictable, recurring FCF  generated by Time Warner's strong portfolio of businesses is leverageable,  providing a sound basis to accommodate the company's net leverage target within  the context of the current 'BBB+' rating. Fitch expects that Time Warner will increase debt over the ratings horizon to  meet its net leverage target of 2.75x. Shareholder returns that exceed FCF  generation are incorporated into current ratings to the extent that leverage  remains below Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold, which remains unchanged. Total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2016 was approximately $23.7 billion,  reflecting a 5.8% increase relative to the $22.4 billion in total as of March  31, 2015. Consolidated leverage was 2.9x (calculated on a gross basis excluding  restructuring and programming impairments) and 2.7x (calculated on a net debt  basis) as of the LTM ended March 31, 2016.  SHAREHOLDER RETURNS Time Warner's capital allocation strategy remains consistent and is centered on  investing in its businesses to strengthen its product portfolio, maintaining a  strong balance sheet and returning excess capital to its shareholders. Fitch  believes the ratings provide sufficient capacity to accommodate the company's  capital allocation policy. Shareholder returns that exceed FCF generation are  incorporated into the current ratings to the extent that leverage remains below  Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold. Fitch acknowledges that Time Warner's  share repurchase authorization and dividend payment represent a significant use  of cash; however, we believe the company would reduce the level of share  repurchases should the operating environment materially change, in order to  maximize flexibility.  Time Warner returned approximately $4.6 billion of capital to its shareholders  through the LTM period ended March 31, 2016, representing 147% of FCF before  dividends. Fitch expects that 2016 total shareholder returns will be lower than  in 2015 and will be managed within the context of the company's 2.75x net  leverage target.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case include: --Fitch assumes that Turner cable networks businesses' revenues continue to grow  by mid-single digits, driven by higher affiliate fees and stable advertising  revenues.  --HBO revenues grow in the mid-single digits driven in large part by an  acceleration of subscription revenue growth. Fitch expects HBO's operating  margin will benefit from cost restructuring efforts taken during 2014 and the  operating leverage within the business.  --The film and television studios grow by low- to mid-single digits during the  forecasted periods. This segment benefits from continued demand for television  content, international expansion, and digital delivery, offset by ongoing  declines in DVDs.  --Stable operating margins due to positive operating leverage of its businesses  and higher margin profile of digital versus physical delivery are offset  somewhat by higher overall investment in programming and production. --Increased programming and production investment in the businesses.  --The base case assumes that shareholder returns continue so the company can  manage to its 2.75x net leverage target. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not contemplate additional positive rating actions over the current  ratings horizon. That notwithstanding, positive rating action would likely  coincide with Time Warner adopting a more conservative financial policy provided  it continues to demonstrate that its operating profile is sustainable amid  ongoing competitive pressures, changing media consumption patterns and evolving  technology platforms. Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary actions  of Time Warner's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting  a more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition  activity that drives leverage beyond Fitch's 3.5x threshold in the absence of a  creditable de-leveraging plan. Negative rating actions could also result should  Fitch begin to observe a weakening of Time Warner's ability to produce desired  film and television content or secure programming on its cable networks that  consistently delivers viewing audience ratings, leading to lower subscription or  advertising revenues. Further, a weakening of its competitive position due to  its failure to adapt to emerging distribution platforms could prompt Fitch to  take negative rating actions. FCF AND LIQUIDITY Time Warner generated approximately $2.0 billion of FCF (defined as cash flow  from operations less capital expenditures and dividends) from continuing  operations during the LTM ended March 31, 2016, a 41% increase year over year.  Fitch expects that the higher investment in programming, production and capital  expenditures will translate into strong FCF generation during the ratings  horizon. We believe the strong FCF profile will be led by the revenue, operating  margin, and low capital requirement characteristics of the company's Turner and  Home Box Office businesses. The FCF generation affords the company significant  financial flexibility.  Time Warner's liquidity is strong and supported by $1.5 billion of cash on hand  as of March 31, 2016, $5 billion in credit facilities (all of which was  available as of March 31, 2016), and expected FCF generation. Time Warner's  revolver commitments mature on Dec. 18, 2020. These facilities provide liquidity  back-up for Time Warner's $5 billion commercial paper (CP) program. There was no  CP outstanding as of March 31, 2016. Time Warner's debt maturity profile is well  laddered and within Fitch's FCF expectations. Scheduled maturities include $500  million during 2017, and $600 million during 2018. Fitch expects the company to  refinance this debt with either new long-term debt or issuance of CP.

286,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Cable TV companies Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications Inc agreed to provide billing credits and make other changes after a U.S. Senate committee found overbilling to thousands of consumers.Other cable firms said they are eliminating some fees and trying to make it easier to cancel service. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said in a report on Thursday that Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) ""have consistently failed to provide refunds to customers whom they knew they overcharged.""The companies made no effort to trace equipment overcharges unless consumers asked and did not provide notice or refunds, it said.""Instead of correcting their mistake by refunding the overcharges, their practice has been to just pocket the money,"" said Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who chairs the panel.Executives of Time Warner - which was acquired by Charter in May - told the Senate panel it will provide an automatic one-month credit to customers for overbilled equipment or service. Charter said a company audit found overbilling in approximately 63,000 of 11 million boxes, or less than 1 percent. The company will give overbilled consumers a one-year credit and has implemented controls to prevent future overbilling.Executives from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Charter, DirectTV - a unit of AT&T Inc (T.N) - and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) testified before the panel and pledged to improve customer service. A former Time Warner Cable executive also testified.Senators said cable bills are too complicated and questioned some fees to cancel service. Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, told the Senate panel it would make it easier for consumers to cancel service without being forced to stay on the phone and answer questions.Comcast has launched a pilot project to allow consumers to request to cancel service online. It has recently eliminated change of service fees, extended the time to dispute fees and made it easier to dispute fees.Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said the best rates for subscribers are never advertised. Customer service representatives are taught not to be honest with consumers about the best price unless the customer is angry and threatens to cancel, she said. ""Nobody knows how to get the best price from you,"" McCaskill told the executives.A recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey found pay television service ranked near the bottom of the 43 industries surveyed.   The Federal Communications Commission has proposed allowing consumers to swap pricey cable and other pay TV boxes for cheaper devices and apps, a change that would boost competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market.

310,"  Senior executives of telecommunications company AT&T Inc (T.N) and media conglomerate Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) have discussed various business strategies including a possible merger in recent weeks, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people it said were familiar with the matter. A deal would be one of the largest in recent years in the sector as telecom companies make a land grab for media firms in order to get hold of valuable content. Time Warner shares jumped 4.7 percent in regular trading and slightly extended gains after hours. AT&T shares slipped 1.8 percent. Neither side has yet hired a financial adviser, Bloomberg said. (bloom.bg/2enqBF9)AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment. Time Warner is attractive because of its premium cable channel HBO, the CNN news network, film studio Warner Bros and other media assets.AT&T, which sells wireless phone and broadband services, may be looking to emulate cable company Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), which acquired NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation in a bid to become a massive force that controls how television shows and movies are made and how they are delivered to viewers. Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies more leverage as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or are cutting the cord altogether and watching online. AT&T has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse, buying satellite TV provider DIRECTV last year for $48.5 billion. Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes has not been willing to sell in the past. The company rejected an $80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in 2014. While Bewkes, 64, was not open to a deal two years ago, the pace of consolidation in the media sector may urge him to reconsider, especially as two competitors, Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and CBS Corp (CBS.N) have been exploring a potential merger at the request of controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone.Talk of a deal comes as another potential bidder, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), is busy with its purchase of internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), which has been set back by news of a massive hacking breach into Yahoo customers' email accounts.Time Warner has a market value of about $65 billion. AT&T has a market value of about $238 billion. Any merger of that size in a sensitive market would get a close look from regulators, analysts said, but that would not necessarily derail a deal.

312,"  (Adds background on deal)Oct 22 AT&T Inc is set to announce as early as Saturday a $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc , sources familiar with the matter said, paving the way for the biggest merger in the world this year, giving the telecom company control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets.The deal, which has been agreed on most terms, would be one of the largest in recent years in the sector as telecommunications companies look to combine content and distribution to capture customers replacing traditional pay-TV packages with more streamlined offerings and online delivery.AT&T will pay $110 per Time Warner share in cash and stock, worth about $85 billion overall, sources told Reuters. It will need to line up financing to pay for the deal, since it only has $7.2 billion in cash on hand. This could put pressure on its credit rating as it already has $120 billion in net debt as of June 30, according to Moody's.The boards of the two companies are meeting on Saturday to approve the deal, one source told Reuters.AT&T, whose main wireless phone and broadband service business is showing signs of slowing growth, has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse, buying satellite TV provider DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion. It also in 2014 entered a joint venture, Otter Media, with the Chernin Group to invest in media businesses, and has rolled out video streaming services.CONTENT PLUS DELIVERY  Time Warner is a major force in movies, TV and video games. Its assets include the HBO, CNN, TBS and TNT networks as well as the Warner Bros film studio, producer of the ""Batman"" and ""Harry Potter"" film franchises. The company also owns a 10 percent stake in video streaming site Hulu.Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes rejected an $80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc in 2014, but sources said on Friday that the former suitor had no plans to renew its bid. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Apple Inc  approached Time Warner a few months ago about a possible merger.Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies  bargaining leverage with other content companies as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or switch to watching online. And new mobile technology including next-generation 5G networks could make a content tie-up especially attractive for wireless providers.""We think 5G mobile is coming, we think 5G mobile is an epic game-changer,"" Rich Tullo, director of research at Albert Fried & Company, said in a research note, adding that mobile providers would be in position to disrupt traditional pay-TV services.A previous Time Warner blockbuster deal, its 2000 merger with AOL, is now considered one of the most ill-advised corporate marriages on record.Dallas-based AT&T and New York-based Time Warner did not immediately return calls for comment.

316,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK When Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) Jeff Bewkes welcomed AT&T Inc's (T.N) Randall Stephenson for lunch at Time Warner Center in New York in late August, their meeting was supposed to be one of the catch-ups the two chief executives have had over the years.And it certainly started that way, with the two men chatting about the direction of the media, broadband and mobile telecommunications industries, according to accounts given by Stephenson and Bewkes as well as people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. Stephenson and Bewkes discussed how Time Warner could reach more customers through AT&T's mobile network, and how that content could reinforce the loyalty of customers. Some of this could be achieved through closer ties and partnerships. But then Stephenson showed his hand. He proposed an outright merger of the two companies, the biggest shakeup in the U.S. media landscape since U.S. telecommunications giant Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) takeover of media conglomerate NBC Universal in 2011.""The more we talked about it, the more it fell into place, that there would be benefits that might be significant and might allow us to evolve the ecosystem faster,"" Bewkes told reporters on a conference call on Saturday. Comcast's deal had greatly influenced Stephenson's thinking, spurring him to look for media and video acquisitions now that AT&T had the most video subscribers in the U.S. with 25 million. The media companies he first looked at buying, such as Starz STRZA.O, which later merged with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGF.N, and Scripps Network Interactive Inc (SNI.O), were too small for his liking. Stephenson's problem was that the big media companies he deemed attractive were not easy targets. CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) were family controlled, while Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), with a $150 billion market capitalization, was too big. When Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) made a hostile acquisition approach to Time Warner in 2014, AT&T was awaiting regulatory approval on its deal to buy DirecTV, and couldn't pursue another large deal at the same time. During the year after the DirecTV acquisition closed in July 2015, AT&T had been thinking about going two ways; either a big international acquisition, or a big content deal. Before buying DirecTV, it had looked at combining its business with Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) in Europe, according to the sources. But after buying two smaller wireless companies in Mexico, it couldn't find an international acquisition that suited its appetite. More than a year after the DirecTV deal closed however, Stephenson felt he had the firepower to pursue Time Warner with an $85.4 billion cash-and-stock bid, this year's biggest attempted acquisition globally. The deal was referred to within AT&T, in order to prevent leaks, as ""Project Bobtail"", whose aim was to acquire ""Rabbit"", the code name for Time Warner and perhaps a homage to Warner Bros' Bugs Bunny character. AT&T's code name was ""Lily"", the same as the customer service person who appears in their commercials.""This thing just had what I would call gravity, and it seemed to move along on its own and we began negotiating out terms very quickly and it was a very natural process,"" Stephenson said on the media call. TRUSTED BANKERS     Soon after Stephenson proposed the combination to Bewkes, the companies called in their most trusted investment bank advisers.          AT&T decided to work with Woody Young, who had joined boutique bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP in January. He had worked on deals for AT&T for two decades, and most recently advised AT&T on its DirecTV deal in 2014, when he was at Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).    Time Warner enlisted Allen & Company LLC banker Ketan Mehta, who had been Time Warner's banker for 12 years and had most recently defended Time Warner from Fox when he was at Citi in 2014. He had also helped defend Time Warner against activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006.    The priority was to keep the deal secret from the media, a challenge given that Time Warner has large fiefdoms in the industry, with HBO in New York, Turner Broadcasting and its news unit CNN in Atlanta and Warner Bros in Los Angeles. Time Warner never reached out to other potential suitors during its talks with AT&T, according to the sources. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), widely speculated as another potential buyer for Time Warner, never showed a strong interest, the sources said, pointing out that after Fox's bid for Time Warner many other companies considered an acquisition but never made any offers.    Large investment banks were brought on for financing in the week leading up to AT&T's and Time Warner's announcement on Saturday. When Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that the two companies had informal conversations about a merger without advisors, Stephenson and Bewkes had already shaken hands on the deal and their boards were close to approving it over the weekend.    To finalize the deal, Time Warner's board met in the offices of law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP's offices in New York and AT&T's board meeting was held at its headquarters in Dallas on Saturday.     The deal was announced Saturday night, which caused Stephenson, an Oklahoma native, to miss a University of Oklahoma college football game. He had to ask a reporter for the score.

More than a year after the DirecTV deal closed however, Stephenson felt he had the firepower to pursue Time Warner with an $85.4 billion cash-and-stock bid, this year's biggest attempted acquisition globally. The deal was referred to within AT&T, in order to prevent leaks, as ""Project Bobtail"", whose aim was to acquire ""Rabbit"", the code name for Time Warner and perhaps a homage to Warner Bros' Bugs Bunny character. AT&T's code name was ""Lily"", the same as the customer service person who appears in their commercials.""This thing just had what I would call gravity, and it seemed to move along on its own and we began negotiating out terms very quickly and it was a very natural process,"" Stephenson said on the media call. TRUSTED BANKERS     Soon after Stephenson proposed the combination to Bewkes, the companies called in their most trusted investment bank advisers.          AT&T decided to work with Woody Young, who had joined boutique bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP in January. He had worked on deals for AT&T for two decades, and most recently advised AT&T on its DirecTV deal in 2014, when he was at Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).    Time Warner enlisted Allen & Company LLC banker Ketan Mehta, who had been Time Warner's banker for 12 years and had most recently defended Time Warner from Fox when he was at Citi in 2014. He had also helped defend Time Warner against activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006.    The priority was to keep the deal secret from the media, a challenge given that Time Warner has large fiefdoms in the industry, with HBO in New York, Turner Broadcasting and its news unit CNN in Atlanta and Warner Bros in Los Angeles. Time Warner never reached out to other potential suitors during its talks with AT&T, according to the sources. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), widely speculated as another potential buyer for Time Warner, never showed a strong interest, the sources said, pointing out that after Fox's bid for Time Warner many other companies considered an acquisition but never made any offers.    Large investment banks were brought on for financing in the week leading up to AT&T's and Time Warner's announcement on Saturday. When Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that the two companies had informal conversations about a merger without advisors, Stephenson and Bewkes had already shaken hands on the deal and their boards were close to approving it over the weekend.    To finalize the deal, Time Warner's board met in the offices of law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP's offices in New York and AT&T's board meeting was held at its headquarters in Dallas on Saturday.     The deal was announced Saturday night, which caused Stephenson, an Oklahoma native, to miss a University of Oklahoma college football game. He had to ask a reporter for the score.

322,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Jessica Toonkel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc (T.N) said on Saturday it agreed to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) for $85.4 billion, the boldest move yet by a telecommunications company to acquire content to stream over its network to attract a growing number of online viewers. The biggest deal in the world this year will, if approved by regulators, give AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets. The tie-up will likely face intense scrutiny by U.S. antitrust enforcers  worried that AT&T might try to limit distribution of Time Warner material. AT&T will pay $107.50 per Time Warner share, half in cash and half in stock, worth $85.4 billion overall, according to a company statement. AT&T said it expected to close the deal by the end of 2017.Dallas-based AT&T said the U.S. Department of Justice would review the deal and that the companies were determining which Federal Communications Commission licenses, if any, would  be transferred to AT&T in the deal.U.S. lawmakers were already worried about cable company Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal, and several argued for close regulatory scrutiny of the AT&T deal. ""Such a massive consolidation in this industry requires rigorous evaluation and serious scrutiny,"" said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senate Judiciary Committee member and former attorney general of Connecticut. ""I will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks.""U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said at a rally he would block any AT&T-Time Warner deal if he wins the Nov. 8 election. Trump has complained about media coverage of his campaign, especially by Time Warner's CNN. ""It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,"" said Trump.Representatives of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CONTENT PLUS DELIVERY AT&T, whose main wireless phone and broadband service business is showing signs of slowing, has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse. It bought satellite TV provider DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion.  It had about 142 million North American wireless subscribers as of June 30, and about 38 million video subscribers through DirecTV and its U-verse service. New York-based Time Warner is a major force in movies, TV and video games. Its assets include the HBO, CNN, TBS and TNT networks as well as the Warner Bros film studio, producer of the “Batman” and “Harry Potter” film franchises. The company also owns a 10 percent stake in video streaming site Hulu. The HBO network alone has more than 130 million subscribers. AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson told reporters on a conference call that owning Time Warner and all its content will provide a greater competitive advantage than just continuing to license it.Talks between Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes began in August, they said. ""Jeff and I both had a vision that if you put these two together, you could innovate much faster,"" said Stephenson. Bewkes, who rejected an $80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in 2014, will stay on for an open-ended period of time to help with the integration.Stephenson called the deal ""vertical"" rather than ""horizontal"" and played down regulatory hurdles.""There's no competitor being removed from the marketplace,  there's no competitive harm that is being rendered by putting these two companies together,"" said Stephenson. ""So any concerns by the regulators, we believe, will be adequately addressed by conditions, that's our anticipation.""  Time Warner must pay AT&T $1.725 billion if it finds a different buyer. If regulators block the deal, AT&T must pay Time Warner $500 million, according to people familiar with the deal.The telecom and media sectors have been consolidating. In addition to Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal, AT&T's wireless rival Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is in the process of buying internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) for about $4.8 billion. FINANCING AT&T said it would finance the cash portion of the purchase with new debt and cash on its balance sheet. AT&T said it has an 18-month commitment for an unsecured bridge term facility for $40 billion.AT&T has only $7.2 billion in cash on hand. Further borrowing could pressure its credit rating as it already had $120 billion in net debt as of June 30, according to Moody's. AT&T said the deal would add to earnings per share in the first year after closing. It said it expected $1 billion in annual run-rate cost savings within three years of closing, chiefly driven by lower corporate and procurement spending.Shortly after the deal was announced, AT&T reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents, the same as in the year-ago period and matching Wall Street's average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It hiked its quarterly dividend by a penny to 49 cents per share. Time Warner said its third-quarter earnings, which have not yet been announced, would show growth in revenue and operating income at each division and double-digit earnings growth.5G IS COMING Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies  bargaining leverage with other content companies as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or switch to watching online.

329,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Supantha Mukherjee  Wall Street signaled skepticism on Monday that AT&T Inc would secure the government approvals needed to carry out its planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc, with shares of both companies falling as analysts scrutinized the deal.Time Warner shares were trading some 20 percent below the implied value of AT&T's $107.50 per share cash and stock offer, indicating investor doubts that the companies would be able to complete the transaction.The deal, announced on Saturday, would give AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted assets and reshape the media landscape.Dallas-based AT&T said on Saturday it would need approval of the U.S. Justice Department and the companies were determining which Time Warner U.S. Federal Communications Commission licenses, if any, would need to transfer to AT&T. Any such transfers would require FCC approval.AT&T Inc Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Monday that he expects government clearances for the transaction, which the company sees closing by the end of 2017.""While regulators will often times have concerns with vertical integrations, those are always remedied by conditions imposed on the merger, so that's how we envision this one to play out,"" Stephenson told CNBC in an interview. Despite its big media footprint, Time Warner has only one FCC-regulated broadcast station, WPCH-TV in Atlanta. Time Warner could sell the license to try to avoid a formal FCC review, several analysts said.Shares of AT&T fell 1.5 percent to $36.92 and shares of Time Warner tumbled 2 percent to $87.50.FOCUS ON APPROVALS  Wall Street analysts and traders on Monday expressed concerns about the implications of the antitrust and regulatory challenges facing the deal.""From a regulatory perspective we believe management are relying heavily on the argument that vertical mergers have historically been approved, yet with so much up in the air in Washington, we find this riskier than would be typical,"" said Cowen & Co analyst Colby Synesael.The deal, announced just over two weeks before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, is generating skepticism among both Republicans and Democrats. The total value of broken deals is nearly $700 billion so far this year, a fact that has sidelined some investors.""The regulatory environment has been unbelievable this year and I think everyone is on edge,"" said an arbitrage investor  considering buying exposure to the deal who did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the press.Among the biggest deals to fall apart in 2016 were: Office Depot-Staples, Baker Hughes-Halliburton, Allergan-Pfizer, and Norfolk Southern-Canadian Pacific Railways. Many of the deals drew objections from the Department of Justice and U.S. Treasury.""We are unprepared at this point to assign anything higher than a 50/50 probability of deal approval,"" wrote MoffettNathanson Research in a report, downgrading Time Warner to ""neutral"" but raising its target price by $8 to $100.Similarly, Credit Suisse lowered its rating on Time Warner to ""neutral"" from ""outperform"", but raised its price target to $107.50 from $90.""We believe the value of the offer is full on current earnings and cash flow; that the probability of a counteroffer from a third party is low; and that the transaction will face lengthy scrutiny from regulators,"" Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh wrote in a report.

337,"   By Jessica Toonkel and Rishika Sadam  Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), which has agreed to be acquired by telecom company AT&T Inc (T.N), on Wednesday raised its full-year outlook and reported quarterly profit topping Wall Street expectations, powered by higher box office and cable network revenues.  Despite the strong results, shares of Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros film studio, slipped 0.8 percent to $87.54 in New York Stock exchange trading. ""The fundamentals are great, but right now the underlying value driver is going to be the merger,"" said Jeffrey Logsdon, analyst at JBL Advisors LLC.AT&T said last month it would buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in a bold bid to acquire content to stream over its networks, valuing the media company at $107.50 per share.Analysts and investors have signaled skepticism about the deal, pointing to possible regulatory hurdles.""This approval process may take well over a year, possibly 18 months, and has a significant chance of not being approved, so the stock may stay at a large discount to the offer for some time,"" said Edward Jones senior analyst Robin Diedrich, who gives the deal a slightly better than 50 percent chance of being approved.  Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes on the earnings call on Wednesday said he expects the transaction to close by the end of 2017, “if not sooner.” When asked whether the U.S. Federal Communications Commission could block the deal over Time Warner transferring any of its licenses to AT&T, executives said the companies would dispose of the licenses if needed.“We don’t have things that are material to the actual conduct of the business that AT&T would need in operating our assets,” said Paul Cappuccio, general counsel at Time Warner. Executives said they do not expect the deal to affect Time Warner's 10 percent stake in Hulu or any other distribution agreements.  Revenue from Warner Bros, the company's biggest unit by revenue, rose 6.7 percent to $3.4 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, driven by the success of movies ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Sully."" Superhero movie ""Suicide Squad,"" which premiered in early August, brought in around $750 million worldwide, executives said. Revenue at the HBO unit, home to ""Game of Thrones"" and ""True Detective,"" rose 4.3 percent to $1.43 billion.     The company's net income rose to $1.47 billion, or $1.86 per share, from $1.04 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier.According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, Time Warner earned $1.55 per share, excluding a tax benefit of 28 cents per share and other items, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.37.Revenue rose 9.2 percent to $7.17 billion, topping analyst expectations of $6.98 billion.Time Warner raised its 2016 full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $5.45-$5.55 per share, excluding a tax benefit, from previous guidance of $5.35-$5.45.

348,"   By Tim Baysinger  Time Warner Inc’s U.S. cable network TBS has renewed its late-night satirical comedy series “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” for a second season next year, moving the show to a new night.“Full Frontal,” which premiered in February, is the only late-night show hosted by a woman on U.S. television, as the industry faces criticism for its lack of diversity.The late-night slot, popular with younger viewers that appeal to advertisers, has seen several channels launch new shows in the past two years.TBS is moving the show from Monday to Wednesday, beginning Jan. 11. The cable network said the show currently averages 3.3 million viewers for each episode, which includes DVR and video-on-demand viewing. That makes “Full Frontal” one of the three highest-rated late-night shows on U.S. TV this quarter among adults 18 to 49, the demographic most attractive to advertisers. The network said it is outpacing its own third-quarter ratings in that demographic by 37 percent.

Donald Trump was one of Bee’s most frequent targets, as the late-night host ridiculed the Republican candidate for misogynist and racist statements during his campaign. Along with HBO’s John Oliver and NBC’s Seth Meyers, Bee looks likely to be one of Trump’s fiercest critics after he takes office.

350,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  proposed issuance of benchmark sized 10-year senior unsecured notes by Time  Warner Inc. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including  debt reduction. Fitch currently rates Time Warner Long-Term 'BBB+' Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) with a Stable Outlook. The company has approximately $24.5  billion of debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2016. The issuance and the concurrent commencement of cash tender offers to purchase  certain outstanding debt securities is consistent with Time Warner's financial  policy. Under the merger agreement, Time Warner has ceased stock repurchases,  which permits Time Warner's excess cash generation to be used to reduce debt.  Fitch views the company's announced cash tender offers for debt securities as a  positive for Time Warner's overall credit profile as the transaction should  result in overall debt reduction during the course of 2017. Consolidated  leverage was 3.0x (calculated on a gross basis excluding restructuring and  programming impairments) and 2.7x (calculated on a net debt basis) as of the LTM  ended Sept. 30, 2016. The notes will be issued by Time Warner Inc. under the indenture dated March 11,  2010. They will be guaranteed by Time Warner's wholly owned subsidiary Historic  TW Inc., a holding company that owns Home Box Office, Inc. (HBO), Turner  Broadcasting System, Inc. (TBS), and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (Warner  Bros.). In addition, HBO and TBS will guarantee Historic TW Inc.'s guarantee of  the notes. This is the same guarantee structure as Time Warner's other notes and  debentures issued after November 2006. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Time Warner's consistent financial policy and capital allocation strategy  continues to revolve around investing in its businesses to strengthen its  product portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet (net leverage target of  around 2.75x) and returning excess capital to its shareholders. While share  repurchases have been discontinued, the company continues to pay its quarterly  dividend, both in line with the terms and conditions of the pending acquisition  by AT&T. Fitch does not anticipate any change to Time Warner's financial policy,  namely its net leverage target of around 2.75x or a change in its dividend  policy.  --The stability, recurring revenue, and free cash flow (FCF, defined as cash  flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends) generation of the  cable networks businesses (Turner and Home Box Office) underpin Time Warner's  ratings. Time Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable networks businesses. Fitch expects  these businesses will continue to generate a significant amount of Time Warner's  earnings and cash flow. --Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. The size and scale of Warner Bros.'  television studio enables the company to capitalize on strong demand for  television content while providing meaningful diversification of revenue  sources. As Warner Bros.' videogames business grows it also adds to the  diversification. --Time Warner is well positioned to address the secular threats and  opportunities presented by emerging alternative distribution platforms and  continued audience fragmentation across the media and entertainment landscape. Time Warner's operating profile benefits from the stability, recurring  dual-stream revenue profile, high operating margin and FCF generation  characteristics attributable to its cable networks businesses. A key operating  strategy within its cable networks businesses will be to continue to leverage  increased investment in original and sports programming to continue driving  healthy domestic affiliate fee revenue growth. Fitch's ratings incorporate the strong competitive position of Time Warner's  film and television studios at Warner Bros. Their size and scale enable Time  Warner to capitalize on strong demand for television content while providing  meaningful diversification of revenue sources. Warner Bros.' strategic  priorities include expanding its leadership in TV production beyond broadcast  networks, focusing on global franchises to grow its theatrical business and  improving margins through cost reduction efforts. Embedded in the strategy is  more collaboration with Turner networks in scripted and kids programming. Fitch  is cognizant of the inherent volatility of hit-driven content in the film and  television production businesses and acknowledges that growth of Warner Bros.'  videogames business adds diversification and stability to the business. Fitch  also acknowledges Time Warner's risk mitigation processes (film co-financing  arrangements, etc.) and strong track record of consistently generating desirable  content.  Fitch believes Time Warner is still well positioned to address the threats and  opportunities present in the evolving media landscape, including the growing  prominence of alternative distribution platforms and audience fragmentation  within the context of a stagnant multichannel video subscriber base, providing  sufficient flexibility within the current ratings to accommodate the company's  leverage target and capital allocation strategy. Fitch also believes demand for  high-quality content remains strong across all major end-markets (broadcast  networks, cable networks and subscription video on demand) and that large,  well-capitalized content providers, such as Time Warner, will remain crucial to  the industry. Fitch recognizes the ongoing secular shifts within the pay television industry,  including changing media consumption patterns, a growing preference for  time-shifted viewing and intensifying competition from emerging distribution  platforms that continue to drive audience fragmentation and mute multichannel  video subscription growth as subscribers migrate away from the traditional pay  television ecosystem. These factors, along with the potential shift to the  skinny bundles video service offerings from cable MSOs, have the capacity to  hamper anticipated affiliate fee revenue growth over the longer term. Fitch  expects that multi-channel video subscribers will continue to decline during the  rating horizon at an annual rate ranging between 1.5% and 2%.  Turner has successfully renewed affiliation agreements with the majority of  leading multichannel video programming distributors, which removes a significant  portion of the risk related to expected affiliation fee increases during the  rating horizon. In addition, Turner networks have been included in emerging OTT  platforms, providing further evidence of demand for its content across  distribution platforms, and which, to the extent the new platforms are  successful, can help mitigate modest subscriber declines in the traditional  multichannel ecosystem and continues to pursue new opportunities outside of the  traditional ecosystem to take advantage of the shift of consumption patterns and  help drive incremental growth. Fitch expects Time Warner to have mid-single-digit top-line growth, expanding margins and high FCF conversion over  the next several years, driven by domestic affiliate fee growth and  international expansion.  Leverage and Financial Policy The company continues to manage its leverage to a net leverage target of around  2.75x, which remains within the context of Fitch's 3.5x total leverage threshold  for the current rating. In Fitch's opinion the positive operating momentum  coupled with predictable, recurring FCF generated by Time Warner's strong  portfolio of businesses is leverageable, providing a sound basis to accommodate  the company's net leverage target within the context of the current 'BBB+'  rating. Total debt outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2016 was approximately $24.5 billion,  reflecting a 3% increase relative to year-end 2015. Consolidated leverage was  3.0x (calculated on a gross basis excluding restructuring and programming  impairments) and 2.7x (calculated on a net debt basis) as of the LTM ended Sept.  30, 2016. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the agency's rating case include: --Fitch assumes that Turner cable networks businesses' revenues continue to grow  by mid-single digits, driven by higher affiliate fees and stable advertising  revenues.  --HBO revenues grow in the mid-single digits driven in large part by an  acceleration of subscription revenue growth.  --The film and television studios grow by low- to mid-single digits during the  forecasted periods. This segment benefits from continued demand for television  content, international expansion, and digital delivery, offset by ongoing  declines in sales of DVDs.  --Stable operating margins due to positive operating leverage of its businesses  and higher margin profile of digital versus physical delivery are offset  somewhat by higher overall investment in programming and production. --Increased programming and production investment in the businesses.  --Fitch assumes that the company will not repurchase shares while the AT&T  transaction remains pending. The company will continue to pay its quarterly  dividend at the current rate.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not contemplate additional positive rating actions over the current  rating horizon. However, positive rating action would likely coincide with Time  Warner adopting a more conservative financial policy, provided it continues to  demonstrate that its operating profile is sustainable amid ongoing competitive  pressures, changing media consumption patterns and evolving technology  platforms. Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with discretionary actions  of Time Warner's management including, but not limited to, the company adopting  a more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and acquisition  activity that drives leverage beyond Fitch's 3.5x threshold in the absence of a  creditable de-leveraging plan. Negative rating actions could also result should  Fitch begin to observe a weakening of Time Warner's ability to produce desired  film and television content or secure programming on its cable networks that  consistently delivers viewing audience ratings, leading to lower subscription or  advertising revenues. Further, a weakening of its competitive position due to  its failure to adapt to emerging distribution platforms could prompt Fitch to  take negative rating actions. LIQUIDITY Time Warner generated approximately $2.7 billion of FCF (defined as cash flow  from operations less capital expenditures and dividends) from continuing  operations during the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2016, a 19% increase relative to the  FCF generated during the year ended Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch expects that the higher  investment in programming, production and capital expenditures will translate  into strong FCF generation during the ratings horizon. Fitch believes that the  strong FCF profile will be led by the revenue, operating margin and low capital  requirement characteristics of the company's Turner and Home Box Office  businesses. The FCF generation affords the company significant financial  flexibility. Time Warner's liquidity is strong and supported by $2.3 billion of cash on hand  as of Sept. 30, 2016, $5 billion in credit facilities (all of which was  available as of Sept. 30, 2016), and expected FCF generation. Time Warner's  revolver commitments mature on Dec. 18, 2020. These facilities provide liquidity  back-up for Time Warner's $5 billion commercial paper (CP) program. There was no  CP outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2016. Time Warner's debt maturity profile is well  laddered and within Fitch's FCF expectations. Scheduled maturities include $500  million during 2017, $600 million during 2018 and $650 million during 2019.  Fitch expects the company to refinance this debt with either new long-term debt  and/or issuance of CP. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Time Warner as follows: Time Warner Inc. --Long-Term IDR 'BBB+'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures 'BBB+'; --Commercial Paper 'F2'. Time Warner International Finance Limited --Long-Term IDR 'BBB+'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial Paper 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes will also testify at the meeting of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights.Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks and Landmark Theatres movie chain, has been a vocal supporter of the deal, saying on Twitter and in published interviews that the combined company could be a counterweight to big digital companies like Facebook Inc (FB.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Snapchat Inc. Gene Kimmelman, president and CEO of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge and a former chief counsel for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, is also expected to testify, the spokesman said.

355,"   By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON AT&T Inc's (T.N) planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) will increase innovation and bring ""better-priced options"" to consumers upset by high cable bills, AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told lawmakers on Wednesday.""We want consumers to pay for their content once and watch it any where any time,"" he said at a hearing of the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel.Senator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the panel, expressed concern that the deal would create incentives for AT&T to refuse to license Time Warner's movies and television shows  to competitors. She also said AT&T could favor its own shows over independent content.Time Warner owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros film studio.Senator Al Franken, also a Democrat, expressed the same concern and pressed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes on whether the new, combined company would raise rates to others who would broadcast its content. ""It would not have the incentive nor would it have the ability,"" Bewkes responded.AT&T's Stephenson agreed: ""It would make no sense ... to do that."" Senator Mike Lee, a Republican who chairs the antitrust panel, said the review by the U.S. Justice Department would be ""very fact-intensive."" ""Consumer welfare is maximized by protecting competition, not necessarily by protecting competitors,"" Lee said.The Justice Department will determine whether the deal is legal under antitrust law. If the agency decides to stop a proposed transaction, it must convince a judge to agree. Stephen has said that the Federal Communications Commission would also review the deal if AT&T decides to assume any of Time Warner's licenses.Franken said he wanted to see the FCC review the merger because of their tougher standard.Senator Richard Blumenthal said he had ""serious concerns about this transaction. I have yet to be convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks."" But he was also concerned that President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration will decide whether to approve the merger, had said during the campaign that it should be blocked.""What troubles me is that the president-elect has said that his Justice Department will enforce a different standard of law depending"" on whether he is angered by news coverage, said Blumenthal, calling the notion ""absolutely abhorrent"".Stephenson said he had not been in touch with Trump's transition team on the issue and that he expected the Justice Department would review the merger fairly.Billionaire investor Mark Cuban told the Senate panel that the merger would create another competitor against large companies like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Google (GOOGL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).""Delivering content to consumers in this app-driven world is not easy,"" he said in written testimony. ""Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete.""
