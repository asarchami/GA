The S&P 500 ended 0.66 percent below its record close of 1,848.38 set on January 15.""The late-day selling was somewhat induced by the futures and options expirations on the close; it's hard to put too much credence in the market's action in the last couple hours because there's so much positioning that has to do with where things close,"" James said.February individual equity options and some options on stock indexes stopped trading at Friday's close and will settle on Saturday.

NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that he still sees a ""high probability"" that Russia, using the guise of a humanitarian mission, could intervene militarily in Ukraine.""From a fundamental standpoint, the big reason why we bounced back so sharply was because a big piece of geopolitical concern has been somewhat alleviated by the news of a Russia pullback,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.

It earned $10.85 per non-GAAP diluted share, while analysts, on average, estimated non-GAAP earnings per share of $10.10.Revenue totaled $1.84 billion versus $1.54 billion a year ago. Analysts were looking for $1.8 billion in the latest quarter The company also said its board authorized a share buyback of up to $3 billion.While Priceline narrowly topped rival Expedia Inc (EXPE.O) for gross bookings last quarter, its lower-than-expected first-quarter forecasts reflected weakening results due to a stronger U.S. dollar, just as U.S. domestic competition heats up following Expedia's acquisition of Travelocity in January and the planned purchase of Orbitz Worldwide Inc (OWW.N), announced earlier this month.

54,"  (Adds details from Havana home owners, travel industry)By Emily StephensonWASHINGTON, April 2 Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc now offers properties in Cuba, the company said on Thursday, as it looks to capitalize on an expected travel boom resulting from the normalizing of relations between the United States and the Communist-run nation.President Barack Obama has loosened some Cold War-era travel restrictions, allowing Americans to visit the Caribbean island for a range of reasons, such as family visits or education.U.S. lawmakers have proposed further easing to permit purely tourist travel. But pure beach and resort tourism remains illegal for Americans in Cuba under a five-decades-old trade embargo.Airbnb said on Thursday that after Obama announced the changes, it saw a 70 percent spike in U.S. searches for rentals in Cuba. In response, it has added more than 1,000 listings on the island. Americans booking stays in Cuba on the site will have to assert that they have a license from the U.S. government to travel there.Airbnb's Cuba services are only open to U.S. travelers, but could expand to include people from other countries, the company said.""They made us this proposal a few days ago and we're delighted to accept what they offered us,"" said Reinier Torres, who manages a Havana home on Airbnb's service. ""It's a great opportunity for us to attract American tourism ... though we haven't seen any practical results yet."" The National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that pushes for open international trade, said Airbnb's expansion would help meet ""soaring demand"" for lodging in Cuba.U.S. travel companies licensed to offer educational and cultural tours to Cuba are reporting a surge in interest from Americans, with bookings for this year up steeply.Airline charter companies flying to Cuba from two Florida cities, Miami and Tampa, are also reporting increased business. In the first three months of 2015, they reported about 175,000 passengers. Travel experts say Cuba's state-run hotel sector lacks the capacity to handle a major increase in U.S. visitors, without the variety of high-end hotels found in other destinations.The private bed and breakfast option is increasingly poised to pick up the slack in the state sector and could spur investment in new hotel construction said Emilio Morales, president of the Havana Consulting Group in Miami.There are between 6,000 to 8,000 rooms for rent in private homes in Havana, priced at about $30-35 a night, compared with $150-$200 in standard hotels.A lack of internet and banking services in Cuba still greatly limits online private sector transactions. But Cubans are already familiar with similar services in Canada and Europe that offer pre-paid home stays in Cuba, using money transfer and cash delivery systems to pay home owners, Morales said.Other U.S. businesses have begun offering services in Cuba. Kayak, owned by online travel agency Priceline Group Inc , has added Cuba to its website. And several airlines have said they are looking into adding flights.

55,"  April 2 Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc now offers properties in Cuba, the company said on Thursday, hoping to capitalize on an expected travel boost after the United States began normalizing relations with the Communist-run nation.President Barack Obama has loosened some Cold War-era travel restrictions, allowing Americans to visit the Caribbean island for a range of reasons, such as family visits or education.U.S. lawmakers have proposed further easing to permit purely tourist travel.Airbnb said on Thursday that after Obama announced the changes, it saw a 70 percent spike in U.S. searches for rentals in Cuba. In response, it has added more than 1,000 listings on the island. Americans booking stays in Cuba on the site will have to assert that they have a license from the U.S. government to travel there. Airbnb's Cuba services are only open to U.S. travelers, but could expand to include people from other countries, the company said.The National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that pushes for open international trade, said Airbnb's expansion would help meet ""soaring demand"" for lodging in Cuba.

56,"  (Adds comments, details on share buyback, rival Expedia's bookings and relative foreign exchange exposure)By Jeffrey DastinMay 7 The Priceline Group Inc said Thursday first-quarter profit was up just slightly from a year ago, but expects growth to slow in the second quarter as weak foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar crimp its sales.Shares of the company fell 3.36 percent in morning trading to $1,221.70.Priceline Group, the world's largest online travel services company and owner of its namesake website, as well as Booking.com and others, said first-quarter net income grew less than one percent from a year earlier to $333 million, or $6.36 per diluted share. Excluding certain items, the company earned $8.12 per diluted share.Analysts expected the company to earn $7.72 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in the quarter was about $1.84 billion, against analysts' expectations for $1.8 billion.The company said it expects travel bookings in the second quarter to stay flat or grow up to 7 percent from a year earlier, as sales in foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars and ""significantly"" slow its pace of growth.""Foreign exchange had more of a negative impact that we thought and doesn't show any signs of easing up,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi. Priceline Group's forecast assumes that the euro is 19 percent weaker and the British pound is 11 percent weaker than a year ago. Accounting for these fluctuations, travel bookings would be up 15 to 22 percent, the company said.The company expects to earn between $10.95 and $11.75 per share in the second quarter, excluding certain items, with revenue staying flat or rising up to 7 percent compared to a year earlier. It has greater exposure to foreign exchange volatility than rival Expedia Inc, with international bookings representing 88 percent of its total travel sales in the first quarter, compared to 41 percent for Expedia.Last week, Expedia affirmed earlier guidance for earnings growth as first-quarter bookings soared 19 percent.Priceline said travel bookings jumped 12 percent on the year in the first quarter, or 26 percent when accounting for currency fluctuations.The company's name-your-own-price feature, which allows customers to suggest a price they'd like to pay to travel, continued to shrink and hamper U.S. growth.""You have to question why they are still promoting that business,"" Amobi said.

82,"  Priceline Group Inc (PCLN.O) on Wednesday said its growth would slow in the second quarter as it spends more on marketing and as the timing of holidays shifts traveler bookings, sending shares down more than 7 percent in premarket trading. The lower forecast overshadowed a first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations at the world's most profitable online travel services company. Priceline Group, which operates Booking.com and other sites, earned $374 million in the first three months. Excluding special items, earnings jumped 24 percent from a year earlier to $532 million, or $10.54 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected $9.65 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The profit beat came as customers booked 31 percent more nights in hotels than a year earlier, with travel bookings up 21 percent overall, the company said. The early timing of the Easter holiday in part buoyed results.Still, Priceline's forecast that profit and bookings growth would slow concerned investors.  The company expects bookings to rise up to 18 percent in the second quarter, and to earn up to $12.50 per share on an adjusted basis. That's short of the 21 percent rise and $14.90 in earnings per share, respectively, that Cowen and Company analyst Kevin Kopelman said Priceline needed to forecast.""Gross bookings have continued to grow strongly across all channels and key geographic regions thus far in Q2, but growth has decelerated compared to Q1,"" Chief Financial Officer Daniel Finnegan said on an analyst call. ""We believe that the Eurocup and earlier timing this year for (the Muslim fasting month of) Ramadan will negatively impact our year-over-year growth rate in June."" Costs will also rise as the company said it plans to spend more on marketing to thwart competition from hotels offering discounts on their own websites to lure travelers from companies like Priceline, which charges a fee for listing their inventory.The weak forecast comes less than a week after Priceline said its Chief Executive Darren Huston had resigned after an investigation into a personal relationship with an employee that violated the company's code of conduct. S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi said uncertainty about when Priceline would appoint a CEO replacement may have also hurt shares.
