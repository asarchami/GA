7,"  (Adds forecast, details)July 2 Constellation Brands Inc reported higher-than-expected  quarterly revenue and profit as its advertising campaigns boosted sales of Corona and Modelo beer brands in the summer, sending its shares up 7 percent premarket.The company, which also makes Svedka Vodka and Robert Mondavi wine, raised its adjusted profit forecast to $4.10-$4.25 per share for the year ending Feb. 28, 2015. It had earlier expected $3.95-$4.15.Constellation, which sells Corona beer in the United States, said it expects net sales to grow about 10 percent and operating income to increase 25-30 percent in its beer business, which contributed half of its revenue last year.The company said in April it expected net beer sales to grow in mid-to-high single digits and operating income to grow in the low-to-mid 20s in percentage terms. Constellation brands became the largest supplier of wine, beer and other alcoholic drinks in the United States after gaining full control of Crown Imports LLC, its joint venture with Grupo Modelo SAB de CV, last year.The company said beer sales rose 14 percent to $867.7 million in the first quarter ended May 31, driven by its '120 Days of Summer' advertising campaign and sales during Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays.Constellation has been concentrating on selling more beer through aggressive marketing as sales of its wines and spirits stagnate.

9,"  (Refiled to correct typographical error in first paragraph)By Neil MaidmentLONDON Aug 7 InterContinental Hotels Group  is set to sell its flagship Le Grand hotel in Paris to Qatari-backed investor Constellation Hotels for 330 million euros ($440 million), it said on Thursday, raising the prospect of more cash returns for investors.The world's largest hotelier said it had received a binding offer for the historic InterContinental Paris, where notable visitors of the past included Russia's last Tsar Nicholas II and British king Edward VII, in a deal that will see IHG manage the hotel for up to 60 years.The sale, which is not expected to complete until next year, continues IHG's strategy of selling on its hotels and then managing them under contract. The approach has seen the group return some $10 billion to shareholders since 2003, including a $750 million special dividend in May. Analysts have said the sale of the Paris hotel as well as its InterContinental in Hong Kong could help bring another $1.5 billion of cash returns to shareholders over the next three years.The price tag for Paris, which had a net book value of $342 million, was slightly low, however, according to Numis. ""The Le Grand is an iconic trophy asset and whilst the takeout multiple of 20 times earnings before interest and tax may seem generous, we consider the sale price to be marginally disappointing,"" Numis analysts said.Shares in the firm, which operates over 4,700 hotels, were down 1.3 percent at 2,247 pence at 1415 GMT, when London's FTSE 100 index was down 0.2 percent. IHG said it expected annual management fees for the InterContinental Paris, which opened in 1862 and has operated under the InterContinental brand since 1982, to be $5 million.Constellation, which will spend 60 million euros on renovations, also bought IHG's London Park Lane InterContinental and a 80 percent stake in its Barclay hotel in New York in 2013.The move comes just days after activist investor Marcato Capital Management said it had hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey to advise it on strategy at IHG, three months after a report that the hotels operator had rebuffed a 6 billion pound  takeover bid.($1 = 0.7495 euros)   (Editing by Greg Mahlich)",2014-08-07,STZ,"Thu Aug 7, 2014 | 11:07am EDT",REFILE-Qataris move to snap up IHG's Paris flagship hotel Le Grand,http://www.reuters.com//article/ihg-paris-idUSL6N0QD5BP20140807?type=companyNews

11,"   By Anjali Athavaley  Constellation Brands Inc (STZ.N) on Thursday said that it was expanding capacity at its brewery in Mexico to increase its share of the market for import beers in the United States.The company will acquire from Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR). a glass production plant in Nava, Mexico for $300 million, pending approval from regulators. Constellation is entering into a 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois Inc (OI.N) to operate the glass plant. The venture will provide bottles for Constellation's adjacent Nava Brewery, where capacity will increase to 25 million hectoliters from 20 million. Constellation previously announced that it had entered into a long-term supply agreement with Vitro, a Mexico-based glass manufacturer, which will supply about 25 percent of the glass needed for Constellation's beer business for seven years beginning in October. For Constellation, which also sells the Svedka vodka and Robert Mondavi wine brands, the plan represents an effort to capitalize on its growing, high-margin beer business. Last year, as part of ABInBev's acquisition of Grupo Modelo, the beer giant sold all of Modelo's U.S. business to Constellation, giving it the rights to import, market and sell the Corona and Modelo brands, as well as ownership of the Nava brewery. Import brands have been outperforming domestic brands in the United States, thanks to strong demand for premium beers and a growing Hispanic population.  ""Our additional investments in production capacity and glass sourcing are designed to ensure that we are well-positioned to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities,"" said Constellation Chief Executive Rob Sands, on the company's second-quarter earnings conference call. The expansion will give Constellation more control over the quality of its beer bottles at the Nava facility. Its second-quarter results include a $9 million charge resulting from a voluntary recall of select bottles of Corona Extra. The defective bottles came from a glass plant operated by a third party manufacturer that supplies the Nava brewery with bottles. Constellation lowered its free cash flow projection for the year to reflect capital expenses from the brewery expansion and joint venture. It now expects $275 million to $350 million for fiscal 2015, down from its previous estimate of $425 million to $500 million. Constellation said net income fell to $196 million, or 98 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Aug. 31 from $1.5 billion, or $7.74 per share, a year earlier.The year-earlier quarter included a $1.6 billion non-cash gain from the acquisition of Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business. Excluding the charge for recalling defective bottles and other items, Constellation's earnings were $1.11 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales rose 10 percent to $1.61 billion on an increase in Constellation's beer business, but fell short of analyst estimates of $1.64 billion.Shares of Constellation were down 27 cents at $84.99 in Thursday afternoon trading.

35,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all of the ratings for  Constellation Brands Inc. (Constellation) and its subsidiary, CIH International  S.a.r.l., including the Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'BB+'. The rating  affirmation follows the announcement by Constellation that it has entered into a  definitive agreement to acquire Home Brew Mart which includes craft beer brand,  Ballast Point, for a total consideration of approximately $1 billion.  As of Aug. 31, 2015, Constellation had $7.4 billion of debt outstanding and $330  million in cash. The Rating Outlook is Stable. See the full list of ratings at  the end of this press release.  TRANSACTION HIGHLIGHTS Fitch estimates a transaction multiple in the upper-20x range based on Ballast's  2015 EBITDA. Constellation will fund the transaction through a combination of  cash and debt. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2015, subject  to customary closing conditions.  Fitch views the acquisition as highly complementary with a robust portfolio that  is innovation focused, which has been a modest weak point in the past for  Constellation. The portfolio includes more than 40 different styles of beer and  increases Constellation's exposure to the faster growing, high end craft beer  and spirits segments. Ballast Point has grown its revenue base almost threefold  to $49 million in 2014 from $14 million in 2012 and during the first nine months  of 2015, revenue grew 166% to $86 million. While relatively modest at only 2% of  overall revenue, Ballast Point's operations will materially leverage  Constellation's distribution, marketing scale, supply chain and market research  over time and should become a key aspect of Constellation's overall growth  strategy. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage Will Increase Slightly, Further Improvement Expected in FY2017 The acquisition will increase leverage (total debt/EBITDA) to slightly greater  than 4x at the end of fiscal 2016 (year ending February 2016), which would be  flat to fiscal 2015 year-end level. Leverage had decreased to 3.8x as of Aug.  31, 2015. Year to date, Constellation has generated better than expected  operating cash flow (OCF) and margin expansion given industry leading comparable  sales. Fitch now expects OCF to be more than $100 million higher than initially  forecast for fiscal 2016 to $1.3 billion. Given the strong operating trends in  Constellation's beer business, which generates more than 60% of the company's  operating income, Fitch expects leverage should decrease to the upper 3x range  in fiscal 2017 as growth in EBITDA should more than offset any increased  borrowing to fund beer capacity expansion and a growing dividend. Hispanics, Premiumization Driving Growth Fitch believes Constellation is well positioned to capture long-term growth due  to its strong appeal to the Hispanic consumer coupled with the ongoing trend  toward premiumization in the beer industry driven by Mexican imports and craft  beer. Other growth factors include the expected sizeable increase in Hispanic  consumers reaching the legal drinking age, growth in distribution, and expansion  of drinking occasions due to increased draft and can consumption.  The $4.75 billion Modelo acquisition (an additional true-up payment of $543  million was made at the beginning of fiscal 2015) that closed in fiscal 2014,  materially increased Constellation's diversity, scale and exposure to  above-average market growth rates in the beer segment. For the last 12 months,  Constellation generated more than 60% of segment operating income from the beer  business compared to approximately 40% in fiscal 2013, and grew beer depletion  volumes by approximately 9.5% which significantly outperformed the U.S. beer  industry. Comparatively, the overall U.S. beer industry has increased in the low single  digits during the past two years after generally experiencing low single-digit  declines for several years prior due to share loss as the millennial generation  shifted preferences into wine and spirits along with a recessionary  macroeconomic environment. As premiumization continues to affect the beer  market, consumers are trading up for high-quality, flavorful products in  above-premium, super-premium categories including hard cider and flavored malt  beverages, craft and import offerings. While several imported beer segments are  experiencing declines, Mexican imports continue to grow and have been the  primary imports growth driver during the past several years.  Thus, Fitch expects Constellation will generate increased long-term cash flows  driven by the above strong underlying fundamentals, further leverage of new  product development innovation, and the potential for increased cost of goods  sold efficiencies as the company brings expansion capacity on-line. The Ballast  Point acquisition allows Constellation to more effectively target different  demographic segments that are attracted to craft beer and spirits and should  minimize potential cannibalization of its existing Mexican beer and spirits  portfolio, thus supporting a slightly improved growth profile. Leading Market Positions Constellation's ratings consider the company's leading market positions and  well-known liquor portfolio. According to the company, Constellation is the  third-largest U.S. beer company with approximately 50% volume share in the  import segment due to its Mexican beer portfolio that contains five of the top  15 U.S. imported beers. Constellation is also one of the world's largest wine  producers, is focused on growing premium brands, and is the producer of one of  the fastest-growing premium brand vodkas, Svedka. Constellation has begun to improve wine growth during the first half of fiscal  2016 with focus brand depletion growth of more than 6% during the second fiscal  quarter of 2016. Fitch's forecast assumes modest growth in wine revenue for  fiscal 2016 after wine sales declined 1.2% in fiscal 2015. The wine portfolio  had lagged the overall U.S. category in fiscal 2015 causing wine dollar market  share to erode slightly, driven by competition in the super-premium price  segment. The luxury/ super luxury wine segments have witnessed strong volume and  dollar sales growth since 2010 as consumers continue to trade up to wine priced  $20 and above. Constellation's recent acquisition of the luxury wine brand,  Meomi, highlights the company's focus on improving the price mix in the wine  portfolio. CFO Growing, FCF Pressured Due to Elevated Capital Intensity Fitch expects Constellation will generate increased cash flow from operations  (CFO) driven by strong underlying fundamentals, further leverage of new product  innovation, and increased efficiencies as expansion capacity comes online. Fitch  has increased its expectations for CFO in FY2016 by more than $100 million to  almost $1.3 billion due to higher operating earnings growth. The company expects  capital expenditures for FY2016 will be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15  billion, with capital expenditures related to the Nava brewery expansion in the  range of $950 million to $1.05 billion.  Fitch expects a free cash flow deficit of $50 million to $75 million in fiscal  2016, which compares to previous deficit expectations of approximately $200  million. Constellation initiated a dividend of approximately $240 million for  fiscal 2016. With accelerated investments for additional growth related beer  capacity likely required due to continued high demand growth, Fitch believes  Constellation's deficit will rise in FY2017 to approximately $225 million  although EBITDA growth should more than offset increased borrowing, resulting in  moderate leverage improvement. Recovery Rating Notching Constellation's bank obligations and the European borrower's bank obligations  are secured by a 100% pledge of certain material U.S. subsidiaries and a 65%  pledge of certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign holding companies. The  European Borrower's obligations are additionally secured by a 100% direct pledge  of certain other foreign subsidiaries which includes the Mexican brewery held by  CIH Holdings Mexico and the IP rights at the CI Cerveza subsidiary. Fitch  believes the additional stock pledge for the European borrower reflects a  superior recovery position at 'RR1'. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Additional key assumptions within Fitch's fiscal 2016 rating case for the issuer  include: --Consolidated revenue growth of 7.5% supported by depletion growth in the beer  segment of approximately 9%;  --Operating income margin improvement for the beer segment of approximately 200  basis points to 34%; modest increase in operating income margin in the wine and  spirits segment to the high 23% range; --Operating cash flow of almost $1.3 billion; --FCF deficit in the range of $50 to $75 million. With accelerated investments  for additional growth related beer capacity likely due to demand growth, Fitch  believes Constellation's deficit will rise to approximately $225 million in  FY2017; --Total debt to EBITDA leverage of approximately 4.1x versus previous  expectations of 3.8x - 3.9x by the end of FY2016. For FY2017, EBITDA expansion  should drive improvement to the upper-3x range. RATING SENSITIVITIES While a ratings upgrade is not anticipated over the next 12 months, future  developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating  action include: --Leverage such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA is under 3.5x or FFO  adjusted leverage is under 4.5x on a sustained basis; --Demonstrated ability to improve and sustain FCF margin above 3.5%; --Growing volume trends for their primary brands; --Maintain EBIT margin in the mid-20% range and EBITDAR margin of at least 30%. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Deterioration in volume trends leading to market share losses; --Significant and ongoing deterioration in profitability due to competitive  activity; --Increased leverage such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA moves above the  low 4x range or FFO adjusted leverage that moves above the low 5x range on a  sustained basis.  LIQUIDITY Constellation had a cash position of $330 million as of Aug. 31, 2015 with  nearly full availability ($15 million of outstanding letters of credit) under  its $1.15 billion senior secured revolving credit facility that matures in 2020.  Constellation also has two accounts receivable securitization facilities that  provide additional borrowing capacity from $235 million up to $330 million and  from $100 million up to $190 million structured to account for the seasonality  of the company's business. Both facilities were extended an additional 364-day  term in September 2015 and moderately upsized to provide additional liquidity  capacity. The facilities were undrawn as of Aug. 31, 2015. Upcoming debt maturities in fiscal 2017 include $700 million of 7.25% notes,  which Fitch expects will be refinanced. Annual amortization requirements for the  term loans over the next three fiscal years is approximately $35 million  remaining in FY2016, $138 million in FY2017 and $138 million in FY2018.

36,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB+/RR4' rating to  Constellation Brands, Inc.'s proposed $400 million senior unsecured notes  offering due 2025. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion  of the consideration for Constellation's pending acquisition of Ballast Point,  which is expected to close before Dec. 31, 2015. Constellation expects to use  cash on hand and borrowings under their senior credit facility or other credit  facilities to pay for the balance of its pending Ballast Point acquisition. As of Aug. 31, 2015, Constellation had $7.4 billion of debt outstanding and $330  million in cash. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release.

74,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the ratings of  Constellation Brands, Inc. (Constellation), including the company's Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'. A complete list of rating actions  follows at the end of this release. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings upgrade for Constellation reflects the expected continuation of  strong operating momentum and Fitch's expectation that leverage will be managed  to Constellation's target (net debt to EBITDA) of 3.5x versus previous target of  3x-4x. Constellation's cash priorities are focused on growth investments, a  dividend pay-out ratio in the 25% to 30% range, opportunistic M&A and share  repurchase strategy within the context of operating within its leverage target. Constellation has substantial financial flexibility to manage capital allocation  priorities due to its increased scale, above-average revenue prospects, EBITDA  growth in the low double-digit range and expected strong FCF generation (once  capital investment ramps down by the end of fiscal 2018 from beer capacity  expansion). Consolidated EBITDA margins in the 33% to 34% range should continue  to strengthen by at least 250 to 300 basis points during the next several years  driven by mix/price, independence from the interim beer supply agreement,  innovation and improved operating asset utilization. The strong profitability  also enables Constellation flexibility with investing behind the brands through  increased marketing and sales capabilities. Fitch expects FCF generation (Fitch  defined as CFFO less capital spending less dividends) to increase to in excess  of $700 million in fiscal 2019 from a projected $300 million in fiscal 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Transformative M&A Materially Increases Scale and Profitability During the past three plus years, Constellation has transformed its asset mix  through the 2013 Modelo acquisition ($5.3 billion including additional true-up  payment), subsequent bolt-on acquisitions that have totalled in excess of $2.5  billion including additional brewing capacity through the Obregon acquisition  and the expected divestiture of its lower growth, lower margin Canadian wine  business. Consequently, Constellation has materially increased diversity, scale  and exposure to above-average market growth rates in the beer, wine and spirits  segments. The recent bolt-on acquisitions present the opportunity for  Constellation to better leverage distribution, marketing scale, supply chain and  existing beer, wine and spirits assets. Fitch expects Constellation will  continue to explore opportunistic bolt-on M&A activity. Constellation has also  pursued a venture fund approach for low cost M&A opportunities in early stage  start-up companies. Leading Market Positions Focused On Premium Category Constellation's ratings consider the company's leading market positions and  well-known liquor portfolio. According to the company, Constellation is the  third-largest U.S. beer company with approximately 25% share of the high-end  U.S. beer market. Its Mexican beer portfolio is anchored by the Corona and Casa  Modelo brands, which are the number 1 and 2 imported beer brands in the U.S.,  respectively. Another strong performer is the quickly growing craft beer brand,  Ballast Point, which is now leveraging Constellation's national distribution and  marketing scale. The strong position is evident in Constellation's double-digit  depletion volume growth rate compared to a relatively flat overall growth rate  for the U.S. beer industry. Constellation is also one of the world's largest  wine producers, is focused on the faster growing premium and above categories  bolstered by recent bolt-on acquisitions, and produces Svedka, the largest  imported vodka brand in the U.S. Multiple Levers Driving Growth Fitch believes Constellation's premium-positioned beer, wine and spirits  portfolio is well placed to capture long-term growth and increase value share  during the next couple of years with volume growth in the beer segment in the  high-single digits range and wine and spirits segment in the mid-single digits  range. Within the beer segment, the Mexican beer portfolio has a strong appeal  with Hispanics, who consume 40% of Constellation's total beer volume, and with  the millennial consumer base. In addition, long-term ongoing premiumization  trends driven by Mexican imports and craft beer likely have significant runway  for further penetration. Constellation's strategies to drive growth include  increased distribution opportunities across its brand portfolio, innovation  including extensions of its Corona and Modelo brands, leveraging favorable  consumer demand trends and improved in-store merchandising. The Ballast Point acquisition allows Constellation to more effectively target  different demographic segments that are attracted to craft beer and spirits and  should minimize potential cannibalization of its existing Mexican beer and  spirits portfolio, thus supporting its growth profile. Risks to Constellation's  growth profile would include a material change with the U.S. government's view  on North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or a significant interruption  with the beer supply from the Nava brewery that would cause a slowdown in  consumption trends.  Constellation has begun to reduce the risk of a single supply source through a  greenfield brewery in Mexicali that should begin production of 5 million  hectolitres capacity in 2019. Additionally, the acquisition of the smaller  capacity Obregon brewing facility will allow Constellation an earlier exit from  its interim supply agreement and provide capacity to support medium-term  innovation efforts. The U.S. wine and spirits categories, with industry sales growth in the  mid-single digit range the past year, are among the fastest growing consumer  packaged goods categories with steadily increasing per capita consumption rates  over the past decade. The luxury/ super luxury wine segments have experienced  strong volume and dollar sales growth as consumers continue to trade up to wine  priced $20 and above. Constellation's recent acquisitions of wine and spirits  brands Meomi, Prisoner, High West and Charles Smith along with the divestiture  of its Canadian wine business highlights the company's focus on above premium  products by improving the growth/margin profile including price/mix and asset  utilization within the wine and spirits portfolio. Relatively Stable Leverage Expected Fitch anticipates leverage (total debt/EBITDA) will remain in line with the 3.5x  pro forma for the $400 million term loan issuance in September over the  longer-term. The strong beer business operating trends, which support the  expected high-single digit growth (Fitch's estimate) in operating income,  affords Constellation flexibility around its capital allocation priorities. This  flexibility will further increase as capital investments scale down after fiscal  2018. Consequently, given Constellation's increasing scale and cash generation,  Fitch expects further bolt-on M&A will not materially increase leverage with  Constellation remaining relatively measured and opportunistic with the pacing of  repurchasing shares. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Key assumptions within Fitch's rating case in FY2017 for Constellation include: --Consolidated revenue growth of approximately 12% supported by growth from the  beer segment in the mid 16% range;  --Operating income margin for the beer segment in the low 35% range; operating  income margin for the wine and spirits segment in the mid 25% range; --Operating cash flow of almost $1.6 billion; --Capital spending of around $1 billion; --FCF of approximately $300 million;  --Leverage (Total debt to EBITDA) of approximately 3.5x. In FY2018, Fitch's assumptions for Constellation include: --Consolidated revenue growth in the 2%-3% range after divestiture of the  Canadian wine business including beer segment growth in the high-single digit  range and organic wine and spirits growth in the mid-single digit range; --Operating income margin for the beer segment in the 35%-36% range; operating  income margin for the wine and spirits segment of at least 27%; --Operating cash flow greater than $1.8 billion; --FCF of approximately $200 million;  --Bolt-on sized acquisitions; --Leverage (Total debt to EBITDA) of approximately 3.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --Change in financial policy with commitment to sustain leverage (total  debt-to-operating EBITDA) at 3.0x or below;  --Sustained FCF margin above 5%; --Growing volume trends for Constellation's primary brands. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Increased leverage such that total debt-to-operating EBITDA is above the mid  3x range on a sustained basis; --Deterioration in volume trends leading to market share losses; --Significant and ongoing deterioration in profitability due to competitive  activity; --A prolonged operating issue that affects shipment of beer from the Nava  Brewery; --An adverse change with U.S. participation in NAFTA that could the institution  of tariffs between U.S. and Mexico; --A change in financial policy toward more aggressive shareholder-based  initiatives. LIQUIDITY Constellation had a cash position of $177 million as of Aug. 31, 2016 with  nearly full availability ($1.13 billion) under its $1.15 billion senior secured  revolving credit facility that matures in 2020. Constellation's LTM FCF was $414  million. For fiscal 2017, Fitch expects FCF of approximately $300 million given  increased capital investment requirements of around $1 billion driven by Mexican  beer capacity expansion. Constellation has two accounts receivable securitization facilities that provide  additional borrowing capacity from $235 million up to $340 million and from $120  million up to $210 million structured to account for the seasonality of the  company's business. Constellation had availability on the facilities of $300  million and $105 million respectively as of Aug. 31, 2016 with $70 million  outstanding. In September 2016, Constellation amended the accounts receivable  securitization facilities extending each facility for an additional 364-day  term. Constellation also had additional credit arrangements totaling $807  million, with $462 million outstanding.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction.
