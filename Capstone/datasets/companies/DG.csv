5,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON, March 16  BOSTON, March 16 Bargain store chains are flooding into North American malls and shopping centers like never before, upstaging old mainstays like J.C. Penney and Sears that are reeling from the one-two punch of an ailing economy and competition from online stores.""We're seeing a seismic shift in retail shopping centers,"" said Garrick Brown, director of research at real estate firm Cassidy Turley. ""The challenges of the weak economy are being replaced by the challenges of e-commerce.""The shift may reflect some consumer pain, but it has brought plenty of winners, too. Commercial real estate rents are rising, and many retailers, especially bargain chains, are in better shape than they have been since the Great Recession in 2008, analysts say. Shopping center vacancy rates in 60 major U.S. markets fell to 8.6 percent at the end of last year from 9.5 percent a year earlier, reflecting 38 million square feet of occupancy growth, according to Cassidy Turley research.As a result, price appreciation among retail assets led all commercial property types in 2013, rising 23 percent, according to Moodys/RCA CPPI.[ Click here for a graphic on store closings and opening -]J.C. Penney Co Inc and Sears Holding Corp  are retrenching and fighting for survival, raising a red flag for malls where, as anchor tenants, they draw foot traffic to nearby smaller stores. Meanwhile, Staples Inc and RadioShack Corp  earlier this month hit the U.S. commercial real estate market with plans to close a combined 1,325 stores. Analysts said they were slow to react to declining foot traffic and the surging amount of consumer shopping moving to the Internet.U.S. shopping center owners say they have had no reason for alarm. With new retail construction at historically low levels, they are getting help from a stable of discount retailers. Costco Wholesale Corp, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Dollar General, Nordstom Rack and Ross Stores have been quick to fill vacancies.Many of those stores are in great shape. Shares of bargain chain operators TJX Companies Inc and Dollar General Corp have risen 36 percent and 19 percent, respectively, over the past year as they open stores at a rapid clip. The top five Dollar store brands together have opened an average 2,000 new stores each of the past three years with similar growth plans for this year, according to researchers at Cassidy Turley.""Dollar stores have just had insane, insane levels of new growth,"" Brown said. Dollar General has more than 11,000 stores, with plans to open several hundred more in 2014. The chain has more stores than RadioShack and Staples combined, which have about 4,300 and 1,900, respectively.""I see a lot of companies interested in the space that Staples would be exiting,"" said Peter Dixon, who runs the $1.1 billion Fidelity Select Retailing Portfolio. The fund's 1-year return of 30.37 percent beats 96 percent of peers while trouncing its benchmark by 12.5 percentage points, according to Morningstar Inc data. Senior executives at Kimco Realty Corp agree with Dixon's assessment. Kimco, North America's largest owner and operator of neighborhood and community shopping centers, says it can absorb hits from consolidation in the office supply industry by signing up tenants such as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, and specialty grocer Sprouts, for example.TJX Cos, owner of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls and the operator of 3,200 stores, said cash outflows for property additions totaled $759 million for the nine months that ended Nov. 2. Capital spending plans for fiscal 2014 will amount to as much as $950 million, compared to J.C. Penney's plan for about $300 million, according to their financial reports.Kimco Chief Executive Dave Henry recently told analysts and investors at a Citi property conference that new store openings are at a five-year high.""So even as these retailers consolidate, the demand for these bigger box (spaces) is good and strong, and rents are beginning to jump,"" Henry said at the March 3 conference.In 2013 nearly 10,500 new retail stores opened, compared with about 2,600 closures, according to Factset research.",2014-03-16,DG,"Sun Mar 16, 2014 | 9:00am EDT",Bargain retail lifts U.S. shopping centers as big names stumble,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-retail-realestate-idUSL6N0MB3OL20140316?type=companyNews
6,"   By Sam Forgione  May 15 Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the first quarter zoned in on the consumer sector, with investments that included eBay Inc, Dollar General Corp and Walgreen Co.Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors opened a new stake of 1.7 million shares in discount retailer Dollar General, while Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners increased its stake in drug store operator Walgreen by 4.8 million shares to 12.1 million shares, regulatory filings showed on Thursday.EBay, which became a darling among top U.S. hedge funds in the fourth quarter just before billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn urged the company to spin off its PayPal payments business, continued to find fans in the first quarter.Omega increased its stake in eBay to 2.9 million shares from 854,800 shares and Jana opened a new stake of 3.9 million shares during the first quarter.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges. Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the first quarter.COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES  Tiger Global Management LLC, led by Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan, slashed its stake in soft drink producer and distributor Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc by 14.5 percent to 6.7 million shares.JPMORGAN CHASE & CO Omega Advisors increased its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co  by 1.6 million shares to 1.7 million shares in the first quarter. The bank's shares rose 3.8 percent in the quarter, compared with a 2.2 percent gain in the S&P financial index , which includes all financial shares in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index. GROUPON INC Jana Partners increased its stake in Groupon Inc's  class A shares by 9.8 million shares to 40.8 million class A shares. Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan's Tiger Global Management got rid of its entire stake in the operator of a ""deal-of-the-day"" website.GENERAL MOTORS CO Jana Partners sold nearly all of its stake General Motors Co , cutting its holding by about 8 million shares to just 7,100 shares. Omega Advisors sold its entire stake of 1.05 million shares. Shares of the automaker fell 15.8 percent in the first quarter.Since February GM has recalled 2.6 million cars because of   defective ignition switches prone to being jostled into accessory mode while the cars are moving. That would shut off engines and disable power steering, power brakes and air bags. The problem has been linked to at least 13 deaths.

11,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N adopted a poison pill to buy time to consider any possible deal that activist investor Carl Icahn could push for after becoming its largest shareholder.Family Dollar's move ""puts a damper"" on prospects for a ""friendly dialogue"" with the company's executives, Icahn told Reuters on Monday. Icahn reported a 9.39 percent stake in Family Dollar on Friday and said he was considering pushing the $6.89 billion company to merge with rival Dollar General Corp (DG.N).""How does it possibly matter if I own 10 percent or 15 percent of a company? All it does is it makes it more difficult to have a friendly dialogue, which we already are planning to have,"" Icahn said on Monday.Family Dollar adopted a one-year shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill, with a trigger of 10 percent. ""Poison pills"" deter hostile takeovers by triggering the issue of new shares, diluting holdings of investors who exceed a set threshold. Family Dollar's shares rose as much as 16 percent to $70.30  on the New York Stock Exchange, while Dollar General's shares rose as much as 14 percent to $65.97.Jefferies & Co raised its ratings on the stock of both companies to ""buy"", based on a potential merger and synergies of as much as $1.2 billion.""We think Dollar General could be a motivated buyer given where we are in the life cycle of this dollar-store industry and potential increased competition in small formats coming from Wal-Mart,"" analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a note. Dollar General, which has a market value of $17.59 billion, has been struggling to shore up margins after it slashed prices to keep its lower-income shoppers from shifting to Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N). Family Dollar, struggling with falling sales, said in April that it would close 370 stores, slow its expansion of new stores and slash prices.Getting antitrust approval will not be an issue as the companies do not sell exclusive goods, an antitrust expert, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.

The departure of Dreiling, 60, who has been chief executive since January 2008, throws a wrench into Icahn's proposal, analysts said.""We think it is very unlikely Dreiling's eventual successor would be inclined to immediately risk his or her legacy by making a very large and transformative acquisition early in their tenure,"" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba wrote in a note to clients. Sterne Agee & Leach analyst Charles Grom said the recent promotion of Todd Vasos to chief operating officer from head of merchandising suggested the company has a succession plan.Dollar General had been a chronic underperformer before Dreiling took over and is now the clear leader among U.S. deep-discount retailers, Chukumba said.Under Dreiling's leadership, Dollar General's annual sales increased by more than 80 percent to $17.5 billion in 2013 and its store count increased by 38 percent to more than 11,000, the company said. ""Rick Dreiling is a legend in the grocery and dollar space and one of the most highly respected CEOs out there, so losing him is clearly a negative for the company,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Dutch Fox, who also sees Vasos as a likely CEO, told Reuters.Dollar General's share price has nearly tripled since the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in November 2009.Dreiling, who has also been chairman since December 2008, will continue in that role during a transition period following the appointment of a new CEO, the company said on Friday. Dollar General said its board would conduct an internal and external search for a new CEO.

Dollar General had been a chronic underperformer before Dreiling took over and is now the clear leader among U.S. deep-discount retailers, Chukumba said.Under Dreiling's leadership, Dollar General's annual sales increased by more than 80 percent to $17.5 billion in 2013 and its store count increased by 38 percent to more than 11,000, the company said.""Rick Dreiling is a legend in the grocery and dollar space and one of the most highly respected CEOs out there, so losing him is clearly a negative for the company,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Dutch Fox, who also sees Vasos as a likely CEO, told Reuters. Dollar General's share price has nearly tripled since the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in November 2009.Dreiling, who has also been chairman since December 2008, will continue in that role during a transition period following the appointment of a new CEO, the company said on Friday.Dollar General said its board would conduct an internal and external search for a new CEO. Dreiling will stay on as CEO until May 30, 2015 or until the appointment of a successor.The company's shares were down 6.5 percent at $57.64 at midday. Up to Thursday's close, Dollar General's shares had risen 6.3 percent since Icahn, who holds about 9.39 percent of Family Dollar, pushed the idea of a merger.As of Thursday, Dollar General had a market value of $18.71 billion, while Family Dollar was valued at about $7.7 billion.

15,"   By David Beasley | ATLANTA  ATLANTA A drawn-out fight between an 11-term congressman and a former Fortune 500 chief executive in a key U.S. Senate race is due to be decided by Georgia's Republican voters on Tuesday.U.S. Representative Jack Kingston and David Perdue, former CEO of Reebok, Dollar General and Pillowtex, have traded jabs and tried to coalesce Republican support since emerging from a crowded primary field in May.Republicans consider it crucial to hold on to the seat, currently held by retiring Republican Saxby Chambliss, as they push to retake control of the Senate.The runoff is the longest in Georgia history after a federal judge ordered the state to move up the date of its primary election to allow more time for military and absentee ballots to be cast.Polls close at 7 p.m., and turnout for the close race appeared to be light on Tuesday, state election officials said. Kingston, 59, of Savannah, has worked to convince voters that his 21-year tenure in Congress is a strength despite low approval ratings for its members. He portrayed Perdue, who lives on Georgia's exclusive Sea Island, as a wealthy elitist. Perdue, 64, criticized Kingston as a Washington insider who voted to add trillions to the national debt and to raise his own pay seven times.When Kingston questioned the propriety of Perdue's 2010 appointment to the Georgia Ports Authority by his cousin, then-Governor Sonny Perdue, his opponent fired back that Kingston had not been able in 17 years to get the Port of Savannah deepened.Voters were split about whether a political veteran or newcomer would best serve them. “Experience matters,” said Kingston supporter Taton Thompson, 24, of Savannah. “When you go to Washington, you need to know what to do, you need to know how to pass legislation.”Don Cole, 60, a self-employed businessman from Cordele, said he wants a senator who has not been influenced for years by lobbyists.""Perdue comes in with a fresh perspective and he’s not tied down by all that,"" Cole said. Perdue and Kingston beat more conservative Tea Party candidates in the May 20 primary, drawing nearly 31 percent and 26 percent of the vote, respectively.Analysts say either man will be a strong challenger to well-financed Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn, former chief executive officer of President George H.W. Bush's Points of Light organization and daughter of onetime U.S. Senator Sam Nunn.Georgia has not elected a Democratic senator in 14 years.

America discount chain* Family Dollar shares close up 25 pct, Dollar tree up 1.2 pct   (Adds revenue comparison, Reuters TV link; updates shares)By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Ramkumar IyerJuly 28 Dollar Tree Inc agreed to buy rival discount chain Family Dollar Stores Inc for $8.5 billion to fend off growing competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and fellow discounter Dollar General Corp.Dollar stores have struggled in a weak U.S. economy as Wal-Mart and other large retail chains chase penny-pinching consumers by offering more items priced at $1 or less.The deal will give Dollar Tree more than 13,000 stores across the United States and Canada, vaulting the company ahead of Dollar General to become North America's biggest discount retailer, with more than $18 billion in annual sales.While the sale is a big win for Family Dollar's largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, the activist investor responded to the offer by saying there were ""a handful of potential buyers"" that he believed would be a better fit.""(We) are hopeful that one or more of them will surface,"" Icahn said in a statement. He had touted Dollar General as a potential buyer. Family Dollar shares closed up 25 percent at $75.74, above the cash-and-stock offer that valued the company at $74.50 per share.Dollar Tree shares closed up 1.2 percent at $54.87. Dollar General and Wal-Mart shares closed slightly down.Dollar General and Wal-Mart declined to comment.Combined, the three Dollar chains annual sales total about $35 billion, less than a tenth of Wal-Mart's $473 billion.Icahn stands to make about $200 million from the deal, a gain of about 32 percent on the price at which he bought his 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar this year, according to Reuters calculations. NEW SHERIFF Dollar Tree sells a mix of consumables in suburban stores across most U.S. states, as well as discretionary items such as gifts, party goods and greeting cards. Everything has a price tag of $1 or less.Most Family Dollar stores are in low-income neighborhoods. Its presence is biggest in Texas and the eastern United States, where it mainly sells lower-margin food and household products. ""This acquisition will extend our reach to lower-income customers,"" Dollar Tree Chief Executive Bob Sasser said.Family Dollar, which also sells many items at more than $1, has been struggling to reverse declining sales and earnings. The company has slashed prices on 1,000 basic items, cut jobs and shut hundreds of stores.""With a new sheriff in town, Family Dollar will be a much sharper competitor,"" Sterne Agee & Leach analysts wrote in a note.Sasser said it was ""too early to say"" whether Dollar Tree planned to cut jobs or close stores. Most of the $300 million in annual savings expected by 2018 would come from procurement and distribution, he told Reuters.""(Family Dollar) can produce more sales per square foot in their stores than they're currently producing,"" said Sasser. ""That can be done through expanding the better categories and contracting the lesser categories.""Family Dollar had about 34,000 full-time employees and about 24,000 part-time employees, as of Aug. 31. Dollar Tree had about 17,600 full-time and 69,800 part-time employees as of Feb. 1.Dollar Tree offered $59.60 in cash and the rest in stock for each Family Dollar share, in a deal with an enterprise value of about $9.2 billion.Dollar Tree said it had secured bridge financing from JP Morgan Chase Bank that, along with existing cash and bonds, would be used to finance the deal.J.P.

Competition to woo penny-pinching customers has intensified, particularly as Wal-Mart Stores Inc has opened more small-format stores."" ... They are trying to rally forces in order to compete more effectively,"" said Barbara Kahn, a professor at Wharton University of Pennsylvania.Many large retailers that cater to low- and middle-income consumers reported disappointing quarterly sales at their established stores last week, pointing to a cutback in spending and a shift in preferences to stores nearer to home.Sales at discount chains, however, have grown consistently since 2009 as shoppers have been spending more cautiously.The U.S. market for dollar stores grew 45.7 percent to $48.2 billion between 2008 and 2013 and is expected to grow 18 percent in the next five years, according to Euromonitor International.But the growth has recently started slowing due to intense competition, Kahn said.""We have a tremendous amount of strength in the rural communities and we have things to learn in the metro,"" Dollar General Chief Executive Rick Dreiling said on a conference call.

All three indexes extended gains from last week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, up around 0.9 percent, had climbed above the key 4,500 mark, a level it has not seen since April 2000, and the S&P 500 was back to within 1 percent of an all-time high in early afternoon trading.Homebuilders' stocks rose after the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index showed that homebuilder sentiment rose for the third straight month in August.The PHLX housing sector index climbed 1.4 percent,  lifted by a rally in major homebuilders, including PulteGroup Inc, up 2.2 percent at $18.67, and D.R.

35,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Devika  Krishna Kumar  Dollar General Corp offered to buy Family Dollar Stores Inc for $8.95 billion, trumping a bid by Dollar Tree Inc and aiming to strengthen its dominance of a growing segment of retailers serving penny-pinching customers.Shares of Family Dollar, the No. 2 U.S. discount chain, rose as much as 5.2 percent to $80.00 in regular trading, above the offer price of $78.50 per share in cash, suggesting that investors anticipate a bidding war.""Both Dollar General and Dollar Tree have some capacity to go a little bit higher with the offer price,"" said Joseph Feldman, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group.Dollar stores have been a popular choice for low- and middle-income U.S. consumers in a weak economy. At the same time, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other large retailers which serve a similar customer base have been struggling with weak sales amid a cutback in spending and a shift in preferences to stores nearer to home.The U.S. market for dollar stores grew 45.7 percent to $48.2 billion between 2008 and 2013 and is expected to grow 18 percent in the next five years, according to Euromonitor International.But the growth has recently started slowing due to intense competition, Kahn said.""We have a tremendous amount of strength in the rural communities and we have things to learn in the metro,"" Dollar General Chief Executive Rick Dreiling said on a conference call. ""Family Dollar is just the reverse.""The combined company would have nearly 20,000 stores across 46 U.S. states and annual sales in excess of $28 billion.It would also allow Dollar General to retain its No. 1 spot among U.S. dollar stores. Dollar Tree's $8.5 billion bid for Family Dollar, announced on July 28, would have vaulted that merged company ahead of Dollar General.Combined, the three dollar chains' annual sales total about $35 billion - less than a tenth of Wal-Mart's $473 billion.Dreiling, who will postpone a retirement planned for next year to stay on as CEO of the combined company through May 2016, said Dollar General had faced stiffer competition from new Family Dollar stores than from Wal-Mart.Both Dollar General and Family Dollar offer goods at multiple price points, while Dollar Tree sticks rigidly to a $1 or less format. This - along with the location of Dollar General and Family Dollar stores - would make Dollar General a more likely buyer, analysts said. Family Dollar's presence is biggest in Texas and the eastern United States. Texas is also home to more Dollar General stores than any other state - more than 1,000 stores, or about a tenth of the total.Family Dollar said on Monday it was reviewing Dollar General's offer, but has not changed its recommendation in support for a merger with Dollar Tree.Family Dollar had agreed to a $74.50 per share cash and stock deal with Dollar Tree last month.Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who in June took a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar, had pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General.On Monday, Icahn said he was ""surprised"" by Family Dollar's deal with Dollar Tree.He questioned whether Family Dollar CEO Howard Levine's future role at Dollar Tree could have influenced the company to go ahead with the deal.Dollar Tree said last month that Levine would remain as Family Dollar CEO after the acquisition. Icahn has cut his stake in Family Dollar to 3.6 percent from 9.4 percent as of July 30.Activist investor Nelson Peltz-led Trian Partners was Family Dollar's second-largest shareholder as of July 27 with a 7.34 percent stake.Dollar Tree declined to comment.Dollar General's offer, made in a letter to Family Dollar's board, represents a premium of 3.2 percent to Family Dollar's Friday close.The enterprise value of the offer is $9.7 billion, higher than Dollar Tree's $9.2 billion.Dollar General's shares closed up 11 percent at $64.14, while Dollar Tree's shares closed down 2.4 percent at $54.26. ANTITRUST CONCERNS Dreiling, who said he would not have announced his retirement had he known a deal between Family Dollar and Dollar Tree was under way, said antitrust approval for Dollar General's bid was not a concern.Dollar General is prepared to divest up to 700 retail stores to get regulatory approval for the deal, the same percentage that Dollar Tree had proposed.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough, however, said that more closings or divestitures might be needed.""Any market where they are dominant, and they are the only two players, is going to be questioned,"" he said. Antitrust lawyer Jared Bona of Bona Law, however, said the deal was likely to pass regulatory muster without much trouble.""I would be surprised if this deal is challenged under the antitrust laws because Dollar General is apparently willing to divest up to 700 retail stores to obtain antitrust approval.    Stating that up front means they probably don’t want a fight,"" he said. A U.S. Federal Trade Commission spokeswoman declined to comment. The FTC and the U.S. Justice Department share the responsibility for federal antitrust review of corporate mergers and acquisitions.Dollar General said it expected annual synergies of $550 million-$600 million three years after the deal closes. Dollar Tree had said it expected $300 million in annual savings by 2018. Dollar General has financing from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Global Markets Inc for the deal, including a $305 million termination fee payable to Dollar Tree.

The S&P 500 climbed above its previous intraday record of 1,991.39, set on July 24, in Thursday morning trading. Investors are eyeing the benchmark index's approach to 2,000, a significant level it has yet to breach.Market participants also refrained from making big bets on Thursday ahead of the start later today of the policymakers' meeting in Jackson Hole, which could provide clues on the timing of an interest-rate hike. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak at the Jackson Hole conference on Friday.""Overall, with the S&P reaching a new high and the Dow back above 17,000, you're seeing a bullish tone in the market,"" said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. ""But the real question will be, with the bullish economic data, will Yellen's comment in Jackson Hole remain as dovish as the market hopes it will be?""U.S. economic data, including a jump in existing home sales to a 10-month high and a sharp drop in initial jobless claims, pointed to an economy that is slowly gaining strength.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 91.39 points, or 0.54 percent, to 17,070.52. The S&P 500 gained 7.3 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,993.81. The Nasdaq Composite  added 6.30 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,532.78. The S&P 500 kept extending its record intraday high, touching 1,994.14 in late afternoon trading.Bank of America Corp shares shot up 3.8 percent to $16.11 after the company reached a record $16.65 billion settlement with the U.S. government to settle charges that the bank and companies it bought had misled investors into buying troubled mortgage-backed securities. The stock's rally helped lift the S&P 500 financial sector index to its highest level since June 2008.Technology shares advanced, with Hewlett-Packard  gaining 6.2 percent to $37.30 a day after the computing company posted a surprising increase in quarterly revenue. Shares of eBay jumped 4.9 percent to $56.02 on a report that the company was mulling a spinoff of its PayPal unit as soon as next year. The S&P technology index added 0.6 percent.Family Dollar Stores Inc rejected Dollar General Corp's $8.95 billion acquisition offer, citing antitrust concerns, and reaffirmed its support for a buyout offer from Dollar Tree Inc.Family Dollar shares slipped 0.3 percent to $79.55 and Dollar General dipped 0.3 percent to $63.60. Dollar Tree also reported quarterly results; its stock fell 1.1 percent to $54.40.Sears Holdings tumbled 7.7 percent to $33.18, putting it on track for its biggest percentage drop since January, after the owner of Sears department stores and the Kmart discount chain reported a ninth straight quarterly loss. Sears also said it might close more stores than planned this year.

Family Dollar said on Tuesday its board would review Dollar General's new offer and that it was committed to the Dollar Tree deal.Any deal will net Family Dollar CEO Howard Levine between $690 million and $750 million, based on his 8.2 percent stake in the company.Analysts said shareholders could pressurize the company to accept Dollar General's offer.""Family Dollar's board will be hard pressed to justify rejecting Dollar General's revised offer without risking a massive backlash from its shareholders,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba wrote in a note.Family Dollar's shares rose more than 1 percent to an all-time high of $80.97 on Tuesday, slightly above Dollar General's offer of $80 per share, suggesting some investors held hopes of higher offers.The fight for Family Dollar comes at a times when dollar chains are struggling with minimal or no gross margin growth as they try to keep lower-income shoppers from being lured by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).Wal-Mart is doubling down on small-format stores, typically one quarter the size of its supercenters, a move that could result in increased competition for the dollar stores.

The company said it hired Richard Feinstein, a former director of the Bureau of Competition at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to further ""validate its antitrust analysis"".Playing down antitrust concerns, Dollar General said its documents would show that the products it offered were not unique as they were also available at most mass retailers, drug and grocery stores. It also said that Wal-Mart, and not Family Dollar, was the primary driver for the company's pricing decisions.A transaction with Dollar General faces little risk of being stopped by the FTC in the absence of documents that show both companies only watch each others' pricing practices, said Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust expert with law firm Baker Hostetler.Dollar General and Family Dollar offer goods at multiple price points, while Dollar Tree sticks to a $1 or less format.Dollar General's shares were up 0.5 percent at $64.36.

The Dollar Tree bid is friendlier to Family Dollar's management.Levine, son of the founder of Family Dollar, would remain CEO of Family Dollar if it was bought by Dollar Tree.If Dollar General succeeds in buying Family Dollar, Levine is widely expected to lose his job, although this has not been confirmed.However, Levine stands to make about $745 million from his stake of 9.3 million shares in Family Dollar, which makes him the largest shareholder as of late July.Dollar Tree's cash-and-stock offer of $74.50 per share proposal would bring him about $50 million less.He would also be eligible to receive annual salary of at least $1.2 million and stock options for his continued role as CEO of the unit.Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP, the second-biggest shareholder in Family Dollar after Levine, declined to comment on the new offer.

62,"  (Repeats story that ran earlier. For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Nadia Damouni and Olivia OranNEW YORK, Sept 5 Dollar General Corp's  sweetened $9.1 billion proposal to buy Family Dollar Stores Inc  may fall short of allaying its smaller rival's fears U.S. antitrust regulators will block the deal, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Family Dollar already has a deal to sell itself to rival discount retailer Dollar Tree Inc for $8.5 billion. Dollar General, the largest U.S. dollar store, first appeared as an interloper last month with a $8.95 billion competing bid, or $78.50 per share, but Family Dollar rejected the offer saying it could run afoul of competition laws.Earlier this week, Dollar General returned with a new proposal, offering $80 per share and saying it would pay a $500 million reverse break-up fee to Family Dollar if regulators scuttle the proposed deal. Dollar General also said it would be willing to divest up to 1,500 stores, an increase from the 700 it originally proposed last month.But the sources familiar with the matter said the two key remedies offered by Dollar General - the  break-up fee and offer to sell more stores - failed to compensate the company for regulatory risk and may not work.Family Dollar's board has yet to convene to review the new proposal and a final decision on whether it should reject the bid has not been made, the sources said. But they added that the early sense within Family Dollar was that the new proposal still did not go far enough.Ideally, Family Dollar would want Dollar General to say it will do whatever it takes to close a deal, especially if it believes the proposed combination would pass regulatory muster, they said.However, Family Dollar has not engaged in a formal discussion with Dollar General, which has prevented it from  analyzing its larger rival's data. A spokeswoman for Dollar General declined to comment. But  in a press release on Tuesday the company said, ""we are confident that our enhanced proposal sufficiently addressed any concerns that led Family Dollar's Board of Directors to reject our prior proposal without any discussions between our companies.""A spokesman for Family Dollar declined to comment.If Family Dollar does reject the new bid, it could set the stage for a protracted battle for its future at a time when the dollar-store sector is struggling amid increased competition from big box stores like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp.Some pressure from investors has eased, however. Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who until recently was a vocal critic of Family Dollar management and had advocated for a sale to Dollar General, had sold his stake. ANTITRUST CONCERNS A combined Dollar General-Family Dollar would have nearly 20,000 stores across 46 U.S. states and annual sales in excess of $28 billion.Dollar General's proposed $500 million break-up fee represents roughly 5.5 percent of the total transaction value. But the sources said it falls short of the agreed amount in some other situations where there were big regulatory risks to the deal. For example in 2011, when AT&T Inc negotiated a deal to buy T-Mobile USA from its parent Deutsche Telekom AG, it agreed to pay cash and assets worth about $6 billion to compensate the seller if regulators shot down the deal.While the cash agreement was already unusually high at 7.7 percent of the total deal price, the addition of assets and services of a similar value meant the companies broke global records with a 15.4 percent break-up fee, according to Thomson Reuters Data.Family Dollar thinks that the deal, which would unite the two largest U.S. discount retailers, would face the same amount of scrutiny, if not more, as AT&T's T-Mobile bid, the sources said. And so it should come with equally huge break-up fees, they added.Further, one of the sources said Dollar General's promise to divest up to 1,500 stores does not remove regulatory risk either in the company's view. There are almost 3,000 zones where Family Dollar and Dollar General have stores within three miles of each other and there are no other competitors, the source said.One antitrust lawyer who is not involved in the transaction said Family Dollar's insistence on antitrust risk could be a strategy to drive up the price.""I wouldn't get too hung up on Family Dollar pointing to the antitrust risk,"" said Jonathan Klarfeld, an antitrust lawyer with Ropes & Gray LLP. ""It's still in their interest to say that there's an antitrust problem because they're still in negotiation.""But he added that Dollar General may not know enough to rule out antitrust issues since it does not  have access to Family Dollar's confidential files. Klarfeld also said the Federal Trade Commission would challenge the deal if the regulator and the companies could not agree on which stores to divest or if acceptable buyers for the stores could not be found.(Additional reporting by Soyoung Kim in New York and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Tom Brown)",2014-09-05,DG,"Fri Sep 5, 2014 | 7:00am EDT",RPT-DEALTALK-Dollar General new bid may not sway Family Dollar-sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/familydollar-ma-dollargeneral-antitrust-idUSL1N0R53AH20140905?type=companyNews

69,"  (Adds antitrust lawyer comment, background about the companies)By Soyoung Kim, Nadia Damouni and Olivia OranNEW YORK, Sept 9 U.S. retailer Dollar General Corp is preparing to go hostile as soon as this week in its bid to buy rival Family Dollar Stores, taking its $9.1 billion offer directly to shareholders after being spurned twice by its smaller rival, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Dollar General could launch a tender offer for Family Dollar as soon as Wednesday, these people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Family Dollar, which already has a deal to sell to Dollar Tree Inc for $8.5 billion, has rejected Dollar General's unsolicited approaches citing antitrust risks.Representatives for Dollar General and Family Dollar both declined to comment.Dollar General's expected hostile move could lead to a protracted takeover battle involving the nation's three largest U.S. dollar-store operators, at a time when these retailers are facing increasing competition from retailers like Wal-Mart and Target Corp. In its most recent offer made last week, Dollar General had added a $500 million break-up fee and increased the number of stores it is willing to sell to get antitrust approval to 1,500 from 700.Dollar General believes these new terms eliminated the antitrust risk for Family Dollar, people familiar with the matter said. But the rival rejected the sweetened bid, saying it still did not give the company sufficient protection.Family Dollar wants Dollar General to assume the entire risk of a deal getting shot down by U.S. regulators through a so-called ""hell or high water"" clause before agreeing to negotiate. Such a clause will commit the company to doing whatever it takes to complete the deal, such as carrying out any divestiture that antitrust regulators ask for.But Dollar General is not willing to offer such an assurance, partly because doing so could leave the retailer at the mercy of the antitrust regulators, who could demand huge divestitures, according to people familiar with the matter. Dollar General also believes it has already offered far more divestitures than is necessary to secure regulatory approval, the people said. While it is willing to sell off up to 1,500 stores if required by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, it still believes that the FTC will ask for far fewer to be divested, around 700, these people added.Some shareholders have questioned if Dollar General can find buyers for the stores that regulators would require them to sell. But the people familiar with the matter said there is a long list of potential buyers for such assets, including a handful of small box retailers such as Fred's, Happy Dollar and Five Below, as well as private equity firms. These buyers could be interested in dividing up the assets, the people said.A combined Dollar General-Family Dollar would have nearly 20,000 stores across 46 U.S. states and annual sales in excess of $28 billion. Family Dollar said it expects the FTC to challenge a deal with Dollar General, as it could lead to higher prices in areas where only the two retailers are present. The company said more than 6,000 Family Dollar stores have a Dollar General store within three miles. Many of those locations also do not have a third competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.Dollar General has played down its rival's antitrust concerns, saying that Wal-Mart was the primary driver for its pricing decisions, not Family Dollar.The FTC would want to make sure that whoever buys the divested stores would be able to keep them open and profitable, said Claudia Higgins, an antitrust expert with the law firm Kaye Scholer, who is not involved in the deal.Higgins said that she had seen instances where a failure to find an appropriate buyer for divested assets did lead to the collapse of a deal but that this was not common and tended to happen in specialized industries.""Seems to me that somebody who runs drug stores would know how to run a store that sells sundries. Or the owner of a small grocery store. Or a private equity company that owns retailers,"" she said.Last week, Dollar Tree said it amended its merger agreement with Family Dollar to include a commitment to divest as many stores as necessary to clear antitrust hurdles. It had previously agreed to divest 500 stores.

The company did not comment on its merger plans in its earnings conference call on Thursday. On Oct. 1, Dollar General extended its tender offer to acquire Family Dollar shares for $80 a piece from Oct. 8 to end of this month. The battle in the discount retail industry comes at a time when Dollar stores are desperate to scale up as they try to keep lower-income shoppers from being lured by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).Family Dollar, which did not provide guidance for fiscal 2015 pending its merger with Dollar Tree, said the company's first quarter in fiscal 2015 will be challenging due to competitive intensity and as low-income customers continue to be wary of spending. Net income for the fourth quarter ended Aug. 30 fell 66 percent to $34.5 million, or 30 cents per share from $102.2 million, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 73 cents per share from 86 cents per share.Family Dollar had $10.4 million in inventory write-downs, as it shut 375 stores during the quarter.

The company, which operates over 8,000 stores in 46 states, said net sales rose 4.5 percent to $2.61 billion. Same-store sales rose 0.3 percent, after three straight quarters of decline driven by an increase in average customer transaction value which offset a decline in transactions.Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Levine said the company anticipated the first quarter in fiscal 2015 to be the most challenging next year.""Our core customer is struggling ...

Family Dollar instead opted for a lower cash-and-stock deal from Dollar Tree Inc of $74.50 per share, on which it will hold a shareholder vote on Dec. 11.Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Taylor Labarr said Dollar General's decision to extend the tender offer was to allow Family Dollar shareholders time to make a decision after the special meeting. ""They (Dollar General) extended the offer through the end of the year, that covers them through the shareholder vote, which I think is the key thing,"" Labarr said.""It's giving cover for FDO shareholders to reject the Dollar Tree deal and still be able to tender for the offer with Dollar General,"" he added.Dollar General and Family Dollar's shares were largely unchanged in afternoon trading. Dollar Tree shares were up 1.9 percent at $60.71. Earlier in the day, its shares rose as much as 2 percent to a record high of $61.00.

Net income fell to $41.4 million, or 36 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended Nov. 29, from $78 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.Family Dollar agreed to be bought by smaller rival Dollar Tree for $8.50 billion in cash and stock and rejected a hostile, $9.1 billion offer from Dollar General because of antitrust concerns.In December, Family Dollar shareholders voted by a wide margin to put off a vote approving the Dollar Tree offer, indicating interest in the higher offer despite its risk.

98,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 9 Some 20 state attorneys general have joined the federal antitrust investigation of competing bids by Dollar General Corp and Dollar Tree Inc  to buy Family Dollar Stores  Inc, a development that potentially complicates the companies' efforts to win U.S. approval for a deal.The attorneys general concern focuses on the likelihood that the loss of one of the chains would lead to higher prices for discount store customers, many of whom are poor, said two sources who spoke privately because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.Family Dollar had previously disclosed that state attorneys general were involved in the federal investigation but gave no details.The 20 states looking at this deal are similar in number to those looking at Comcast Corp's plan to buy Time Warner Cable Inc and Sysco Corp's bid for US Foods Inc, both of them high-profile deals.Florida is a member of the multi-state group, which joined the Federal Trade Commission to determine if the deals were legal under antitrust law, according to Whitney Ray, spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi. Vermont had also joined, said Jill Abrams, an assistant attorney general in the state.Iowa is also in the group, according to a source who was not authorized to speak to reporters. Indiana is looking into the mergers, but a spokesperson declined to say if it had formally joined the multi-state group of attorneys general.The presence of the state attorneys general gives the FTC additional lawyers to look at the case, much-needed knowledge of how the merging companies function in the state and how the deal would affect the state's consumers, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust attorney with the Konkurrenz Group in Washington, DC.""There are times where federal government wants to do one remedy and you have a state or two who believe that there should be more done in their state.

Family Dollar shareholders on Dec. 23 adjourned voting on the Dollar Tree offer, indicating interest in the higher offer despite its risk.Family Dollar on Monday asked its shareholders to vote for the Dollar Tree offer at a Jan. 22 shareholder meeting.""After two delays, we have been more than reasonable but have reached the end of our patience,"" Dollar Tree Chief Executive Bob Sasser said in a letter to Family Dollar. Dollar General has said that it was willing to divest up to 1,500 stores to satisfy FTC concerns but Family Dollar said Monday that offer could fall short.Family Dollar warned on Monday that regulators will want many more than 1,500 stores divested, saying that the FTC, which is looking at both possible deals to ensure they comply with antitrust law, identified a long list of what it called ""problematic stores"" if Dollar General prevails.""We estimate based on experience with earlier iterations of the FTC staff's store lists that the current count of stores that the FTC staff views as presumptively problematic is around 3,500 to 4,000 stores,"" Family Dollar said in a letter to shareholders. Dollar General will provide an update before the vote, a spokeswoman said.""I think more people are going to be leaning toward Dollar Tree after today,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.Dollar Tree said it expects to close the acquisition as soon as March after the FTC's Bureau of Competition approved the store divestitures. The company would present potential buyers for the stores to the FTC within a month.Shares of Dollar Tree ended nearly flat.

110,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Dollar General Corp (DG.N) could make smaller acquisitions and build its store footprint to better compete with Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O), which is poised to become the largest discount retailer after its acquisition of Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N.  On Thursday, Family Dollar shareholders approved a cash-and-stock deal to be bought by Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion, derailing Dollar General's $9.1 billion all-cash offer. The deal, which will give the combined company more than 13,000 stores and more than $18 billion in annual sales, is not expected to hurt Dollar General's growth and competitive standing, analysts said.        Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Taylor LaBarr said that Dollar General is now expected to focus on expanding its footprint of more than 11,500 stores, while Dollar Tree slows store openings to integrate Family Dollar. The company also has a competitive edge for up to two years as Dollar Tree enters a period of financial and operational frictions related to the integration, he wrote.          Dollar General said in December it was on track to open about 700 stores in the year ending in January. The company declined to comment for this story.""With gas prices down considerably over the past two months and home heating bills likely to (be) far lower than last year, there are several reasons to be more optimistic on the sales front in the coming periods for Dollar General,"" Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Charles Grom wrote in a note.Grom also said the extension of Dollar General chief executive officer's term was a ""big win"" for the company at a time it is facing growing competition from smaller format stores by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).   The company said its Chief Executive Officer Rick Dreiling, slated to step down at the end of May, would now stay on till January 2016. Grom said Dreiling needs to focus on expansion and prepare the company to face competitive threats, which now includes the Dollar Tree-Family Dollar combination. Dollar General has not detailed its strategy after losing out on Family Dollar.  On an analyst call in December, the company outlined a strategy that included focusing on affordability, selling more higher-margin private label goods, and promoting its digital coupon program. Analysts including S&P Capital IQ's Efraim Levy said Dollar General could look to grow faster by making tuck-in acquisitions.History shows that Dollar General, founded in 1939, has been averse to making acquisitions.

Investors will also keep a keen eye on a slew of U.S. economic data due this week for clues on the timing of the Federal Reserve's first rate increase in nearly a decade.Data due on Tuesday includes April factory orders at 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). Demand for manufactured goods is likely to have been flat after a strong showing in March.The auto industry will report sales for May and analysts expect demand to have been flat or down slightly from last year. ""If the Fed keeps delaying and doesn't start the process of a rate hike, they are going to lose credibility,"" said Meckler who reckons that September is the best bet for a hike.S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 4.25 points.

135,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Discount retailer Dollar General Corp (DG.N) reported higher-than-expected growth in quarterly sales at established stores as more customers visited its outlets and they spent more on items such as snacks, tobacco and home products.Shares of the company, which also forecast full-year same-store sales growth largely above analysts' estimates, rose as much as 9.4 percent to a record high of $82.27 in noon trading on Thursday. Larger rival Dollar Tree Inc's (DLTR.O) shares gained as much as 5 percent.Dollar General's sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter as lower gas prices and rising wages encourage consumers to loosen their purse strings.This growth was stronger than the 1.9 percent analysts on average had expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.  Dollar General's performance was in sharp contrast to that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which reported lower-than-expected comparable sales for the holiday quarter last month, hurt by a strong dollar and low prices for grocery products. Customers prefer Dollar General's stores to Wal-Mart's ""supercenters"" for small purchases, mainly due to the smaller size and convenient locations of the discount retailer's outlets, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.""They've (Dollar General) shown the consumer we are convenient, our prices are competitive with the Walmarts of the world, much better priced than the drugstores, that's where you've seen them take a lot of (market) share,"" he said.Dollar General plans to open 80 smaller format stores this year in addition to the 30 it already operates, to better tap densely populated areas and rural locations, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a post-earnings conference call.  Overall, the retailer plans to open about 900 stores by January 2017. Dollar General forecast full-year same-store sales growth of 2-4 percent, largely above the 2.8 percent analysts on average were expecting.The company also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share from 22 cents, and said it would buy back about $1 billion in shares in fiscal 2016.  Dollar General's net income rose about 6 percent to $376.2 million, or $1.30 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 29, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales increased 7 percent to $5.29 billion, but came slightly below the average estimate.

""The world was really, really happy with this mainly because we're all addicted to zero interest rates,"" said Kim Forrest, research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""It's free money.""When Draghi said future cuts would only happen under extreme circumstances, investors expecting even lower rates switched their strategy to risk off, Forrest said.At the same time, other investors feared lower interest rates in Europe would harm U.S. banks and negatively impact exports by leading to euro devaluation, dragging the market down further, she said. ""We're torn between fear and greed and it all happens on the same day,"" said Forrest.Crude oil prices, the stock market's other major driver, fell after Reuters reported that a proposed meeting between major oil producers to discuss an output cut was unlikely to take place without Iran's participation.

138,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Discount retailer Dollar General Corp (DG.N) reported higher-than-expected growth in quarterly sales at established stores as more customers visited its outlets and they spent more on items such as snacks, tobacco and home products.Shares of the company, which also forecast full-year same-store sales growth largely above analysts' estimates, rose as much as 9.4 percent to a record high of $82.27 in noon trading on Thursday. Larger rival Dollar Tree Inc's (DLTR.O) shares gained as much as 5 percent.Dollar General's sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter as lower gas prices and rising wages encourage consumers to loosen their purse strings.This growth was stronger than the 1.9 percent analysts on average had expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.  Dollar General's performance was in sharp contrast to that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which reported lower-than-expected comparable sales for the holiday quarter last month, hurt by a strong dollar and low prices for grocery products. Customers prefer Dollar General's stores to Wal-Mart's ""supercenters"" for small purchases, mainly due to the smaller size and convenient locations of the discount retailer's outlets, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.""They've (Dollar General) shown the consumer we are convenient, our prices are competitive with the Walmarts of the world, much better priced than the drugstores, that's where you've seen them take a lot of (market) share,"" he said.Dollar General plans to open 80 smaller format stores this year in addition to the 30 it already operates, to better tap densely populated areas and rural locations, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a post-earnings conference call.  Overall, the retailer plans to open about 900 stores by January 2017. Dollar General forecast full-year same-store sales growth of 2-4 percent, largely above the 2.8 percent analysts on average were expecting.The company also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share from 22 cents, and said it would buy back about $1 billion in shares in fiscal 2016.  Dollar General's net income rose about 6 percent to $376.2 million, or $1.30 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 29, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales increased 7 percent to $5.29 billion, but came slightly below the average estimate.

The core dollar store shoppers seem to be doing better than their higher-income counterparts, helped by rising employment, wage gains and as they are not impacted by stock market volatility, Brian Yarbrough, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones, said.Lower fuel prices have also resulted in more savings.Dollar Tree's best-selling categories in the quarter ended April 30 included household products, food and beverage and party supplies. Dollar General said it was seeing new categories of shoppers at its stores, including middle-income customers and millennials.""The millennial shopper represents about 12 percent of our shoppers and 24 percent of our sales. On average, she is shopping our stores about three times a month,"" Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on a conference call.Dollar Tree said its net sales more than doubled to $5.09 billion in the first quarter, helped by the acquisition of larger rival Family Dollar Stores in July.

152,"  (Adds details on case, paragraphs 4-10)By Lawrence HurleyWASHINGTON, June 23 The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday allowed a child sexual molestation lawsuit against discount retailer Dollar General Corp to move forward in a Native American tribal court in Mississippi.The justices were split 4-4, leaving intact a lower court decision that said the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians' tribal court can hear a family's civil suit accusing a non-Indian man who managed a Dollar General store located on tribal land of molesting a 13-year-old boy.Under U.S. law, Native American tribes can act in certain matters as semi-autonomous sovereign entities. Tribal courts primarily allow Native Americans to resolve disputes among tribe members. The Supreme Court has previously limited their jurisdiction. Dollar General, questioning the impartiality of tribal courts, argued that the suit should have been filed in state court because it involved a non-tribe member. The decision sets no nationwide precedent on tribal court jurisdiction.The 4-4 split means there were no written opinions in the case. During Dec. 7 oral arguments in the case, the issue of whether a tribal court could be provide a neutral forum for a legal dispute involving a non-tribe member became a central point. After Dollar General's lawyer questioned the impartiality of such courts, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor retorted, ""You're just assuming that these judges are not neutral.""The family of the boy, a tribe member, sued Tennessee-based Dollar General and the store manager in tribal court in 2005 over molestation alleged to have taken place in 2003, seeking $2.5 million in damages. The store was operated by Dollar General subsidiary Dolgencorp LLC. The boy was working at the store as part of a youth training program.Dollar General, which has more than 12,300 stores in 43 U.S. states and more than 109,000 employees, sought to block the case in tribal court by suing in federal court in 2008, but a federal judge and later the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled in favor of the tribe.The Obama administration and six states, including Mississippi, filed court papers backing the tribe.

156,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Discount retailer Dollar General Corp (DG.N) said it was cutting prices on its most popular items such as bread, eggs and milk, intensifying a price war with retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to win back market share.Dollar General's shares fell as much as 14 percent on Thursday after the company reported quarterly sales below estimates, blaming aggressive competition, lower food prices and a reduction of food stamp coverage in several U.S. states.Larger rival Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) also reported lower-than-expected sales, sending its shares down 8.3 percent.Dollar General cut prices by 10 percent on average on about 450 of its best-selling items across 2,200 stores during the quarter, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a conference call.He said the company expects to extend the price reductions to more product categories and markets. Wal-Mart's strategy of cutting prices has helped the world's largest retailer to boost sales in the latest two quarters. ""Wal-Mart's been doing better lately, lowering prices, and that's been a concern that (it) could impact dollar stores,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ""Historically, it hasn't as much but maybe we are seeing something different here."" Dollar store operators have expanded aggressively in recent years, taking market share from Wal-Mart and other retailers, thanks to their smaller store sizes, improving product assortment and price points starting $1.Dollar Tree's Chief Financial officer Kevin Wampler downplayed any impact from competition. ""I can't tell you (competition) is an issue anymore for us than it usually is."" Retailers are also grappling with a drop in grocery prices that has pressured margins in the second quarter .Dollar General said prices for milk were down about 8 percent and for eggs over 50 percent. 'SNAP' CUTS HURT Some states changed in April the criteria for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamp program, as they brought back a three-month limit on benefits for unemployed adults.More than 500,000 people are estimated to lose SNAP benefits this year, according to research group Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  Dollar General said the changes in SNAP along with grocery deflation reduced same-store sales by 60-70 basis points in the second quarter ended July 29 and were expected to hurt results in the second half of the year as well.Though Dollar Tree said the impact from changes to food stamps was small, the company's acquisition of larger rival Family Dollar last year has increased its exposure to the program.Dollar Tree, which traditionally caters to middle-income consumers, attributed the ""challenging retail environment"" to consumers being pressured by higher rent and healthcare costs.Dollar Tree also cut its full-year sales forecast to $20.69 billion-$20.87 billion.The company's net sales rose 66 percent to $5 billion in the second quarter ended July 30, helped by the Family Dollar deal.Dollar General's net sales rose 5.8 percent to $5.39 billion.

165,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Discount retailer Dollar General Corp (DG.N) reported a surprise drop in quarterly comparable sales and tempered its full-year profit forecast, hit by lower grocery prices and reduced food stamp coverage in several U.S. states.The company's shares were down 7.3 percent at $71.67 in morning trading on Thursday.Food prices have fallen in the past few months due to low commodity prices and intense competition, resulting in aggressive price cuts by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other food retailers.Grocery deflation has reduced the price gap between Dollar General and higher-priced rivals and has made the company's prices less competitive, Conlumino analyst Håkon Helgesen said.Wal-Mart has likely captured some spend of Dollar General's customers, Helgesen said.Dollar General said it reduced prices on about 450 items in about 17 percent of its 13,205 stores in the third quarter but it did not help drive traffic as much as anticipated. ""It became apparent that our incremental actions would not be able to overcome the decline in traffic in our stores... requiring greater-than-anticipated markdowns,"" CEO Todd Vasos said.Discount retailers have also been hit by changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly called the food stamp program.By the end of 2016, 22 states would have changed the criteria for SNAP - which is likely to result in as many as 1 million Americans losing benefits. States implementing SNAP changes this year include Florida, Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee, which have some of the highest concentration of Dollar General stores.Comparable sales in such states were reduced by about 1 percentage point due to the cuts, Vasos said.""The cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors such as the reduction of SNAP participation and benefit levels and increased housing and healthcare expenses appear to have taken a noticeable toll on (consumer) spending."" Dollar General said it now expects earnings to come in at the low end of its 10-15 percent growth forecast range for the year ending Feb. 3.For the third quarter ended Oct. 28, sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.1 percent, compared with the 0.8 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.Net income fell 7 percent to $235.3 million, or 84 cents per share, and included a charge of about 5 cents per share.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 93 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
