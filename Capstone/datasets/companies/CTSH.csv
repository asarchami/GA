26,"   By Abhirup Roy  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp's fourth-quarter revenue rose more than expected and the IT services provider forecast a pick up in annual revenue growth as healthcare and financial services clients in North America boost spending.The company shares rose as much as 7 percent to a record high of $58.94 on Wednesday.Like its Indian rivals Tata Consultancy Services, and Infosys Ltd, Cognizant also gets the largest chunk of its revenue from financial services clients.But the company's healthcare business, which accounts for about a quarter of revenue, was the fastest growing in the year ended December.After slowing in the third quarter, growth in the business picked up in the fourth quarter, helping assuage concerns about spending by clients such as insurers, hospitals and state-run exchanges set up under the U.S. Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.That helped the company's total revenue rise a better-than-expected 16.4 percent to $2.74 billion in the quarter. Robert W. Baird & Co analyst David Koning said organic constant currency revenue growth was about 14 percent, the company's strongest acceleration in over four years.""The core business in healthcare seems to be getting better again and we heard competitors also say financial services and healthcare are doing quite well,"" Koning said. ""So, I think that's what's setting up a really nice growth pattern.""Cognizant, which gets nearly 80 percent of revenue from North America but has most of its employees in India, forecast 2015 revenue growth of at least 19 percent. That was higher than the 16.1 percent achieved in 2014, the lowest in the Teaneck, New Jersey-based company's 20-year history.""We think there are significant opportunities in the healthcare space in the next several years, particularly here in the United States with the continued implementation of the Affordable Care Act,"" Chief Financial Officer Karen McLoughlin told Reuters.Revenue in Cognizant's healthcare business grew 26 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by the $2.7 billion acquisition of TriZetto Corp in the quarter. Excluding TriZetto, the company's biggest deal ever, healthcare revenue grew 15.2 percent, which was still the highest among its major businesses.Profit rose 11.9 percent to $362.9 million, or 59 cents per share.

Cognizant said in May it expected healthcare to drive growth this year, helped by its $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. healthcare IT services provider TriZetto Corp and the implementation of the U.S. Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.Shares of Cognizant, which also raised its full-year revenue and adjusted profit forecasts for the second time this year, rose as much as 9.6 percent in early trading on Wednesday.Revenue from Cognizant's healthcare clients surged 39 percent to $897.3 million in the second quarter ended June 30, while revenue from its core financial clients rose 18.1 percent to $1.25 billion. The company's healthcare business accounted for 29.1 percent of revenue in the quarter, compared with 25.6 percent in the same quarter of 2014.An unprecedented wave of M&A activity among health insurers  has created some uncertainty for Cognizant, however.On one hand, merged companies may need help to integrate their systems.

44,"   By Abhirup Roy  IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) forecast its slowest quarterly revenue growth in 14 years, adding to mounting worries about clients keeping a tight lid on technology spending.Shares of the company, which also reported its first revenue miss in six quarters, fell as much as 8.7 percent to a year-low of $53.46 in morning trading on Monday.Cognizant, whose rivals include Indian IT services firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS) and Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS), said the financial services sector was off to a slow start this year.""They're certainly slowing down some of the discretionary spend as well as looking for ways to optimize even on the run-the-business activities through efficiency and more effectiveness,"" President Gordon Coburn told Reuters.Coburn said the sector was in a challenging environment due to volatility in the markets.Revenue in the financial services business, the company's biggest, rose 16.6 percent to $1.31 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Growth in healthcare also slowed this quarter.Revenue in the division rose about 23 percent to $951.9 million, the slowest in five quarters, and accounted for about 30 percent of total revenue.A wave of M&As among U.S. health insurers is set to reduce the number of national players to three from five. This has created uncertainty, as the companies pause spending while they work through the deals.However, Coburn said the business was likely to see significant strength around mid-2016 with a strong pipeline of large deals.

45,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Investors spooked by a steep sell-off in enterprise tech stocks will get a fresh glimpse of the health of technology spending on Wednesday when bellwether Cisco Systems Inc posts its quarterly results.The networking equipment maker is the largest of several companies reporting this week that have benefited from the trend toward information technology (IT) delivered over the Internet, widely known as cloud computing. But Cisco relies heavily on demand from China and other developing countries whose economies have been losing steam.Stocks of companies selling cloud computing and data analytics fell for a second session on Monday after Tableau Software Inc last week disappointed investors with a weak revenue forecast.Analysts for year have been hyping companies in cloud computing and ""Big Data,"" which refers to the analysis of growing amounts of stored data, and investors are becoming more critical of the valuations on such stocks.Cisco's stock was unchanged on Monday while shares of other enterprise technology companies reporting this week fell sharply.  Along with Tableau's disappointing report, Monday's poor revenue forecast from IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp stood in contrast to relatively upbeat reports from Microsoft Corp and SAP SE , leaving investors uncertain about the broad health of IT spending.Cisco is expected to report a 1.5 percent drop in revenue for the January-ended quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, but investors fear the current quarter could be worse.  ""If Cisco gets up and says 'We're worried about macro conditions in emerging markets hurting overall demand for technology', that's a big wet blanket on the branded IT companies,"" said Needham & Company analyst Alex Henderson.Global IT spending dropped 6 percent in 2015 and it will grow less than 1 percent this year, according to market research firm Gartner. Other companies in the spotlight this week include Akamai Technologies Inc, whose customers include Audi and MTV Networks. Late Tuesday, it is expected to report a 6 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue, its smallest quarterly growth since at least 2010.  ""We have a market that's absolutely in a risk-off mode and given the heightened uncertainty around the name, there's a lot of fear,"" said Evercore analyst Jonathan Schildkraut, among the majority of analysts who recommend buying Akamai's stock.Other enterprise IT companies reporting this week are Limelight Networks Inc and Fidelity National Information Services Inc  Tuesday, and cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc on Thursday. Their stocks were down between 4 percent and 9 percent on Monday.
