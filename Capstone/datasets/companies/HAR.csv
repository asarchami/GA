It has closed below that level just four times this year, the last one in mid April. Markets kept an eye on eastern Europe as Moscow imposed a ban on imports of many Western foods, retaliating against sanctions imposed for its support of rebels in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. Russia will ban various imports from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada and Norway in a measure that isolates its consumers from world trade to a degree unseen since Soviet days.""The Russian situation has gone from bad to worse,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, adding that ""imposing an import restriction on agricultural products will likely lead to rapid inflation.""However, he said the recent volatility and pullback are not foreshadowing a market correction. ""Earnings are robust, revenues are rising, and interest rates are likely to go up gradually,"" Jacobsen said. ""These are not the conditions that create market corrections.""The sanctions by Moscow are seen as possibly hurting European economies more than the United States due to closer ties between Russia and Europe. Such a scenario could favor U.S. equities and other assets as foreign cash looking for yield may head towards the world's largest economy. The full extent of the impact, however, is yet to be known.""Geopolitical risks are heightened, are higher than they were a few months ago. And some of them, like the situation in Ukraine and Russia, will have a greater impact on the euro area than they ... have on other parts of the world,"" European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said after the ECB left interest rates unchanged at record lows. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 68.62 points or 0.42 percent, to 16,374.72, the S&P 500 lost 8.33 points or 0.43 percent, to 1,911.91 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 11.15 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,343.90.Health insurer stocks fell after Goldman Sachs downgraded Aetna to neutral and cut earnings estimates on a number of its larger peers. Aetna shares fell 3 percent to $75.97. The S&P managed healthcare index fell 2.7 percent.Shares of Harman International Industries fell 4.1 percent to $106.71 after the maker of JBL and Harman Kardon audio systems forecast full-year profit below market estimates as it spends more to boost production in lower-cost countries.On the flip side, Twenty-First Century Fox was the largest gainer on the S&P 500 after quarterly profit beat Wall Street's expectations. Executives stressed they would not make a new approach for Time Warner Inc after withdrawing an $80-billion bid. Fox shares rose 5.5 percent to $34.09.The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week and the four-week claims average, considered a better measure of labor market trends, fell to its lowest since February 2006.

14,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Oct 14 - For over seven years, fund managing partners Bob Olstein and Eric Heyman have had the good fortune of investing in a number of companies that were later bought out or became targets of big-name shareholder activists.This year alone, their Olstein Strategic Opportunities Fund  has seen two of its holdings targeted by activists and another six the object of announced acquisitions. That's a significant showing for a fund with a smallish $116 million portfolio.Those kind of market events generally drive big gains in a stock's price, and the fund's ability to be there first has rewarded shareholders. Over three years its returns have been double those of the average activist hedge fund, making its portfolio one for bargain hunters to watch.Heyman and Olstein, who ran his own stock research service in the 1960s, have a simple explanation for their success: it's all about the balance sheet.""A lot of people look at these businesses and treat them as stocks,"" Heyman said in an interview. ""We look at it as if we are a private equity company and we are buying the business.""Over the five years ended Sept. 30, outside activists like Jana Partners, Relational Investors and Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners have invested in nine of the companies that are among Olstein's portfolio holdings; none would comment for this story.""We think there are some pretty smart people monitoring our portfolio,"" the 73-year-old Olstein told Reuters. Heyman and Olstein look for small-cap companies that have stumbled but offer solid management, turnaround prospects and the ability to produce free cash flow.Those metrics have brought them to companies like CareFusion , a top holding of the fund that recently agreed to be acquired by Becton Dickinson & Co in a deal that valued the company at a 26 percent premium to its last closing share price. In July, when hedge fund Jana Partners announced its activist stake in PetSmart Inc, the Olstein fund was already sitting on 69,000 shares, according to Lipper.The fund also holds nutritional supplement retailer Vitamin Shoppe, which is the subject of shareholder and activist calls for a sale.. AN AVENUE FOR INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS As of Sept. 30, the Olstein fund had a three-year annualized return of 26.48 percent, while the Activist Hedge Fund Index had an annualized return of 13.16 percent.""For individual investors who cannot afford to invest with the hedge fund activists, this is a way to own shares of the companies many are targeting,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ.The Olstein fund is expensive, with management fees of 1.60 percent, and certain share classes carry sales charges. It is, however, cheaper than activist hedge funds, which tend to charge management fees around 1.75 percent plus incentive fees. The fund has not escaped this year's stock market selloff. It is down 2.24 percent through Oct. 10, compared with the 7.44 percent average decline for Lipper's category of small cap core funds.There is one consumer fund that is solely focused on activists' targets, the 13D Activist Fund, but it buys companies after they have been targeted. The fund returned 0.71 percent this year through Oct. 10.But for Olstein and Heyman, value is not defined by activists' interests. They still hold audio equipment maker Harman International Industries, five years after buying the stock and two years after it was targeted by Relational Investors.Similarly, Heyman and Olstein are sticking with all-terrain vehicle maker Arctic Cat, which recently fired its chief executive officer. At roughly $32 a share, the stock is down 44 percent this year but Heyman and Olstein believe the company could become a $45 stock with a new CEO.Olstein's process does not always work. In 2011, the fund was down 7.6 percent, compared with an average decline of 3.4 percent for small-cap core funds, according to Lipper.Olstein and Heyman themselves have behaved like activists in only a handful of situations, usually behind the scenes, and said they never engage with hedge fund activists.""I have no desire to be the next Carl Icahn,"" Olstein said. ""Carl knows how to take over companies, I know how to value them.""

Uconnect also uses software and network connectivity provided by other companies.""Our system was safe and secure,"" Paliwal said, adding that the issue apparently started due to a ""hole"" or port opening in a network. ""Once you leave the door of the house open, somebody will walk in and they can do whatever they want,"" he said. Fiat Chrysler declined to comment.Paliwal said Harman did not anticipate any financial impact  related to the recall.Apart from Fiat Chysler, Harman's customers for infotainment systems include BMW, Daimler and Volvo  among many others.

47,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A former Harman International Industries Inc executive admitted on Monday to insider trading in the company's stock just prior to the release of a stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings report.Dennis Hamilton, a former vice president of tax at the maker of car audio systems, pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud in the federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly said.Hamilton, 45, of Norwalk, faces up to 20 years in prison, but could get one to two years under recommended federal guidelines, according to his plea agreement. He also agreed not to contest a $131,958 fine, representing his illegal profit.Brian Spears, a lawyer for Hamilton, declined to comment. The defendant is free on bond, and scheduled to be sentenced on June 10. He also faces related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges.Prosecutors said Hamilton illegally profited on 17,000 Harman shares he bought through a Charles Schwab account belonging to him and his wife on Oct. 30, 2013, a day before the company released quarterly results. Hamilton allegedly bought the shares after reviewing drafts of Harman's quarterly report and press release announcing the results, and listening to a conference call with Harman's audit committee during which the results were discussed.Harman shares rose 12.5 percent on Oct. 31, 2013, after the Stamford, Connecticut-based company made its results public.

60,"   By Kevin Allison | CHICAGO  CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Samsung is riding a stallion instead of a unicorn into the driverless revolution. Despite no stated cost savings, the 28 percent premium the Korean electronics group agreed to pay for connected-car supplier Harman International is reasonable. The likes of Alphabet's Google are investing heavily to invent the automotive future as General Motors and others bet on risky startups. This deal suggests there are safer ways to play a mega-trend in the making.The $8 billion price tag looks both opportunistic and fair for a company that will jump-start Samsung's presence in what it expects to be a $100 billion market by 2025. Harman's shares hit a three-year low in June, reflecting concerns that car suppliers face tougher times as the long post-crisis boom in U.S. auto sales fades. General Motors last week underscored the worries by unveiling 2,000 U.S. factory job cuts, following news of similar cutbacks at rival Ford Motor. Despite the turn, Harman has been trying to position itself for the longer term. While it is best known for its JBL speakers, features like navigation, infotainment, communications and car safety accounted for nearly half of Harman's sales over the past year. They're likely to grow in importance as computers take over from humans at the wheel. A lack of advertised cost cuts probably means that Samsung, which plans to run Harman as an independent subsidiary, will have to rely on revenue gains to recoup its investment. It would only take slashing costs equivalent to 4 percent of next year's sales to cover the premium, but it's also reasonable to think that combining Samsung's products with Harman's brands and customers could result in faster growth than either company can manage separately. That makes Harman a more sensible way to gain exposure to the next generation of cars than building brand-new technology from scratch the way Google, Apple and Uber are doing. Similarly, investments like the $500 million GM made in ride-sharing app Lyft and its $1 billion-plus acquisition of software venture Cruise Automation offer huge upside, but with accompanying risk. Harman should be a good ride down the middle of the road.",2016-11-14,HAR,"Mon Nov 14, 2016 | 1:53pm EST",Harman sale grooms stallion instead of unicorn,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-harman-intl-ind-samsung-elec-breaking-idUSKBN13928R?type=companyNews
61,"   By Hyunjoo Jin and Miyoung Kim | SEOUL  SEOUL Samsung Electronics has agreed to buy Harman International Industries in an $8 billion deal, marking a major push into the auto electronics market and the biggest overseas acquisition ever by a South Korean company.The transaction highlights Samsung's efforts to break into the high-barrier automotive industry where it has little track record and also marks a strategic shift for the electronics company, which has previously shunned big acquisitions.""An M&A deal this big is a first for us. But it shows that under Jay Y. Lee, the company is changing and open to new ways to grow,"" a source familiar with the deal told Reuters, referring to Samsung Electronics' vice chairman. The purchase of the Stamford, Connecticut-based maker of connected car and audio systems is part of Samsung's search for new growth areas as its smartphone business - scarred by the withdrawal of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 - slows. The greater use of electronics and software in vehicles, and the ability of cars to connect to smartphones and other devices, is offering technology companies with new business opportunities. ""We have been studying the automotive market for some time.

""Samsung will not get into the business of manufacturing cars,"" he said.Samsung, a maker of chips, displays, smartphones and TVs, agreed to acquire Harman for $112.00 per share in cash, a 28 percent premium to the U.S. company's closing price on Friday.Harman shares rose 25.6 percent to their highest level in more than one year.    ""Harman was missing, in our opinion, a meaningful presence in displays and cockpit electronics; Samsung has these,"" Baird Equity Research said in a report.But investors in Samsung had reservations about the purchase price. ""Samsung is using its huge cash pile to pull ahead of rivals in the auto technology market. But it remains to be seen whether Samsung will be able to grow into a company that will be able to compete with the likes of Bosch and Continental,"" said fund manager Park Jung-hoon of HDC Asset Management, which owns Samsung Electronics shares.
