0,"   By David DeKok | HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania  HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania A court injunction obtained by Texas-based Cabot Oil & Gas is preventing Pennsylvania resident Vera Scroggins from going to her local grocery store, her friends' homes, schools, or even the hospital.That's because those properties sit atop the more than 200,000 acres in Susquehanna County that the energy producer owns and leases for gas extraction - land on which Scroggins, a determined anti-fracking activist, is not allowed to tread.A judge in October granted Cabot's request to bar Scroggins from the land - more than 40 percent of Susquehanna County, where she lives - after her repeated trespassing, court documents show. Her offending actions included giving a tour last year to anti-drilling celebrities Susan Sarandon, Yoko Ono, and Sean Lennon, the documents said.Scroggins, 62, is a long-time opponent of energy drilling in northeastern Pennsylvania, especially the method of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the controversial process of injecting water, chemicals and sand into underground shale formations to extract oil and gas. The use of fracking in the United States has increased dramatically in recent years as drillers found ways to extract more hydrocarbons from shale. The boom has transformed parts of northern Pennsylvania and divided communities drawn by the monetary rewards that energy production brings, but concerned by its impact on the environment.""I have to watch what I do,"" said Scroggins, whose anti-fracking video footage made its way into ""Gasland,"" an Oscar-nominated documentary by Josh Fox.""I have to stop and tell myself, you're not supposed to be there. I've been going to these places for over 20 years. I can't stop in at friends' when I'm driving around,"" she said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Scroggins is headed back to court on March 24 - this time with a lawyer - to argue for overturning the injunction. When Judge Kenneth Seamans imposed the injunction in Susquehanna County Court of Common Pleas in October, Scroggins acted as her own lawyer against Cabot's lawyers.Vic Walczak, legal director of the Pennsylvania ACLU and one of her lawyers, said neither state law nor the gas leases themselves give Cabot the right to tell private property owners who may come on their land. It is also a freedom of speech and freedom of travel issue, he said. Cabot, according to court documents, cited Scroggins' repeated trespassing — in asking the court to exclude her from any property it owns, plus the 200,000 acres it leases.Company spokesman George Stark said Cabot is open to a modification of the injunction to limit it to actual gas facilities and the roads leading to them.""Cabot's primary concern is with operational sites where safety issues are concerned,"" he said, adding that Cabot supports freedom of expression.(Editing by Edward McAllister, Barbara Goldberg and Gunna Dickson)",2014-03-11,COG,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 5:33pm EDT",Anti-fracking activist barred from 40 percent of Pennsylvania county,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-pennsylvania-fracking-idUSBREA2A1WE20140311?type=companyNews

2,"  NEW ORLEANS, March 25 Cabot Oil & Gas Corp  plans to accelerate share buybacks due to what it considers the depressed levels of its stock, its chief executive officer said on Tuesday.Shares of Cabot are down 9 percent in the past six months due in part to concern about the company's inability to transport some natural gas out of Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale formation. As a result, it must sell the fuel at below market rates. ""We think the price Cabot is at right now is beat up a bit and we will be in the market shortly,"" CEO Dan Dinges said at the Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans.  The company has roughly 417.3 million shares outstanding.

3,"   By David DeKok   (This February 19 story is corrected to fix pipeline name to Constitution Pipeline in paragraph three)By David DeKokSCRANTON, Pa. A federal judge ruled on Friday that a Pennsylvania family that runs a maple syrup business cannot stop most of their trees from being cut down to make way for a shale gas pipeline, but he stopped short of charging them with contempt of court.Judge Malachy Mannion of the U.S. District Court in Scranton said his previous order allowing the tree-cutting could not be challenged in court. But he said lawyers for the company building the Constitution Pipeline failed to prove the five defendants who own the property were guilty of obstructing the tree cutting.""But I’m going to direct that U.S. Marshals are empowered to arrest or detain anyone who obstructs the felling of trees,” he said. “Then they will be brought before me for a contempt hearing.” Monty Morgan, a former Ohio state trooper who is regional security director for Constitution Pipeline Co, was unable to identify any of the defendants as those who have blocked workers from cutting the maples this month. The $875 million Constitution Pipeline, due to be operational this autumn, would run 124 miles (200 km) from Montrose, Pennsylvania, to Albany, New York. It would bring gas from fracking wells to the New York and New England markets.“I think this is the most realistic outcome we could have expected,” said Megan Holleran, spokeswoman for North Harford Maple, a family-run syrup business in New Milford. “We never intended to disobey the judge’s order.” She said peaceful protests would continue and became emotional about the impending loss of the maple trees. But she said family members will stay outside an exclusion zone set by the judge, and would not encourage others to stop the cutting.Her mother, Catherine Holleran, is one of the defendants. Three others — Michael W. Zeffer, Maryann Zeffer, and Patricia Glover — are aunts or uncles. Dustin Webster, the fifth defendant, is a cousin. The family has owned the land since moving from Long Island in the early 1950s.The 120-foot (37-m) wide pipeline right-of-way would force the felling of up to 200 maples, or about 80 percent of the family's sugaring trees.  The company and the family have made no agreement regarding compensation for the land, which was transferred by an ""eminent domain"" court order declaring the pipeline in the public interest. Michael Archie, a spokesman for Williams Companies Inc, which along with Cabot Oil & Gas Corp and several other partners will own the pipeline, said tree cutting could start as soon as the coming week.
