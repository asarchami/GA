0,"   By Karen Freifeld and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 17 The New York judge weighing approval of Bank of America Corp's $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities was promoted on Friday, but is expected to rule on the controversial accord before she takes her new job.Justice Barbara Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who heard nine weeks of testimony about the fairness of one of the biggest settlements stemming from the 2008 financial crisis, was appointed to the state's Appellate Division, an intermediate appeals court, by Governor Andrew Cuomo.Bank of America had agreed in June 2011 to the $8.5 billion settlement to resolve claims over roughly $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which the bank had bought three years earlier.The settlement was intended to resolve much of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's legal liability from Countrywide. It was backed by 22 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc, MetLife Inc and Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co.But investors led by American International Group Inc  objected, saying there was no proof the payouts were fair, and that Bank of New York Mellon Corp failed to perform its duties as trustee during the negotiations. Kapnick had overseen a so-called Article 77 proceeding, which ended on Nov. 21, to determine whether the settlement should be approved. She has yet to rule.A staff member in Kapnick's chambers said in an interview after the promotion was announced that ""the judge is going to be issuing that decision before she leaves."" David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the New York state court system, said it is unclear when the promotion will take effect, but that state law appeared to allow promomoted judges to decide cases they were already handling that were ready for rulings.Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the institutional investors, said: ""New York law permits Judge Kapnick to rule on this matter, and we look forward to her decision.""Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment. A Bank of New York Mellon spokesman had no immediate comment. An AIG spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. Kapnick, 60, will fill a vacancy on the Appellate Division for the First Department, which encompasses Manhattan and the Bronx. Her promotion does not require voter or legislative approval.The judge was elected to the Supreme Court, which in New York is a trial court, in 2001, and moved to its commercial division in 2008. She graduated from Barnard College in 1975 and Boston University School of Law in 1980.Cuomo on Friday also appointed three trial judges - Colleen Duffy, Hector LaSalle and Joseph Maltese - to fill vacancies in the Appellate Division for the Second Department, which encompasses 10 counties in southeastern New York, including the other New York City boroughs and Long Island.The case is In re: Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.",2014-01-17,AIG,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 4:57pm EST",Judge on BofA $8.5 bln settlement case is promoted,http://www.reuters.com//article/bankofamerica-settlement-idUSL2N0KR1KW20140117?type=companyNews

8,"  * KCG reported Q4 a loss of 15 cents a share* Call to end rebates for market makers won't gain traction-CEO* Firm expects $41 mln on closing of BATS/Direct Edge mergerBy John McCrankNEW YORK, Jan 31 Trading firm KCG Holdings Inc , which reported a quarterly loss on Friday due to merger costs, plans to trade interest rate swaps before the year is out, the company's chief executive said.Interest rate swaps, which allow investors to hedge against interest risk, make up $490 trillion, in notional value, of the $633 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. Much of the swaps market is moving onto new exchanges known as swap execution facilities (SEFs), as required by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, representing an opportunity for trading firms like KCG.The move to SEFs will bring more electronic trading, as opposed to brokers trading between themselves over the phone, to the over-the-counter derivatives market, and is aimed at boosting transparency.""I do believe that transparency in swap trading will be beneficial to all market participants who trade interest rate products,""  KCG chief executive Daniel Coleman said on a call with analysts. ""It's something that we would like to do and something we are focused on.""Under the new rules, swaps must also be centrally cleared, meaning clearing houses back the trades against a default, opening up the market to firms that do not need massive balance sheets to stand behind the trades. The OTC derivatives market came under regulatory pressure in the wake of the financial crisis when risky trading at firms such as insurer American International Group Inc and investment bank Lehman Brothers nearly toppled the financial system. The inability to assess the scale of the market, the identity of contracting parties, or the nature of non-standard contracts, frustrated regulators.MARKET STRUCTURE More recently, there have been growing calls for an overhaul of U.S. equity market regulation in order to reduce conflicts and complexities in the system. One of the loudest voices as of late has been Jeff Sprecher, who heads IntercontinentalExchange Group, the new owner of the New York Stock Exchange. Sprecher has called for an end to the dominant pricing system in U.S. equities, in which market makers receive trading rebates for posting orders to exchanges for other market participants to trade against.As one of the top U.S. equity market makers, KCG made around $48 million in profit on just under $233 million in market-making revenues in the last quarter.Overall, the firm, which also operates dark pools and provides trading services in multiple asset classes and countries, reported a net loss of $17.4 million, or 15 cents a share, on $322 million in revenues. The loss included $36.5 million in merger and integration costs.The pricing system, known as ""maker-taker,"" in which the ""maker"" of the liquidity on the exchange receives a rebate and the ""taker"" - the buyer of the stock - pays a fee, is ""bad for markets,"" Sprecher told Reuters last week. He said the system attracts people who quickly jump in an out of markets looking to profit from rebates, rather than actually trade or hold risk. He said the rebates distort stock prices and cause the interests of brokers to be out of sync with their customers.Coleman said that ultimately maker-taker is the way exchanges compete with each other, and that if rebates are removed, exchanges would still compete on taker fees and brokers would still face the conflict of routing one exchange versus another based on fees.""You have the head of a commercial enterprise saying he doesn't want to compete on fees any more ... so from that point of view, I don't think that argument is going to gain a lot of traction,"" he said.KCG said that at the end of the quarter it received around $10.5 million from Nasdaq OMX Group as part of the exchange operator's compensation plan for the botched Facebook IPO in May 2012. During the IPO, a glitch in Nasdaq's system prevented timely order confirmations for market makers, leaving them unsure about their exposure for up to days afterwards.Knight Capital Group, which merged with rival firm Getco last summer to create KCG, recorded a charge of $35.4 million in the second quarter of 2012 related to the Facebook IPO.Knight had its own glitch in August 2012, which led to millions of unintentional orders flooding into the market over a 45-minute period, leaving the firm with a huge position it had to unload at a total loss of $461.1 million. KCG agreed in October to pay a fine of $12 million over the incident.Separately, KCG said it expects to receive $41 million as part of a dividend payment once exchange operators BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge close their merger, which is expected to happen within days. The deal cleared its final regulatory hurdles on Friday.

9,"   By Luciana Lopez and Aman Shah  Insurer American International Group (AIG.N) on Thursday raised its dividend and announced more share buybacks as its fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations, swinging to a profit compared with a year-earlier loss.The company also said it expects to reduce its global workforce by about 3 percent, a move that analysts said could help the company improve its underwriting profitability.The results take AIG one step further into a turnaround story since it was almost wiped out by its derivative bets during the financial crisis, something that had drawn heavy ire from both lawmakers and taxpayers. The company has repaid the $180 billion bailout it received in 2008.""We have seen that the public negative sentiment is down dramatically,"" Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said on CNBC.The company on Thursday raised its dividend by 25 percent to 12.5 cents from 10 cents per share and also authorized a share buyback of up to another $1 billion.""It certainly was a very strong quarter,"" said Gloria Vogel, senior equity research analyst at Drexel Hamilton in New York.Even so, she said, the company is still indicating that it is receiving less in premiums than it is paying out in claims. That could change going forward, Vogel said, in part on the workforce reduction that Benmosche detailed in a memo to employees, which was dated Thursday and obtained by Reuters.""With results today, we announced a $265 million severance charge taken at the end of 2013, which we expect will reduce AIG's global workforce by approximately 3 percent,"" Benmosche wrote. AIG shares rose 1.7 percent to $50.42 percent in extended trading.Benmosche said also in the memo that while AIG has ""positioned ourselves for continued growth and profitability,"" there is a need for more change, including ""to cultivate a culture where there is a clearer understanding of roles"" and ensuring swift decision-making by the most qualified people.""To accomplish this, in many parts of the organization, we will need to make some changes,"" he said. ""We know that this will mean some changes in roles and in reporting structure, and that some roles will have to be eliminated.""PREMIUM PROFITABILITY COULD IMPROVE  For the fourth quarter, AIG reported net income of $1.98 billion, or $1.34 per share, compared with a loss of $3.96 billion, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier.On an operating basis, the company earned $1.70 billion, or $1.15 per share.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.In commercial underwriting, net premiums earned rose 5 percent to $5.294 billion from the year-ago quarter, and the combined ratio improved to 107.7 from 130.3. A combined ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, meaning an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims.In consumer underwriting, net premiums earned dipped 7 percent to $3.296 billion, but the combined ratio fell to 103.3 from 111.2 in the year-ago period.Net premiums earned in the company's property casualty unit were flat at $8.6 billion, while the combined ratio improved to 103.8 from 125.1 in the same quarter of 2012.The combined ratios will improve, ""but it's not going to happen overnight,"" Sandler O'Neill & Partners analyst Paul Newsome. ""One of their biggest issues is their expense levels as opposed to the underwriting.

The company has repaid the $180 billion bailout it received in 2008.""We have seen that the public negative sentiment is down dramatically,"" Chief Executive Robert Benmosche said on CNBC.The company on Thursday raised its dividend by 25 percent to 12.5 cents from 10 cents per share and also authorized a share buyback of up to another $1 billion. ""It certainly was a very strong quarter,"" said Gloria Vogel, senior equity research analyst at Drexel Hamilton in New York.Even so, she said, the company is still indicating that it is receiving less in premiums than it is paying out in claims. That could change going forward, Vogel said, in part on the workforce reduction that Benmosche detailed in a memo to employees, which was dated Thursday and obtained by Reuters.""With results today, we announced a $265 million severance charge taken at the end of 2013, which we expect will reduce AIG's global workforce by approximately 3 percent,"" Benmosche wrote.AIG shares rose 1.7 percent to $50.42 percent in extended trading.Benmosche said also in the memo that while AIG has ""positioned ourselves for continued growth and profitability,"" there is a need for more change, including ""to cultivate a culture where there is a clearer understanding of roles"" and ensuring swift decision-making by the most qualified people. ""To accomplish this, in many parts of the organization, we will need to make some changes,"" he said. ""We know that this will mean some changes in roles and in reporting structure, and that some roles will have to be eliminated.""PREMIUM PROFITABILITY COULD IMPROVE For the fourth quarter, AIG reported net income of $1.98 billion, or $1.34 per share, compared with a loss of $3.96 billion, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier.On an operating basis, the company earned $1.70 billion, or $1.15 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.In commercial underwriting, net premiums earned rose 5 percent to $5.294 billion from the year-ago quarter, and the combined ratio improved to 107.7 from 130.3.A combined ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, meaning an insurer is receiving more in premiums than it is paying out in claims.In consumer underwriting, net premiums earned dipped 7 percent to $3.296 billion, but the combined ratio fell to 103.3 from 111.2 in the year-ago period.Net premiums earned in the company's property casualty unit were flat at $8.6 billion, while the combined ratio improved to 103.8 from 125.1 in the same quarter of 2012.The combined ratios will improve, ""but it's not going to happen overnight,"" Sandler O'Neill & Partners analyst Paul Newsome. ""One of their biggest issues is their expense levels as opposed to the underwriting. I think that's more controllable, but it's not going to happen overnight.""The company said the pre-tax severance charge of $265 million in the fourth quarter primarily related to AIG Property Casualty as part of efforts to lower expenses.The year-earlier quarter included a net loss of $4.4 billion related to the sale of AIG's aircraft leasing business and after-tax catastrophe losses of $1.3 billion from superstorm Sandy.The company's shares closed at $49.59 in regular trade on Thursday.",2014-02-13,AIG,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 6:38pm EST","UPDATE 2-AIG raises dividend as it swings to profit, plans job cuts",http://www.reuters.com//article/aig-results-idUSL3N0LI5YU20140213?type=companyNews

15,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK American International Group (AIG.N) is holding ""hostage"" an $8.5 billion deal to compensate investors who bought Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) mortgage securities, supporters of the deal said in court filings ahead of a hearing on Wednesday.The supporters urged the judge overseeing the deal to reject AIG's efforts to delay its approval, according to documents submitted to the court late on Friday.Bank of America agreed to the settlement in June 2011 to resolve claims by investors who had bought $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial before the U.S. housing crisis. The investors said Countrywide, acquired by Bank of America in 2008, misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the crisis.AIG, one of the investors in the mortgage securities, objected to the deal, saying there was no evidence it provided adequate compensation for losses.Justice Barbara Kapnick in New York state court approved the settlement on January 31, but four days later AIG asked a new judge overseeing the case to delay the decision, saying Kapnick had left issues unresolved.The new judge, Justice Saliann Scarpulla, has called a hearing Wednesday to hear arguments on AIG's request.""The court should not permit AIG to nullify the judgment and hold the entire settlement hostage indefinitely,"" supporters of the deal said in their court filing. Kapnick overruled AIG on the unresolved issues, they said. AIG is seeking to delay the settlement as leverage against Bank of America in another case, the supporters said. In that case, AIG sued Bank of America over $10 billion of securities fraud claims in August 2011, the same day it intervened to object to the $8.5 billion settlement.In a reply filed with the court on Tuesday, AIG's lawyers said Kapnick had ""refused to give any weight"" to the idea that AIG was objecting ""merely"" as a way to benefit its securities fraud claim. Scarpulla should delay approval of the settlement until investors like AIG can find out how the money will be allocated, the reply said.CONSIDERING WHETHER TO GRANT AIG'S REQUEST Scarpulla must decide whether to grant AIG's request to further delay Kapnick's judgment or enter the judgment into the court record and leave AIG to appeal if it chooses. If Scarpulla grants AIG's request, AIG should be required to post $1 million a day that the delay is costing other investors, supporters of the deal said.Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock (BLK.N)Inc, Allianz SE's Pimco, (ALVG.DE) and Metlife Inc, (MET.N), and Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), the trustee for the securities, agreed to the settlement with Bank of America.In her ruling on January 31, Kapnick said Bank of New York Mellon was concerned that Countrywide would be unable to pay a future judgment that even approached $8.5 billion, and thought it was reasonable to lock in a one-time payment. Kapnick made one exception in her ruling, withholding her approval from settlement of claims relating to certain loans that had been modified. Bank of New York Mellon should not have settled claims related to mortgages that had been modified without investigating their potential worth, she said.In its latest court filing, Bank of New York Mellon said it would do nothing about those claims until the settlement is finally approved.""There is no decision to be made, by anyone, about any action to take with respect to these claims until it is determined whether the settlement agreement is finally approved and appeals are exhausted,"" the bank and investor group said.In its reply Tuesday, AIG disagreed, saying the court should withhold final judgment until the parties resolve the claims related to loan modifications and determine how the settlement will be allocated.Separately on Tuesday, AIG asked a state appeals court for more time to submit briefs in its appeal of Kapnick's decision to hear the case without a jury.

19,"   By Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Since his ouster from American International Group Inc (AIG.N) in 2005, Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg has been quietly building an insurance and investment conglomerate that people close to him describe as a mini version of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).Greenberg's $4.4 billion acquisition, announced Monday, of health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc is by far the largest in a series of investments carried out through the private investments arm of his insurance and investment firm, C.V. Starr & Co, which was set up by AIG founder Cornelius Vander Starr in 1943.The MultiPlan deal could be the clearest sign yet of how Greenberg, 88, has been working on a Wall Street comeback after spending the last few years dealing with a multitude of lawsuits and investigations while suffering huge losses in the value of his AIG holdings as the insurance giant tottered during the financial crisis.Although Greenberg's closely held company does not disclose financial details, people familiar with the matter said its private investments arm, Starr Investment Holdings LLC, had more than $3 billion in assets under management. It is tiny compared with Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of $283 billion.In the MultiPlan deal, Greenberg deployed some of the same tactics as Buffett - using cash flow from a set of operating companies and assets as well as his relationships to pull off a large deal.""We have a rapidly growing insurance arm, we have a real estate business, and we also have a unit that helps Chinese companies invest in the U.S.,"" Greenberg said in an interview. ""We are private, we don't advertise what we are doing, and we will stay private,"" added Greenberg, who described the private investments arm as a significant driver of earnings.Greenberg, who - according to Forbes - had a net worth of $3.2 billion around the time he was ousted as AIG boss, last year told talk show host Charlie Rose he had lost around 90 percent of his wealth as a result of AIG's collapse.

20,"  By Greg RoumeliotisNEW YORK Feb 19 Since his ouster from American International Group Inc in 2005, Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg has been quietly building an insurance and investment conglomerate that people close to him describe as a mini version of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.Greenberg's $4.4 billion acquisition, announced Monday, of health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc is by far the largest in a series of investments carried out through the private investments arm of his insurance and investment firm, C.V. Starr & Co, which was set up by AIG founder Cornelius Vander Starr in 1943.The MultiPlan deal could be the clearest sign yet of how Greenberg, 88, has been working on a Wall Street comeback after spending the last few years dealing with a multitude of lawsuits and investigations while suffering huge losses in the value of his AIG holdings as the insurance giant tottered during the financial crisis. [ID: nL2N0L313K]Although Greenberg's closely held company does not disclose financial details, people familiar with the matter said its private investments arm, Starr Investment Holdings LLC, had  more than $3 billion in assets under management. It is tiny compared with Berkshire Hathaway, which has a market value of $283 billion.In the MultiPlan deal, Greenberg deployed some of the same tactics as Buffett - using cash flow from a set of operating companies and assets as well as his relationships to pull off a large deal.""We have a rapidly growing insurance arm, we have a real estate business, and we also have a unit that helps Chinese companies invest in the U.S.,"" Greenberg said in an interview. ""We are private, we don't advertise what we are doing, and we will stay private,"" added Greenberg, who described the private investments arm as a significant driver of earnings.Greenberg, who - according to Forbes - had a net worth of $3.2 billion around the time he was ousted as AIG boss, last year told talk show host Charlie Rose he had lost around 90 percent of his wealth as a result of AIG's collapse.

21,"  By Karen FreifeldNEW YORK Feb 19 A New York state judge declined to delay court approval of Bank of America Corp's $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage-backed securities, rejecting a move by American International Group Inc.At a hearing on Wednesday, Justice Saliann Scarpulla of New York State Supreme Court ordered the judgment by her predecessor in the case, Barbara Kapnick, to be officially recorded.""It's very straightforward,"" Scarpulla told lawyers for AIG, which was one of the investors in the mortgage securities. ""Judge Kapnick issued the order. ... If you don't like it, your remedy is to appeal.""Kapnick approved the settlement on Jan. 31, her last day overseeing the case before she was elevated to a state appeals court, and ordered a five-day delay before her approval was officially recorded. AIG on Feb. 4 asked Scarpulla, the new judge on the case, to delay recording of the judgment, saying Kapnick had left some matters unresolved.""Judge Kapnick told me the five-day stay she put in was merely a convenience to the parties,"" Scarpulla said on Wednesday. ""She had no intention of leaving anything open."" AIG said in a statement it will appeal Kapnick's decision if necessary.Bank of America agreed to the settlement in June 2011 to resolve claims by investors who bought mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial before the U.S. housing crisis. The investors said Countrywide, acquired by Bank of America in 2008, misrepresented the quality of the underlying home mortgages, which went sour in the crisis.Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc , Allianz SE's Pimco and Metlife Inc, signed on to the settlement. AIG opposed the deal, saying there was no evidence it provided adequate compensation for losses.""AIG's announced strategy of imposing indefinite delay was defeated today,"" Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the investor group supporting the decision, told Reuters. Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to comment.Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee overseeing the securities, said it was pleased the court will enter the judgment, ""which overwhelmingly vindicated the trustee's actions.""Bank of New York Mellon and other supporters of the deal have accused AIG of holding the settlement ""hostage."" In her Jan. 31 ruling, Kapnick said Bank of New York Mellon acted with mostly reasonable judgment in entering into the settlement. She made one exception, withholding approval relating to certain loans that had been modified. She said the trustee should not have settled those claims without investigating their potential worth.AIG said Wednesday it will try to get Kapnick's decision vacated by pursuing a motion it filed Tuesday to reargue the case before Scarpulla.In the motion, AIG said Kapnick overlooked disputed and unresolved issues, applied the wrong standard to the trustee's actions and failed to adequately explain her decision.""We are pleased that the court intends to address AIG's motion for re-argument,"" AIG said in its statement. ""If necessary, AIG also looks forward to pressing ahead with its appeal at the appropriate time.""Scarpulla said during the hearing she would hear arguments on the motion but did not set a date.The case is In re Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 651786/2011.",2014-02-19,AIG,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 3:44pm EST",UPDATE 2-BofA $8.5 bln deal to go forward; AIG loses bid to delay,http://www.reuters.com//article/bankofamerica-mbs-settlement-idUSL2N0LO1EO20140219?type=companyNews
22,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded American International  Group, Inc.'s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A-' from 'BBB+'. The ratings on  AIG's senior debt obligations are upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. The Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of AIG's rated property/casualty insurance  subsidiaries are affirmed at 'A'. The IFS ratings of the company's U.S. life  insurance subsidiaries led by AGC Life Insurance Company are affirmed at 'A+'. In addition the long-term senior secured ratings of securities issued by ASIF  Global Financing, ASIF II Program and ASIF III Program were revised to 'A+' from  'A' and are also affirmed at 'A+'. The revision brings the long-term senior  secured ratings of these entities in line with AIG Life and Retirement's IFS  ratings, which were previously upgraded on Feb. 14, 2013 and affirmed on Aug. 8,  2013. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of ratings is provided at  the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The holding company upgrade recognizes the continued improvement in the  organization's capital position and debt servicing capabilities. The company's  financial leverage as measured by the ratio of financial debt and preferred  securities to total capital (excluding operating debt and the impact of FAS 115)  declined to 18% at year-end 2013 from 31% at year-end 2010. Fitch's total  financial commitment (TFC) ratio has also improved, to 1.1x at year-end 2013  from 2.5x at year-end 2010. The sale of aircraft leasing subsidiary  International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) to AerCap Holdings N.V. that is  expected to close in second quarter 2014 will further reduce TFC to a pro forma  level of approximately 0.7x.  The upgrade of the IDR and debt ratings is also based on Fitch's view that the  improved earnings and dividend capacity of AIG's Life and Retirement segment can  support the interest and debt service payments of the holding company. The  holding company rating now reflects the application of standard notching between  the holding company IDR and the life operating companies' implied IDR. AIG reported significantly improved profitability in 2013. Net income increased  by over 160% to $9.1 billion, which corresponds with a return on equity of 9.2%.  Pre-tax operating income was $4.8 billion for AIG's Property Casualty segment  and $5.1 billion for Life and Retirement operations in 2013.  Earnings growth at the insurance subsidiaries and the repayment of higher coupon  debt has led to significantly improved interest coverage.  Operating-earnings-based interest coverage on financial debt improved to 6.7x in  2013 from 2.2x in 2012. AIG's ability to meet holding company obligations is  primarily supported by dividend capacity from the insurance subsidiaries. Cash  distributions from subsidiaries totaled $8.7 billion in 2013. The company has  built a strong holding company liquidity position that includes $7.2 billion of  unencumbered cash and investments at year end 2013, and $4.4 billion of  available capacity from credit facilities.  AIG property/casualty subsidiary ratings consider the company's unique market  position in the global insurance market given its absolute size. Lower  catastrophe losses and benefits from recent pricing underwriting and portfolio  repositioning actions led to a decline in the property casualty combined ratio  to 101.3% in 2013 from 108.5% a year earlier. The company's underwriting results  were affected by modest unfavorable reserve development in 2012 and 2013. AIG's  underwriting performance continues to lag large commercial insurer peers.  The ratings of AIG's Life and Retirement subsidiaries are driven by these  entities' strong statutory capital position, more conservative asset allocation  and return to stronger operating profits and earnings stability. The company has  demonstrated that the effects of the previous financial crisis have subsided.  Operating income has improved in 2012 and 2013 as a result of higher fee income  driven by growth in assets under management, continued active spread management,  higher investment income and low levels of surrender activity. These positive  factors are offset somewhat by concerns as to the effect of continued very low  interest rates on product performance and future profitability.  The 'A+' senior secured notes ratings assigned to the securities issued by ASIF  Global Financing, ASIF II Program and ASIF III Program recognizes that the  obligations are secured by a funding agreement with cash flow structures that  enable the trustees to make payments on the notes. Thus the notes are dependent  upon the credit quality of AIG Life and Retirement and are assigned the  insurer's IFS rating. All ratings reflect AIG's success in restructuring and deleveraging efforts over  the last five years. All government support was repaid by AIG in 2012. The  company is now an independent publicly held corporation with an operating focus  on global property/casualty insurance and domestic life insurance and retirement  products. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key triggers that could lead to future rating upgrades include: --Demonstration of higher and more consistent earnings within Property/Casualty  or Life and Retirement operating segments that translate into average  earnings-based interest coverage above 10.0x. This would correspond with  insurance pre-tax operating earnings of approximately $14 billion;  --Further improvement in AIG's capital structure and leverage metrics that  reduce the company's TFC ratio to below 0.5x; --Continued improvement in the operating earnings of the Life and Retirement  segment which could lead to an upgrade of those subsidiary ratings;  --A shift to modest sustainable breakeven or better underwriting results, with  greater loss reserve stability or reserve redundancies could lead to an upgrade  of property casualty subsidiary IFS ratings. Key triggers that could lead to a future rating downgrade include:  --Increases in financial leverage as measured by financial debt-to-total capital  to a sustained level above 30%, or a material increase in the TFC ratio from  current levels;  --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 6x annual interest on  financial debt; --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries that Fitch views as inconsistent with  that of comparably-rated peers and industry trends; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios at either the domestic life  insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries, and/or failure to achieve the  above noted capital structure improvements.

23,"   By Aluisio Alves and Guillermo Parra-Bernal | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO American International Group Inc (AIG.N) expects revenue from underwritten premiums in Brazil to rise 40 percent this year, the unit's top executive said, underpinning fast growth in a market where the U.S. insurer has ambitious expansion plans for the next decade.AIG will pump about $120 million into the unit in Brazil to propel growth in life, property-casualty and high risk corporate insurance, Jaime Calvo, AIG's chief executive officer in Brazil, said late on Monday. The insurer, the largest in the United States, is forecasting underwritten premiums at $225 million this year, Calvo added.The capital injection is part of a broader strategy that includes acquisitions and which aims to make Brazil one of AIG's top-five markets by 2017. Calvo said the company expects to almost double staff to 700 employees within three years; currently AIG's Brazilian operations are not even among the group's top-20 performers.""Our plan is one of accelerated growth. It implies organic growth of course, but it includes acquisitions too,"" Calvo, a Maxico-born company veteran, said. ""The secular process of household income gains in Brazil will naturally lead to more demand for insurance services and products.""Brazil's insurance market, with its rapid growth in demand, is the target of foreign interest. Brazilians spend less than a 10th of the amount Britons or Americans do on insurance products and, as the middle class in Latin America's biggest country grows, insurers are luring new clients by transforming traditional, costlier policies into cheaper products. According to Susep, Brazil's watchdog for the insurance sector, premiums rose 18 percent in the first 11 months of 2013.AIG's strategy in Brazil does not only aim at seeking rapid market share gains in some segments but also to achieve high returns, Calvo added. The company's biggest bet is on retail insurance products, starting with auto insurance, allowing the so-called consumer lines to represent about 75 percent of AIG's portfolio in Brazil, from 25 percent currently. In the case of the local auto insurance market, an increase in the size of Brazil's fleet coupled with healthy pricing dynamics is bolstering growth in premiums. Partnerships with insurance brokers and even commercial banks could help AIG fend off the shortcomings of having small scale in distribution of its products, Calvo noted.In addition, the highest interest rates in more than two years could help improve financial income at insurance companies in Brazil, while marginally fanning competition in the auto insurance segment. Still, according to Calvo, there are no signs of any player trying to expand market share by lowering prices yet.Despite the company's appetite for potential acquisitions in Brazil, AIG is reluctantly analyzing Itaú's plans to sell its high-risk corporate insurance portfolio. Itaú put the unit up for sale late last month in a bid to deploy capital more efficiently in coming years. Analysts say the sale could fetch about 1 billion reais ($426.48 million) for Itaú.Yet, Calvo said that the portfolio itself does not look attractive without an effective distribution network. ""An outright purchase just for the sake of it does not interest us,"" Calvo said of the deal.The process to dispose of the high-risk insurance portfolio is in preliminary stages, Itaú executives said last month. The sale comes after infrastructure projects related to hosting the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016 got off to a late start, and the government auctioned rights to operate roads, railways and ports a year later than expected.($1 = 2.3448 Brazilian Reais)",2014-03-11,AIG,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 10:47am EDT",AIG's Brazil revenue to soar this year on fast growth plan,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-aig-brazil-strategy-idUSBREA2A11W20140311?type=companyNews
24,"   By Emily Stephenson | WASHINGTON, March 11  WASHINGTON, March 11 A U.S. senator who backed tougher capital rules for nonbank financial firms said on Tuesday that regulators misread how that requirement applied to insurance companies, and she has proposed new legislation to clear up the confusion.Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, introduced an amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street oversight law that said large nonbank firms should meet leverage limits that are at least as stringent as the rules that banks follow.Insurance companies have since complained that they are structured differently than banks and already meet leverage requirements imposed by state regulators, so they should not have to follow the same capital rules.Officials with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which now regulates American International Group Inc and Prudential Financial Inc, have questioned whether Dodd-Frank allows them to tailor the rules for insurers. Collins told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the Fed has flexibility to tailor its rules. She introduced a bill on Monday that she said would make that clear.""My legislation would ... clarify that, in establishing minimum capital requirements for holding companies on a consolidated basis, the Federal Reserve is not required to include insurers so long as the insurers are engaged in activities regulated as insurance at the state level,"" Collins said in remarks prepared for the hearing. Senators Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who called the hearing, and Mike Johanns, a Republican, introduced legislation in 2013 to address the same issue. That bill has not yet been considered by the banking panel.The squabble stems from the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when AIG nearly collapsed and had to be rescued by U.S. officials. Reform advocates said nonbank financial companies had never been held to the same leverage and other rules that big U.S. banks had to meet.

27,"  (Adds AIG comment)By Karen FreifeldNEW YORK, March 31 Insurer MetLife will pay $60 million because two subsidiaries solicited insurance business in New York without a license, New York authorities said on Monday.Investigations by the state's Department of Financial Services and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office found that MetLife subsidiaries ALICO and DelAm, bought from AIG in 2010, misrepresented their business activities to regulators. An investigation is ongoing into violations by AIG  and its subsidiaries on conduct before the MetLife purchase, Benjamin Lawsky, the state's top financial regulator, said in a statement.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement that the two subsidiaries used Manhattan-based staff to solicit insurance business even though neither company was licensed to do so in New York. Metlife will pay a $50 million fine to Lawsky's agency. Another $10 million will go to the Manhattan District Attorney's office as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. AIG disagrees that the conduct violates the law, according to a statement from the company.""A New York license is required only where a foreign insurer issues policies covering New Yorkers,"" the statement said, adding there was no evidence anyone was harmed.(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Karen Freifeld; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-03-31,AIG,"Mon Mar 31, 2014 | 3:13pm EDT",UPDATE 1-N.Y. regulators say MetLife to pay $60 mln for violations,http://www.reuters.com//article/insurance-regulation-idUSL1N0MS1EN20140331?type=companyNews

Ukrainian forces were ambushed by separatists, triggering heavy fighting on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Slaviansk, a day after a Ukrainian police station in Odessa was stormed. The Institute for Supply Management's services sector index hit the fastest pace in eight months in April, topping expectations. It was the latest report to offer upbeat news on the economy after an unusually harsh winter.""The ISM services came out and showed pretty good growth, and that obviously brought back some buyers,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.Apple shares, up 1.4 percent at $600.96, led both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher. Late in the session, the stock broke above $600, and it closed above the level for the first time since Oct. 26, 2012. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.66 points or 0.11 percent, to 16,530.55, the S&P 500 gained 3.52 points or 0.19 percent, to 1,884.66 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 14.158 points or 0.34 percent, to 4,138.055.Short-term upward trendlines were tested in the S&P 500 and the Dow but not broken, said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York, suggesting the uptrend is not over.Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac gained after activist investor William Ackman recommended the shares of mortgage finance giants during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York. Fannie was up 3 percent at $4.10 while Freddie  was up 6.3 percent at $4.23. On the downside, shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 2.4 percent to $54.22, the biggest drag on the S&P 500. The bank said late Friday it expects second-quarter revenue from bond and equity trading to decline about 20 percent from a year ago. The S&P financial index fell 0.4 percent.Pfizer Inc shares fell 2.6 percent to $29.96. The biggest U.S. drugmaker reported revenues well below analysts' expectations.After the bell, shares of American International Group Inc  declined 1.9 percent to $51.70 after it posted a 27 percent fall in quarterly income.During the regular session, Target Corp shares fell 3.5 percent to $59.87. Chief Executive and Chairman Gregg Steinhafel will leave the No. 3 U.S. retailer in the wake of a data breach last year that hurt profits, shook customer confidence and prompted congressional hearings.But shares of B/E Aerospace jumped 9.3 percent to $97.22.

52,"  * Benmosche retires after 5 years at the helm* Will now take up advisory role at AIG* Hancock headed company's property-casualty business   (Adds details, analyst comments)By Avik DasJune 10 American International Group Inc  said Peter Hancock would succeed Robert Benmosche as chief executive and president, effective Sept. 1.Hancock joined AIG in 2010 and has headed the company's property-casualty business since March 2011.Before joining AIG, he was vice chairman of KeyCorp  and a former chief financial officer at JPMorgan Chase & Co .The Wall Street Journal reported in May that Hancock and Jay Wintrob, who leads AIG's life-insurance and retirement business, would be the leading candidates for the CEO post after Benmosche retired in September. BMO Capital Markets analyst Charles Sebaski said Hancock's banking experience would help AIG deal with SIFI (systemically important financial institutions) and the U.S. government, and his appointment ""should provide no hiccups to the company.""Sebaski, who has a five-star rating on StarMine due to the accuracy of his estimates, also identified AIG's property-casualty business as needing ""more corrective action"" and said Hancock's experience in this area would be ""probably beneficial"" for the company. BENMOSCHE LEGACY Retiring CEO Benmosche, who has been with AIG since 2009, is credited with steering the company through the financial crisis. During his tenure, AIG fully repaid the $182.3 billion government bailout it received in 2008 to stave off bankruptcy.Benmosche, who was diagnosed with cancer in late 2010, was CEO of MetLife Inc from 1998 to 2006.He initially planned to retire from AIG in 2012, but later expressed his desire to carry on. Soon after becoming the fourth person to hold the CEO post at AIG since June 2008, Benmosche reversed course on the company's strategy in an attempt to turn around its fortunes.He stopped the sales of assets at throwaway prices, tried to boost employee morale and took on AIG's critics, including government officials.Sebaski said that under Benmosche's leadership, AIG had moved from ""great uncertainty"" in 2009 to re-establish itself as a market leader in its core businesses.In February, AIG raised its quarterly dividend by 25 percent, to 12.5 cents per share.With Benmosche at the helm, the insurer's stock has more than doubled to Tuesday's close of $55.01 on the New York Stock Exchange.Benmosche will now take up an advisory role at AIG, the company said in a statement.

54,"   By Leela Parker Deo | NEW YORK, June 13  NEW YORK, June 13 Private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Management and insurer American International Group (AIG) have teamed up to establish Varagon Capital Partners, an asset manager and direct origination platform focused on lending to middle market companies.Varagon is an independent firm jointly owned by AIG and partners of Oak Hill, Chief Executive Officer Walter Owens told Thomson Reuters LPC in a phone interview. Varagon launched with an initial $1.5 billion investment commitment from AIG.The joint venture comes as institutional investors and alternative asset managers, including private equity firms, are increasingly expanding into the middle market lending space with new direct lending and credit investment platforms. Other institutional investors are gaining exposure through mandated separately managed accounts, the formation of business development companies or traditional loan funds.""Varagon combines a true direct origination and risk management platform in the commercial banking tradition with the fundraising and portfolio management capabilities of an asset manager,"" said Owens, who prior to taking the helm at Varagon, held leadership positions at GE Capital, CIT Bank, and TD Bank. Varagon will lend to companies with between $10 million and $75 million of Ebitda, focusing primarily on borrowers backed by private equity sponsors. But the team's industry heads will also evaluate opportunities to invest in non-sponsored businesses. The firm will make loans up to $350 million, typically holding from $20 million to $100 million of the deal with the remainder being syndicated to a lender group.""Our investor is a risk adjusted return investor, which allows the firm to provide products up and down the capital structure, and to do it in size,"" said Owens. ""They see the value in each product on a risk adjusted basis."" As such Varagon will invest across the capital structure, offering borrowers a range of options including first-lien credit facilities, unitranche and second-lien loans, as well as mezzanine financing.""As a buy and hold investor with a core focus on credit discipline we are excited to partner with Varagon,"" said AIG Deputy Chief Investment Officer Brian Schrieber. ""We believe that by applying strong credit discipline, middle market loans offer compelling risk adjusted returns. Varagon's experienced management team brings both fundamental credit expertise and strong industry relationships that we expect will produce high quality, directly originated investment opportunities,"" he added. With interest rates expected to remain persistently low in the near term, alternative capital providers are likely to see sustained institutional appetite from investors aiming to generate higher risk adjusted returns through diversified fixed income portfolio allocations. At the same time, as banks face regulatory constraints designed to limit leveraged lending activity, non-traditional lenders are poised to step in to fill the funding gap for borrowers.In addition to the commitment from AIG, Varagon is also targeting other institutional investors seeking middle market credit exposure, including insurance companies, pension funds, family offices, foundations and endowments.Varagon's twelve person team is based in New York.

55,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign a rating of 'BBB+' to  American International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) $1.0 billion issuance of 2.3% senior  notes due 2019 and $1.5 billion of 4.5% senior notes due 2044.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The new issue rating is equivalent to the ratings on AIG's existing senior debt.  Proceeds from the issue will be used for general corporate purposes. The new  issuance will marginally affect the company's financial leverage as the company  has recently redeemed approximately $2 billion of outstanding debt. Consolidated  debt was also significantly reduced by completion of the sale of aircraft  leasing subsidiary, International Lease financing corporation (ILFC) on May 14,  2014. Fitch estimates that AIG's ratio of financial debt to total capital will  be approximately 19% following the new issuance and consolidated debt to total  capital will be approximately 31%. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key triggers that could lead to future rating upgrades include: --Demonstration of higher and more consistent earnings within Property/Casualty  or Life and Retirement operating segments that translate into average  earnings-based interest coverage above 10.0x. This would correspond with  insurance pre-tax operating earnings of approximately $14 billion; --Further improvement in AIG's capital structure and leverage metrics that  reduce the company's TFC ratio to below 0.5x; --Continued improvement in the operating earnings of the Life and Retirement  segment which could lead to an upgrade of those subsidiary ratings;  --A shift to modest sustainable breakeven or better underwriting results, with  greater loss reserve stability or reserve redundancies could lead to an upgrade  of property casualty subsidiary IFS ratings.  Key triggers that could lead to a future rating downgrade include:  --Increases in financial leverage as measured by financial debt-to-total capital  to a sustained level above 30%, or a material increase in the TFC ratio from  current levels;  --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 6x annual interest on  financial debt; --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries that Fitch views as inconsistent with  that of comparably-rated peers and industry trends; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios at either the domestic life  insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries, and/or failure to achieve the  above noted capital structure improvements.  Fitch has assigned the following ratings:  --USD 1.0 billion of 2.3% senior unsecured notes due July 16, 2019 'BBB+';  --USD 1.5 billion of 4.5% senior unsecured notes due July 16, 2044 'BBB+'.

The settlement which the parties announced on Wednesday ends securities fraud litigation brought by AIG against the bank. It also removes the biggest obstacle to the bank's $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, the mortgage lender Bank of America acquired in July 2008.AIG agreed to dismiss litigation in New York and California that accused the bank of fraudulently causing billions of dollars in losses by selling it shoddy mortgage securities. It originally sought $10 billion of damages in the New York case. For the past three years, AIG has also led opponents of Bank of America's $8.5 billion settlement in June 2011 with institutional investors to resolve claims that Countrywide misrepresented the quality of home loans underlying $174 billion of mortgage-backed securities it issued before the housing crisis. Twenty-two institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Allianz SE's (ALVG.DE) Pimco and Metlife Inc (MET.N) had agreed to the settlement, with the Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) serving as trustee.  AIG claimed the settlement undervalued its claims, and had been appealing January's approval by Justice Barbara Kapnick in New York state court of the bulk of the settlement.  In agreeing to drop its appeal, AIG said it will accept a pro rata share of whatever investors recover.

61,"   By Soyoung Kim and Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 11 China's $653 billion sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp (CIC), is in talks to buy Dublin-based aircraft leasing firm Avolon for $4 billion to $5 billion including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.CIC is teamed up with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a state-owned aerospace and defense company, in its bid for Avolon, which provides aircraft leasing and lease management services to airlines and aircraft investors, one of the people said.The buyer group has been working on a potential acquisition of Avolon for the past several months but any deal is still months away, the people said on Monday, asking not to be named because the discussions are confidential.Private equity-owned Avolon is estimated to have an equity value of around $2.5 billion, the people said. Including debt, the proposed deal could have an enterprise value of $4 billion to $5 billion, they added.The discussions with CIC come as Avolon is simultaneously pursuing an initial public offering, in a bet that yield-hungry investors eyeing growing demand for air travel would sustain a recent boom in aircraft finance. CIC's interest underscores strong demand for aircraft assets from Asian buyers, at a time when the region has become the world's fastest growing market as Asian airlines tap into the spending power of travelers.China, one of the world's biggest buyers of aircraft, is playing a bigger part in the global aviation industry as its airlines seek to cater to the nation's growing number of business and leisure travelers. Another Chinese consortium made an unsuccessful bid in 2012 to buy aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) from U.S. insurance giant American International Group.

63,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Insurer American International Group (AIG.N) is ramping up its lobbying team in Washington, almost six years after it halted such efforts following its rescue by the U.S. government during the financial crisis.Many large companies deploy a handful of staff to provide access to Capitol Hill and the White House, but AIG has employed no officially registered lobbyists since 2009. Some of its government relations positions in Washington, which companies typically use to influence policymaking by regulators and other government officials, have been left vacant.Yet in May of this year, Lauren Scott started working as AIG's director for international regulatory and government affairs in Washington, according to her LinkedIn profile. She was previously a director of international and insurance regulation at the American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group.That follows the arrival in February of Mary Frances Monroe - a former Federal Reserve supervisor who worked for a Washington consultancy firm - as AIG's head of international regulatory in February, also according to LinkedIn.Scott and Monroe did not respond to requests for comment. AIG declined to comment.The lobbying build-up comes at a critical time for the insurer, which has been subject to new supervision by the Federal Reserve after it was designated as a ""systemically important"" firm by a top U.S. regulatory panel.It is not clear whether the two will officially register as lobbyists, something that anyone spending more than 20 percent of their working hours on influencing senior U.S. policymakers needs to do. It is also unclear how much of their work is domestic, and how much focused on international lobbying.Monroe worked as a registered lobbyist in a previous position, but Scott did not, according to official records.      The company said in October 2008 it would stop lobbying. It had faced public criticism when it continued to spend heavily to influence lawmakers despite receiving a $182 billion bailout that gave the government a majority stake, and because it continued to pay staff big bonuses.The company, which says it has customers in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions, almost collapsed when a little-known London unit, AIG Financial Products, racked up colossal losses through complex derivative transactions it had engaged in.But it is now slowly returning to normal, and has repaid the bailout funds to the government.AIG's shares still linger at a fraction of where they were before the crisis, but it has resolved litigation and streamlined the business, and the company's second-quarter profit beat expectations earlier this month.     The Financial Stability Oversight Council, which brings together all the key U.S. financial regulators and is chaired by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, has designated AIG and one other insurer, Prudential (PRU.N), as systemically important, and is considering doing the same with MetLife Inc (MET.N).While AIG did not fight its designation, the insurance industry is trying to convince Congress to ease a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law that applies strict bank capital standards to ""systemically important"" insurers. They argue the bank-specific approach is a bad fit for insurers' distinct business model.     RAMPING UP  AIG spent $11 million on lobbying Congress in both 2007 and 2008 - putting it among top spenders of that period, along with other major companies such as General Electric (GE.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) - but it quickly pulled back after that, and it did not spend at all in either 2010 or 2011, official records show.In 2012, it started spending again -- paying $120,000 for the services of law firm Patton Boggs when AIG was selling a majority stake in one of its units.In 2013, it spent $140,000, and so far this year $80,000 with the same firm, now called Squire Patton Boggs, or with Ernst & Young, according to the Senate lobbying database. Its Political Action Committee, or PAC - a fund to donate to election campaigns - donated $337,358 in 2008, with politicians on both sides of the aisle benefiting, but the organization has  been dormant after 2010.However, AIG in a recent job advertisement was looking to hire someone to perform ""day-to-day AIG PAC activities"", to coordinate with fundraising committees for candidates, and to ""assist with planning AIG PAC events"" - a sign that it may be planning to make political donations again.

67,"  (Recasts with countersuit filed by Coventry against AIG, response from AIG)By Joseph AxNEW YORK, Sept 5 An American International Group Inc unit and a philanthropist traded lawsuits on Friday over a partnership gone sour involving billions of dollars in life insurance policies sold by elderly individuals in exchange for cash.AIG's Lavastone Capital said in a lawsuit filed Friday in New York federal court that it had paid Coventry First of Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, more than $1 billion since 2006 to help it acquire the policies, known as ""life settlements.""Coventry, whose chief executive is Philadelphia philanthropist Alan Buerger, is the ""leader and creator"" of the life settlement industry, according to its website. Investors who acquire a policy cover the premiums until the individual's death and then collect the payout.Rather than identifying appropriate policies and selling them to Lavastone at the elderly individuals' asking price, the lawsuit claimed, Coventry used a network of shell companies to artificially inflate the prices to Lavastone. The fraud cost Lavastone more than $150 million, the lawsuit said. ""Thus, defendants' behavior is no different than an auction house that knows a bidder's maximum price ceiling and then uses 'shill bidders' associated with the auction house to fraudulently inflate the price to that bidder's maximum bid,"" the lawsuit said. It called Coventry and CEO Buerger ""scam artists.""In a countersuit filed in New York state court a few hours later, Coventry accused Lavastone of breaching its exclusive contract with Coventry by allowing an affiliate to purchase life settlements from other businesses.The lawsuit also claimed Lavastone ""concocted"" fraud allegations to escape contractual provisions that limit its ability to resell certain policies, which Coventry estimated could cost AIG $700 million. ""Their lawsuit is simply meant to get leverage to get rid of the contract provisions,"" Buerger said in an interview.Coventry asked a judge to award it more than $100 million and declare that Lavastone is not entitled to its own damages.An AIG spokeswoman called the Coventry lawsuit ""a baseless attempt to distract attention from the fraudulent and illegal scheme that AIG alleged in its complaint."" Lavastone accused Coventry of engaging in racketeering, fraud, conspiracy, breach of contract and other violations. The lawsuit also noted two previous civil fraud actions against Coventry brought by the New York Attorney General's office and Florida's insurance regulator, both of which have been settled.Besides Coventry, the lawsuit names several other business entities as well as Buerger and several family members.Lavastone spent about $6.5 billion over a decade to acquire nearly 7,000 life settlements with a face value of $20 billion, its lawsuit said. AIG has since wound down its life settlement business, the lawsuit said.The Buergers are well-known philanthropists in Philadelphia who donated $50 million to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia last year.The federal case is Lavastone Capital LLC v.

71,"   By Aruna Viswanatha | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON One of the more unusual trials to come out of the 2008 financial crisis is set to begin on Monday, when a federal judge will consider whether the U.S. government's rescue of American International Group Inc (AIG.N) was, in fact, legal. In a case that explores the limits on U.S. government power in responding to major financial crises, the trial is expected to revisit in detail the New York Federal Reserve's September 2008 decision to extend a bailout package to AIG as the insurance giant was minutes from bankruptcy.The AIG bailout, on the heels of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, preceded the ""too big to fail"" auto and bank bailouts the federal government undertook during a U.S. financial crisis underpinned by faulty mortgage lending.The major players in that drama will be back on the Washington stage during the six-week trial: Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry ""Hank"" Paulson.A lawyer for the insurance giant's former chief executive, Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg, was expected to argue that the government unlawfully sought to punish AIG shareholders with excessively harsh terms.Greenberg's lawyers have said in court papers the bailout ""offer"" from the New York Fed to provide AIG an $85 billion loan in exchange for high interest rates and a nearly 80 percent stake in the company amounted to unconstitutional theft from AIG shareholders.Greenberg, through his Starr International Co, was AIG's largest shareholder at the time. Starr filed lawsuit, to considerable public scorn, in November 2011. Government lawyers have defended the actions as appropriate, pointing out that the deal had been approved by the AIG board, as the company faced no other alternative to bankruptcy. Lawyers at the U.S. Department of Justice have described the case as a ""conspiracy theory"" and ""built on a mistaken premise."" ""Starr's case stems from a misperceived entitlement ... that when AIG faced an existential crisis in September 2008, AIG was entitled to dictate the terms of its own rescue,"" they said in papers filed before trial.  But U.S. Judge Thomas Wheeler last month rejected the United States' bid to dismiss the lawsuit, which seeks as much $50 billion in damages, saying that the case involved ""complex financial and economic issues"" that deserved analysis. The case poses two central questions. One is whether it was legal for the government to take $35 billion worth in AIG shares, and only effectively pay $500,000. The 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prevents private property from being taken for public use without just compensation. The other is whether the government was allowed to condition its first $85 billion loan on an equity stake in the company. Starr's lawyers have argued that the Federal Reserve Act does not allow the government to demand a stake in the company in exchange for the loan.   AIG finished repaying the full $182.3 billion bailout in December 2012, leaving taxpayers with a nearly $23 billion profit.Greenberg, 89, led AIG for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster. Arguing for Starr is David Boies, who represented former Vice President Al Gore before the U.S. Supreme Court during the contested 2000 presidential election. Few experts even expected the case to go to trial. ""Certainly what the government did was unusual ... my guess is that the government will win,"" said Hester Peirce, a senior research fellow at George Mason University who studies financial regulation. ""The standard idea is that during a crisis, what the government should do is lend freely, but they should do so at a penalty rate,"" Peirce said.

Starr filed a lawsuit, to considerable public scorn, in November 2011. Government lawyers have defended the actions as appropriate, pointing out that the deal had been approved by the AIG board, as the company faced no other alternative to bankruptcy.On Monday a lawyer from the U.S. Department of Justice, Kenneth Dintzer, said AIG received assistance only because of the potential global consequences of the company filing for bankruptcy, and that the loan terms made sense given market conditions.""The goal was not to save AIG, it was to save the world from AIG,"" Dintzer said.The trial is unfolding before U.S. Judge Thomas Wheeler, who last month rejected the United States' bid to dismiss the lawsuit. He said the case, which seeks as much $50 billion in damages, involved ""complex financial and economic issues"" that deserved analysis. The case is before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which mainly deals with lawsuits from people arguing they are owed money by the U.S. government.The case poses two central questions. One is whether the government literally took $35 billion worth in AIG shares, and effectively paid only $500,000 for them. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prevents private property from being taken for public use without just compensation.The other is whether the government was allowed to condition its first $85 billion loan on an equity stake in the company. Starr's lawyers have argued that the Federal Reserve Act does not allow the government to demand a stake in the company in exchange for the loan.On Monday Boies, who represented former Vice President Al Gore before the U.S. Supreme Court during the contested 2000 presidential election, said AIG's treatment was not in line with assistance the New York Fed offered other financial institutions.Citigroup Inc, for example, received loans at a much lower interest rate without having to provide equity as collateral, he said, even though the government later accused the company of fraud in its mortgage securities business that fueled the crisis. ""They say Citibank is the fraudster ... yet AIG is the only company they single out for punishment,"" Boies said.Dintzer, the government's lawyer, said the bailout in the end raised the value of AIG shares, and that policymakers had to consider ""moral hazard"" concerns when calculating its terms.""Shrinking a benefit to shareholders is not punishment, it is a benefit,"" Dintzer said.AIG finished repaying the full $182.3 billion bailout in December 2012, leaving taxpayers with a profit of nearly $23 billion.Greenberg, 89, led AIG for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster.The trial's first witness, Federal Reserve general counsel Scott Alvarez, took the stand on Monday morning, and was expected to continue testifying later in the afternoon.The case is Starr International Co v.

AIG finished repaying the full $182.3 billion bailout in December 2012, leaving taxpayers with a nearly $23 billion profit.Greenberg, 89, led AIG for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster.Arguing for Starr is David Boies, who represented former Vice President Al Gore before the U.S. Supreme Court during the contested 2000 presidential election.Few experts even expected the case to go to trial.""Certainly what the government did was unusual ... my guess is that the government will win,"" said Hester Peirce, a senior research fellow at George Mason University who studies financial regulation.""The standard idea is that during a crisis, what the government should do is lend freely, but they should do so at a penalty rate,"" Peirce said.

74,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Oct 1 China Investment Corp (CIC) and AVIC Capital Co Ltd have ended talks to acquire Avolon Holdings Ltd, making it likely that the aircraft leasing company will pursue an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.CIC, China's sovereign wealth fund, and AVIC, a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense company, were in talks to acquire Avolon for between $4 billion and $5 billion, Reuters reported in August. AVIC subsequently confirmed the discussions, cautioning there was uncertainty over the potential deal.Avolon registered with financial regulators in June for an IPO in the United States. The sources said this week that the unsuccessful talks with the Chinese parties made the IPO the most realistic alternative for Avolon's private equity owners to cash out on their investment. The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Avolon declined to comment, while CIC and AVIC could not immediately reached for comment.Avolon, which is backed by private equity firms Cinven Ltd, CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Oak Hill Capital Partners, as well as Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte, has been working with JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc on the IPO. Dublin-based Avalon provides aircraft leasing and lease management services to airlines and aircraft investors. It has a fleet of more than 200 aircraft serving 48 customers in 27 countries. Its customers include American Airlines Group Inc, Air France KLM SA and Ryanair Holdings Pc.It is not the first time that Chinese interest in such a company failed to lead to a deal. A Chinese consortium made an unsuccessful bid in 2012 to buy aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) from U.S. insurance giant American International Group Inc. That proposal deal fell apart and AIG ended up selling ILFC to AerCap Holdings NV.Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd , Australia's Macquarie Group Ltd and Japan's Orix Corp were among the parties exploring bids for another Dublin-based lessor, Awas, that is owned by British private equity firm Terra Firma, Reuters reported last month.

75,"  More than 300 companies, including PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), AIG Inc (AIG.N) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), secured secret deals from Luxembourg to slash their tax bills, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) reported, quoting leaked documents.The companies appear to have channeled hundreds of billions of dollars through Luxembourg and saved billions of dollars in taxes, the group of investigative journalists said, based on a review of nearly 28,000 pages of confidential documents. The leaked documents reviewed by ICIJ journalists include hundreds of private tax rulings – known as comfort letters – that Luxembourg provides to corporations seeking favorable tax treatment.Luxembourg officials denied any ""sweetheart deals"" in its tax system.

76,"   By Alastair Macdonald and Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS A storm of outrage over Luxembourg's role in helping global companies avoid tax plunged its former leader into controversy in his first week running the European Commission, the EU body that polices tax abuses.Jean-Claude Juncker, 59, who took over as president of the EU executive after more than two decades as finance minister and prime minister of the tiny Grand Duchy, pulled out of a speaking engagement on Thursday. He repeated through a spokesman a remark made the previous day denying a conflict of interest and saying he would not hinder existing EU investigations of Luxembourg.And for all the sharp words from political opponents to his left, there seemed little threat to his five-year mandate. Many critics focused instead on calls for both Juncker and his successor in Luxembourg to follow through on commitments to change and to promote a level playing field for taxes in Europe and worldwide.Controversy over the role of Luxembourg (population half a million) as a low-tax conduit for corporate cash has long been a feature of Juncker's political career. Some weeks ago, the Commission of his predecessor began investigations of tax deals struck there by web retailer Amazon and Italian carmaker Fiat.Ireland and Malta are also under scrutiny by EU antitrust investigators for possibly having offered some companies competitive advantages through sweetheart tax deals.However, the publication of documents by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists indicated more than 300 companies had secret deals to slash global tax bills - and that has turned up the heat on Luxembourg, and on Juncker""These revelations are a major blow to the credibility of new Commission president Junker and his capacity to act for the public interest,"" said Sven Giegold, finance spokesman for the Greens in the European Parliament, who called Juncker ""directly complicit in this mass corporate tax avoidance"".""The Commission must now set out a comprehensive action plan against tax dumping,"" Giegold added. ""Only by doing so can Juncker begin the path to redemption and try and dispel the doubts about his conflict of interest."" The chief Commission spokesman recalled Juncker's words on Wednesday - ""The Commission will do its work. I will refrain from intervening."" He also noted Juncker had committed himself to seeking a common EU framework for corporate taxation when he was campaigning for his job during May's EU parliament election.INVESTIGATIONS PURSUED The new competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, was pursuing inquiries into Luxembourg and may open further investigations, spokesman Margaritis Schinas said during nearly an hour of news conference questions on Juncker's position.  ""Mrs. Vestager will push this through to the end,"" he said, adding that Juncker himself was ""relaxed"" amid the controversy.Vestager said that her office had yet to take a view on the legality of Luxembourg's tax deals but vowed to ""enforce state aid control in fair and justified manner"".Schinas characterized the examination of Luxembourg's use of tax policy to bolster its economy as ""typical"" of investigations into a variety of governments' use of incentives for industry. In some cases, those incentives were deemed illegal ""state aid"". Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, who succeeded Juncker a year ago, said his country had not broken any rules and it was not alone in allowing tax schemes for big companies. [ID:nL6N0SW3V9]      Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna told reporters in Brussels that Luxembourg would work with other states to level the tax playing field: ""The moment that there is a recognition in the international community that fiscal matters must be equitable and the information should be shared, then Luxembourg would have no problem going in the direction of more transparency.""He offered a defense of Juncker, saying it was wrong to single out ""one politician for a particular period of time"".However, Britain's euro-skeptical UK Independence Party did not miss the opportunity to target the new Commission chief personally, calling the tax affair ""more proof that the EU elite protect their friends in high corporate places"".But more significant for Juncker's ability to weather the storm may be a statement from his center-left opponent for the job, Martin Schulz, the speaker of the European Parliament: ""I am confident that the European Commission will check the cases with regard to potential breaches of EU law and will take all appropriate actions swiftly and if necessary,"" Schulz said.""What worries me most is the fact that the reported practices were manifestly legally possible,"" the German Social Democrat said. ""This reality means that we need to urge the member states to work with us to end systematic tax evasion practices in Europe, be it in Luxemburg or any other country.""

77,"  (Adds family details and career history)By Luciana Lopez and Jennifer AblanNEW YORK Feb 27 Robert Benmosche, who took the helm of insurer American International Group after a massive government bailout at the height of the financial crisis, died on Friday at 70 after a battle with lung cancer.Benmosche is credited with steering AIG through the turbulent period following its near collapse and rescue by the U.S. government. During his tenure, which started in August 2009, AIG fully repaid the $182.3 billion government bailout it received in 2008 to stave off bankruptcy.Benmosche, who stepped down in September 2014, weathered intense scrutiny and was sharp-tongued at times, referring to federal officials as ""those crazies down in Washington.""Critics often likened the former CEO, who also tangled with  then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo over bonuses paid to AIG staff after the bailout, to a bull in a china shop.""I can be - I can break things,"" he said in an interview at his villa in Croatia in August 2009, when asked about his sometimes pugnacious manner shortly after taking the AIG job.That was about 11 months after the insurer was brought to its knees because of a unit that sold credit-default swap contracts on risky securities, as well as other investments in subprime mortgage-backed securities. Benmosche also often defended AIG employees from public criticism of the company and its role in the financial crisis, which helped trigger the worst recession in the United States in 70 years.""A lot of (employees) feel hurt, embarrassed, a lot of people have lived in fear because of what I call lynch mobs with pitchforks,"" he said in the Reuters interview.That defense of AIG employees won him praise from his workers. After Benmosche was diagnosed with cancer in late 2010, employees would tear up when discussing his illness. ""Bob was a brilliant man who brought tremendous leadership, energy, passion, and tenacity to his job. At AIG, we will honor his legacy by continuing to focus on integrity and performance. He will be deeply missed,"" said Robert S. Miller, chairman of AIG's board of directors.Benmosche was CEO of MetLife Inc from 1998 to 2006. He came out of retirement to lead AIG, which announced his death in a statement on Friday.Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg, who built AIG into a global financial-services powerhouse during nearly 40 years at its helm, told Reuters on Friday that he had recommended Benmosche to the U.S. government when it was looking for a new chief.""He was a good man, strong, knowledgeable and honorable - everything we look for in a CEO,"" said Greenberg, who was chair of AIG from 1967 to 2005, before being forced out. Benmosche said an AIG failure could be devastating for the United States and other countries.""Some of us need to come out of retirement - who have done this before - to help deal with the crisis,"" Benmosche said to Reuters in 2009. ""If I sit here, I just felt that there are going to be continuing problems. I felt I had some of the skills necessary to fix the problems of AIG in particular and it made sense to come back.""Benmosche, who had undergone treatment for lung cancer since 2010, announced his intention to leave AIG in June of last year. He did so in September, and was succeeded as president and CEO by Peter Hancock.Benmosche, who died at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, is survived by his wife Denise, three children, three siblings, and six grandchildren.The Brooklyn-born Benmosche prided himself on a reputation for toughness. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Alfred University in Alfred, New York, later serving in Korea as a lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps.(Reporting by Luciana Lopez and Jennifer Ablan; writing by David Gaffen; editing by Christian Plumb)",2015-02-27,AIG,"Fri Feb 27, 2015 | 5:13pm EST",UPDATE 3-Former AIG head Benmosche dies; led insurer after bailout,http://www.reuters.com//article/amer-intl-group-benmosche-death-idUSL1N0W11Z820150227?type=companyNews

80,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed American International  Group, Inc.'s ratings, including the long-term IDR at 'A-'. Fitch has also  affirmed the ratings on AIG's senior debt obligations at 'BBB+'. Additionally,  Fitch has affirmed the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of AIG's rated  property/casualty insurance subsidiaries at 'A' and the IFS ratings of the  company's U.S. life insurance subsidiaries led by AGC Life Insurance Company at  'A+'.  Lastly, Fitch has revised AIG's Rating Outlook to Positive from Stable. A  complete list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  The Outlook revision to Positive reflects the improvement in AIG's capital  position and debt servicing capabilities over the past several years. Fitch  believes AIG's leverage metrics are now on par with higher rated peers. Improved  earnings within the insurance operations and reductions in interest expense have  led to better GAAP earnings-based interest coverage. Continued earnings  stability and coverage improvement are key factors considering towards future  rating upgrade actions. The ratings reflect AIG's long term success in restructuring and deleveraging  efforts. AIG is now an independent publicly held corporation with an operating  focus on global property/casualty insurance, domestic life insurance and  retirement products, and mortgage guaranty insurance. The 2014 sale of aircraft  leasing subsidiary International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) was a major  step in exiting non-insurance operations. AIG's financial leverage as measured by the ratio of financial debt and  preferred securities to total capital (excluding operating debt and the impact  of FAS 115) declined to 16% at year-end 2014 from 31% at year-end 2010. Fitch's  total financial commitment (TFC) ratio has also improved, to 0.5x at year-end  2014 from 2.5x at year-end 2010.  AIG's GAAP earnings-based interest coverage improved to 9.0x in 2014 from 6.7x  in 2013. Recent refinancing of higher cost debt with long term lower coupon  obligations will reduce interest expense further in 2015. AIG's ability to meet holding company obligations is primarily supported by  dividend capacity from the insurance subsidiaries. Cash distributions from  subsidiaries totaled $8.3 billion in 2014. The company has built a strong  holding company liquidity position that includes $6.9 billion of unencumbered  cash and investments at year end 2014, and $4.5 billion of available capacity  from credit and contingent liquidity facilities.  AIG property casualty subsidiary ratings consider the company's unique market  position in the global insurance market given its absolute size, underwriting  capabilities, and consolidated capital adequacy that is comparable to higher  rated peers. AIG's property casualty subsidiaries financial strength benefits  from the improvements in capital strength and liquidity of the parent holding  company.  Lower catastrophe losses and benefits from recent pricing underwriting and  portfolio repositioning actions led to profitability improvement in the last two  years for property casualty operations. Still, the GAAP property casualty  combined ratio of 102.2% in 2014 and 101.1% in 2013 is weaker than large  commercial insurer peers. Modest unfavorable annual loss reserve development  continues to affect AIG's performance.   The ratings of AIG's U.S. life insurance subsidiaries are driven by these  entities' strong statutory capital position; leading market share in key lines  of business; diversification of revenues from insurance premiums, spread  business and fees; and solid operating profits and earnings stability.  Fitch expects the life subsidiaries' year-end 2014 RBC ratio will remain above  the company's long-term target range of between 425% to 470% as well as the  agency's median guideline for the current rating category. Additionally AIG's  operating and asset leverage metrics compare favorably to peers. Since 2012, AIG's U.S. life insurance subsidiaries have consistently generated  in excess of $4 billion in pre-tax operating earnings. Pretax operating income  declined modestly by 5% to $4.7 billion in 2014. This reflects lower returns on  alternative assets, higher general operating expenses and increases in  policyholder benefit reserves partially offset by higher fee income from VAs,  stable value wrap business and group retirement products driven by growth in  assets under management.  Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, AIG is  considered a systematically important financial institution (SIFI). Though  ultimate regulatory capital standards for SIFI's are still being formulated, AIG  now operates under a more rigorous compliance and governance framework that  entails greater disclosure and documentation requirements, as well as completion  of various regulatory stress-testing analyses. Completing these processes have  influenced the organization's overall risk management efforts and may help to  reduce future volatility in earnings and capital.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improvement in GAAP earnings-based interest coverage to 10x or above; --No material changes in AIG's capital structure including maintenance of  financial leverage and total financing and commitments (TFC) ratio at current  levels as well as risk-based capital at the company's insurance subsidiaries; --Stable to improving overall operating earnings.  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade in the ratings of AIG's  property/casualty subsidiaries include:  --A shift to sustainable underwriting profitability, with greater loss reserve  stability or reserve redundancies. Conversely, key triggers that could lead to a return to a Stable Outlook  include:  --Increase in financial leverage to above 20%, or an increase in the TFC ratio  to above 0.7x;  --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 6x annual interest on  financial debt; --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios at either the domestic life  insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries.

81,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings assigns a rating of 'BBB+' to American  International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) new issuance of approximately $350 million  4.35% senior notes due 2045.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  This new issue is rated equivalent to the ratings of AIG's existing senior debt  and was sold in the Taiwan market. Proceeds from the issue will be used for  general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of existing debt.  AIG's financial leverage ratio continued to decline to 16.5% at yearend 2014  from 18.2% at yearend 2013. The company's consolidated outstanding debt fell  significantly in 2014 due to the retirement of hybrid debt, significant  reductions in operating debt and the elimination of debt related to the  completed sale of the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) aircraft  leasing operations in May 2014.  Lower interest costs on recently issued debt and recent stable earnings for  AIG's property/casualty and life & retirement operations have fostered an  improvement in interest coverage levels. AIG's interest coverage ratio improved  to 9.0x in 2014 from 6.7x in 2013. This new debt issuance follows $2 billion of new debt issued in January 2015 by  AIG. Financial leverage is not anticipated to rise materially in 2015 from this  new issuance as AIG has approximately $2.1 billion of financial and operating  debt maturing in 2015. Fitch affirmed the ratings of AIG and its insurance operating subsidiaries with  a Positive Outlook on March 2, 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improvement in GAAP earnings-based interest coverage to 10x or above; --No material changes in AIG's capital structure including maintenance of  financial leverage and total financing and commitments (TFC) ratio at current  levels as well as risk-based capital at the company's insurance subsidiaries; --Stable to improving overall operating earnings.  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade in the ratings of AIG's  property/casualty subsidiaries include:  --A shift to sustainable underwriting profitability, with greater loss reserve  stability or reserve redundancies.

90,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK American International Group Inc  has reached a $40 million settlement of claims it should not have let employees invest their retirement savings in company stock as the insurer headed into the 2008 financial crisis, which nearly caused its collapse.The preliminary settlement was filed on Thursday in Manhattan federal court, which must approve the accord.It resolves claims that AIG caused the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars of retirement savings by imprudently offering company stock as an investment option in retirement plans such as the AIG Incentive Savings Plan and the American General Agents' and Managers' Thrift Plan.Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the settlement one of the largest under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, stemming from the financial crisis. AIG denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Its insurance carriers are expected to fund the settlement. AIG reached a $960 million settlement of shareholder litigation related to the crisis last August.Once the largest U.S. insurer by market value, AIG narrowly avoided collapse after making bad bets on mortgage debt through hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps. Huge losses led to a bailout that began in Sept. 2008, which at one point gave the government a 92 percent stake, and caused AIG's share price to bottom at around 35 cents in March 2009.The government has since shed its stake, and New York-based AIG is now profitable. Thursday's settlement covers retirement plan participants and beneficiaries from Aug. 7, 2007 through May 1, 2009.Legal fees will not exceed one-third of the settlement fund, court papers show.On Wednesday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. heard closing arguments in a $50 billion bench trial over whether the bailout shortchanged AIG shareholders, including a company run by the insurer's former chairman, Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg.

Its insurance carriers are expected to fund the settlement. AIG reached a $960 million settlement of shareholder litigation related to the crisis last August. Once the largest U.S. insurer by market value, AIG narrowly avoided collapse after making bad bets on mortgage debt through hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps.Huge losses led to a bailout that began in Sept. 2008, which at one point gave the government a 92 percent stake, and caused AIG's share price to bottom at around 35 cents in March 2009. The government has since shed its stake, and New York-based AIG is now profitable.Thursday's settlement covers retirement plan participants and beneficiaries from Aug. 7, 2007 through May 1, 2009.Legal fees will not exceed one-third of the settlement fund, court papers show. On Wednesday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. heard closing arguments in a $50 billion bench trial over whether the bailout shortchanged AIG shareholders, including a company run by the insurer's former chairman, Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg.

107,"   By Karen Freifeld | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A decade-old lawsuit in which New York accused former American International Group Inc Chief Executive Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg of accounting fraud will head to the state's highest court for a second time, likely delaying for several months a trial that had been set for June 25.The appellate division, a mid-level New York state court, on Thursday granted Greenberg's request to appeal its April 16 ruling that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman could pursue his bid to ban Greenberg from the securities industry, impose an officer and director ban, and recoup bonuses.Greenberg, 90, was sued in 2005 by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for arranging fraudulent transactions at AIG that boosted the insurer's loss reserves by $500 million. Schneiderman later inherited the lawsuit, but was forced to drop damages claims as high as $6 billion.Greenberg has called the remaining case a waste of taxpayer money, after he and other defendants reached a $115 million settlement with shareholders that won court approval in 2013.

110,"   By Richa Naidu  American International Group Inc (AIG.N), the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, reported a quarterly operating profit that breezed past analysts' estimates, and boosted its share buyback by up to $5 billion.Shares of the company, which more than doubled its quarterly dividend, were slightly higher in volatile after-market trading on Monday.The results were primarily driven by investments in one of China's biggest insurers and earnings from the insurer's stake in aircraft lessor AerCap, but lower underwriting at most of its units caused concern.S&P Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said AIG only beat because of income from a company it had essentially taken off its balance sheet.    AIG, which has been trying to exit AerCap Holdings NV (AER.N), sold most of its 46 percent stake in the world's largest independent aircraft leasing company in June.Pretax earnings from AerCap more than doubled to $127 million in the second quarter ended June, helping push AIG's operating income after tax to $1.9 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share.AIG, which traces its roots to a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also gained $170 million from investments in the People's Insurance Group of China Ltd (1339.HK) and its subsidiary, PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd (2328.HK). Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.22 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.FAIRLY DISAPPOINTING Underwriting income fell in all of the company's units, except retirement insurance. ""I found the insurance underwriting results fairly disappointing across the board and I'm hoping they don't portend a broader-based weakness,"" analyst Seifert said.Pretax operating profit fell 4 percent to $1.19 billion at the commercial property and casualty insurance business, traditionally AIG's forte, as the unit struggled with plummeting rates. Industry rates for commercial property and casualty insurance fell for the third quarter in a row, according to a survey published last month by the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers.AIG also paid out $88 million more in catastrophe losses. Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N), which vies with AIG for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit as catastrophe losses halved.The combined ratio at AIG's property and casualty unit inched up during the quarter to 98.8 percent from 96.5 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.AIG raised its quarterly dividend to 28 cents per share.The company's shares closed at $64.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.

119,"   By Richa Naidu  American International Group Inc (AIG.N), the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, reported a quarterly operating profit that breezed past analysts' estimates, and boosted its share buyback by up to $5 billion.Shares of the company, which more than doubled its quarterly dividend, were slightly higher in volatile after-market trading on Monday.The results were primarily driven by investments in one of China's biggest insurers and earnings from the insurer's stake in aircraft lessor AerCap, but lower underwriting at most of its units caused concern.S&P Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said AIG only beat because of income from a company it had essentially taken off its balance sheet.    AIG, which has been trying to exit AerCap Holdings NV (AER.N), sold most of its 46 percent stake in the world's largest independent aircraft leasing company in June.Pretax earnings from AerCap more than doubled to $127 million in the second quarter ended June, helping push AIG's operating income after tax to $1.9 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share.AIG, which traces its roots to a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also gained $170 million from investments in the People's Insurance Group of China Ltd (1339.HK) and its subsidiary, PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd (2328.HK). Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.22 per diluted share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.FAIRLY DISAPPOINTING Underwriting income fell in all of the company's units, except retirement insurance. ""I found the insurance underwriting results fairly disappointing across the board and I'm hoping they don't portend a broader-based weakness,"" analyst Seifert said.Pretax operating profit fell 4 percent to $1.19 billion at the commercial property and casualty insurance business, traditionally AIG's forte, as the unit struggled with plummeting rates. Industry rates for commercial property and casualty insurance fell for the third quarter in a row, according to a survey published last month by the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers.AIG also paid out $88 million more in catastrophe losses. Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N), which vies with AIG for the title of the biggest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurer, reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit as catastrophe losses halved.The combined ratio at AIG's property and casualty unit inched up during the quarter to 98.8 percent from 96.5 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.AIG raised its quarterly dividend to 28 cents per share.The company's shares closed at $64.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.

131,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK, Sept 10  NEW YORK, Sept 10 A federal judge on Thursday narrowed several lawsuits against American International Group Inc by shareholders who opted out of the $970.5 million class-action settlement that she approved in March over the insurer's 2008 bailout.U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan dismissed claims that she said were brought too late against AIG in the six ""opt-out"" lawsuits, which were filed between November 2011 and February 2015.She rejected the argument by plaintiffs that the filing of the shareholder class action gave them more time to pursue their own claims, without running afoul of statutes of limitation. Swain also dismissed claims brought under state common law.The six lawsuits did not all raise the same claims against AIG, which is based in New York. AIG spokesman Jon Diat said: ""We are pleased with the decision.""As in the class action, opt-out shareholders claimed that AIG misled them about its subprime mortgage exposure and the risks that the insurer took in credit default swaps, culminating in $182.3 billion of federal bailouts.The shareholders include the Kuwait Investment Authority, the Teachers Retirement System of the State of Illinois, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Ltd, the University of California, and various General Electric and Lord Abbett investment funds. Plaintiffs often file opt-out lawsuits if they believe they can recover more by suing individually rather than in a class.Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer for the Kuwait fund, said Swain's decision ""has no effect on our client,"" which filed the earliest of the opt-out lawsuits. Lawyers for the other plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Other defendants who won dismissals of various claims include former AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan; Joseph Cassano, who oversaw the CDS portfolio; and various executives and board members.The bailouts left taxpayers with a nearly 80 percent stake in AIG, which the government later sold off, resulting in a $22.7 billion return.The cases are all in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. They are Kuwait Investment Authority v. American International Group Inc et al, No. 11-08403; Teachers Retirement System of the State of Illinois v.

132,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign a rating of 'BBB+'  to American International Group, Inc.'s (AIG) $420 million issuance of 4.9%  senior notes due 2045. Proceeds from this new issue will be used for general  corporate purposes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS This new issue is rated equivalent to the ratings of AIG's existing senior debt,  and was sold in the Taiwan market. AIG completed offerings of 30-year notes in  Taiwan in March 2015 ($350 million) and July 2015 ($290 million). Financial leverage as measured by the ratio of financial debt and preferred  securities to total capital (excluding operating debt and the impact of FAS 115)  was 17.5% at June 30, 2015, up from 16.5% at year-end 2014. Pro forma financial  leverage adjusting for the new issuance, the July 2015 repurchase of $3.4  billion of AIG parent debt, and prior third-quarter 2015 issuances of $2.79  billion of senior debt is 17.5%.  Fitch affirmed the ratings of AIG and its insurance operating subsidiaries with  a Positive Outlook on Sept. 1, 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade include: --Improvement in GAAP earnings-based interest coverage to 10x or above; --No material changes in AIG's capital structure, including maintenance of  financial leverage and total financing and commitments (TFC) ratio at current  levels as well as risk-based capital at the company's insurance subsidiaries; --Stable-to-improving overall operating earnings.  Key triggers that could lead to an upgrade to the ratings of AIG's  property/casualty subsidiaries include:  --A shift to sustainable underwriting profitability, with greater loss reserve  stability or reserve redundancies. Key triggers that could lead to a return to a Stable Outlook include:  --Increase in financial leverage to above 20%, or an increase in the TFC ratio  to above 0.7x from 0.5 currently;  --Significant reductions in debt servicing capacity from holding company assets  and available dividends from subsidiaries to a level below 6x annual interest on  financial debt; --Large underwriting losses and/or heightened reserve volatility of the  company's non-life insurance subsidiaries; --Deterioration in the company's domestic life subsidiaries' profitability  trends; --Material declines in risk-based capital ratios at either the domestic life  insurance or the non-life insurance subsidiaries. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch expects to assign the following rating:  --USD420 million of 4.9% senior unsecured notes due Sept. 25, 2045 'BBB+'.

Later in March, United Guaranty filed for an initial public offering of up to $100 million with U.S. regulators.Icahn, whose representative secured a board seat at AIG earlier this year, has been pushing the insurer to split itself into three smaller companies. The billionaire saw it as a way for the company to shed its designation as a systemically important financial institution, which would free the company from having to comply with stricter capital requirements.The insurer reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly operating profit earlier this month, driven by lower costs and strong underwriting. Shares of Arch Capital and AIG were unchanged in after-market trading on Monday.J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co LLC advised AIG on the deal. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP was its legal adviser. Arch's financial adviser was Credit Suisse Group AG, with Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP and Clyde & Co acting as legal counsel.
