6,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Avago Technologies Ltd's LSI and Seagate Technology do not violate patented technology owned by Realtek Semiconductor Corp, the U.S. International Trade Commission said on Monday. Taiwan-based Realtek accused the companies of violating a patent to make an integrated circuit with high frequency and low noise.The commission found that Seagate and LSI, which was purchased by Avago this year, used the same technology as in the patent. But it also found that Realtek does not have a U.S. business and thus could not enforce the patent using the ITC.    The ITC can rule that a patent has been violated if the accused company infringes the patent and if the patent owner uses the patent in the United States.     Realtek filed a complaint with the ITC in September 2012 accusing the two companies of infringing on two of its patents for making integrated circuits used in a wide array of electronics. One of the patents was dropped during the course of litigation. None of the three companies could immediately be reached for comment.     Realtek and Avago's LSI make semiconductors while Seagate,  based in California, specializes in disk drives and storage.    The ITC is a popular venue for patent lawsuits because it will ban products from the United States if they infringe on a patent. The case at the International Trade Commission is No. 337-859.

The company is releasing a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus. They will support more than 200 telecoms carriers worldwide, with sales launching in Australia on Friday morning and then in the United States and other countries.Like previous iPhones, the iPhone 6 Plus uses a Qualcomm (QCOM.O) 4G LTE modem, according to iFixit.Dissembling the device in a Mac repair shop after lining up overnight to buy a phone, iFixit technicians also discovered a Murata (6981.T) wifi module, a Broadcom (BRCM.O) touchscreen controller, and chips from Skyworks, Avago and TriQuint TQNT.O. News that a supplier has been chosen - or rejected - for one of Apple's products can sometimes cause drastic swings in stock prices.

It also imposes strict rules forbidding its suppliers from discussing Apple-related business with investors and the media.Shares of GT Advanced Technologies Inc GTAT.O, a mineral crystal specialist, slumped 13 percent on Sept 9 after some investors were surprised the US company's scratch-resistent sapphire glass was not being used on the new iPhones.The phones launched on Friday are Apple's first to include NFC radio chips used for the new Apple Pay mobile payment platform. The NFC chip in the iPhone 6 Plus comes from NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O), according to iFixit, in line with most investors' expectations. NXP also supplies a motion co-processor, key to making the iPhone's sensors work without draining its battery, iFixit said.As in other iPhones, Apple has designed its own main processor with technology licensed from ARM Holdings ARM.L and in this device it is the A8 chip.

Avago's previously unreported negotiations to acquire Freescale indicate that major deals in the sector are set to continue as chipmakers respond to their customers seeking to consolidate suppliers.Avago, which has a market capitalization of $32 billion, had lined up banks to finance an offer for Avago, the people said. The company, which is based in Singapore and San Jose, California, ended negotiations after Freescale shares surged above $36 on Feb. 13 after the New York Post reported that Freescale was exploring a sale, according to the people. The rise in the share price made Freescale too expensive for Avago, which had identified fewer synergies than NXP did and was betting on cutting costs and divesting some of Freescale's less profitable assets to make the deal work, the people added.Avago and Freescale could not be reached for comment. The deal would have been the biggest so far for Avago, which was created by private equity firms KKR & Co LP and Silver Lake following their acquisition of Hewlett-Packard Co's semiconductor unit Agilent in 2005.Avago, under the leadership of Chief Executive Hock Tan, is now looking for other acquisitions to expand its offerings, the people said.  Last week, Avago agreed to buy networking company Emulex Corp for $606 million. Avago's biggest deal to date was in May 2014, when it bought LSI Corp for $6.6 billion in cash, with backing from Silver Lake, in a bid to expand into the fast-growing storage chip market.Avago could now look at expanding in different areas, from analog semiconductors to radio frequency technology, the people said, adding that it could roll up several smaller analog companies or pursue a larger acquisition.Avago's main business is its wireless segment, which last quarter accounted for about 40 percent of revenue and sells radio frequency chips for products like Apple's Inc's iPhone. The rest of its businesses are split between enterprise storage, wired infrastructure and fiber optics, as well as industrials, all areas it may seek to bulk up. Avago's shares have doubled over the past 12 months, as has its revenue, primarily due to the LSI deal. Worldwide semiconductor M&A reached $31 billion last year, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data.  (Reporting by Liana B.

Baker  Avago Technologies Ltd, looking to acquire a fellow chipmaker, has reached out to potential targets including Xilinx Inc, Renesas Electronics Corp and Maxim Integrated Products Inc, according to people familiar with the matter.Avago is working with investment banks and could spend more than $10 billion on a potential takeover, the people said.None of the three approaches has yet led to advanced deal discussions, in part because of Avago's fear of overpaying, the people added. Avago has also spoken to private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP about partnering in a potential acquisition, the people said. Silver Lake, together with KKR & Co LP, created Avago in 2005 by acquiring Hewlett-Packard Co's semiconductor unit Agilent. Neither Silver Lake nor KKR still own stakes in Avago, but the former provided financing for Avago's $6.6 billion acquisition of LSI Corp last year and has a seat on Avago's board. The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. Maxim, Xilinx and Silver Lake declined to comment. Avago and Renesas did not respond to requests for comment. Even if they prove unsuccessful, Avago's overtures highlight  Chief Executive Hock Tan's unquenched thirst for acquisitions following its bid earlier this year for Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. NXP Semiconductors NV ended up buying Freescale for $11.8 billion after Avago deemed it too expensive, sources told Reuters at the time. Avago, which develops semiconductor devices for the wireless and industrial markets, has been looking at expanding in areas ranging from analog semiconductors to radio frequency technology. Each of the potential targets could allow Avago to round out its businesses. San Jose, California-based Xilinx, a dominant programmable chipmaker, competes with Altera Corp, which Intel Corp has been circling in recent months.Renesas, which makes microcontroller chips used in cars, was created from a merger of the chip units of Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric in 2002. Renesas then merged with NEC Electronics Corp in 2010 to create Japan's largest chipmaker. In 2012, when Renesas was running low on cash, it turned to a consortia of Japanese investors to help keep it afloat and also spoke to KKR and other private equity firms. San Jose, California-based Maxim designs and manufactures analog chips that are used in cars, manufacturing, energy, communications, healthcare and connected devices, according to its website.  Worldwide semiconductor M&A reached $31 billion last year, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data. (Reporting by Nadia Damouni and Liana B.

EU officials, however, dismissed Greek claims an aid agreement was being drafted. Investors said U.S. stocks were oversold in the previous session, when concerns about Greece and foreign exchange pushed Wall Street to its steepest fall in three weeks.The S&P has inched up to a handful of record high closes in May. But the stock market has failed to make what some traders see as meaningful gains, in part because they are concerned about when the Federal Reserve will start to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.""People felt yesterday was an overreaction and I would agree,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois.

31,"   By Lehar Maan and Bill Rigby  Avago Technologies Ltd's (AVGO.O) $37 billion deal to buy chipmaker Broadcom  Corp (BRCM.O) creates new competitive challenges for Qualcomm and may force the world's largest mobile chip maker to radically rethink its own strategy.Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which has dominated the market for connectivity chips on smartphones, has been looking to extend its reach into data centers and network infrastructure, but may find its way blocked by an enlarged competitor combining Avago's strength in storage and Broadcom's power in networking.""Qualcomm has aspirations of moving into Intel's data center processor incumbency that the Avago storage and now enterprise networking (from Broadcom) capability directly overlays,"" said Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington. That could result in Qualcomm creating some sort of partnership with Intel Corp (INTC.O), he said, to combat the reach of the new company.Wall Street analysts generally cheered the deal on Thursday, despite some fretting about price, saying Broadcom's strength  in wireless networking, WiFi and Bluetooth chips is a good complement to Avago's presence in industrial and wired devices.That presents a challenge to Qualcomm, which finds itself in a tough spot in the maturing microprocessor business, as smartphone makers such as Samsung (005930.KS), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Huawei (002502.SZ) put more effort into producing their own chips. Now a Avago/Broadcom tie-up - which will take the name of Broadcom - potentially gives handset makers another viable supplier, giving them more leverage and putting even more pressure on Qualcomm, said IDC analyst Mario Morales.""The other material impact will come from the adjacencies that Qualcomm is trying to enter now, the data center, infrastructure and the consumer area,"" he added. ""We see a lot of synergy in the technology they (Avago) are buying.""Qualcomm has hinted that it is looking at new areas.  ""I think there's going to be a tremendous amount of growth in computing and resources dedicated to supporting the cloud,"" Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said at last year's Consumer Electronics Show. ""We look at that as an opportunity for a company like ours.""The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment on its strategic plans in response to the Broadcom deal on Thursday.Avago/Broadcom is just the latest in a wave of heavyweight mergers and acquisitions reshaping the chip industry.  NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) unveiled a deal in March to buy smaller peer Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N. In the same month, Reuters reported that Intel was in talks to buy chipmaker Altera Corp ALTR.O, which many investors expect to result in a deal soon.That backdrop of consolidation may force Qualcomm's hand.""Either divest themselves of the business that they are in that is in direct competition with Broadcom - and now Avago - or find a way to grow their presence,"" said Chris Geier, partner-in-charge of Sikich Investment Banking, assessing Qualcomm's options. ""They are going to have to do one or the other. The status quo for them at this point won't work.""

Baker and Supantha MukherjeeMay 28 Avago Technologies Ltd agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion in the largest merger of chipmakers ever, turning a lesser known company run by a ferocious dealmaker into one of the biggest industry players.Avago, which serves the wireless and industrial markets, is offering Broadcom shareholders $17 billion in cash and Avago shares valued at $20 billion.Broadcom is best known for its connectivity chips, which are used widely in smartphones made by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.The deal is the biggest so far by Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan, who has developed a small chipmaker into a $36 billion company through acquisitions since taking the helm nine years ago.Tan, a serial deal-maker, has trimmed Avago's portfolio by divesting units while bulking up in faster-growing areas.The combined company, to be based in Singapore and known as Broadcom, will be the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp and  Qualcomm Inc. The merger is the industry's second megadeal this year and is unlikely to be the last, analysts said.The $37 billion price represents a premium of about 28 percent over Broadcom's market value of $28.85 billion as of Tuesday's close, before the Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks. MORE DEALS? Demand for cheaper chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry.The Avago-Broadcom deal follows NXP Semiconductors'  $11.8 billion offer to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd  in March. Avago had also bid for Freescale, people familiar with the matter said at the time.Intel has also been in talks to buy chipmaker Altera Corp  in a deal that could top $10 billion.Until Thursday, Avago's biggest deal was for chipmaker LSI Corp, which it bought for $6.6 billion last year.Tan's strategy has been to look at potential targets that do not necessarily have the best strategic fit but have cost-cutting potential to build value. Avago and Broadcom first spoke about a potential merger in October 2014 but could not agree on a price, said people familiar with the matter who are unauthorized to speak publicly about it.Talks heated up in April when Avago approached Broadcom again with higher offers, and negotiations continued until the two agreed on a deal.Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, which is an Avago investor and holds a board seat, worked closely with the company to help evaluate Broadcom and structure the deal, said two sources who are unauthorized to speak publicly about the deal.BARGAINING CHIP  The merger will help the companies improve their bargaining position with manufacturers.Irvine, California-based Broadcom has been struggling to grow as competition in the mobile chip business intensifies. The company's revenue increased by just 1.5 percent last year.Broadcom's shares closed down 1.5 percent at $56.25 on Thursday, while Avago's fell 0.62 percent to $142.38.The companies said they expected to close the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and save $750 million within 18 months. The deal has a breakup fee of $1 billion, one of the unidentified sources said.The new Broadcom would have annual revenue of $15 billion and an enterprise value of $77 billion, the companies said in a statement.Broadcom shareholders will own about 32 percent of the combined company. They would also have the option to choose between various combinations of cash and stock.Avago, which is incorporated in Singapore and also has headquarters in San Jose, California, said it intended to fund the cash portion of the deal by using funds from the combined company and new debt of $9 billion.Avago was advised by Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.Broadcom was advised by JPMorgan Chase, while Evercore served as financial adviser to the Special Committee of the board.Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is the legal adviser to Broadcom.

Baker and Supantha MukherjeeAvago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp (BRCM.O) for $37 billion in the largest merger of chipmakers ever, turning a lesser known company run by a ferocious dealmaker into one of the biggest industry players. Avago, which serves the wireless and industrial markets, is offering Broadcom shareholders $17 billion in cash and Avago shares valued at $20 billion.Broadcom is best known for its connectivity chips, which are used widely in smartphones made by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).  The deal is the biggest so far by Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan, who has developed a small chipmaker into a $36 billion company through acquisitions since taking the helm nine years ago.Tan, a serial deal-maker, has trimmed Avago's portfolio by divesting units while bulking up in faster-growing areas.The combined company, to be based in Singapore and known as Broadcom, will be the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp (INTC.O) and  Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O). The merger is the industry's second megadeal this year and is unlikely to be the last, analysts said.The $37 billion price represents a premium of about 28 percent over Broadcom's market value of $28.85 billion as of Tuesday's close, before the Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks.MORE DEALS?

41,"   By Jonathan Schwarzberg and Lynn Adler | NEW YORK, June 4  NEW YORK, June 4 Huge takeovers by companies including cable operator Charter Communications Inc and chipmaker Avago Technologies promise to propel merger and acquisition loan volume from strong to certifiably robust as deals were announced at a record-breaking pace in May.Leveraged deals are taking a backseat to investment grade deals, however, as corporations with strong balance sheets and huge amounts of cash on their books are beating out sponsors already burdened by the constraint of leveraged lending guidance that has limited leverage to around 6.0 times on most deals.Industry insiders expect both leveraged and investment grade M&A activity to remain strong throughout the remainder of the year, with demand for debt outweighing supply despite the rash of new deals.""There's a lot of capital chasing the loan side of these deals,"" said George Tetler, a partner at Bowditch & Dewey, referring to debt investors.Companies in the United States announced $245.2 billion of mergers and acquisitions in May, breaking the all-time record of $225.8 billion for monthly M&A volume set in May 2007, according to data from Dealogic. So far this year volume in the United States has reached $825.8 billion, compared to $542.1 billion in the same period last year. M&A activity has boosted volume in a market that until the second quarter of the year was virtually void of refinancing activity.Total completed M&A loan volume is $176.5 billion year-to-date compared to $163.5 billion at this time last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. Another $96.2 billion is in the pipeline, led by Charter, which is arranging approximately $32 billion of loans to fund its acquisitions of fellow cable operators Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.Avago said it plans to arrange $15.5 billion of loans to back its purchase of rival Broadcom Corp, including $9 billion of new money and $6.5 billion of refinancing debt. Avago is a leveraged deal while Charter has said it anticipates netting an investment grade rating on its secured debt. This week, another chipmaker - Intel, the world's biggest - agreed to buy Altera for $16.7 billion, the third big deal this year in the highly fragmented chip industry.Charter is the largest M&A financing of the year so far, followed by a pair of other investment grade transactions. Drugmaker Abbvie lined up an $18 billion bridge loan to support its $21 billion acquisition of pharmaceutical company Pharmacyclics in March for the second-largest deal. Drugstore CVS Caremark Corp arranged a $13 billion bridge loan to finance its $12.7 billion purchase of pharmacy services provider Omnicare.  PIPELINE BOOST Investment grade deals have made up 41.5 percent of completed M&A financing this year, and this number jumps to 50.3 percent including deals in the pipeline. Last year at this time, investment grade deals made up just 35.8 percent of total volume.""On the investment grade side, people had been waiting for the floodgates to open for a while, and fairly clearly they have now opened,"" said Jason Kyrwood a partner at Davis Polk, adding the deals tend to come in waves by sector, from food companies last year to pharma and healthcare to telecom.Cross-border deals have also become more prevalent. It does not look like M&A activity is ready to slow down yet.""The chatter I am hearing suggests that the pipeline remains robust, with a few nice larger transactions still to come,"" Kyrwood said, referring to both leveraged and non-leveraged deals.In particular, Tetler noted that General Electric Co's decision to sell most of financial services unit GE Capital should spur M&A activity in the financial services sector throughout the remainder of the year, as GE sells off the unit in pieces.

42,"   By Kristen Haunss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) has lined up five banks to back its $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom Corp (BRCM.O), the largest merger of chipmakers.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Citigroup will provide the committed financing slated to back the transaction, sources told Thomson Reuters LPC.Though the loans are still in early stages, Avago said in a May 28 investor presentation it plans to line up $15.5 billion of term loan debt. This will include $9 billion to finance the acquisition and $6.5 billion to refinance existing facilities.The debt package also includes an undrawn $500 million revolver.Though bankers suggest there is no firm breakdown yet, the financing is expected to include a term loan A and a term loan B component.A hefty pro rata portion that may tap the market first is anticipated to at least partially quench the U.S. bank market’s thirst for funded paper.“It’s going to be a big deal and everyone is going to do it,” an investor said.A term loan B will likely follow, and will help boost the low supply of institutional paper that year-to-date has contributed to the wave of repricings and refinancing currently making its way through the market. The lack of new paper is not only impacting investors’ loan revenues but also loan buyers across the board. Collateralized loan obligation (CLO) issuance has also slowed, in part because of a lack of new loan volume, after a record $15.24 billion was arranged in March. Still with more than $17 billion of CLOs raised in April and May, coupled with $388 million of inflows into loan funds last month, investors are aching for new loans. Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) is also anticipated to bring more supply to the equation. The cable provider has lined up $30.5 billion of debt commitments to back its $56 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and its $10.4 billion purchase of Bright House Networks LLC. The mega deal will include a large leveraged component as well.“Every little bit helps in this market,” the investor said.ON THE UP  Moody's Investors Service placed the Ba2 corporate family rating of Avago on review for upgrade following the announcement of the planned acquisition.Adjusted leverage for the combined company will be about 3.5 times at closing, an increase from Avago’s 2.6 times for the 12 months ended May 3, according to a June 1 Moody’s report.Standard & Poor’s estimates leverage will increase to the high 2.0 times to low 3.0 times area from about 2.0 times April 30, including adjustments, according to a May 28 report.The credit facility will permit dividends and share repurchases. In addition to the debt, the financing includes about 140 million shares and share equivalents, according to the company’s presentation. Avago, a chip maker incorporated in Singapore, announced May 28 that it is acquiring Irvine, California-based Broadcom for $17 billion in cash and shares. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016, according to the presentation.Though the Avago transaction is expected to go through significant anti-trust scrutiny, bankers do not expect any regulatory delays.The combined company will have a revenue base of about $15 billion, more than double Avago’s trailing annual revenue, according to the Moody’s report.Avago and Broadcom spokespeople could not immediately comment.The Avago financing roster closely mirrors the lineup the company tapped for its purchase of semiconductor designer LSI Corp in May 2014, with the addition of Credit Suisse.

44,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff and Michael Gold | SINGAPORE/TAIPEI  SINGAPORE/TAIPEI Chip companies are merging, signing $66 billion worth of deals this year alone in preparation for an explosion of demand from all walks of life as the next technological revolution takes hold: the Internet of Things.As cars, crockery and even cows are controlled or monitored online, each will require a different kind of chip of ever-diminishing size, combining connectivity with processing, memory and battery power.These require makers to pool resources and intellectual property to produce smaller, faster, cheaper chips, for a market that International Data Corp said would grow to $1.7 trillion by 2020 from $650 billion last year.By comparison, chip markets for personal and tablet computers are stagnant or in decline, and even smartphones are near peaking, said Bob O'Donnell, a long-time consultant to the chip industry.""We're very much done in terms of growth of those traditional markets,"" said O'Donnell. ""That's why they are looking at this.""Last month saw the biggest-ever chip merger with Avago Technologies Ltd agreeing to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion. That eclipsed the $17 billion Intel Corp agreed last week for Altera Corp, and the $12 billion NXP Semiconductors NV offered in March for Freescale Semiconductor Ltd.On Friday, Lattice Semiconductor Corp said it was open to a sale.  CONNECTED COWS The Internet of Things relies on chips in devices wirelessly sending data to servers, which in turn process the data and send results to a user's smartphone, or automatically tweak the devices themselves.Those devices range from a light bulb to a nuclear power plant, from a smartwatch to a building's air-conditioning system. This range presents both opportunity and a challenge for semiconductor companies: their potential customer base is huge, but diverse, requiring different approaches. Qualcomm Inc, for example, is used to selling chips to around a dozen mobile phone manufacturers. The Internet of Things has brought it business from quite different players, from makers of water meters to street lights that sport modems and traffic-monitoring cameras. All have their own needs.""You can't think the new market is just like the old one,"" Qualcomm Vice President of Marketing Tim McDonough said in an interview.Qualcomm estimates that the Internet of Things will bring in more than 10 percent of its chip revenue this business year.    And then there are those cows. Instead of monitoring herds by sight, farmers in Japan have tagged them with Internet-connected pedometers from Fujitsu Ltd and partner Microsoft Corp, to measure when they might be ready for insemination. Cows in season, it turns out, tend to pace more. SPECK OF CHIP This new business is pushing chip companies together in part to consolidate their expertise onto one chip, a trend forged by mobile phones.The Avago-Broadcom deal, for instance, brings together motion control and optical sensors from Avago with chips from Broadcom that specialize in connectivity via wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.In the past ""if you wanted to build a board that has all the components, then you needed to buy three different chips,"" said Dipesh Patel of ARM Holdings PLC, which licenses much of the technology inside mobile phones - and, increasingly, in the Internet of Things.""Now you only need to buy one chip. But you're trying to get more of the same system on the same chip.""As chips get smaller, they could be tiny enough to ingest, according to Vital Herd Inc. The Texas-based startup's pill-like sensor, once a cow swallows it, can transmit vital signs, warning farmers of illness and other problems. Jen-Hsun Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of graphics chips maker Nvidia Corp, predicts chips will shrink to the size of a speck of dust and find their way into almost anything, from shoes to cups.""Those little tiny chips, I think they're going to be sold by the trillions,"" Huang said in an interview. ""Maybe even sold by the pound.""    PROCESSING Installing chips into end products is only one side of the equation. The more things connect, the bigger the number and capability of servers needed to process the vast amount of specialized data those chips transmit.To meet the demand, Intel could employ chips for its servers designed by new purchase Altera that analyze streams of similar data - specializing in one function, as opposed to multiple functions like chips inside personal computers - industry consultant O'Donnell said.Combining such strengths is going to be vital, said Malik Saadi of ABI Research, because consolidation is not over yet.More chip companies ""will have to make that radical decision to merge,"" said Saadi. ""This is just the starting point.""  (Additional reporting by Liana Baker in New York; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",2015-06-08,AVGO,"Mon Jun 8, 2015 | 5:08pm EDT","Connected cows, cars and crockery prod chip mega mergers",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-chips-internet-idUSKBN0OO2FZ20150608?type=companyNews
45,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK, July 6  NEW YORK, July 6 Hedging activity is rising for U.S. semiconductor stocks as investors fear that sector earnings may be weak, and share prices may fall after a recent flourish in mergers and acquisitions.Options bets on an exchange-traded fund that tracks the sector have long been bearish, but there was a noticeable rise in hedging activity in June.The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index lost 9 percent in June, more than twice the 4.4 percent fall for the broader S&P 500 Information Technology Index.The Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF touched an all-time high of $60.13 in June but has lost 9 percent, and was down 48 cents at $54.64 on Monday. ""The price action in both the ETF and the semiconductor index are indicating that there is trouble ahead,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.Sentiment has been hurt after Micron Technology Inc  gave a dismal earnings forecast in late June, citing a further drop in personal computer chip prices due to weak demand for PCs.Since Micron's forecast, puts activity has increased for Intel and Texas Instruments, two of the ETF's top holdings. With analysts expecting a choppy earnings season for chip companies, options traders have been lapping up the ETF's put, usually used to place bearish bets.Overall open interest, which had dropped to 70,000 contracts mid-May, has nearly trebled with puts outnumbering calls nearly 5-to-1. The ETF's puts had attracted heavy hedging activity earlier this year as well, when puts outnumbered calls by about 10-to-1. ""The sheer volume in the puts leads me to believe that traders are hedging for earnings or general market volatility,"" said Jim Smith, options strategist at OTR Global.Big mergers in the sector, including Avago Technologies Ltd's $37 billion deal for Broadcom and Intel Corp's $16.7 billion purchase of Altera, have put the spotlight on the sector as the largest players look to beef up capabilities.Most semi stocks currently include some M&A premium, and this could be problematic for companies that do not get acquired, analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group said in a recent note.

46,"   By Jonathan Schwarzberg | NEW YORK, Sept 3  NEW YORK, Sept 3 Big issuers of US leveraged loans including cable company Charter Communications Inc  and chipmaker Avago Technologies will test the US leveraged loan market by launching jumbo deals after the Labor Day holiday, but could benefit from a flight to quality after global equity market turmoil.Investors are expected to favor large liquid deals for highly-rated companies as they become more selective about deals that they are willing to hold on their books in a 'risk off' environment as China's stock market crash and slumping commodities prices exacerbate fears of increasing default rates.""I believe there's a higher degree of uncertainty right now driven by a combination of historically low commodity prices and equity market volatility plus what happens with interest rates,"" said Kevin Lockhart, global co-head of leveraged finance at Jefferies.Wider market volatility usually pushes secondary prices lower, and average secondary bids on the SMi100 index of most widely held loans dropped to 98.71 at the start of September from 99.62 on July 21. This typically prompts a pricing correction in the primary market as investors call for higher pricing or discounts and improved terms, including adding or boosting call protection and adding most favored nation clauses.Charter and Avago have jumbo multi-billion dollar acquisition loans to launch after Labor Day, despite launching smaller deals before the holiday to minimize execution risk on the larger financings in light of market turmoil.These jumbo loans could be less affected by typical market dynamics, however, due to low dealflow this year in the US leveraged loan market and continued demand from deal-hungry investors as new Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds, the main buyers of loans, have continue to be issued.US leveraged volume was just US$559bn at the end of August for the year to date, 19% lower than US$689bn in the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. ""It feels like pricing should widen a bit, but that is offset by the combination of CLO creation and the fact that year over year volume is low,"" Lockhart said.The volume of deals launching after Labor Day is unlikely to change excess demand, which will continue to favor borrowers with strong credit profiles, another banker said.This means that Charter and Avago's bellwether deals may still be able to achieve competitive pricing, although smaller, less liquid deals are expected to see more revision.""The top tier of credits is probably going to be on par with pricing earlier this year and may be slightly tighter on occasion because everyone is going to be chasing quality."" Lockhart said. PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES Charter and Avago launched smaller deals in July and August to reduce the size and risk of the remaining loans that they need to raise. Investors were supportive and both deals were increased from original targets.Charter increased a term loan H financing to US$3.8bn from US$3.5bn on July 22, which part-finances its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks LLC, which total US$78.7bn. The company still has commitments to issue a further US$5.2bn of debt to help finance the acquisitions. Avago increased a term loan A to US$4.25bn from US$3.25bn on August 14, which also part-financed its US$37bn acquisition of rival Broadcom Corp. The company said that it plans to line up a total of US15.5bn to finance the deal, leaving more than US$10bn to raise. Avago will use US$9bn of loans to finance the acquisition and US$6.5bn will refinance debt.Charter and Avago's follow-on deals are expected to be well received by investors, a senior banker said, adding that deals at the lower end of the credit spectrum will not find as much interest from investors.Demand for riskier lower-rated deals and subordinated second lien loans has fallen in the recent market rout. Many buyers were crossover high-yield investors and deals with second-lien debt are now being restructured with bonds when possible. Private equity firms and alternative lenders may also buy second lien tranches if they are small enough.Bankers still expect September to be busy due to continued mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity with deals in the pipeline including a financing backing fashion department store operator Belk Inc's US$3bn buyout by Sycamore Partners, which has commitments from nine banks.The current round of equity market volatility is expected to create new financing opportunities in the fall, but fewer jumbo deals of Charter's or Avago's scale are expected.""It's not a market that is dominated by big deals right now,"" the banker said. ""But there are going to be quite a few more things on the calendar.""

Avago serves the wireless and industrial markets while Broadcom's chips are used widely in smartphones made by Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS).European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. The EU competition authority extended its deadline for a decision on the deal to Nov. 23 from Nov. 9. U.S. regulators nodded through the takeover in August. Avago and Broadcom did not immediately reply to emails for comment.Since taking over Singapore and San Jose, California-based Avago nine years ago, Chief Executive Hock Tan has developed the company via a series of acquisitions, with Broadcom his biggest buy to date. The merged company will be based in Singapore and known as Broadcom.

Barron's also noted that other trends will be positive for the company, including increased demand for proprietary signal filters used in cell phones.

75,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Qualcomm Inc is nearing a deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV for around $37 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday, as the U.S. company seeks to expand the reach of its chips from phones to cars.The deal would make San Diego-based Qualcomm, which supplies Android smartphone makers and Apple Inc, a bigger supplier to the automotive industry as it grapples with slowing smartphone sales and stiff competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals.The acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm for $110 per share in cash could be announced within days, although there is always a possibility of a last-minute glitch, the source said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Qualcomm and NXP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CNBC first reported that the companies were nearing a deal for $110 per share. NXP shares dropped 2.5 percent on the news to $101.90, while Qualcomm shares were up 2.2 percent to $68.77, indicating that the terms were seen by investors as more favorable to Qualcomm than previously expected. Qualcomm had sat out the transformative consolidation sweeping the industry, which has seen mega-deals such as Avago buying Broadcom for $37 billion last year.Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from chip sales but most of its profit comes from wireless patents it licenses to the mobile industry. It explored a plan to break up its chip business from its patent licensing unit after pressure from activist investor Jana Partners but decided to remain whole. Qualcomm ranked third in terms of revenue among global semiconductor companies in 2015, while Eindhoven, Netherlands-based NXP ranked No. 7, according to research firm IHS.

76,"   By Liana B. Baker  SAN FRANCISCO - Chipmaker Broadcom Ltd is nearing a deal to acquire network gear maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc in a deal that could be announced later this week, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  The deal would be the latest in a wave of semiconductor consolidation sweeping the industry. Run by Chief Executive Hock Tan, the company formerly known as Avago is one of the chip sector's most prolific acquirers, having completed a $37 billion takeover this year and changing its name to Broadcom.   If the U.S.-and-Singapore-based company succeeds in buying Brocade, it would keep Brocade's fibre channel and storage business, which has roughly $1.5 billion in annual revenue, while it would aim to divest its networking business, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.    Broadcom and Brocade declined to comment. While the companies are in advanced discussions, no deal is final and talks could still fall apart, the people cautioned.     A big part of Brocade's IP networking business that Broadcom would look to divest was acquired as part of Brocade's $1.5 billion acquisition of Ruckus Wireless earlier this year. This unit generated $209 million in product revenue in the third quarter.   A deal for Brocade, whose market capitalization has risen to $4.5 billion on merger talk, would come a week after the semiconductor's industry's largest-ever tie-up when smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Inc agreed to buy NXP Semiconductors NV for about $38 billion.Shares of Brocade closed 6 percent higher at $11.24, while Broadcom shares closed 0.9 percent lower at $168.80 on Tuesday.     Brocade would be the latest addition to the sprawling company known as Broadcom, now the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, with a market capitalization of $66.4 billion.  Last year, when Broadcom was called Avago, it made a push into fibre and adapters with the acquisition of Emulex. By adding Brocade's high-margin fibre unit, it would further bulk up its capabilities to help customers with the backbones of their data centers.Morningstar analyst Brian Colello said in a research note on Tuesday his biggest concern about a potential deal would be Broadcom having to compete with some of its key customers such as Cisco Systems Inc. By disposing of Brocade's networking business, it could help mitigate this issue.  Bloomberg reported on Monday that Brocade was nearing a deal to be sold and that Broadcom was among potential buyers.

A deal for Brocade, whose market capitalization has risen to $4.5 billion on merger talk, would come a week after the semiconductor's industry's largest-ever tie-up when smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Inc agreed to buy NXP Semiconductors NV for about $38 billion.Shares of Brocade closed 6 percent higher at $11.24, while Broadcom shares closed 0.9 percent lower at $168.80 on Tuesday.     Brocade would be the latest addition to the sprawling company known as Broadcom, now the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, with a market capitalization of $66.4 billion.  Last year, when Broadcom was called Avago, it made a push into fibre and adapters with the acquisition of Emulex. By adding Brocade's high-margin fibre unit, it would further bulk up its capabilities to help customers with the backbones of their data centers.Morningstar analyst Brian Colello said in a research note on Tuesday his biggest concern about a potential deal would be Broadcom having to compete with some of its key customers such as Cisco Systems Inc. By disposing of Brocade's networking business, it could help mitigate this issue.  Bloomberg reported on Monday that Brocade was nearing a deal to be sold and that Broadcom was among potential buyers.

79,"  (Corrects market capitalization of Brocade in paragraph 6 to $4.5 billion from $5.31 billion)* Broadcom would plan to divest Brocade's IP networking unit-sourcesBy Liana B. BakerSAN FRANCISCO, Nov 1 - Chipmaker Broadcom Ltd is nearing a deal to acquire network gear maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc in a deal that could be announced later this week, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The deal would be the latest in a wave of semiconductor consolidation sweeping the industry. Run by chief executive Hock Tan, the company formerly known as Avago is one of the chip sector's most prolific acquirers, having completed a $37 billion takeover this year and changing its name to Broadcom. If the U.S.-and-Singapore-based company succeeds in buying Brocade, it would keep Brocade's fibre channel and storage business, which has roughly $1.5 billion in annual revenue, while it would aim to divest its networking business, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.Broadcom and Brocade declined to comment. While the companies are in advanced discussions, no deal is final and talks could still fall apart, the people cautioned.

84,"   By Michelle Sierra | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters LPC) - Six banks will be providing a US$6.5bn financing backing chipmaker Broadcom's acquisition of Brocade, a maker of networking switches, software and storage products, two sources familiar with the financing said.Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Bank of Montreal, Citigroup and Credit Suisse have signed on to the 364-day unsecured bridge loan, the sources said. The all-cash transaction, valued at approximately US$5.5bn, plus US$400m of debt, is the latest in a burst of merger activity in the last two weeks that will help lift U.S. investment banking fee incomes from four-year lows. The six banks will hold the loan until the bridge is replaced with permanent financing by April 2017, the expected closing of the merger, the sources said. The final capital structure will depend on the corporate ratings the company receives by then, and whether it is upgraded to investment grade.Moody’s Investors Service has Broadcom at Ba1 with a positive outlook, while S&P has the company at BB+, only one rating below investment grade.Following the acquisition, Fitch assigned a BBB- rating to Broadcom, the first investment grade ratings tier. Banks stand to earn US$25m to US$35m on the bridge, according to Freeman Consulting Services.In the last two weeks, US$66.1bn in acquisition-backing bridge loans has accumulated, according to Thomson Reuters LPC preliminary data. A dry spell in the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) arena through most of this year has sapped bank fee income.As of November 8, the US$33bn in year-to-date total U.S. investment banking fee income, which includes M&A advisory fees, equity and bond underwriting fees, as well as syndicated loan arranging fees, is down 17.5% from the same period last year and the lowest since 2012, according to Freeman Consulting.Singapore-based Broadcom, formerly Avago Technologies, said November 2 it is paying US$12.75 per share, and expects to fund the transaction with new debt financing and cash available on the balance sheet. Brocade is based in California. CHIPMAKER CONSOLIDATION The tie-up is the latest in a shrinking chip sector, and will allow Broadcom to corner a larger share of the data center products market by using Brocade's fiber channel switches that speed up data transfer between servers and storage devices, according to Reuters. The chip industry is becoming more concentrated as companies try to capture market share, much of it related to connected devices and cars, and Avago/Broadcom has been one of the sector's most prolific acquirers. Avago, a maker of semiconductors for phones, cars and the defense industry, purchased Broadcom in 2015 and adopted the target name.In the biggest chip deal ever, smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Inc announced October 27 it would buy NXP Semiconductors NV for about US$38bn, making it the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chips market, Reuters reported.BAML, Citi, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
