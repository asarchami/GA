Haniel declined to comment.""A thought that has surfaced is that McKesson could pay Haniel a slightly lower price for its 50 percent stake and offer a premium to other shareholders,"" one of the sources said.Haniel, a family-owned conglomerate which traces its roots back to the 18th century, has been shedding assets to pay down its net debt, which stood at 1.6 billion euros at end-September 2013, and to offset a massive writedown on its holding in German retailer Metro (MEOG.DE) in 2012. Elliott has 25.16 percent of the voting rights in Celesio but when shares from Celesio's two convertible bonds are taken into account, the investor's voting stake is 22.7 percent, below the 25 percent it would technically need to block the deal.However, some funds, which track share indexes, cannot tender their shares before completion of the deal and usually another small percentage of a company's shares are held in accounts, whose owners do not tender.San Francisco-based McKesson was not immediately available for comment outside business hours.

4,"   By Alexander Hübner and Ludwig Burger | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT U.S. drugs wholesaler McKesson (MCK.N) raised its offer for German peer Celesio (CLSGn.DE) to about 6.2 billion euros ($8.4 billion) including debt, mollifying an activist hedge fund that had been blocking the deal.McKesson increased its bid to 23.50 euros per Celesio share from the 23 euros it offered in October, the San Francisco-based company said on Thursday.The U.S. firm is seeking to forge a global leader in drugs distribution to boost its bargaining power with big pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis NOVN.VX and Teva (TEVA.TA), in what could be the largest health-sector takeover in Germany in eight years.McKesson, the largest U.S. drugs distributor and its closest rivals AmerisourceBergen (ABC.N) and Cardinal Health (CAH.N), who command a combined 95 percent U.S. market share, have all been looking to team up with pharmacy chains or to grow abroad.Celesio shares were trading at 24.00 euros at 1443 GMT on Thursday, just above the increased offer price, reflecting investors' speculation that the deal would go through and that McKesson would likely offer a slight premium to buy out any remaining minority shareholders after taking control.The German company has a drugs wholesale business and owns a network of pharmacies in Europe which trade under the Lloyds brand.Celesio's majority investor Franz Haniel & Cie FHANI.UL backed the original 6.1 billion euro bid. But hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, the German company's second-largest shareholder, said it was too low. Spokesmen for McKesson and Elliott declined to give a total figure for the revised offer.Based on the 0.50 euro per share increase and assuming there are about 204 million shares outstanding - including all those from Celesio's two convertible bonds - the new offer is worth at least 100 million euros more than the original.McKesson's higher offer is contingent on the U.S. firm getting at least 75 percent of Celesio's shares, including those from bonds that convert to shares. Its agreement with Elliott gets McKesson closer to reaching that goal by the deadline of midnight on Thursday.Elliott, run by U.S. investor Paul Singer, said it has agreed to sell shares equivalent to at least 13 percent of Celesio's equity capital, taking into account the dilutive effect of the convertible bonds. Overall, convertible bonds would account for 16.7 percent of the company's share capital if they were all converted.The hedge fund also offered to sell all 4,866 convertible bonds it holds in Celesio, provided that the 75 percent threshold is reached. An Elliott spokesman declined to say how many shares those bonds convert to.That means McKesson still needs smaller Celesio shareholders to tender their stock for the deal to go through.Elliott, which could still hold a stake in Celesio even if the deal succeeds, could then as a minority shareholder press MckKesson for an even higher price. McKesson said it would pay Haniel 23.50 euros a share for its 50.01 percent stake.Elliott spent roughly 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) on close to a quarter of Celesio's shares after McKesson made its initial offer and then rejected it as too low.Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that McKesson was looking at concessions to get the deal done.The new offer would value Celesio including its debt at about 11 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2013, broadly in line with the multiple its U.S. suitor is trading at.That compares with a multiple of about 11 times EBITDA that U.S. drugstore chain Walgreens WAG.N paid for a stake in Alliance Boots in 2012.($1 = 0.7353 euros)(Additional reporting by Frank Siebelt; Editing by Erica Billingham)",2014-01-09,MCK,"Thu Jan 9, 2014 | 11:34am EST",McKesson raises bid to salvage $8.4 billion Celesio deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-celesio-mckesson-idUSBREA080YI20140109?type=companyNews

People familiar with the matter said the fund had pledged all its 22.7-percent stake in Europe's market leader to the bid.McKesson, the biggest U.S. drugs distributor, said on Tuesday it fell less than 3 percent short of its condition of 75 percent of shares being pledged to its 23.50-euro offer. Its chief executive had said on Monday after the failure of the bid that it would move on to build its business in other ways.Celesio and Haniel, a German family holding company that owns 50.01 percent of it, voiced regret that the bid had failed on Monday but said the firm would pursue its own development.However, analysts and investors said that, with the shortfall in acceptances so narrow and a trend in place across the sector toward consolidation, a further bid for Celesio from McKesson seemed a strong possibility - encouraging speculators to build up short-term stakes in the Stuttgart-based firm.""We believe it is possible McKesson may look to launch another bid for Celesio,"" Jefferies analyst James Vane-Tempest wrote in a note to investors.""Our 19-euro price target reflects the rerating of the market as well as an element of a bid premium, as we see the possibility for renewed interest in Celesio by McKesson.""Cowen analysts said: ""While we don't think (McKesson) 'needs' Celesio to be successful ... we think given the direction the market is moving with the creation of larger purchasing entities, it is more likely than not (McKesson) will want to participate at that level as well.""

McKesson's 75-percent threshold for completing its offer was based on an assumption that all outstanding convertible bonds would become shares, diluting existing holdings. Conversion would dilute Haniel's total stake to 41.8 percent.Adding that to the fully diluted 22.7 percent held by Elliott, McKesson had secured close to 65 percent of Celesio, while further pledges from other shareholders brought the level of acceptances by the deadline to 72.33 percent, McKesson said.Some investors may now be encouraged to amass a stake large enough to dangle in front of McKesson to clinch a deal - though convertible bond holders may demand more than the equivalent of 23.50 euros a share, given talk of Elliott getting a mark-up.For now, McKesson Chief Executive John Hammergren has said his strategy may not include Celesio: ""Although we remain optimistic that we will continue to find ways to add value to our company through capital deployment and continued scale, it is not clear to us that Celesio will be part of that,"" he said on Monday.Shares in San Francisco-based McKesson, which ended last week at $175.44, have also suffered.

Haniel's previous attempt crumbled this month, when McKesson failed to reach the 75 percent shareholder acceptance it had set as a condition for a Celesio takeover, even after agreeing to Elliott's demands for a sweetened bid.The sources said that the price being discussed is 23.50 euros per share, the same as last month's bid, but it is unclear how much is being offered for Elliott's Celesio bonds, which convert to shares in the drug distribution company. It remains uncertain whether Haniel is offering to buy Elliott's stake directly or is acting as an intermediary on behalf of McKesson.Haniel, Elliott and Celesio all declined to comment. A McKesson spokesman was not immediately available to comment.As part of McKesson's initial bid, worth about 6.2 billion euros ($8.4 billion) including debt, the U.S. company's acceptance threshold also took into account shares from Celesio's convertible bonds. Regulatory filings have shown that at Jan. 13 Elliott held shares and convertibles equivalent to 26.7 percent of Celesio's fully diluted equity capital. On the same basis, Haniel held a 41.8 percent stake.That meant that their combined holding at the time was 6.5 percent short of McKesson's 75 percent hurdle. When shares alone are taken into account, Elliot held 24.08 percent and Haniel 50.01 percent.McKesson wants to acquire Celesio to further its push to become a global leader in drugs distribution, boosting its bargaining power with big pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis and Teva.Haniel, meanwhile, has been shedding assets to offset a massive 2012 writedown on its holding in German retailer Metro  and reduce a debt burden that stood at 1.6 billion euros ($2.17 billion) at Sept. 31.

23,"  * McKesson takeover bid succeeds at second attempt* Elliott vows to abstain from further disruption - source* Shares reach 3-1/2 year high as buyers bank on premium* Minority investors eye perks from domination agreement   (Recasts with source, analyst comments, updates shares)By Arno Schuetze and Ludwig BurgerFRANKFURT, Jan 24 Hedge fund Elliott has called an end to its fight with McKesson over the drugs distributor's acquisition of German peer Celesio, selling its shares and vowing not to disrupt the deal further, a source familiar with the transaction said.Elliott, led by U.S. investor Paul Singer, sold its stake to Celesio's largest shareholder Haniel, which then tendered a combined stake of more than 75 percent of Celesio shares to McKesson, including those from bonds that convert into shares.McKesson is buying Celesio as part of its drive to become a global leader in drugs distribution and boost its bargaining power with pharmaceutical firms such as Novartis and Teva. A previous bid foundered after failing to secure the 75 percent shareholder support it had set as a condition.Celesio's new owner said it would now enter into a so-called domination and profit-and-loss transfer agreement with the German business, which will allow it to take full control and gain access to its cash flows. As part of the procedure, McKesson will have to compensate minority shareholders forced to relinquish their holdings by the domination agreement.A source familiar with the matter said Elliott accepted the transaction and would not join any move by minority investors to seek a higher price for any remaining shares and bonds - a strategy it employed during the takeover of German cable firm Kabel Deutschland.Elliott declined to comment, while officials at McKesson were not immediately available for comment.Elliott, which invested more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in Celesio shares and convertible bonds   over the course of the drawn-out takeover process, had pressed McKesson to hike its offer. McKesson gave way on Jan. 9 and bumped up its bid by 50 cents to 23.50 euros a share.Sources familiar with the transaction said Elliott, which bought the shares at an average price of 23 euros apiece, made the bulk of its profit from its convertible bond holdings rather than from selling its shares.McKesson declined to comment on the price it paid for the bonds held by Elliott. But it will have to disclose that at later stage, the source familiar with the transaction said.""Given the huge size of Elliott's bet it's hardly conceivable that they did all this for (a return of) just 2 percent,"" a hedge fund manager holding a sizeable stake of Celesio convertible bonds said, referring to the profit Elliott would have made on the shares. McKesson said it was launching a new offer with the same 23.50 euro price to the remaining Celesio shareholders without setting a minimum acceptance threshold. The offer documents are expected to be published over the next 10 days.However, Celesio shares on Friday traded 7 percent above McKesson's offer price, indicating that buyers are holding out for a premium because the U.S. company is seeking 100 percent ownership.""The current price level is appropriate, even though the premium on the 23.50 may appear excessive,"" Equinet Bank analyst Konrad Lieder said.Lieder said the price was justified by the likely compensation McKesson would have to pay remaining shareholders.""If the share price stays where it is, it looks like 25 percent of the registered capital is playing the back-end,"" a Celesio shareholder said, referring to the strategy of holding out for higher compensation.($1 = 0.7307 euros)   (Additional reporting by Alexander Hübner and Frank Siebelt; Editing by Philipp Halstrick and Mark Potter)",2014-01-24,MCK,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 11:50am EST",UPDATE 2-Elliott buries hatchet with McKesson over Celesio,http://www.reuters.com//article/mckesson-celesio-idUSL5N0KY1CD20140124?type=companyNews
24,"  Jan 30 U.S. pharmaceutical wholesaler McKesson Corp, which last week reached a deal to acquire Germany's Celesio AG, reported on Thursday a lower quarterly profit and trimmed its full-year outlook, citing higher taxes and one-time charges.For its full fiscal year ending March 31, McKesson said it expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of  $8.05 to $8.20 per share, down from a previous estimate of $8.40 to $8.70 per share.The revision was driven by an expected tax rate of 36.5 percent, up from a previous estimate of 31 percent, due to a dispute with Canadian tax authorities and a change in business mix, as well as a technology-related charge, McKesson Chief Financial Officer James Beer said on a conference call.For its fiscal third quarter, ended Dec. 31, McKesson posted a net profit of $64 million, or 28 cents per share, compared with $298 million, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier. McKesson reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.45, but excluding 70 cents in one-time charges, the company earned $2.15, which beat analysts' average estimate of $1.84, according to JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill.Revenue rose 10 percent to $34.3 billion. With the Celesio buyout, valued at about $8.5 billion including debt, McKesson aims to advance its push to become a global leader in drugs distribution. The deal was secured after the U.S. company reached agreements with two shareholders controlling about 75 percent of Celesio shares.McKesson said it expects to acquire enough of the remaining shares in Celesio to achieve operational control toward the end of the first half of its fiscal 2015. Chief Executive Officer John Hammergren said the combined company would have revenue of over $150 billion, 81,000 employees, operations in 20 countries and would deliver to over 120,000 hospitals and pharmacy locations on a daily basis.Shares of McKesson, which rose 2 percent to close at $177.23 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, were up 21 cents at $177.44 after hours.",2014-01-30,MCK,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 6:49pm EST","UPDATE 1-McKesson trims full-year outlook, cites taxes, charges",http://www.reuters.com//article/mckesson-results-idUSL2N0L42HG20140130?type=companyNews

27,"  FRANKFURT Jan 30 Hedge fund Elliott has made a return of about 13 percent on the bonds and shares it bought in Celesio, the German drug distributor being taken over by U.S rival McKesson, according to estimates by an analyst at Market Securities.After a fierce standoff, Elliott last week called an end to its fight with McKesson over Celesio.Though McKesson hiked its offer price for Celesio shares by just 2.1 percent and Elliott bought most of its stake at or above the original offer price of 23 euros a share, the hedge fund made the bulk of its profit from selling the convertible bonds, a person familiar with the transaction said.According to a regulatory filing, Elliott received 71,428 euros ($97,500) per 2014 convertible bond, and 162,473 euros per 2018 convertible bond.""We estimate the see-through price is about 30 euros, so they made about 165 million euros altogether on their convertible holding,"" said Timothee de Mierry from brokerage Market Securities said on Thursday, referring to the equivalent price per share. Elliott, led by U.S. investor Paul Singer, invested more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in Celesio shares and convertible bonds over the course of the drawn-out takeover process. Based on the analyst's assumption, the hedge fund made a total of roughly 13 percent on its investment.That would be in line with the average annual return of 14 percent that Elliott has booked on its investments in the past. Elliott declined to comment.According to the filing, Elliott has vowed not to disrupt the deal any further and to refrain from buying any Celesio and McKesson securities or to oppose their boards for a period of five years. While other minority shareholders in Celesio may seek a higher price for any remaining shares and bonds at a later stage, the agreement means Elliott will not do so.Elliott has sued for higher compensation as a minority shareholder in takeovers in the past - a strategy dubbed ""playing the back end.""

28,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the long-term ratings  of McKesson Corp. (NYSE: MCK), including the long-term Issuer Default Rating  (IDR), to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.  A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The rating actions follow the close of MCK's agreements with Franz Haniel & Cie  GmbH (Haniel) and Elliott Fund Management (Elliott) to acquire the firms'  respective stock and convertible bond holdings of Celesio AG (Celesio). These  transactions are valued at approximately EUR3.7 billion (US$5.1 billion). KEY RATING DRIVERS -- MCK's acquisition of Celesio is strategically sound, though moderate event  risk remains as to the subsequent steps in the acquisition process.  Increased  scale from the deal will allow MCK to drive cost savings, particularly related  to generic drug sourcing, and future growth.  -- Fitch expects MCK's post-deal capital structure to include a materially  increased amount of long-term debt. Pro forma debt-to-EBITDA could exceed 2.5x,  but MCK's strong cash generating ability should allow for de-leveraging to  around 2x by fiscal year-end 2016. Liquidity is expected to remain strong. -- U.S. drug distributors maintain exceptionally stable operating profiles and  consistent and strong cash generation, owing to steady pharmaceutical demand and  generally oligopolistic markets. Margins and cash flows continue to benefit from  the mostly durable effects of the unprecedented generic wave, which is set to  ramp up again in calendar 2014. -- Fitch sees the European drug channel as somewhat less stable and efficient,  and generally higher risk, than the U.S. market due to increased competitive/regulatory pressures. MCK's acquisition of Celesio adds incremental  but manageable business risk related to operating a new business line (retail  pharmacy) and engaging new geographies (Europe, Brazil). -- MCK holds top U.S. market positions in specialty drug distribution,  medical-surgical distribution, and healthcare IT, as well as drug distribution  in Canada. These businesses will support intermediate-term growth and  profitability and, in addition to measured expansion in other non-U.S. markets,  are likely to represent areas in which MCK will pursue future growth  opportunities. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of a 'BBB+' IDR will require MCK to direct sufficient cash flows  toward debt repayment such that debt-to-EBITDA of 2x or below is achieved over  the next 24-30 months. Long-term funding plans have not been made available, but  Fitch expects MCK's significant cash generating ability, enhanced by the  addition of Celesio in the intermediate term, to be sufficient to achieve this  target. Fitch forecasts cumulative free cash flow (FCF; cash from operations  minus capital expenditures minus dividends) to exceed $4.5 billion in fiscal  2015-2016 for the combined firm. Ratings flexibility will be limited during the de-leveraging timeframe.  Significant M&A activity or the resumption of large-scale share repurchases in  the next 2-3 years could contribute to downward ratings pressure, to the extent  that such actions restrict MCK's ability to repay debt maturities as they come  due. The addition of more long-term debt than currently expected could also  pressure the 'BBB+' ratings. A positive rating action is not anticipated in the near-to-intermediate term. The Negative Outlook represents the large amount of de-leveraging necessary to  support the 'BBB+' ratings, plus uncertainty related to the longer-term  post-deal capital structure. Furthermore, some event risk remains surrounding  future acquisition-related transactions and processes. Significant setbacks in  any of these areas requiring the use of material amounts cash or external  financing could contribute to negative ratings pressure. CELESIO DEAL IS STRATEGICALLY SOUND; LIMITED NEAR-TERM FINANCIAL BENEFITS Fitch views the acquisition of Celesio by MCK as strategically sound, as it  offers the potential for better buy-side drug pricing and additional growth  opportunities outside the largely penetrated U.S. market. The realization of  these benefits, however, is likely to take several years. Fitch sees relatively  few financial synergies in the near term. The combination of MCK and Celesio is differentiated from the scale-plays  engaged by other drug channel participants. Both of MCK's competitors,  AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal), have entered  into drug purchasing joint ventures with other drug channel participants - ABC  with Walgreen Co. and Alliance Boots GmbH, and Cardinal with CVS Caremark Corp.  Thus, these firms must share the benefits of increased scale, namely buy-side  cost savings on the purchase of generic drugs. Conversely, MCK will retain all  the benefit of expected cost savings, but will also bear fully the risks  associated therewith. The overall relative benefits of these differing  globalization/scale-enhancing schemes cannot yet be ascertained and will take  some time to be fully realized. STABLE OPERATIONS IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE MCK and its peers in the drug distribution industry continue to exhibit  exceptionally stable operations and financial performance. Despite still weak  macroeconomic conditions and moderately decreased utilization of healthcare in  the U.S., core business growth at MCK has remained largely in-step with or ahead  of broader market growth. Organic long-range growth in the low-single digits is  driven by consistent demand for pharmaceuticals and is realized relatively  uniformly, given the largely oligopolistic market.  Fitch expects the U.S. drug distribution industry to maintain good operating  stability. The industry's very slim margins make it an unlikely target for extra  taxes and fees (like those recently imposed on the pharma and medical device  sectors in the U.S.). Distributors excel in adding value to the drug channel  through the supply chain management and other services they offer to both  upstream and downstream customers. The Celesio transaction will provide MCK with significant new exposure to the  European drug distribution and pharmacy markets. Fitch sees the European drug  channel as relatively less stable and efficient than that found in the U.S.  Furthermore, Fitch believes risks related to drug pricing and reimbursement are  greater for drug channel participants in Europe than in the U.S., especially  given that regulatory and reimbursement constructs generally vary from country  to country. The opportunity for increasing generic penetration in most markets  could provide upside, however, over the ratings horizon. A FEW MORE YEARS OF THE UNPRECEDENTED GENERIC WAVE MCK and its peers - both in the U.S. and in Europe - continue to benefit from  the unprecedented wave of branded drug patent expirations in calendar 2012-2014.  Most drug channel participants, including distributors, earn higher margins -  though less revenues - on the sale of lower-cost generic drugs. Fitch believes  much of the margin expansion MCK and its peers have achieved in recent years is  durable. Further margin growth is expected to benefit from the introduction of  biosimilars to the U.S. drug channel, as well as from new branded biologic  drugs, as the pace of traditional branded-to-generic conversions slows  post-2015. Fitch believes biosimilars could represent an even more compelling  margin expansion opportunity for drug distributors than traditional generics in  the intermediate-to-longer term. SOLID PRESENCE IN SPECIALTY, MED-SURG, AND HIT Traditional drug distribution in the U.S. is a consolidated industry  characterized by steady growth in the low-single digits. Traditional drug  distribution accounts for roughly 80% of MCK's overall revenues. The remaining  20% comes from the company's leading market positions in the distribution of  specialty pharmaceuticals and of med-surg supplies, and in healthcare  information technology (HIT). MCK is one of only a handful of companies with a  significant share of these relatively fragmented markets. As a result, Fitch believes MCK is uniquely positioned to benefit from growth  opportunities related to its ancillary businesses as those markets grow and  consolidate over time. To that end, Fitch expects MCK to continue consummating  small, tuck-in acquisitions in especially the med-surg and HIT spaces.  ROBUST CASH FLOWS AND SOLID LIQUIDITY  MCK's stable margins, efficient operations, and good asset management contribute  to stable and strong cash generation measures. Funds from operations (FFO) and  FCF for the latest 12 months (LTM) period ended Dec. 31, 2013 were $3.1 billion  and $2 billion, respectively. The firm's solid liquidity position also includes  a $1.3 billion unsecured revolver due September 2016 and a $1.35 billion  accounts receivable facility due November 2014. Cash on hand as of Dec. 31, 2013  was $2.4 billion ($1.5 billion held outside the U.S.).  Debt maturities are estimated as follows: $350 million for the remainder of  fiscal 2014; $1.1 billion in 2016; $980 million in 2017 (including EUR 350  million of Celesio bonds); $1.2 billion in 2018 (including EUR 500 million of  Celesio bonds), and $2.4 billion thereafter.  Fitch has downgraded the following ratings of MCK: -- Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; -- Unsecured bank facility to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; -- Unsecured senior notes to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings of MCK: -- Short-term IDR at 'F2';  -- Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

34,"  * Magnetar says minority Celesio shareholders short changed* Says also to sue over terms of domination agreement   (Adds details on lawsuit, background on deal)FRANKFURT May 21 Hedge fund Magnetar Capital is suing U.S. drugs wholesaler McKesson, saying its acquisition of German peer Celesio short-changed minority shareholders and bondholders by around 370 million euros ($507 million).McKesson structured the transaction in an unlawful way, discriminating against the minority investors, Magnetar said in a statement on Wednesday.McKesson's bid for Celesio succeeded following drawn-out negotiations with another Celesio shareholder, activist hedge fund Elliott International, led by U.S. investor Paul Singer.Elliott, which had invested more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in Celesio shares and bonds that convert into shares, ended up selling all those securities to McKesson. Magnetar, which holds more than 3 percent in Celesio's shares, accuses McKesson of paying convertible bond holders such as Elliott an equivalent of up to 30.95 euros per underlying share, while owners of Celesio stock were only offered 23.50 euros a share.Sources familiar with the transaction have said in the past that Elliott, which bought Celesio shares at an average price of 23 euros apiece, made the bulk of its profit from its convertible bond holdings rather than from selling its shares.""Under the German minimum price protections, McKesson should have offered to pay over 370 million euros ($507 million) of additional consideration to minority shareholders and bondholders of Celesio,"" Magnetar said. McKesson bought Celesio as part of its drive to become a global leader in drugs distribution and boost its bargaining power with pharmaceutical firms such as Novartis and Teva.An initial bid foundered after failing to secure the 75 percent shareholder support it had set as a condition.The second attempt succeeded and McKesson earlier this month started consultations with Celesio's board on a so-called domination and profit transfer agreement, which will allow the U.S. group to take full control and tap the German company's cash flows. As part of this deal, McKesson plans to offer investors which did not tender their shares 22.99 euros a share.Minority investors that stay on board after a takeover bid has succeeded typically reject such offers and seek a mark-up on the offer in court. Some hedge funds specialise in this strategy, dubbed ""playing the back end"".Magnetar also said it would file a separate lawsuit in a bid to get the terms of the planned domination agreement revised.McKesson and Celesio declined to comment.($1 = 0.7302 Euros)   (Reporting by Arno Schuetze and Ludwig Burger; Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-05-21,MCK,"Wed May 21, 2014 | 9:59am EDT",UPDATE 1-Hedge fund sues McKesson for $500 mln over Celesio deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/celesio-mckesson-hedgefund-idUSL6N0O734T20140521?type=companyNews

41,"  (Adds details from earnings conference call, background)By Nandita Bose and Shailaja SharmaApril 8 Rite Aid Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, and expected a renewed distribution agreement with McKesson Corp  along with the remodeling of its wellness stores to benefit fiscal 2016 earnings.The drugstore chain operator forecast a full-year profit of 19 cents to 27 cents per share and sales of $26.9 billion to $27.4 billion, with same-store sales expected to rise 2.5-4.5 percent.Rite Aid said its outlook accounts for planned wage and benefit increases, the introduction of certain new generics and a reimbursement rate environment which will remain challenging this year.Rite Aid is the No. 3 drugstore chain by sales in the U.S. behind Walgreen Boots Alliance and CVS Health Corp . The chain has tweaked and expanded its business model as the pharmacy and drugstore industry expands into the health and wellness sector. Last year, Rite Aid signed an expanded five-year pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution agreement for both branded and generic drugs with Mckesson, which extends through March 2019.For the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28, Rite Aid said strong prescription sales drove up same-store sales, which rose 4.5 percent, higher than a 3.6 percent rise estimated by research firm Consensus Metrix.Rite Aid, which sells over-the-counter drugs, personal care items and food and beverages, said total revenue rose 3.8 percent to $6.85 billion, with prescription drug sales accounting for about 68 percent of Rite Aid's total drugstore sales. The number of prescriptions filled in same-stores rose 3.5 percent from a year earlier.The drugstore chain's net income rose to $1.84 billion, or $1.79 per share, from $55.4 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included an income tax benefit of $1.72 billion, or $1.67 per share.Excluding the income tax benefit, Rite Aid earned 12 cents per share.Analysts had expected a profit of 7 cents per share on revenue of $6.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said for fiscal 2016, it expects cash tax payments to remain in a range of $10 million to $20 million.Rite Aid's shares were up 1.26 percent at $8.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.

46,"  (Adds Saunders interview)By Caroline HumerNEW YORK, July 27 Allergan plc CEO Brent Saunders is ready to put the $36 billion his company will net from the sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd to work, possibly with another large, ""transformational"" merger.The readiness for a new transaction just after the Teva deal was announced on Monday represents what Saunders calls a strategy to remain nimble and open to opportunity as the healthcare sector remakes itself.Saunders has already shown a penchant for quick deal-making. Just last year, he helped orchestrate the $25 billion sale of Forest Laboratories Inc, where he was CEO, to Actavis Plc.As head of Actavis, he then sealed a $66 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan, beating out rival suitor Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its acquisition partner, hedge fund billionaire William Ackman.The latest deal had just closed in March and Saunders was busy integrating the two companies under the Allergan name. At the time, he did not consider unloading the generics assets of Actavis.""While I had a different strategy a few months ago, the thing that sets us apart ... is our strategy to be nimble,"" Saunders said in an interview. Saunders now plans to use the proceeds from its $40.5 billion asset sale to Teva to increase the size of existing drug businesses, expand into new therapy areas and pursue larger deals.He declined to discuss any specific targets, a list Wall Street that analysts speculated may include Biogen Inc, AbbVie Inc and Amgen Inc.""Clearly we are watching many companies - we have been for some time - but what has changed is our timeline for being able to execute has accelerated, if the opportunity presents itself,"" Saunders said.The $40.5 billion cash-and-stock sale of generic drugs business to Teva is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. That will essentially ""reload"" Allergan's balance sheet for more acquisitions, Saunders added. When asked if Allergan planned to spend the cash within 18 months, he replied that the company would, as long as it could maintain its investment-grade credit rating.CONSOLIDATION AHEAD Saunders said his change of direction for Allergan came only a few weeks ago when Teva CEO Erez Vigodman called to make an offer. Vigodman had already approached Actavis earlier in the year, but the company was not interested at that time. ""To be fair, I didn't think it was a good idea to sell it until Erez called me and put a compelling offer on the table,"" Saunders said. ""It caused me to step back and think about the industry and the dynamics.""The healthcare industry has consolidated in the past year, with pharmacies and distributors aligning through merger deals or purchasing agreements that give them more leverage over prices for generic drugs.These deals, such as CVS Health's purchases of Target Corp's pharmacies and the Omnicare specialty pharmacies and distributor McKesson Corp's purchasing agreement with pharmacy Rite Aid Corp, will force more consolidation among generics makers so they can compete, Saunders said.Two of the largest U.S. health insurers - Humana Inc  and Cigna Corp - have also agreed to be bought in the past month, signaling fresh pressure on prices, Saunders said.Of the seven main therapeutic areas that Allergan will focus on after the generics sale, he said there are four with the strongest opportunities in terms of unmet medical care: aesthetics, eye care, central nervous system therapies and gastrointestinal therapies.Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Asset Management, which owns Allergan shares, said Saunders should look for something with a reasonable risk versus reward profile.""If it were my $40 billion, I would probably do four or five deals in the $10 billion range, aiming for late-stage drug programs where you have some idea if the drug works,"" Funtleyder said. If two of those deals panned out, ""that would be a good use of capital.""

51,"   By Siddharth Cavale and Ankur Banerjee  With a lucrative supply deal hanging in the balance, drug distributor McKesson Corp (MCK.N) moved to reassure investors on Thursday by announcing its retention of a contract with Omnicare, a supplier of prescription medicines to nursing homes.The company's shares rose 2 percent after it also raised its profit forecast and announced a $2 billion share buyback.McKesson sources and distributes drugs for Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), the drugstore chain that agreed this week to be bought by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O).That deal calls into question its long-standing contract with Rite Aid, because Walgreens sources its drugs from a rival distributor, AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N).

52,"   By Siddharth Cavale and Ankur Banerjee  Oct 29 With a lucrative supply deal hanging in the balance, drug distributor McKesson Corp moved to reassure investors on Thursday by announcing its retention of a contract with Omnicare, a supplier of prescription medicines to nursing homes.The company's shares rose 2 percent after it also raised its profit forecast and announced a $2 billion share buyback.McKesson sources and distributes drugs for Rite Aid Corp , the drugstore chain that agreed this week to be bought by Walgreens Boots Alliance.That deal calls into question its long-standing contract with Rite Aid, because Walgreens sources its drugs from a rival distributor, AmerisourceBergen Corp.

64,"   By Natalie Grover  U.S. drug distributor McKesson Corp (MCK.N) said it would buy drugstore chain Rexall Health from Katz Group for C$3 billion ($2.23 billion) to strengthen its position in Canada's pharmaceutical supply chain.The deal will give McKesson access to about 470 retail pharmacies, and help leverage its existing assets in the country, particularly in Ontario and Western Canada, the companies said.This is the second acquisition announced by San Francisco-based McKesson in recent weeks. Late last month, it announced its plan to buy two privately held cancer care service providers for about $1.2 billion, to add muscle to its specialty health business.The more than 150-year old McKesson, which also distributes drugs to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), in January said its fiscal 2017 earnings would likely be hit by weak generic drug pricing and narrowed its profit forecast for 2016.McKesson's lucrative supply deal with Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) hangs in the balance after the drugstore chain Rite Aid agreed in October to be bought by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O). Walgreens sources its drugs from rival distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N).Analysts have estimated that the Rite Aid contract is worth between $15 billion to $25 billion a year for McKesson, accounting for up to 15 percent of its annual revenue.     Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen said he had greater confidence that McKesson would come in at the high end of its fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and that these acquisitions would help offset the likely roll-off of the Rite Aid contract in fiscal 2018.The Rexall Health acquisition, which will be funded by a mix of cash and debt, is expected to close later this year and should modestly add to McKesson's adjusted earnings in fiscal 2017.McKesson shares were up about 3 percent at $161.14 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

73,"   By Nathan Layne  Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said on Monday that it was expanding joint procurement of generic drugs with U.S. drug distributor McKesson (MCK.N) to lower costs as it battles drug inflation and other pressures on its pharmacy business margins.Wal-Mart, which has been sourcing generics with McKesson for several years, has been looking to strengthen its health-related business as well as cut costs in its pharmacy operations, which emerged as a significant drag on earnings last year.The deal is aimed at ""using our combined size and scale to drive efficiencies,"" George Riedl, senior vice president and president of the health and wellness division at Wal-Mart in the United States, said in a statement.For McKesson, the deal, which includes expanding a long-term distribution agreement, means a bigger role in sourcing most of the 6,000-plus generic drugs sold by Wal-Mart in the United States. Shares of McKesson rose 4.1 percent to $172.80 on the news.  Wal-Mart said in August that margins in its pharmacy business were being pinched by reduced reimbursement rates from drug plan administers as well as fewer people paying in cash, significant because cash transactions fetch higher margins.In October, Greg Foran, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. operations, told investors that the company was working on several measures to ""help offset some of the reimbursement pressures that we are seeing and we expect to see in the foreseeable future."" While Wal-Mart expects the McKesson deal to boost its buying power, it does not see it leading to lower prices for consumers. That is partly due to inflation, with U.S. prescription drug prices overall rising 10.4 percent in 2015 and generics up 2.9 percent, according to healthcare research firm Truveris.""While we don’t foresee a change in the pricing of generic drugs, we will be able to be more efficient, remain a competitive force in the pharmacy space, and continue to ultimately lower the cost of healthcare,"" Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said. Since 2006, Wal-Mart has offered customers a 30-day prescription for more than 200 generic drugs for $4. It does not expect that offering, including the price, to change as a result of the expanded alliance with McKesson.Wal-Mart was the third-biggest bricks-and-mortar U.S. pharmacy in 2015 with $19.9 billion in prescription sales, according to Pembroke Consulting.

82,"   By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis  McKesson Corp (MCK.N), one of the largest U.S. drug distributors, has held talks about merging its information technology unit with healthcare technology company Change Healthcare Inc, three people familiar with the matter said. A combination of McKesson's IT unit with Change Healthcare would create one of the biggest players in the healthcare information technology sector, potentially worth more than $10 billion, including debt, the people said this week.McKesson has explored separating its healthcare IT unit, called Technology Solutions, and combining it with other companies in the sector, the people said. There is no certainty that a combination with Change Healthcare, or that any transaction involving Technology Solutions, will occur, the people added.McKesson and Change Healthcare declined to comment. For New York-based McKesson, a deal for Technology Solutions would be a continuation of its ongoing strategy of shedding assets that are not core to its pharmaceutical distribution business. Last year, McKesson sold its care management unit to investment firm Comvest Partners for an undisclosed sum.  In the past year, several household name companies, including Hewlett-Packard Co and Xerox Corp (XRX.N), have cleaved off large portions of their businesses in an effort to unlock shareholder value. In the healthcare sector, drugmaker Baxter International (BAX.N) spun off its rare diseases unit Baxalta, and pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc carved out its animal health unit Zoetis Inc (ZTS.N). In 1999, McKesson entered the healthcare technology space  by purchasing a large tech company, HBO & Co, for $14.5 billion.  Shortly after the deal, auditors discovered that HBO & Co had been fraudulently boosting sales, eventually leading to a shareholder lawsuit that cost McKesson nearly $1 billion. McKesson's technology solutions business also consists of RelayHealth, a provider of online physician communication services that McKesson purchased for an undisclosed sum in 2006.  It is now seen as being worth around $2 billion, and is widely considered to have significant potential to ramp up future revenues, some of the people said. Nashville, Tennessee-based Change Healthcare, formerly known as Emdeon, provides revenue cycle management and other information technology tools to hospitals and doctors' offices.Change Healthcare is majority owned by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), which took the company private for $3 billion in 2011.
