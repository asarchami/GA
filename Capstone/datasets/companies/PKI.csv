0,"  By Bill BerkrotJan 30 Scientific instruments maker PerkinElmer Inc on Thursday forecast full-year earnings in line with current Wall Street estimates and its CEO sees a rosier 2014 after a year filled with uncertainty in the markets it serves.The company, which also sells medical diagnostic equipment, such as for prenatal screening, and environmental testing products, sees full-year earnings of $2.40 to $2.45 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average are looking for $2.42 per share.""We are feeling more optimistic as we think about 2014,"" Chief Executive Robert Friel told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""The diagnostics, research and environmental markets all appear to be in a better position this year versus the same time last year.""At this time last year, U.S. budget battles and automatic spending cuts known as sequestration hit academic research hard. This year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget has been set. ""They now have some certainty with regard to funding,"" Friel said of people running laboratories and research facilities. ""The U.S. appears to be recovering from a capital expenditure perspective.""Friel also said he is seeing improving conditions in the major markets of Europe, with the exception of France, and said PerkinElmer has not been feeling the pinch from slowing economic conditions in China that have impacted other industries of late. ""While the macro economy may be slowing a little bit, China specifically and the emerging markets more broadly continue to invest fairly significantly in environmental and in healthcare, so we're not seeing any slowdown,"" he said. ""We didn't see it in Q4 and we don't see it in early indications in Q1.""Friel said percentage sales growth in China in the fourth quarter continued to be in the ""low teens.""Excluding special items, the company reported adjusted fourth quarter earnings of 73 cents per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. PerkinElmer posted a net profit of $64.5 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $15.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year ago, when results were hit by an accounting adjustment related to pension liability.Revenue of $593.3 million topped Wall Street estimates of $589.1 million.In addition to an improving economic picture, Friel pinned some of his optimism for 2014 on moves the company made throughout 2013.""We did a lot on the productivity side where we did some consolidation of facilities, we moved some of our production into lower-cost areas and we've made a number of investments into new products,"" Friel said. ""That's an area we're particularly excited about going into 2014.""",2014-01-30,PKI,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 5:18pm EST",UPDATE 1-PerkinElmer optimistic about 2014; EPS forecast in line,http://www.reuters.com//article/perkinelmer-results-idUSL2N0L428020140130?type=companyNews

The company in February forecast full-year adjusted earnings of $2.65 to $2.75 per share, leading analysts to lower their estimates on average by 11 cents to $2.71.""We feel generally better about the end markets and therefore more confident in our ability to forecast a much stronger bottom line,"" PerkinElmer Chief Executive Robert Friel said in a telephone interview.The 10-cent increase to the forecast range was ""made up of about 6 cents from the operational strength we saw in the first quarter and about 4 cents associated with the foreign exchange rate movement since a couple of months ago,"" Friel said.""We are forecasting the second quarter fairly similar to the first with 4 percent organic growth,"" Friel added. Excluding one-time items, the company, which also makes medical diagnostic and environmental and food testing products,  earned 56 cents per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company saw double-digit sales growth in its food safety testing business and in newborn and prenatal screening, with particular strength outside the United States, Friel said, adding that business had also picked up from pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. PerkinElmer posted a net profit $47.5 million, or 43 cents per share, compared with a profit of $40.3 million, or 36 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue for the quarter of $538.7 million edged past Wall Street estimates of $532.7 million. Profit and revenue had missed expectations in the prior quarter.The widespread Zika virus outbreak in South America and elsewhere impacted aspects of PerkinElmer business both negatively and positively. Newborn screening was down in South America, the CEO said, as people put off having babies over fear of severe birth defects that may be caused by Zika infection.On the flip side, ""some of our instruments are being used by researchers in Brazil and the United States to do some analysis on Zika ... to screen compounds trying to understand the disease mechanism a little better.""

19,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  PerkinElmer Inc.'s (PerkinElmer's) 10-year EUR senior notes offering. Fitch  expects that proceeds of the issue will be used for general corporate purposes,  including the repayment of amounts outstanding under the company's unsecured  revolving credit facility, which totaled $590 million at March 31, 2016. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to $1.1 billion of debt as of March 31, 2016. A full list of  rating actions follows at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --PerkinElmer has generally maintained its gross debt between 2.0x and 2.5x, and  Fitch expects this metric to remain within this range within most periods. As  has been the case historically, Fitch anticipates that gross leverage could  temporarily exceed 2.5x if the company issues incremental debt to finance  targeted acquisitions. --Adjusted EBITDA margins have recently stabilized at levels near 20%, which  represents an improvement of roughly 400 bps from levels reported in 2011. Fitch  projects that the company will be able to sustain and possibly improve upon  these levels going forward, as successful execution of restructuring initiatives  has helped offset the negative margin impact of foreign exchange (FX) rates. --Fitch anticipates low- to mid-single digit organic revenue growth in 2016 and  beyond, supported by growing demand in emerging markets and the favorable impact  of new products, which should more than offset industry headwinds that include  constrained research spending. --FCF generation has been consistently solid and should remain so for the  foreseeable future. Fitch projects annual FCF of around $250 million or more for  the next few years, benefitting from EBITDA growth, minimal required  contributions to pension plans and continued, manageable capital expenditure  (CAPEX) requirements. --Fitch believes PerkinElmer's top priority for capital use remains asset  purchasing, specifically bolt-on acquisitions designed to gain access to new  technologies or business channels. In the absence of acquisitions, Fitch  believes shareholder returns, especially opportunistic share repurchases, will  take precedence over debt reduction. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects revenues to increase from 2016 to 2019 by a CAGR of between  3%-4%, reflecting sustained but moderating FX headwinds in 2016 followed by  stronger growth later in the forecast period. --Fitch models EBITDA growth resulting from growing revenues and modest margin  expansion, benefitting from cost savings derived from recent restructuring  activities. --FCF exceeds $250 million annually, benefitting from recent completion of key  capital projects, modest pension funding requirements, and long-dated debt  maturities. --Incremental debt increases of $50 million to help fund acquisitions, resulting  in gross leverage sustained around 2.3x throughout the forecast period.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Given Fitch's September 2015 upgrade of PerkinElmer's ratings, near-term upward  ratings momentum is unlikely. Longer-term, a positive rating action could be  considered if PerkinElmer were to significantly increase its scale and further  expand the scope of products and services while maintaining gross debt leverage  below 2.0x, maintaining EBITDA margins near 20% and generating U.S.-based cash  flows that exceed annual debt servicing requirements by a comfortable margin. Downward rating action could result from heavy pressure on operations or  leveraging shareholder-friendly actions or acquisitions such that debt leverage  was expected to exceed 2.5x for 18-24 months or longer.  PerkinElmer's ratings could also be downgraded if the company's U.S.-generated  cash flows decreased to a level where its ability to internally fund annual debt  servicing requirements from domestic cash generation came into question.  Operational weakness could stem from lower-than-anticipated results due to  poorer-than-expected sales performance if the company's diversified portfolio  cannot withstand headwinds of capital expenditure constraints and tightened  global research spending.  Good Balance Sheet Flexibility  Given Fitch's outlook for low to mid-single-digit revenue growth and modest  margin expansion, the company should be able to maintain leverage within  2.0x-2.5x fairly comfortably. Gross debt leverage was 2.3x as of March 31, 2016.  Fitch expects that PerkinElmer could occasionally use debt to help fund  acquisitions of a size would cause the company's gross leverage to exceed 2.5x.  Fitch believes PerkinElmer's 'BBB' rating provides flexibility for the company  to temporarily exceed 2.5x gross leverage if the company were to demonstrate a  clear pathway to reducing leverage closer to 2.5x within 18-24 months. Restructuring Actions Support Sustained Margin Improvement Cost savings associated with numerous restructuring programs over the past  several years appear to be durable. PerkinElmer has successfully executed upon  its strategic focus on margin expansion as evidenced by EBITDA margin increasing  steadily to 20.1% for the LTM ending March 31, 2016 from 15.7% in 2011.  Improvement resulted from restructuring operations as well as a shift in product  mix toward higher margin businesses, including software services and  consumables. Looking forward, Fitch sees the potential for further margin  expansion, though at a significantly slower pace than that achieved over the  prior several years. Fitch expects near-term additional margin improvement  primarily driven by additional changes in product mix toward higher margin  products and services, rather than additional restructuring programs.  Solid Organic Growth Outlook  PerkinElmer's product offering has proved to be resilient to recent industry  headwinds that have included tightened capital expenditures in Western Europe  and a constrained research spending across much of the globe. Fitch projects  that PerkinElmer will generate compound growth in reported revenues of between  3%-4%, as global population growth and an expanding middle class in emerging  markets continue to generate increased demand for diagnostic products in the  company's Human Health business, which should benefit from increased demand for  high quality health care outside of the U.S. Demand for PerkinElmer's  Environmental Health business should be driven by growing demand for food supply  chain security and a world-wide shortage of clean water. These factors are  driving increased regulatory scrutiny and spurring demand for increased  monitoring of air, food and water quality. Strong Free Cash Flow Generation Fitch's estimates that stable EBITDA margins, manageable capital spending, a  consistent dividend and modest pension contributions will yield annual free cash  flow (FCF) in excess of $250 million annually for the next several years. Steps  taken over the past several years to fund the U.S. defined pension benefit plan  and improve operational efficiency have materially boosted cash flows versus  levels reported in 2012 and 2013. FCF totalled $217 million for the LTM as of  March 31, 2016, representing a FCF margin of 9.5%. These results reflect  significant improvement over levels of $77.9 million (3.7% FCF margin) and $88  million (4.1% FCF margin) reported in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Additional, Opportunistic Acquisitions Likely Fitch believes PerkinElmer's present highest priority for capital deployment is  asset purchasing, specifically small to moderately sized opportunities to gain  access to technology and broaden the research and product portfolios as well as  targets in adjacent markets.  PerkinElmer management has indicated publicly that it would be comfortable  operating at 2.5x gross leverage or a bit higher over the next couple of years,  which Fitch views this as a signal that PerkinElmer will occasionally use debt  to help fund targeted acquisitions, similar to its December 2014 purchase of  Perten Instruments Group AB (Perten), for $269.9 million in cash.  In the absence of attractive acquisition opportunities, Fitch believes that  shareholder returns, especially opportunistic share repurchases, will take  precedence over debt reduction.  SIMPLE MATURITY PROFILE, SOLID LIQUIDITY Available liquidity is sufficient. PerkinElmer's debt maturity is manageable and  the company's capital structure is simple, currently consisting of one unsecured  debt issuance (5% notes due in November 2021) and bank borrowings under a $700  million revolving credit facility maturing in January 2019 ($98.5 million  available as of March 31, 2015). Although PerkinElmer generally carries a  meaningful amount of cash ($211 million as of March 31, 2016), the large  majority of the cash balance is located outside the U.S. FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch currently rates PerkinElmer Inc. as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured credit facility 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'.
