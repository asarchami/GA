0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Huntington Bancshares,  Inc.'s (HBAN) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch's affirmation of and Outlook for HBAN's IDR is supported by the company's  good earnings profile, solid capital, improved funding profile and stable asset  quality performance, which is in-line with 'A-' rated regional peers. Notably,  HBAN has improved its risk profile through various actions over the last few  years. HBAN has delivered solid results with return on assets (ROA) hitting an average  of 1.13% and pre-provision net revenues (PPNR)/Average Asset averaging 1.70%  over the last five quarters despite a difficult operating environment. Further,  NIM compression has been more manageable versus peers. Fitch also believes many  of these trends are sustainable, particularly given the company's good loan  growth and stable credit performance. Over the last two years, HBAN has been focused on growing its retail deposit  base with much success reflected by the increase in non-interest bearing  deposits which accounts for 28%. Nonetheless, much like peers, Fitch expects to  experience a certain level of deposit run-offs but should be somewhat  manageable. Fitch notes that more recently the company's C&I loan growth has outpaced its  peers despite a relatively slow economic recovery. To-date, credit performance  has remained stable. Fitch remains cautious regarding C&I lending across the  industry which remains very competitive.  Additionally, Fitch notes that HBAN has a sizeable indirect auto business. Given  the CFPB's focus on the indirect auto space, Fitch believes there could be a  potential disruption to the current business model.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT HBAN's ratings are at the high-end given performance is in-line with peers.  Although not expected, should HBAN's performance fall below current levels such  as ROA and NIM or credit measures weaken, ratings would come under pressure.  Additionally, aggressive capital management would also be viewed negatively. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   HBAN's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should HBAN's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for HBAN given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that HBAN may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may  not be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  HBAN has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, HBAN is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  HBAN's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by HBAN and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from HBAN or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by HBAN and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in HBAN's VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of HBAN's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Huntington  National Bank are equalized across the group.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of HBAN to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in HBAN's IDRs.  To the extent that one of HBAN's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from HBAN's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS HBAN's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by HBAN and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in HBAN's long- and short-term IDRs.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Huntington Bancshares, Incorporated --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability rating at 'a-'; --Senior Unsecured at 'A-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock at 'BB'; --Support at '5';     --Support Floor at 'NF'. Huntington National Bank --Long-term deposits at 'A' ;  --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Viability rating at 'a-'; --Senior unsecured at 'A-' ; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Short-term deposits at 'F1'; --Support at5';      --Support Floor at 'NF'.

3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Huntington Bancshares,  Inc.'s (HBAN) ratings at 'A-/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), PNC Financial Services  Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US  Bancorp (USB), UnionBanCal Corporation (UBC), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and  Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch's affirmation and Outlook of HBAN's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is  supported by the company's solid financial profile, including good earnings  trajectory, improved funding profile and stable asset quality performance, which  is in-line with 'A-' rated large regional peers.  Fitch also believes many of these trends are sustainable, particularly given the  company's good loan growth, its recent acquisition of Macquarie Equipment  Finance which brings higher-yielding loans onto the balance sheet and stable  credit performance. Despite a challenging operating environment, HBAN earnings have been solid with  return on assets (ROA) of 1.16% for the second quarter of 2015 (2Q15) compared  to the 0.96% peer group average. Further, on average, net interest margin (NIM)  compression has been more manageable versus peers.  Over the last two years, HBAN has been focused on growing its retail deposit  base with much success reflected by the increase in non-interest bearing  deposits which accounts for 28%. Nonetheless, similarly to peers, Fitch expects  HBAN to experience a manageable level of deposit run-offs. HBAN has continued to experience loan growth that is above the peer average,  although much less than the previous year. Of note, much of the growth has come  from auto lending and acquisitions that increased C&I loans. To-date, credit  performance has remained stable. Nonetheless, Fitch remains cautious regarding  C&I lending across the industry which remains very competitive.  Additionally, HBAN has a sizeable indirect auto business, which is also an area  that has become more competitive. However, HBAN has a long, established history  of indirect auto lending with strong asset quality measures through various  credit downturns. The company has continued to originate the same borrower base  with minimal changes to its underwriting practices.     Nonetheless, Fitch believes there could be a potential disruption to the current  business model given the CFPB's focus on the indirect auto space and practices  relating to mark up pricing for dealer relationships.  Although HBAN's capital position has been trending down given acquisitions, loan  growth and its modest dividend payout ratio, Fitch considers capital levels to  be adequate given HBAN's improvements its risk profile.  Further, under the 2015  DFAST severely adverse stress scenarios, HBAN's capital position declined much  less than almost all of its peers.  Further, in terms of loan losses, HBAN had  the lowest level of estimated loan losses under the severely adverse scenario.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  HBAN has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, HBAN is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES HBAN's subordinated debt is notched one below its VR of 'A-'. The company's  trust preferred securities are notched four below the VR reflecting two notches  down for loss severity and two notches down for non-performance. HBAN's  preferred securities are rated five notches below its VR. Preferred stock is  notched two times from the VR for loss severity, and three times for  non-performance. Subordinated debt and other hybrid securities ratings are in accordance with  Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments' non-performance and loss  severity risk profiles. Thus, these ratings have been affirmed due to the  affirmation of the VR. HOLDING COMPANY   HBAN's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of HBAN's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Huntington  National Bank are equalized across the group.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS HBAN's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDR, VR, AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch believes HBAN's ratings do not have ratings upside given that performance  is in-line with similarly rated peers, coupled with its loan growth and capital  position.  Although not expected, should HBAN's performance fall below current levels such  as ROA and NIM for an extended period or credit measures deviate from its  normalized ranges of 35 basis points (bps) to 55bps, ratings would come under  pressure.  Additionally, aggressive capital management would also be viewed negatively. As  of June 30, 2015, HBAN's TCE and CET1 ratio stood at 7.91% and 9.65%,  respectively. Should these measures continue to substantially decline coupled  with an increase to the company's risk profile, ratings could be pressured. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR HBAN's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by HBAN and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in HBAN's VR. HOLDING COMPANY Should HBAN's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term and  short-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Huntington Bancshares, Inc. (HBAN)  with a Stable Outlook following its announcement that it will acquire FirstMerit  Corporation (FMER). A full list of rating actions is detailed at the end of this  rating action commentary. The transaction is valued at $3.4 billion made up roughly 80% stock and 20%  cash. The deal represents a price-to-tangible book value of 1.6x with a core  deposit premium of 6.8% for FMER. The deal is expected to be accretive to HBAN's  earnings in 2018 with an estimated increase return to tangible common equity to  300 basis points (bps), improvement to efficiency ratio of 400 bps and IRR of  20%. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016 (3Q16),  subject to regulatory approval. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch's affirmation and Stable Outlook reflects our view that the FMER  transaction represents low credit risk, manageable integration, and reasonable  cost save estimates given the significant amount of overlap between the two  entities. Further, execution risks are viewed as modest given that FMER is a  solid institution with good earnings and asset quality performance. Nonetheless,  HBAN's capital position will decline, however, Fitch views this decline in the  context of the transaction coupled with HBAN's ability to return to stronger  capital levels.  HBAN's estimated pro forma CET1 is expected to go down to 8.7%  at deal close from 9.7% at 4Q15. The company has also indicated that it expects  CET1 to build back to around 9.00%.  In Fitch's opinion, this transaction presents good cost save opportunities  (company estimates of 40%) which in our view is a reasonable assumption given  market overlap in key markets such as Ohio and Michigan. The combined entity is  expected to deliver improvements to ROAA of 15bps and ROTCE of 300bps% compared  to HBAN's stand-alone measures by 2018. Fitch believes these forecasted measures  are achievable based on cost saves and the expected credit performance of FMER's  portfolio. The price of the transaction is also in-line with recently announced  acquisitions for banks of similar size.  In Fitch's view, the combined entity risk profile is in line with HBAN's current  ratings and reflects a very similar blend. Further post-closing, the loan  portfolio composition mirrors HBAN's current mix reflecting 41% in Commercial &  Industrial, 13% Commercial Real Estate and 20% Auto/Marine RV. Additionally,  HBAN is taking a 1.9% credit mark, which appears appropriate given the credit  performance and risk profile of FMER. The deposit profile of FMER is also  similar to HBAN and the combined entity should easily comply with modified LCR  given core funding profile and good liquidity on the balance sheet. Post-closing, HBAN would have leading market share in Ohio and new entrance into  the Chicago MSA and Wisconsin.  Fitch last affirmed HBAN's IDRs and Viability Rating (VR) on Oct. 5, 2015.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  HBAN has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, HBAN is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES HBAN's subordinated debt is notched one below its VR of 'A-'. The company's  trust preferred securities are notched four below the VR reflecting two notches  down for loss severity and two notches down for non-performance. HBAN's  preferred securities are rated five notches below its VR. Preferred stock is  notched two times from the VR for loss severity, and three times for  non-performance. Subordinated debt and other hybrid securities ratings are in accordance with  Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments' non-performance and loss  severity risk profiles. Thus, these ratings have been affirmed due to the  affirmation of the VR. HOLDING COMPANY  HBAN's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The IDRs and VRs of HBAN's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Huntington  National Bank are equalized across the group. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS HBAN's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch believes HBAN's ratings do not have ratings upside given that performance  is in-line with similarly rated peers coupled with its forecasted capital  position.  HBAN's ratings are sensitive to its ability to achieve many of the key targets  in undertaking this transaction. Specifically, its ratings would be sensitive to  its ability to build its CET1 ratio up to 9%. Moreover, HBAN's ratings could be  pressured if it is not able to realize/generate the internal rate of return,  estimated profitability improvements, and cost saves incorporated in the deal.  Further, should unexpected operational and integration risks arise that are  material to financial performance HBAN's rating could likely be reviewed for  negative rating action. Additionally, ratings pressure could ensue should management take an aggressive  approach to capital management such as future acquisitions of size or a total  pay-out ratio that pushes capital below peers. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  HBAN's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by HBAN and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in HBAN's VR. HOLDING COMPANY Should HBAN's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for HBAN given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of HBAN to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in HBAN's IDRs. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by HBAN and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in HBAN's long- and short-term IDRs. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Huntington Bancshares, Incorporated --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability rating at 'a-'; --Senior unsecured at 'A-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock at 'BB'. --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

5,"  Huntington Bancshares Inc (HBAN.O) said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy Ohio-based FirstMerit Corp FMER.O for about $3.4 billion in a cash-and-stock deal.Huntington expects the deal, which would combine two of Ohio's midsize banks, to add to its earnings per share in 2017, excluding one-time merger-related expenses.The deal, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016, is the latest in a string of mergers among smaller U.S. banks, spurred by years of near-zero interest rates and higher costs related to stricter regulations imposed since the financial crisis.Huntington offered the equivalent of $20.14 per share for FirstMerit Corp - 1.72 of its own shares and $5.00 in cash, a premium of 31 percent to FirstMerit's closing price on Monday on the Nasdaq.FirstMerit's stock jumped 17.1 percent to $18.00, and Huntington fell 9.3 percent to $7.98.
