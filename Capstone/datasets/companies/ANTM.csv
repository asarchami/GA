""We were able to achieve a very competitive rate and a freeze on retail pricing for 2015,"" the insurer said in an emailed statement. ""That does favorably impact plan costs for 2015.""Gilead has come under fire for the high cost of Harvoni, as well as predecessor drug Sovaldi, which was launched in late 2013 at a price of $1,000 per pill. Harvoni has a list price of $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment, or $1,125 per daily pill. Last month, AbbVie Inc began sales of a competing drug, Viekira Pak, at a similar list price. Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, subsequently chose AbbVie's drug as the exclusive option for patients in its largest commercial plan, covering 25 million people.Anthem said Harvoni is covered for members of its affiliated health plans who are infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C, the strain that accounts for around 75 percent of all chronic hepatitis C infections in the United States.The insurer attributed its decision to favorable pricing and clinical differences, including the fact that Harvoni does not require additional medication, and offers a less complex treatment regimen than the AbbVie drug. CVS Health Corp, the nation's second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, said this week it had selected Gilead's drugs as its exclusive option for patients on commercial plans as well as those covered under its healthcare exchange plans, Medicare and Medicaid.Anthem declined to comment on the number of customers affected by its deal with Gilead but said it affects patients covered under its commercial/employer-based plan. Anthem said hepatitis C drugs sit on the highest coverage tiers, which means patients are required to pay for a certain percentage of the drug cost.

9,"   By Supriya Kurane and Jim Finkle  Health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), which has nearly 40 million U.S. customers, said late on Wednesday that hackers had breached one of its IT systems and stolen personal information relating to current and former consumers and employees.The No. 2 health insurer in the United States said the breach did not appear to involve medical information or financial details such as credit card or bank account numbers.The information accessed during the ""very sophisticated attack"" did include names, birthdays, social security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment information, including income data, the company said.Anthem said that it immediately made every effort to close the security vulnerability and reported the attack to the FBI. Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc FEYE. said it had been hired to help Anthem investigate the attack. The company did not say how many customers and staff were affected, but the Wall Street Journal earlier reported it was suspected that records of tens of millions of people had been taken, which would likely make it the largest data breach involving a U.S. health insurer.Anthem had 37.5 million medical members as of the end of December.""This attack is another reminder of the persistent threats we face, and the need for Congress to take aggressive action to remove legal barriers for sharing cyber threat information,"" U.S. Rep.

The FBI had warned last August that healthcare industry companies were being targeted by hackers, publicizing the issue following an attack on U.S. hospital group Community Health Systems Inc (CYH.N) that resulted in the theft of millions of patient records.Medical identity theft is often not immediately identified by patients or their provider, giving criminals years to milk such credentials. That makes medical data more valuable than credit cards, which tend to be quickly canceled by banks once fraud is detected.

12,"  (Adds details, background, quotes from FireEye and cybersecurity expert)By Supriya Kurane and Jim FinkleFeb 4 Hackers have stolen personal information relating to current and former customers and staff of no. 2 U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc., after breaching an IT system containing data on up to 80 million people, the company said late on Wednesday.Anthem, which has nearly 40 million customers in the United States, said it had reported the attack to the FBI and cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. said it had been hired to help Anthem investigate the attack.""We do confirm that this was done by an advanced group using custom malware,"" said FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza, noting that Anthem employees identified the breach, which was limited to a window of a few days.""We know across the board that when you do see something, you need to act fast"", which Anthem appears to have done, De Souza said.Anthem said in a statement that names, birthdays, social security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment information, including income data, had been accessed in what it described as a ""very sophisticated attack"".The breach did not appear to involve medical information or financial details such as credit card or bank account numbers, Anthem said, adding it immediately made every effort to close the security vulnerability, which was discovered last week.FireEye's De Souza said the breached database contained information from about 80 million individuals, but the extent of stolen data is still unknown, as are the perpetrators and method of the cyberattack. ""That information is a treasure trove for cybercriminals. It can easily be sold on underground markets within hours and used for a wide variety of identity fraud schemes,"" said Stuart McClure, chief executive of cybersecurity firm Cylance Inc.Cybersecurity has become a major concern both for U.S. firms facing a barrage of attacks as well as insurers trying to figure out how much of that risk they can afford to underwrite.A high-profile attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment  late last year brought the company headlines for everything from pay disparities among its employees to internal critiques about the studio's own movies.Other attacks have spooked consumers, with retailers Target  and Home Depot both reporting the theft of such personal data as credit card numbers in recent years. President Barack Obama's recently proposed fiscal 2016 budget sets aside $14 billion to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity defenses, an increase of 10 percent.SECURITY COST Cylance's McClure, who has helped healthcare companies respond to previous breaches, said it typically costs health insurers at least $100 per stolen record to clean up this type of cyberattack. If 10 million records were stolen, the costs to respond would likely top $1 billion, he said. That includes costs for setting up a hotline to answer customer questions, providing credit monitoring services and meeting state and federal government disclosure requirements.Security experts say cybercriminals are increasingly targeting the $3 trillion U.S. healthcare industry, which has many companies still reliant on aging computer systems that do not use the latest security features.One of the largest U.S. hospital operators, Community Health Systems Inc, last year said Chinese hackers had broken into its computer network and stolen the information of 4.5 million patients.The percentage of healthcare organizations that have reported a criminal attack rose to 40 percent in 2013 from 20 percent in 2009, according to an annual survey by the Ponemon Institute think-tank on data protection policy.Anthem spokeswoman Kristin Binns said the company has doubled its spending on cybersecurity over the past four years. The health insurer had 37.5 million medical members as of the end of December.""This attack is another reminder of the persistent threats we face, and the need for Congress to take aggressive action to remove legal barriers for sharing cyber threat information,"" U.S. Rep.

18,"   By Supriya Kurane and Jim Finkle  Health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), which has nearly 40 million U.S. customers, said late on Wednesday that hackers had breached one of its IT systems and stolen personal information relating to current and former consumers and employees.The No. 2 health insurer in the United States said the breach did not appear to involve medical information or financial details such as credit card or bank account numbers.The information accessed during the ""very sophisticated attack"" did include names, birthdays, social security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment information, including income data, the company said.Anthem said that it immediately made every effort to close the security vulnerability and reported the attack to the FBI. Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc FEYE. said it had been hired to help Anthem investigate the attack. The company did not say how many customers and staff were affected, but the Wall Street Journal earlier reported it was suspected that records of tens of millions of people had been taken, which would likely make it the largest data breach involving a U.S. health insurer.Anthem had 37.5 million medical members as of the end of December.""This attack is another reminder of the persistent threats we face, and the need for Congress to take aggressive action to remove legal barriers for sharing cyber threat information,"" U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas and chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement late Wednesday. The FBI had warned last August that healthcare industry companies were being targeted by hackers, publicizing the issue following an attack on U.S. hospital group Community Health Systems Inc (CYH.N) that resulted in the theft of millions of patient records.Medical identity theft is often not immediately identified by patients or their provider, giving criminals years to milk such credentials. That makes medical data more valuable than credit cards, which tend to be quickly canceled by banks once fraud is detected. Security experts say cyber criminals are increasingly targeting the $3 trillion U.S. healthcare industry, which has many companies still reliant on aging computer systems that do not use the latest security features.Anthem said it would send a letter and email to everyone whose information was stored in the hacked database. It also set up an informational website, www.anthemfacts.com, and will offer to provide a credit-monitoring service.

And the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach revealed on Thursday suggests cyberspies may now also be finding value in it.Cyber investigators from iSight Partners said they had linked the OPM hack to earlier thefts of healthcare records from Anthem Inc, a health insurance company, and Premera Blue Cross, a healthcare services provider. Tens of millions of records may have been lost in those attacks.All three breaches have one thing in common, said John Hultquist of Dallas-based iSight. While cyberespionage usually focuses on stealing commercial or government secrets, these attacks targeted personally identifiable information.The stolen data ""doesn't appear to have been monetised and the actors seem to have connections to cyberespionage activity"", said Hultquist, adding that none of the data taken in the earlier attacks had turned up for sale on underground forums.A source close the matter said U.S. authorities were looking into a possible China connection to the breach at OPM, which compromised the personal data of 4 million current and former federal employees.Several U.S. states were already investigating a Chinese link to the Anthem attack in February, a person familiar with the matter has said.China routinely denies involvement in hacking, and on Friday a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing said suggestions it was involved in the OPM breach were ""irresponsible and unscientific"". Hultquist said iSight could not confirm that China was behind the attacks, but similar methods, servers and habits of the hackers pointed to a single state-sponsored group.BLACK MARKET FLOODED Security researchers say that medical data and personnel records have become more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card data.The price of stolen credit cards has fallen in online black markets, in part because massive breaches have spiked supply. ""The market has been flooded,"" said Ben Ransford, co-founder of security start-up Virta Laboratories.The result: medical information can be worth 10 times as much as a credit card number.Fraudsters use this data to create fake IDs to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold, or they combine a patient number with a false provider number and file made-up claims with insurers.State-sponsored hackers may not be after money, but would also be interested in such data because they could then build a clearer picture of their target. That, said Philip Lieberman of security software company Lieberman Software, would increase the chances of any targeted email attack, or spear phish, successfully obtaining confidential data.Others said that, given the data affected included job histories, those targets might be in other government departments. ""It's likely this is less about money and more about gaining deeper access to other systems and agencies,"" said Mark Bower of HP Security Voltage, a data security company.This interest in more granular data is pushing hackers of all stripes into more inventive ways of penetrating the defences of hospitals and other institutions holding such data.TrapX, a cybersecurity company, said it had discovered criminal gangs from Russia and China infecting medical devices such as X-Ray systems and blood gas analysers to find their way into servers from which they stole personnel and patient data.Other security researchers agreed this kind of attack was becoming more common.Billy Rios, founder of security company Laconicly, said he had found infected systems while working with several healthcare organisations. ""Clinical software is riddled with security vulnerabilities,"" he said.A survey by think-tank the Ponemon Institute issued last month said that more than 90 percent of healthcare organisations surveyed had lost data, most of it to hackers.""This is going to get worse before it gets better,"" said Carl Wright, of TrapX, which discovered the breaches via medical devices.

""Uncertainty freaks the market out. It makes it very, very nervous.""Investors were also nervous ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting starting Tuesday. Upbeat consumer sentiment and other data last week added to views the economy is regaining momentum and could encourage the Fed to raise interest raise as soon as September.Investors will focus on any changes in Fed Chair Janet Yellen's language in a post-meeting news conference.Easy monetary policy has driven borrowing costs lower and helped stocks and bond prices to record highs in recent years.

Data on Monday showed that manufacturing activity in New York State slowed in June, while U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May, mainly because of a strong dollar and a drop in spending by energy companies.However, U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose more than expected in June, hitting its highest level since September.Cigna shares soared 19.4 percent to a record high of $164 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the health insurer had rebuffed a takeover offer from Anthem.

48,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) said on Saturday it had offered $47 billion in cash and stock for smaller rival Cigna Corp (CI.N), signaling a pick-up in the industry's long-awaited consolidation.The biggest U.S. health insurers are seeking acquisitions to boost membership in government-paid healthcare plans and the employer-based insurance that is Cigna's specialty. Being bigger can help them negotiate better prices and improved networks of doctors, they said.Anthem's offer comes as Cigna, as well as insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N), are participating in an auction to acquire another rival, Humana Inc (HUM.N), according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential. Humana was first reported to be considering a sale in May.Humana declined to comment. Aetna was not immediately available for comment. Cigna declined to comment on the Humana auction or the Anthem offer.Anthem, the second largest U.S. health insurer, said in a statement it had made four offers for Cigna in June, but that the deal was stalled over Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani's role in the merged company. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the rejected offers last week.In a letter published as part of the company's statement on Saturday, Anthem detailed its weeks-long attempts to reach a deal with Cigna, including the steps by which it raised its offer to $184 per share. Based on that price and 257,370,000 shares outstanding, the deal is worth about $47 billion.Cigna shares closed on Friday at $155.26, down $1.15 or 0.7 percent, making the $184 offer a premium of about 18 percent. The offer consists of 68.6 percent cash and 31.4 percent stock. CEO Joseph Swedish wrote that the company did not think investors supported Cigna's rejection of the deal because of Anthem's refusal to guarantee that the CEO role would eventually go to Cordani. The letter also said Cigna had refused to sign a two-week standstill agreement with Anthem that would prevent both sides from having other deal talks.A combined Cigna and Anthem would have 53 million customers in commercial, government, consumer and other kinds of health insurance plans. Anthem, which offers Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, said the purchase would boost earnings more than 10 percent in the first year and double that in the second year.DEAL MAKING   The deal making comes as insurance companies have adjusted to the major changes introduced by President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, which has created new kinds of insurance, cut government payments for medical services and introduced new healthcare taxes. The news broke in May that Humana, which specializes in Medicare Advantage plans for older people and the disabled, was considering selling itself, a source familiar with the matter said.The Wall Street Journal last month reported that Aetna and Cigna were possible buyers. Both companies declined to comment on the report at the time. Last week, the Journal reported that Cigna had turned down Anthem after two offers and also said UnitedHealth Group Inc was interested in buying Aetna.Aetna itself has for years been speculated to be a buyer for Cigna, but Wall Street analysts have said one barrier would be finding a role for the CEO of each company. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said she thought the Anthem-Cigna deal would close and that Aetna had an 80 percent or more chance of buying Humana. She also wrote in a research note that she expects UnitedHealth to try to buy Aetna, but that it could face too many regulatory barriers.Regulatory issues would likely not be an issue with Anthem as the buyer and Cigna as a target, Wall Street analysts have said, while Anthem and Humana is another combination that could pass regulatory scrutiny. Swedish wrote in a letter to Cigna's board that Anthem had proposed that Cordani could be president and chief operating officer of the new company during a two-year period while Swedish remained CEO. After that time, Swedish said he would step down and that the board could appoint a new CEO.

55,"   By Caroline Humer and Diane Bartz | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) on Monday dismissed concerns that buying smaller competitor Cigna Corp (CI.N) would be considered anti-competitive, even as antitrust experts said the combination would earn regulatory scrutiny.Any merger could require asset sales and would be complicated by potential deals among other insurers, which after years of change due to President Barack Obama's healthcare reform are now scrambling to tie up.Insurers are seeking to use scale to trim administrative costs and negotiate lower prices with doctors, moves they say will make plans more affordable but which regulators will closely scrutinize for the opposite effect on consumers.Besides the possible Anthem deal, Humana Inc (HUM.N) is considering a sale, possibly to Cigna or Aetna Inc (AET.N), a source familiar with the situation previously told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal also reported that UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) was interested in Aetna.The U.S. Department of Justice will look at how the proposed combinations - with deal values estimated in the tens of billions of dollars - would increase market share in each county or region for each type of health insurance plan that the companies offer, antitrust experts say.  If two deals were announced in the insurance industry, that would likely trigger more scrutiny from antitrust enforcers,  said Barak Richman, who teaches at Duke University School of Law. ""The economics of the health insurance market makes it a complicated analysis. These are not doomed transactions,"" Richman said.The Justice Department has been aggressive, one expert said, pointing to Comcast’s failed bid for Time Warner Cable. It would likely be concerned if the number of competitors in the product market of any county dropped to three or fewer, said Andre Barlow, a Justice Department veteran now at Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.    ""Any time you're down to two players or less you have a problem that needs to be resolved,"" said Barlow. ""Three, you may still have to divest.""The mergers of the No. 2 insurer with the No. 5 insurer, and the No. 3 with the No. 4 insurer, could spark a change in the way they review deals, he said.

56,"  (Adds Breakingviews link)By Caroline Humer and Diane BartzNEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 22 U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc on Monday dismissed concerns that buying smaller competitor Cigna Corp would be considered anti-competitive, even as antitrust experts said the combination would earn regulatory scrutiny.Any merger could require asset sales and would be complicated by potential deals among other insurers, which after years of change due to President Barack Obama's healthcare reform are now scrambling to tie up.Insurers are seeking to use scale to trim administrative costs and negotiate lower prices with doctors, moves they say will make plans more affordable but which regulators will closely scrutinize for the opposite effect on consumers.Besides the possible Anthem deal, Humana Inc is considering a sale, possibly to Cigna or Aetna Inc, a source familiar with the situation previously told Reuters. The Wall Street Journal also reported that UnitedHealth Group Inc  was interested in Aetna.The U.S. Department of Justice will look at how the proposed combinations - with deal values estimated in the tens of billions of dollars - would increase market share in each county or region for each type of health insurance plan that the companies offer, antitrust experts say.If two deals were announced in the insurance industry, that would likely trigger more scrutiny from antitrust enforcers,  said Barak Richman, who teaches at Duke University School of Law.""The economics of the health insurance market makes it a complicated analysis. These are not doomed transactions,"" Richman said. The Justice Department has been aggressive, one expert said, pointing to Comcast's failed bid for Time Warner Cable.It would likely be concerned if the number of competitors in the product market of any county dropped to three or fewer, said Andre Barlow, a Justice Department veteran now at Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.""Any time you're down to two players or less you have a problem that needs to be resolved,"" said Barlow. ""Three, you may still have to divest.""The mergers of the No. 2 insurer with the No. 5 insurer, and the No. 3 with the No. 4 insurer, could spark a change in the way they review deals, he said. ""There's no guarantee that they would review transactions within an industry similar to how they've treated them in the past,"" Barlow said.Anthem, which runs Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, disclosed on Saturday that it had offered to buy Cigna for $47 billion but said the deal was held up over issues like the role of Cigna's CEO at the merged company.Cigna on Sunday confirmed rejecting the offer, citing its own concerns about Anthem's management and saying the combination would run afoul of the rules governing members of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is made up of 37 different health plans, of which Anthem is the largest, who work together to create a national network of health insurance coverage.

74,"  (Adds more details from sources)By Greg RoumeliotisJuly 22 U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc  is close to finalizing negotiations to acquire peer Cigna Inc  and could announce a roughly $48 billion deal as early as this week, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The deal would follow Aetna Inc's $37 billion agreement earlier this month to acquire Humana Inc, potentially reducing the number of major U.S. insurance companies from five to three and attracting antitrust scrutiny.Most issues that were preventing Anthem and Cigna from reaching a deal, such as price and the role of Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani, have been resolved, the people said. Anthem has slightly improved on its previous cash and stock offer of $184 per share and will pay somewhere near $187 per share for Cigna, one of the people said. Cordani has accepted he will be No. 2 to Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish, though details are still being hammered out, the person added.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Anthem was nearing an agreement to pay about $187 per share for Cigna. Cigna shares ended trading on Wednesday at $155.10.The source asked not to be identified because the negotiations between the companies are confidential. Anthem and Cigna did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Health insurers have been in a race to consolidate, arguing that being larger would help them negotiate better prices with doctors and hospitals as well as cut administrative costs following President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law that was passed in 2010.Many healthcare providers are concerned, however, that further consolidation will decrease competition in the insurance industry. Antitrust authorities are expected to scrutinize how the combination of insurers will affect competition for each line of insurance: Medicare, Medicaid for the poor, individual insurance, commercial insurance for small and large businesses and the large employer business.Anthem said in June that it had made several offers for Cigna but a deal had been delayed in part due to differences over who would lead the company and corporate governance. Cigna also said it was concerned that other members of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would be an obstacle.Large self-insured employers make up most of Cigna's customers. In addition to these businesses, Cigna also has 24 million behavioral care customers, nearly 14 million dental care members, 8 million pharmacy benefit plan members and 1.5 million Medicare Part D pharmacy customers.Anthem operates health plans under the Blue Cross Blue Shield banner in 14 states.

""They also both possibly face divestitures and may have to make concessions to consumers to make the merger go through.""The AMA said its own analysis shows 41 percent of U.S. metropolitan areas already have a single health insurer with a commercial market share of 50 percent or more. It believes the Anthem-Cigna merger would be presumed anticompetitive in at least nine of the states where Anthem operates.""It is imperative that we closely examine changes in the healthcare market, and what has caused these changes, to ensure that consumers are not harmed,"" said Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah who is chairman of the Senate's antitrust panel.Apparent worries about regulatory scrutiny have also hit Humana shares, which closed at $181.76 on Friday, well below the value of Aetna's cash-and-stock offer of $230 per share when it was announced on July 3. BIGGER THAN UNITEDHEALTH Cigna has 15 million members, and about 80 percent of its business is with self-insured companies which pay it a management fee, according to Leerink. It also serves large and small employers, Medicare Advantage customers and individuals.About 61 percent of Anthem's 39 million members are served through self-insured companies, while 15 percent have Medicaid coverage. Large and small group policies make up about 12 percent of its business, while Medicare Advantage accounts for 1 percent.The combined company would have about 53 million members, surpassing UnitedHealth Group's 45.86 million as of June 30.Anthem said it will pay $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of its shares for each Cigna share. The deal is valued at $181.12 per share based on Anthem's Friday close of $150.86. Anthem said on Friday the offer was valued at $188 per share based on its stock price on May 28 before media reports surfaced that the two companies were in talks.The offer's equity portion is valued at $49.11 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on 261.2 million Cigna shares outstanding as of March 31.Another question is whether Anthem would violate rules of  the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, a federation of 36 independent insurers of which it is the biggest member.The association collectively insures 106 million Americans. Anthem provides coverage to the most people and operates in 14 states. No other Blue Cross member operates in more than five states.Blue Cross operators are not supposed to compete with one another, but Cigna does compete against Blue Cross members in a handful of states, which could cause controversy in the association.""There will no doubt be debate among the board of directors,"" said a person knowledgeable about Blue Cross who requested anonymity to protect business relationships.""We will remain Blue,"" Swedish said on the conference call, adding that Anthem feels confident that even after acquiring Cigna, the combined company will satisfy ""the Blue rules.""Swedish said he would serve as CEO for only two years, and remain as chairman afterward. Cordani could be a contender for the CEO role at that point, but no guarantees were provided, said a source familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the person was unauthorized to publicly discuss details of the transaction.Both Anthem and Cigna would be liable to pay the other a fee equivalent to 3.8 percent of the deal's value if either walks away from the planned merger.Anthem's lead financial adviser is UBS Investment Bank. Credit Suisse also served as financial adviser, and White & Case LLP as legal adviser.Morgan Stanley is Cigna's financial adviser and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP its legal adviser.

82,"  * Combined company will cover about 53 million members* To pay $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 for every Cigna share* Says confident of getting regulatory approvals   (Adds comments from Anthem, Cigna CEOs, background on businesses)By Ankur Banerjee and Ransdell PiersonJuly 24 Anthem Inc said on Friday it would buy Cigna Corp for about $54.2 billion, a deal that would create the largest U.S. health insurer by membership and accelerate the consolidation of an industry from five national players to three.The proposed acquisition - the biggest ever in the health insurance industry - comes three weeks after Aetna Inc  agreed to buy Humana Inc for $37 billion.Health insurers are finding it tougher to raise prices following the roll-out of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, while grappling with soaring costs for a growing list of innovative new medications such as some new cancer drugs that cost $100,000 annually for patients.State insurance regulators and federal antitrust authorities are expected to aggressively scrutinize how both of the proposed health insurer acquisitions will affect competition for Medicare and individual and commercial insurance.Under the deal, which the companies expect to close in the second half of 2016, Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish would serve as CEO and Chairman of the combined company. Cigna CEO David Cordani would be president and Chief Operating Officer.In a joint conference call with industry analysts, Swedish said that Anthem has had no discussions ""at all"" with regulators ahead of the deal announcement, but was confident it will receive their approval. Shares of Cigna on Friday were trading at $147.64, far below their $188 per share value under the announced deal, suggesting significant Wall Street skepticism over whether it will survive antitrust scrutiny.""Strategically and financially it's very attractive, but they will face regulatory scrutiny,"" said Ana Gupte, analyst with Leerink Partners. ""They also both possibly face divestitures and may have to make concessions to consumers to make the merger go through.""The same apparent wariness of approval has been seen with Aetna's planned purchase of Humana. Humana shares are trading in the $183 range, well below the value of Aetna's cash-and-stock offer of $230 per share when it was first announced.Both Anthem and Cigna would be liable to pay the other a fee equivalent to 3.8 percent of the deal's value if either of them walk away from the planned merger. BIGGER THAN UNITEDHEALTH Anthem and Cigna are two of just four major insurers that administer self-insured plans for major companies. The other two are UnitedHealth Group Inc and Aetna. The combined company would have about 53 million members. UnitedHealth had 45.86 million members as of June 30.Growing concerns about market concentration came into sharp focus earlier this year when regulatory concerns scuttled Comcast Corp's $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc. Anthem said it will pay $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of its shares for every Cigna share. The deal is valued at $183.36 per share based on Anthem's Thursday close of $155.21. Anthem said the offer is valued at $188 per share, based on its unaffected share price as of May 28 before media reports surfaced that the two companies were in talks.The equity portion of the offer is valued at $49.11 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on 261.2 million Cigna shares outstanding as of March 31.Swedish said Anthem's mainstay Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance coverage requires the company to maintain a concentrated focus on that business, according to Blue Cross rules.""We will remain Blue,"" Swedish said on the conference call, adding that Anthem feels confident that even after acquiring Cigna and its core Medicare Advantage plans, the combined company will satisfy ""the Blue rules.""The company has said the deal will help it reduce costs and allow it to negotiate lower prices with doctors and hospitals.(The) spirit of our collaboration going forward is total collaboration,"" Swedish said, saying his and Cordani's different roles and responsibilities ""are perfectly aligned.""Swedish said he intended to remain CEO of the combined company for two years, and afterward become chairman.Anthem's lead financial adviser is UBS Investment Bank.

It also said that a key financial measure of medical costs fell during the quarter.Health insurers closely manage costs to contend with a constant rise in medical spending. Cost increases had been held back for many years by the weak economy, but began picking up in 2014 with the improved economy and as the national healthcare reform law extended insurance to millions more people.A few months ago, the largest U.S. insurers began scrambling to line up merger partners that would give them leverage to contend with the trend and negotiate lower prices with medical providers.

89,"   By Caroline Humer  Health insurer Cigna Corp, which agreed last week to be bought by Anthem Inc for $47 billion, said on Thursday that medical services use was low in the second quarter, helping to keep costs in check and beat Wall Street profit estimates.Cigna's report of a continued low utilization trend backs up a growing industry view of this closely watched component of insurer profitability. Anthem made similar comments on Wednesday, when it reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Health insurers have benefited from low medical services use during the past five years as the weak economy has kept down doctor visits and hospitalizations and membership growth has helped increase revenues.But the rate of overall health spending has begun to increase and medical use is expected to rise more as the economy improves. The national healthcare reform law, also known as Obamacare, has contributed to the increase as millions of people gained health insurance coverage in the past two years.That is driving insurers to consolidate to build scale to help keep costs down and negotiate better deals with doctors and hospitals.""The reason why there is so much consolidation is because utilization and the cost trend overall will go up, which will pressure the profitability for these companies long term,"" Morningstar Research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said.

90,"  (Corrects spelling of name Vishnu in 6th paragraph)By Caroline HumerJuly 30 Health insurer Cigna Corp, which agreed last week to be bought by Anthem Inc for $47 billion, said on Thursday that medical services use was low in the second quarter, helping to keep costs in check and beat Wall Street profit estimates.Cigna's report of a continued low utilization trend backs up a growing industry view of this closely watched component of insurer profitability. Anthem made similar comments on Wednesday, when it reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Health insurers have benefited from low medical services use during the past five years as the weak economy has kept down doctor visits and hospitalizations and membership growth has helped increase revenues.But the rate of overall health spending has begun to increase and medical use is expected to rise more as the economy improves. The national healthcare reform law, also known as Obamacare, has contributed to the increase as millions of people gained health insurance coverage in the past two years.That is driving insurers to consolidate to build scale to help keep costs down and negotiate better deals with doctors and hospitals. ""The reason why there is so much consolidation is because utilization and the cost trend overall will go up, which will pressure the profitability for these companies long term,"" Morningstar Research analyst Vishnu Lekraj said.Aetna Inc agreed to buy smaller rival Humana Inc  in early July, just weeks before Anthem and Cigna reached a deal.The mergers are expected to face antitrust scrutiny as regulators consider their effect on insurance premium rates.

99,"  (Adds comment from Aetna, antitrust expert)NEW YORK, Sept 8 The leading U.S. physicians' organization said on Tuesday that two proposed mergers of U.S. health insurers worth tens of billions of dollars could lead to higher prices in 17 states for companies that buy insurance for their workers or people who buy their own insurance.Aetna Inc announced plans to buy smaller rival Humana Inc in early July and Anthem Inc agreed to buy Cigna Corp later that month. Both mergers are being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice and state insurance officials.The American Medical Association study focused on the impact on the commercial fully insured and self insured markets, largely made up of employer-based plans. The health insurers also manage plans for Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs not included in the study.The proposed insurance mergers follow the implementation of President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul, the Affordable Care Act, which extended health insurance to millions of people. Insurers say the combinations will help them better compete as companies as the government tries to rein in healthcare spending. Anthem and Cigna combined would affect competition in 13 states where they sell individual insurance plans and in all 14 states where Anthem currently operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, the AMA's analysis found.Anthem spokeswoman Kristin Binns said the two companies have limited overlap and the merger would help consumers by allowing the merged company to better manage costs. An Aetna and Humana merger would raise anti-competitive issues in as many as 14 states overall including Humana's home state of Kentucky, Texas, Georgia, Utah and Florida, the study said. The majority of Humana's business is in Medicare Advantage, which is not part of the study.An Aetna spokeswoman noted that Humana's focus is on Medicare. ""The AMA report focuses on competition in the commercial marketplace, which would not meaningfully change following an Aetna/Humana combination given Humana's very small commercial business,"" spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said. The American Hospital Association has also made public its analysis of the two deals, saying they would diminish competition.The Department of Justice will take a hard look at the study, said Mark Ryan, of the law firm Mayer Brown and formerly of the department's Antitrust Division.""I think they'll pay a lot of attention to what the doctors are saying because they would be impacted by the merger,"" Ryan said.Doctors could well be concerned that they would be paid less because of the mergers, said Andrew Gavil, who teaches antitrust at Howard University School of Law. ""The AMA could be right but obviously they are self-interested,"" Gavil said.

100,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Health insurer Anthem's planned $47 billion takeover of rival Cigna will not hurt consumers but increase choice and affordability, Cigna CEO David Cordani said, defending the merger against widespread criticism that it will harm competition.The Anthem-Cigna deal and a plan by Aetna Inc to buy Humana have come in the wake of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and amid pressure on insurers to keep healthcare spending down for their biggest customers - employers and the U.S. government. ""It's going to increase choice, not decrease choice. It's going to increase affordability, not decrease affordability,"" Cordani told Reuters in an interview, saying results-oriented contracts with doctors and hospitals would help consumers be healthier and trim medical spending.Cordani said the biggest overlap in a combination of their $115 billion businesses is their large employer-based divisions and asset sales may be necessary to win regulatory approval, though he expects that would only be on a limited basis.""Divestitures through the DOJ process should be modest and manageable. And we've leaned on the conservative side of the business case that supports this,"" he said, but added it was too early to say what might be offered up. About 150 million Americans get their health insurance through their employers, many of which are large companies.In the past few weeks, both the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association have issued written criticisms of the deal. Congress held a hearing on insurer competition last week and another hearing is scheduled in the Senate next week in which Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini are scheduled to appear.The company expects the Department of Justice review to take 12 to 18 months during which it will look at the extent of their overlap in market share for Medicaid for the poor, Medicare Advantage for seniors, individual insurance, small employers and large employers. Cordani said the detailed nature of the review would show few competitive issues. There was little geographical overlap in their Medicaid and Medicare businesses and he is also not anticipating issues with the individual business, where Cigna is a new player, nor with small employer-based plans.He added that insurers would not see outsized benefits from cutting costs through their combinations because customers typically demand that spending savings be passed onto them. So far, Cordani said, employers have been optimistic that the combination will enable them to combine the results-oriented care management programs for diseases like diabetes that Cigna has used to cut healthcare spending in Medicare and commercial plans, and combine them with the Anthem's strong Blue Cross Blue Shield networks. ""Within that, there may be deemed by the DOJ some overlap that is not acceptable and we'll deal with that,"" he said.On branding, he said that in a state like Georgia, where Cigna and Anthem both operate, the companies can continue with their Cigna and Anthem branded plans and designs.

101,"   By Caroline Humer  Health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) said on Wednesday that its Obamacare insurance business is being hampered by lower-than-anticipated enrollment due to fewer applicants than expected and cheaper premium rates at competitors.Anthem has been one of the biggest and most profitable insurers in the new individual market, which was overhauled in 2014 with new government subsidized plans sold on exchanges created under Obamacare. Now Anthem says that business will drag on profit growth in 2016 and could even affect its long-term 2018 financial target. The comments from the second-largest U.S. health insurer came in its third-quarter financial report, which showed that other government-based businesses had outperformed expectations.Shares of Anthem were down 5.1 percent at $137.35 in morning trading. Cigna Corp (CI.N), which Anthem has announced plans to buy, was down 3.2 percent while shares of Aetna Inc (AET.N), which reports on Thursday, were down 2.8 percent.""We're trending the wrong direction on enrollment,"" Anthem Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt told investors on a conference call. The company lost 69,000 exchange customers during the quarter, ending with 824,000 customers. It has 1.75 million total individual customers.Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in more than a dozen states, said it expects continued enrollment declines in the fourth quarter and that 2016 will be weak as competitors undercut prices. After that, it is counting on improvements in 2017 and 2018 when it expects to be able to compete better on prices. Many of its individual customers buy their insurance on the exchanges created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law and receive subsidies from the government aimed at making it more affordable. The government expects about 9.1 million people to have this insurance at the end of 2015, a lower target than the 15 million it once aimed for, and for next year expects 10 million people to enroll.Earlier this week, the U.S. government said that in the 37 states where it runs exchanges, the monthly premium rate of the benchmark health insurance plan will increase 7.5 percent on average. DeVeydt said the company was not seeing what hospitals attested to this week: patients dropping coverage because of premium prices. Two weeks ago, UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) disappointed investors when it told them the individual business was cutting into profit this year. Unlike Anthem, it said it expected 2016 to improve. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte described Anthem's commentary on the call as being ""very cautious"" and noted the pressure from market share losses to other plans that had priced below them in 2016.Anthem said its other businesses did well as more people enrolled for its government plans in Medicare for the elderly and disabled and Medicaid for lower-income families. Medicaid enrollment rose by 786,000 members in the third quarter.Anthem said earnings rose to $654.8 million, or $2.43 per share, from $630.9 million, or $2.22 per share, a year earlier. The company said spending on medical claims as a percentage of premiums rose to 83.6 percent from 82.5 percent a year ago, due to expenses in its individual business.

102,"  (Recasts to focus on individual exchange business, adds CFO and analyst comments, share prices)By Caroline HumerOct 28 Health insurer Anthem Inc said on Wednesday that its Obamacare insurance business is being hampered by lower-than-anticipated enrollment due to fewer applicants than expected and cheaper premium rates at competitors.Anthem has been one of the biggest and most profitable insurers in the new individual market, which was overhauled in 2014 with new government subsidized plans sold on exchanges created under Obamacare. Now Anthem says that business will drag on profit growth in 2016 and could even affect its long-term 2018 financial target.The comments from the second-largest U.S. health insurer came in its third-quarter financial report, which showed that other government-based businesses had outperformed expectations.Shares of Anthem were down 5.1 percent at $137.35 in morning trading. Cigna Corp, which Anthem has announced plans to buy, was down 3.2 percent while shares of Aetna Inc, which reports on Thursday, were down 2.8 percent.""We're trending the wrong direction on enrollment,"" Anthem Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt told investors on a conference call. The company lost 69,000 exchange customers during the quarter, ending with 824,000 customers. It has 1.75 million total individual customers. Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in more than a dozen states, said it expects continued enrollment declines in the fourth quarter and that 2016 will be weak as competitors undercut prices. After that, it is counting on improvements in 2017 and 2018 when it expects to be able to compete better on prices.Many of its individual customers buy their insurance on the exchanges created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law and receive subsidies from the government aimed at making it more affordable. The government expects about 9.1 million people to have this insurance at the end of 2015, a lower target than the 15 million it once aimed for, and for next year expects 10 million people to enroll.Earlier this week, the U.S. government said that in the 37 states where it runs exchanges, the monthly premium rate of the benchmark health insurance plan will increase 7.5 percent on average. DeVeydt said the company was not seeing what hospitals attested to this week: patients dropping coverage because of premium prices.Two weeks ago, UnitedHealth Group Inc disappointed investors when it told them the individual business was cutting into profit this year. Unlike Anthem, it said it expected 2016 to improve.Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte described Anthem's commentary on the call as being ""very cautious"" and noted the pressure from market share losses to other plans that had priced below them in 2016. Anthem said its other businesses did well as more people enrolled for its government plans in Medicare for the elderly and disabled and Medicaid for lower-income families. Medicaid enrollment rose by 786,000 members in the third quarter.Anthem said earnings rose to $654.8 million, or $2.43 per share, from $630.9 million, or $2.22 per share, a year earlier.The company said spending on medical claims as a percentage of premiums rose to 83.6 percent from 82.5 percent a year ago, due to expenses in its individual business. The metric is keenly watched for signs of rising costs.On an adjusted basis, Anthem earned $2.73 per share, well above analysts' average estimate of $2.33 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $19.77 billion from $18.37 billion.

The company kept the top end of the guidance unchanged at $8.60.However, Cigna said it expected revenue growth in 2016 could be offset by reduction in customers in its individual plans, which are sold on exchanges created under the U.S. Affordable Care Act.Last month, the U.S. government said that in the 37 states where it runs the exchanges, the monthly premium rate of the benchmark health insurance plan would increase 7.5 percent on average.Cigna manages insurance plans for large companies and sells health plans to individuals on government exchanges. It also manages government Medicare and Medicaid plans. The company said it had experienced favorable medical costs, physician engagement and low utilization trend on an year-to-date basis.Revenue at Cigna's unit that sells commercial and government plans rose 8 percent to $6.62 billion in the third quarter. Membership in government plans increased 8.5 percent. Net income attributable to the company's shareholders rose to $547 million, or $2.10 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $534 million, or $2.01 per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, Cigna earned $2.28 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $2.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

107,"   By Caroline Humer  U.S. health insurers Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) on Friday sought to reassure investors that their Obamacare businesses had not worsened after UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) warned of mounting losses in that sector.Aetna and Anthem said their individual insurance businesses, which include the plans created by President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, had performed in line with projections through October. Both backed their earnings forecasts for 2015. The announcements came the day after UnitedHealth cut its earnings forecast and said it might exit the Obamacare exchanges in 2017. It said it was losing money on that business because of low enrollment and high costs. Anthem remains committed to the exchanges and to ""continuing our dialogue with policymakers and regulators regarding how we can improve the stability of the individual market,"" Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said in a statement.Enrollment for 2016 exchange plans opened earlier this month. In October, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services forecast about 10 million people would have plans next year, significantly below industry expectations of 20 million. Enrollment in 2015 also fell short of initial goals, and insurers say that trend has made it difficult to price their plans.  About a dozen start-up cooperative insurers have collapsed this year, driven out of the business by paying more medical claims than expected. Also, government payments to mitigate the costs of insuring sicker-than-expected members are declining and will be mostly phased out after next year. Aetna shares, which had fallen 7 percent on Thursday, rose 4.1 percent to $103.97 on Friday. Anthem, the second-largest player on the exchanges, was up 2.5 percent at $131.10 after dropping 9 percent the previous day, and UnitedHealth gained 2.1 percent to $113.00 after a 6 percent decline. Aetna said it still expected 2015 operating earnings of $7.45 to $7.55 per share, and Anthem reiterated its outlook of $9.53 to $9.63 per share. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said Aetna's statement showed the company had already factored in the individual business' challenges to its forecasts. Aetna and Anthem had referred back to earlier comments when asked on Thursday about UnitedHealth's commentary.In October, Aetna had said it was not making money from the business, which sells government-subsidized plans on exchanges created under the U.S. Affordable Care Act but that profitability could improve next year. It has about 815,000 members in plans on the exchanges.Anthem said last month that 2016 would be a challenging year on the exchanges, where it has about 824,000 customers, and that the business would drag on profit. The earnings affirmations echo that of Centene Corp (CNC.N) and Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH.N). The small health insurers, which focus on Medicaid, also said its exchange business was performing in line with its expectations.Molina CEO J. Mario Molina said that Molina was targeting low-income people, similar to its Medicaid patients, and that it was not having the same problems as UnitedHealth.Kaiser Permanente, a hospital and insurer system, also said that it was ""strongly committed"" to the exchanges.

118,"   By Susan Kelly and Caroline Humer  Jan 12 Anthem Inc could save $3 billion annually on drug costs from a re-pricing provision in its current contract with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co, the health insurer's chief executive officer said Tuesday.Anthem said it is working to renegotiate the contract this year to avoid overpaying for pharmaceuticals based on current market conditions. It first announced that it was going to rework the contract about two years ago, but it has not previously disclosed an estimate on the cost savings from the move. Anthem's 10-year contract with Express Scripts runs through 2019 but includes the re-pricing clause that became effective Jan. 1, Joseph Swedish, chief executive of the insurer, said in remarks at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.""This represents a substantial adjustment to drive lower care costs for our customers and improve our competitive position in the marketplace,"" Swedish said. Anthem conducted a market analysis to identify the potential savings, which would come primarily from lower generic drug pricing, Swedish said. ""We have seen a substantial improvement in market pricing in just the last 12 months,"" he said. Swedish said in an interview with Reuters at the conference this week that the company is still undecided about when and if it will sign a new contract with Express Scripts that would go into effect when the current one expires. Negotiations have picked up pace, he said, and he is hopeful about making a decision in 2016 about how to proceed.Anthem, which manages Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, is the country's second-largest health insurer. It could become the nation's largest if its proposal to buy Cigna Corp  is approved by antitrust regulators.

119,"   By Caroline Humer  Health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), which is in the process of buying smaller rival Cigna Corp (CI.N), said on Wednesday its individual Obamacare exchange health plans weighed on fourth-quarter profit, causing it to miss analysts' expectations.Anthem said that it had nearly 800,000 people enrolled in plans through the exchanges, which were created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, about 30 percent below its expectations. Without the membership it had planned for, costs of running the business were too high, Anthem said.Anthem said net profit fell to $180.9 million, or 68 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $506.7 million, or $1.80 per share, a year earlier. It earned $1.14 per share on an adjusted basis, below the average analyst estimate of $1.20 per share.Revenue rose to $20.02 billion from $18.78 billion.Shares fell 3.7 percent in morning trading, and also pulled down shares in competitor Aetna Inc (AET.N), which fell 2.3 percent. Many insurers have reported losing money on the exchanges, in part because total enrollment has been sharply lower than initially anticipated and because some patients costs have been higher than expected. In November, UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) said it may completely exit the business.Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said during a conference call with investors that for 2016 so far, the early enrollment data is looking ""slightly better"" than its own ""muted expectations.""  The company, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in more than a dozen states, said it expects the exchange business to be profitable this year, but not as much as the 3 percent to 5 percent profit margin that it had expected. Anthem lowered its expectations for 2016 revenue to reflect the weaker sector sales.""Until these issues with the exchange as far as growth goes, expected growth, costs, getting the right membership to enter the exchanges; until those issues get ironed out, there is going to be volatility,"" said Vishnu Lekraj, a senior analyst at Morningstar Research.    The percentage of premiums paid out for medical services increased due to greater expenses in the company's individual and certain employer plans. This closely watched expense ratio was 87 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 84.5 percent a year ago, it said.  Anthem said its other businesses did well as more people enrolled for its government plans, especially in Medicaid for lower-income families. Medicaid enrollment rose by 721,000 members in the fourth quarter.

125,"   By Susan Kelly  The American Hospital Association warned U.S. antitrust regulators that Anthem Inc's (ANTM.N) proposed acquisition of Cigna Corp (CI.N) will hurt other health insurers' ability to compete with Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, leading to higher premiums for consumers.Anthem, the country's second-largest health insurer, runs Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states. The hospital group, in a letter Monday to Assistant U.S. Attorney General William Baer, urged the Justice Department to challenge the Anthem-Cigna deal, saying Blue Cross Blue Shield plans are already much larger than competitors in many states.Adding Cigna's customers would give the plans greater power to demand larger discounts from providers and reduce competitors' ability to compete, raising the cost of health insurance premiums paid by consumers, the group said.  ""The acquisition threatens to both reinforce existing barriers to entry and raise new ones, further entrench dominant Blue plans, and exacerbate conditions conducive to abuse of market or monopoly power,"" the group wrote in its letter.

""We will deliver for consumers by operating more efficiently to reduce our own costs, while enhancing our ability to manage the cost drivers that negatively impact affordability for consumers,"" Becher said in a statement.The Justice Department is now scrutinizing the proposed merger as well as Aetna Inc's (AET.N) plan to buy Humana Inc (HUM.N) to determine if the deals, which would reduce the number of nationwide health insurers to three from five, would lead to higher prices and fewer options for consumers.

The company also said Anthem acted in bad faith by accepting a $4.675 billion up-front payment from Express Scripts at the beginning of the contract, which it said was supposed to let Express Scripts charge higher prices.Express Scripts said that if Anthem does win price cuts in its lawsuit, it should be ordered to repay that money.The case is Anthem Inc v.

139,"   By Caroline Humer  Health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) on Wednesday said it is not planning to exit the Obamacare individual insurance exchanges next year like competitor UnitedHealth Group, and is planning instead on growth in that market.Anthem Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said the company had picked up more exchange customers than it expected this year and that its planned acquisition of Cigna Corp.

Even so, Anthem said the exchanges may not be as profitable as it had expected until after next year and only if structural changes are made.

""I think a sustainable market can be built.""Last week, UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) said that it was losing too much money on its exchange customers and would largely exit the marketplace in 2017. Other insurers, such as start-up cooperative healthcare plans created by the reform law, have also lost money.  Anthem shares fell about 2 percent to $143.13 in New York trading.Anthem said it added 184,000 net new Obamacare members during the first quarter for a total of 975,000 members. Executives said it was too early to estimate the costs of its new Obamacare members, but that it expected to continue to break even or have small profits. It is aiming for 3 percent to 5 percent profit margins.  ""They are saying they are not seeing any issues, and so far so good on the exchanges...but they have to be cautious,"" Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said. Anthem said it is talking to the government about making changes to how customer risk is shared among insurers, the exceptions allowed for enrollment outside of the usual time, the grace period for non-payment of insurance premiums and new insurance products.Anthem's stance of sticking by the exchanges is not surprising, one analyst said.  ""They are definitely more aggressive on the exchanges.

149,"  NEW YORK Health insurer Cigna Corp plans to cut its customers' prescriptions for opioid treatments by 25 percent over the next three years, putting its weight behind a U.S. government battle against addictive pain killers.Cigna, whose plan to be acquired by Anthem Inc would make it part of the nation's largest health insurer, said  on Thursday it is backing efforts by state governments to require doctors to check state databases for high-risk customers before prescribing opioid drugs for longer than 21 days.U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this year asked Congress for $1.1 billion in new funding over two years to expand treatment for a spreading heroin and prescription pain killer epidemic.Some medical researchers believe an increase in opioid prescriptions over the past few years has caused many patients to become hooked and to seek heroin when their prescriptions expire. In 2014, a record number of Americans died from drug overdoses. As part of its plan, Cigna is to send doctors information from its own claims databases about its customers' prescription opioid use, enabling doctors to find out if prescriptions have been written elsewhere or if patients have been prescribed drugs to treat opioid addiction.It will also work with physicians to educate them on prescribing guidelines and access to medication-assisted therapy to treat substance use disorders, Cigna's Chief Medical Officer for Behavioral Health Dr. Douglas Nemecek said in an interview.  Nemecek said Cigna is considering the same types of measures that it has used to moderate use of many medications, including prior authorization, step therapy and the size of the co-pay. Over 250 million prescriptions are written each year for opioids, Nemecek said. He declined to provide the number attributed to Cigna customers.

But the bigger issue, she said, was that the companies' Fortune 500 clients might not be on board with the deal, based on feedback from antitrust and policy experts advising the government. Lekraj said he believed Anthem and Cigna still felt the need to get the deal done to maintain profits as the government worked to trim healthcare costs and lower reimbursement rates.""The Justice Department will ultimately approve the deal as long as management teams can get along and keep the deal intact, and egos don't work their way into the situation,"" he predicted.Both Cigna and Anthem declined to comment.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; editing by Michele Gershberg and Phil Berlowitz)",2016-05-23,ANTM,"Mon May 23, 2016 | 5:01pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Doubts mount over merger of health insurers Anthem, Cigna",http://www.reuters.com//article/cigna-ma-anthem-idUSL2N18K1LS?type=companyNews

Anthem shares fell 1.8 percent to $133.18.""The market is telling you that it feels the probability of the deal is significantly less than 100 percent,"" Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj said in a telephone interview. He declined to provide his own probability forecast.Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte on Monday estimated the deal had a less than 50 percent chance of closing, down from her previous view of 70 percent. She also lowered her stock price targets on both companies. Anthem's bid for Cigna followed close on the heels of Aetna Inc's (AET.N) proposed $34 billion purchase of Humana Inc (HUM.N). The two transactions would mark an unprecedented consolidation of the U.S. health insurance market to three major players from five.Anthem and Aetna argue that they need the greater scale to help curb mounting U.S. healthcare costs, both for hospital services and pharmaceutical prices. Both deals have faced close scrutiny from state and federal regulators over concerns that they may raise insurance costs for customers.

""We will protect the interests of the American people.""The deals would hurt consumers in the different markets served by the four companies, from medical coverage provided by large corporations to their employees to Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly and insurance sold to individuals on exchanges created under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, the Justice Department said.""We have no doubt that these mergers would reduce competition from what it is today,"" said Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General William Baer, who spearheaded the antitrust reviews.Merging Aetna's and Humana's Medicare Advantage businesses would create the largest U.S. manager of the healthcare insurance for seniors and the disabled.The Anthem deal for Cigna would create the largest U.S. health insurer by membership, with about 53 million members, surpassing UnitedHealth Group's 45.9 million as of June 30, and make it the leader in employer-based health insurance.Aetna and Anthem had each argued their proposed purchases would help lower prices for consumers by giving them greater leverage in negotiating with doctors and hospitals.AETNA VOWS LEGAL FIGHT Aetna and Humana said Thursday they plan ""to vigorously defend the companies' pending merger,"" worth $33 billion. Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said the company has proposed divesting enough assets to ensure competition in markets where it overlaps with Humana.""If we can't come to a negotiation on what markets to divest, although we have two very complete remedies in front of the Department of Justice now, I think I'm willing to let a judge decide,"" Bertolini told business news channel CNBC. ""We'll go all the way we need to to make this happen.""Anthem had a more muted response, saying it was committed to working toward a settlement with the Justice Department for its $45 billion transaction, but would challenge the lawsuit if necessary. Cigna said it was evaluating its options. It does not believe a deal would close before 2017, ""if at all.""After news of the lawsuit, Humana raised its 2016 earnings forecast, saying its core businesses, Medicare Advantage and Healthcare Services, are performing better than expected. Humana shares rose 8.3 percent.Cigna climbed 5.4 percent, Anthem closed up 2.6 percent and Aetna rose 1.6 percent. Speculation that the U.S. government would block both deals had weighed on shares of all four insurers for several weeks.Humana's raised forecast ""bodes well for the rest of the industry. Now you can expect the other guys to report good numbers and perhaps raise guidance as well,"" said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager for Gabelli Funds, which holds Cigna and Humana shares. ""There's somewhat of a relief rally, too, given that this has been an overhang for so long, particularly with Anthem and Cigna,"" he said.CONCERN FOR DIFFERENT CONSUMERS In the lawsuit against Aetna, the Justice Department cited specific concerns about damage to 1.6 million people in 364 counties who are customers of Medicare Advantage, the program that serves older people.It also said there were issues for the individual plans sold on Obamacare exchanges, where the government has sought to spur competition and keep prices low.About 20 state insurance departments were required to review the Aetna-Humana deal. Missouri came out firmly against it, while others, including California and New York, approved it after reaching a settlement. In the lawsuit against Anthem-Cigna, antitrust regulators said the combination would substantially lessen competition in an already consolidated industry, harming millions of Americans, doctors and hospitals.The Justice Department said it was concerned about the impact on the national corporate business, which serves large companies and which it said has only four competitors.It also said there were issues with local business markets, the individual Obamacare exchanges and the impact a combined company could have on contracts with doctors.The presidential campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton, who said when the deals were announced she was ""very skeptical"" they would benefit consumers, said Thursday they ""applaud"" the Justice Department's decision.""Hillary will continue to fight to reduce health costs and strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent corporations from gaining too much market power,"" Clinton policy adviser Ann O'Leary said in a statement.Doctors and hospitals had urged the Justice Department to try to block the deal, and some large employers were also against the combination.Aetna and Anthem had each proposed asset sales to the regulators, but they did not adequately address the loss of market competition, Baer said.Eleven states and the District of Colombia joined the Justice Department lawsuit against Anthem and Cigna; eight states and DC joined the lawsuit against Aetna and Humana.If the government successfully scuttles the deals, Anthem would owe Cigna $1.85 billion in breakup fees. Aetna would have to pay Humana $1 billion. If the deals fail for other reasons, the breakup fees would be different.The unusual move against two deals in the same industry represents a repeat of history for Baer, who headed the department's Antitrust Division until a short time ago and is now the No. 3 official in the Justice Department.In March 1998, Baer asked a court to stop a major consolidation of the U.S. drug wholesaling business.

180,"   By Bill Berkrot and Amrutha Penumudi  Health insurer Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) on Wednesday vowed to fight U.S. government efforts to block its planned acquisition of Cigna Corp (CI.N) and said it expects to lose money this year on its business selling individual health coverage under President Barack Obama's healthcare law.Anthem has argued that its planned $45-billion purchase of Cigna will give it greater leverage to negotiate better prices from healthcare providers and pass on those savings to consumers, including those signing up for ""Obamacare"" plans on public insurance exchanges.""To be clear, our board and executive leadership team at Anthem is fully committed to challenging the (U.S. Department of Justice's) decision in court,"" Chief Executive Joseph Swedish told analysts on a conference call.Anthem had previously said it expected to break even on its Obamacare business this year. But on Wednesday, the insurer said that business could decline by mid-single-digit percentages due to higher-than-expected costs of caring for those members. Shares in Anthem fell more than 2 percent. The company said it was ""focused on returning to profitability in 2017"" in its exchange business. Anthem said it now serves 923,000 public exchange members across 14 states in what it called a high-risk market.

Anthem said it expects the trial will likely begin in October and last about four months. But industry experts doubt the Cigna deal could still survive the legal challenge, and allow for only a slight possibility that Aetna could prevail in efforts to salvage the Humana purchase.""I think it's dead,"" Gupte said.

CURBING EXPENSES  The Cigna acquisition would create the largest U.S. health insurer by membership, with about 53 million members, and make it the leader in employer-sponsored health insurance.Anthem said it incurred higher-than-expected Medicaid claims, particularly from its new Iowa business, and higher costs from members with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and kidney disease, in the quarter.Excluding items, the company earned $3.33 per share in the second quarter, topping analysts' average expectations by 10 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue increased about 7.2 percent to $21.46 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $20.57 billion. The earnings beat was largely driven by lower general and administrative costs, the company said.Anthem reaffirmed its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings of greater than $10.80 per share, and raised its operating revenue outlook by $1.5 billion to $82.5 billion to $83.5 billion, reflecting strong enrollment trends.It expects 2016 total membership to be 1 million to 1.2 million higher than at the end of 2015.Anthem sees its medical loss ratio, the percent of premiums it spends on claims, to be about 84.9 percent.     Memberships in its government business, which includes Medicare and Medicaid plans, increased 6.5 percent. Enrollment grew 572,000 in the Medicaid business, the company said.

185,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit due to losses in its group disability and life business, and said it would look at acquisition targets if its proposed takeover by Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) did not materialize.U.S. antitrust authorities have sued to block Anthem's $54.2 billion acquisition of Cigna as well as Aetna Inc's (AET.N) bid for Humana Inc (HUM.N), saying the deals will reduce the number of big national insurers to three from five, hurting competition, inflating prices and stifling innovation.If the deal falls through, Cigna will have more than $5 billion in cash, which it will use to finance deals and share buybacks and to invest in its core business, the company said on a post-earnings call on Friday.Should the U.S. Justice Department succeed in blocking these deals, smaller mergers and acquisitions could follow, analysts have said. The most obvious targets are mid-sized players in government healthcare plans, such as Centene Corp (CNC.N), Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH.N) and WellCare Health Plans Inc (WCG.N).Cigna's shares, which have fallen about 12 percent since the Anthem deal was announced in July last year, slumped as much as 6.4 percent in morning trading on Friday.  WEAK QUARTER Cigna slashed its full-year forecast for adjusted income from operations to $7.75-$8.10 per share from $8.95-$9.35, saying it expected medical costs to rise further.  In the second quarter, medical loss ratio - the percent of premiums spent on claims - rose to 78.8 percent in its commercial business from 77.5 percent a year earlier.Like larger rivals UnitedHealth Group Plc (UNH.N) and Anthem, the company was hurt by losses in its individual insurance business, which sells plans under Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.Cigna said its group disability and life insurance business recorded a loss following modifications to its claims management process implemented earlier in the year. Cigna said shareholders' income fell 13 percent to $510 million, or $1.97 per share, in the quarter ended June 30.Excluding items, the company earned $1.98 per share, well below the average analyst estimate of $2.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose nearly 5 percent to $9.96 billion, but missed the average estimate of $9.97 billion.

The Justice Department filed lawsuits on July 21 asking a federal court to stop two huge mergers: Anthem's planned $45 billion purchase of Cigna as well as Aetna Inc's $33 billion planned acquisition of Humana.Anthem's lawyer, Christopher Curran, indicated during the hearing that the company was most concerned about the reviews on the merger in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia and New Hampshire.Lawyers for the Justice Department and Anthem both told her they were willing to discuss a settlement but neither indicated that talks were ongoing. ""There is absolutely a willingness"" to hold settlement discussions, said the Justice Department's Jon Jacobs, who added, however, that any proposed remedy would take time to evaluate.Anthem lawyer Curran said the company ""stands ready"" to discuss a settlement. Cigna is unlikely to agree to an extension of the April 30 deadline because of the two companies' contentious relationship, a lawyer for Anthem said last week.The Justice Department argues that the deals would reduce competition, raise prices for consumers and stifle innovation if the number of large, national insurers fell from five to three.If the mergers go through, No. 1 U.S. insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc would rank second after Anthem. Aetna would be No. 3.The trial on the Aetna deal is set for Dec 5.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Will Dunham)",2016-08-12,ANTM,"Fri Aug 12, 2016 | 12:49pm EDT",U.S. judge in Anthem merger trial plans ruling by late January,http://www.reuters.com//article/cigna-ma-anthem-idUSL1N1AT14X?type=companyNews

201,"   By Natalie Grover  Oct 7 Health insurer Anthem Inc said it would not cover the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug, developed by Sarepta Therapeutics Inc, calling it ""investigational and not medically necessary"".Bowing to pressure from patient advocates, the FDA approved the drug, Exondys 51, last month, even though an outside panel of experts and the agency's own reviewers questioned its efficacy.The accelerated approval is based on data believed to predict a clinical benefit. Sarepta has to prove that benefit in a subsequent clinical trial. Anthem, the second-largest health insurer in the United States, said on its website on Friday the drug's clinical benefit, including improved motor function, had not been demonstrated. (bit.ly/2e9qGhu)""Exondys 51 failed to show it improves health outcomes, and therefore it is not a covered benefit for our members,"" Anthem spokeswoman Leslie Porras said in an emailed statement on Friday. The drug treats a subset of patients with DMD, a rare, progressive genetic disorder that hampers muscle movement, eventually killing most patients by the age of 30. The subset includes about 13 percent of all DMD patients, or some 1,300 to 1,900 in the United States.Sarepta has priced Exondys 51 at about $300,000 per patient per year. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company's stock was down about 8 percent on Friday.""We hope that insurers will understand the unmet need in Duchenne and will allow physicians to use their professional opinions to prescribe and monitor the benefits of all approved drugs,"" said Debra Miller, CEO of non-profit organization CureDuchenne, which provided Sarepta early funding to develop the drug.

212,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and the U.S. Justice Department dug in their heels on Monday in court over whether the lower prices the health insurer expects to negotiate after buying smaller rival Cigna Corp (CI.N) are an efficiency that benefits customers or an antitrust violation.In the first phase of what could be a two-stage trial, a lawyer for Anthem argued that the $45-billion deal, which was announced more than a year ago, would create a new, bigger insurer with the power to push down prices that it would pass onto customers.But the Justice Department argued that any cost cuts would come from Anthem using its clout in the market to force hospitals and doctors to work for less.""Efficiencies don't count if the only way you get them is more market power,"" the Justice Department's attorney Jon Jacobs said in opening statements.Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia may opt to block the proposed deal if she decides it will mean higher prices for consumers or that it hurts suppliers. The Justice Department asked her to declare the deal illegal under antitrust law. The Justice Department's Jacobs argued that the deal would also lead to fewer companies selling health insurance to big, nationwide employers that need a broad network of services.  Fewer companies usually means higher prices for these big companies, and Anthem's lawyer Christopher Curran took issue with that idea. ""The notion that these Fortune 500 companies are going to be victimized here ... is not realistic,"" Curran said in court.Curran also argued that the Justice Department had failed to consider the new online private exchanges where corporations allow employees to choose from multiple insurers.Judge Jackson noted that the major insurance companies were the ones in the exchanges and asked: ""How's that the answer to the problem?"" The Justice Department's Jacobs noted the tough competition between the companies, referring to an Anthem document. ""It offered its sales force a bounty if they took business away from Aetna or Cigna,"" said Jacobs.The trial is expected to end by the end of the year.The Justice Department filed lawsuits on July 21 asking a federal court to stop the $45-billion purchase of Cigna and Aetna Inc's (AET.N) $33-billion planned acquisition of Humana (HUM.N), arguing that such consolidation among the largest health insurers would be anti-competitive. Anthem attempted to make the case that it was not truly a national insurance company because it is only in 14 states.Joseph Swedish, chief executive of Anthem, the largest member of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, testified that  he would be inclined to assist another so-called blue plan land a national contract in a way it would not help one of the other major companies.""If a blue plan reaches out to me to give help, I'll give help,"" Swedish said.

214,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and the U.S. Justice Department dug in their heels on Monday in court over whether the lower prices the health insurer expects to negotiate after buying smaller rival Cigna Corp (CI.N) are an efficiency that benefits customers or an antitrust violation.In the first phase of what could be a two-stage trial, a lawyer for Anthem argued that the $45-billion deal, which was announced more than a year ago, would create a new, bigger insurer with the power to push down prices that it would pass onto customers.But the Justice Department argued that any cost cuts would come from Anthem using its clout in the market to force hospitals and doctors to work for less.""Efficiencies don't count if the only way you get them is more market power,"" the Justice Department's attorney Jon Jacobs said in opening statements.Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia may opt to block the proposed deal if she decides it will mean higher prices for consumers or that it hurts suppliers. The Justice Department asked her to declare the deal illegal under antitrust law. The Justice Department's Jacobs argued that the deal would also lead to fewer companies selling health insurance to big, nationwide employers that need a broad network of services.  Fewer companies usually means higher prices for these big companies, and Anthem's lawyer Christopher Curran took issue with that idea. ""The notion that these Fortune 500 companies are going to be victimized here ... is not realistic,"" Curran said in court.Curran also argued that the Justice Department had failed to consider the new online private exchanges where corporations allow employees to choose from multiple insurers.Judge Jackson noted that the major insurance companies were the ones in the exchanges and asked: ""How's that the answer to the problem?"" The Justice Department's Jacobs noted the tough competition between the companies, referring to an Anthem document. ""It offered its sales force a bounty if they took business away from Aetna or Cigna,"" said Jacobs.The trial is expected to end by the end of the year.The Justice Department filed lawsuits on July 21 asking a federal court to stop the $45-billion purchase of Cigna and Aetna Inc's (AET.N) $33-billion planned acquisition of Humana (HUM.N), arguing that such consolidation among the largest health insurers would be anti-competitive. Anthem attempted to make the case that it was not truly a national insurance company because it is only in 14 states.Joseph Swedish, chief executive of Anthem, the largest member of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, testified that  he would be inclined to assist another so-called blue plan land a national contract in a way it would not help one of the other major companies.""If a blue plan reaches out to me to give help, I'll give help,"" Swedish said. Anthem shares closed up 1.5 percent at $137.36, while Cigna shares fell 1.2 percent to close at $137.08.
