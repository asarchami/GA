0,"  * 4th-qtr adjusted profit $1.10/share vs est $1.08* Plans to use proceeds to repay debt from Eagle Ford asset purchase* Canadian Natural says to sell or fold acquired royalty revenue into new vehicle* Devon shares rise 3 pct premarket* Capex seen slightly lower at $4.8 bln to $5.2 blnBy Swetha Gopinath and Anna DriverFeb 19 Devon Energy Corp said on Wednesday that it would sell some liquids-rich natural gas assets in Canada to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd for about $2.8 billion and posted a better-than-expected profit as it produced more profitable crude oil.Devon shares were up 3 pct while Canadian Natural's shares traded in Toronto rose 4.6 percent.Devon, along with many other U.S. oil and gas producers, has been selling off its natural gas holdings to focus on more profitable crude oil assets in North America.To help achieve that aim, Devon has made some radical changes, including the $6 billion purchase of oil-producing properties in the Eagle Ford formation in south Texas in November. ""We're not investing in gas properties or dry gas properties at this time,"" John Richels, Devon's chief executive officer told investors on a conference call.Devon said it plans to use proceeds from the asset sale to repay debt incurred in the Eagle Ford deal.This year, Devon expects to spend $4.8 billion to $5.2 billon, slightly lower than 2013, drilling wells in places that produce crude oil like Texas' Permian Basin.After the deal with Canadian Natural, Devon's only Canadian  assets are its Horn River gas holdings in northern British Columbia and heavy oil properties in Alberta.Devon is also looking to sell other non-core natural gas assets in the United States that produced 144,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. The company's oil production rose 17 percent to 177,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter output from its Permian Basin wells in Texas grew. This year oil production is forecast at 198,000 to 216,000 barrels per say, Devon said.""Our pursuit of oil production resulted in higher revenue and improved profitability,"" Richels told investors.Adjusted profit was $1.10 per diluted share. Analysts on average had expected $1.08, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. BIG DEAL The acquisition is Canadian Natural's largest since 1996, when it bought Anadarko Petroleum Corp's Canadian unit for $4.1 billion. It came as a surprise to most because the Devon assets are natural-gas rich and Canadian Natural has limited spending on its already substantial suite of gas assets because of low prices.But the company said it sees an opportunity to squeeze down costs on Devon's properties and boost production of valuable natural-gas liquids and oil.It also believes that gas prices may strengthen on depleted U.S. storage levels.""That helps the metrics of this deal but that's not the driver,"" Steve Laut, Canadian Natural's president, said on a conference call. ""It's the assets themselves and the ability to integrate those assets ... and just develop some light oil properties and liquids-rich natural gas on these properties that drive the acquisition.""Adding Devon's 383 million cubic feet per day of gas production will push Canadian Natural's output of the fuel to around 1.5 billion cubic feet per day, about the same as Encana Corp, now the largest producer of gas in Canada.""It's a good deal for them,"" said David McColl, an analyst with Morningstar. Price-wise it's a good deal and asset-wise.""The company said the acquired royalty revenue would either be folded into a new vehicle to provide steady cash flow to existing shareholders or be sold off later this year.Shares of Devon rose $1.93 to $64.84 in midday New York Stock Exchange trading.

3,"  (Corrects currency in paragraphs 1 and 4 to C$ from US$)Feb 19 Canadian Natural Resources Ltd  , the country's largest independent oil producer, said on Wednesday it would buy some of Devon Energy Corp's  liquids-rich natural gas assets in Canada for C$3.13 billion ($2.86 billion).The deal, which will immediately add to Canadian Natural's earnings and cash flow, excludes Devon's Horn River assets in northern British Columbia and heavy oil properties in Alberta.Canadian Natural said the acquired royalty revenue would either be folded into a new vehicle to provide steady cash flow to existing shareholders or be sold off later this year. The royalty revenue from the deal is expected to earn Canadian Natural about C$75 million in cash flow during 2014. The cash flow from the combined portfolio is expected to be between C$140 million and C$150 million this year.Devon said in November it planned to sell all of its Canadian gas assets, hit by years of low prices. Natural gas prices, which have risen recently due to cold weather in North America, have been weak over the past few years because of a flood of production from shale fields. Before royalties, the properties being acquired produce the equivalent of about 383 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (mmcf/d), 10,800 barrels per day (bpd) of light crude oil and 12,000 bpd of natural gas liquids.Under the agreement, Canadian Natural will also buy six natural gas plants, with gross processing capacity of more than 1,000 mmcf/d.The deal comes more than a month after Canadian Natural dropped plans to sell some of its shale gas-rich Montney properties, which straddle the border of northern Alberta and British Columbia, after failing to attract a suitable offer.

35,"  (Adds earnings estimates, industry context)Aug 4 Devon Energy Corp on Tuesday reported quarterly results that topped expectations as the oil and gas company with a focus on North America pumped a record amount of U.S. crude oil from shale basins in Texas and costs fell.Shares of Devon rose about 2 percent in after-hours trading.A more than 50 percent slide in crude from a year ago has oil companies drilling for oil in properties that have the highest returns while keeping a tight focus on cost-cutting. ""We made substantial progress reducing well costs and operating expenses,"" Dave Hager, Devon's chief executive officer said in a statement.The Oklahoma City, Oklahoma company had a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, or $6.94 per share, compared with a profit of $675 million or $1.64 per share in the same period a year earlier. The quarter's low oil prices prompted Devon to take a $2.6 billion after-tax charge related to asset writedowns. Excluding that and other items, Devon had a per share profit of 78 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 42 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total oil and gas production averaged 674,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), up 9 percent from a year earlier. Gains were fueled by output from the company's oil and gas properties in the Eagle Ford field in south Texas and the Permian Basin in the western part of the state.Shares of Devon ended at $48.74 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

A prolonged slump in global crude prices has triggered tens of thousands of job losses in the Canadian oil and gas industry as companies try to rein in spending.The Devon layoffs come after the completed expansion of the Oklahoma-based company's Jackfish oil sands project in northern Alberta, which has ramped up to around 75,000 barrels per day. In total, Devon produces 98,000 bpd in Canada. ""In the past two years, Devon has seen a significant reduction in capital spending in Canada as major projects, like Jackfish, have been completed. We expect capital to remain at lower-than-historic levels for the foreseeable future,"" Barber said.Earlier on Wednesday Calgary-based MEG Energy said it had cut around 30 percent of its workforce over the past year in a bid to cope with slumping crude prices.

Hedging disclosures serve as a leading indicator of drilling activity ahead and the expiry of positions points to a decline next year as low market prices offer little incentive for producers to ramp up programs.While it is unclear how quickly the lack of hedges affects output, financial statements already show a significant hit to earnings.Continental Resources, which made waves by selling its hedges last November when oil was around $80 per barrel, remains unhedged and while its third quarter output was up 25 percent from a year ago, crude and natural gas revenues fell 46 percent.While crude prices tumbled more than 60 percent from mid-2014 peaks, the market offered brief opportunities to lock in better prices and companies that failed to capitalize on those are now most exposed.One largely missed chance came when prices rallied to $60 a barrel in April. Another reprieve came in October when crude jumped more than 9 percent but hedging was, again, muted. Among firms that bolstered hedges the most in the third quarter is EOG Resources, which added nearly 5 million barrels to its hedge books mainly in the form of put options with a $45 floor price. Even so, the company's hedges do not go beyond 2015.Devon Energy, Whiting Petroleum, Hess  and Denbury Resources are among those that let the number of contracts fall the most. Devon and Hess are not hedged beyond 2015.Producers contacted by Reuters declined to discuss their hedging strategies.PAIN AHEAD  Hedges serve as an insurance, allowing producers to lock in prices at a set level; however, the cost of that insurance can rise as prices fall. That leaves some unprotected because of tight budgets, while others are willing to take a risk and bet that prices will recover next year.""Clearly, the decision has been made on behalf of many of these companies not to hedge or to hold off for now,"" said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group.Of the 30 analyzed companies, eight had no hedges going beyond 2015, including firms such as Devon, which let a large portion of hedges bought last year expire.While its chief executive voiced confidence last quarter that Devon would be able to raise output despite hedges rolling off, the company said in a quarterly filing that low prices and expiry of its hedges this quarter would impact its earnings.Cabot Oil and Gas, Hess and Apache  were also unhedged beyond year end, though it was not clear if those companies bought any new hedges in the fourth quarter.High-yield exploration companies have hedged only 35 percent of 2016 output by the third quarter, Citigroup said in a report, with the average price dropping by around $7 per barrel from the previous quarter.With some highly-leveraged drillers possibly facing tough bi-annual credit negotiations with lenders in April, analysts say producers will need any relief they can get.""Producers will have to look for targets to hedge when the market rallies,"" said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays. ""The pain is going to worsen ahead and it's going to be exacerbated by lower gas and (natural gas liquids) prices too.""(Reporting By Catherine Ngai; Editing by Jessica Resnick-Ault and Tomasz Janowski)",2015-12-14,DVN,"Mon Dec 14, 2015 | 1:00am EST","With oil hedges rolling off, US shale producers face stiff test",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-oil-hedging-idUSL8N13Z4K720151214?type=companyNews

58,"  Devon Energy Corp's (DVN.N) upsized $1.5 billion public share offering - the latest in a series of stock sales by U.S. oil producers - shows that companies with high quality assets and low debt are still able to attract investors.And for Devon itself, a successful sale is likely to mean that it keeps its investment grade rating, analysts said.Devon's shares fell nearly 6 percent to $19.21 in morning trading on Thursday, a day after the company announced the stock sale. Devon said it would offer 69 million shares, upsized by 25 percent from the originally planned 55 million shares.The offering, which was priced at a 7.8 percent discount to the stock's close on Wednesday, represents about 15 percent of the company's outstanding shares.""There is an appetite out there for equity, it seems. Investors want to get involved in these deals, especially if you're a long-term investor this is not a bad time,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets. ""But the market is not open to everyone,"" Sorbara said. ""It is open to the higher-quality, maybe mid-tier companies,"" he said, adding that low debt was the key factor. ""If your leverage is sub-2 times debt-to-EBITDA, investors are buying your stock.

Oklahoma City-based Devon said it would use the proceeds to boost liquidity, pay down debt and fund its budget.""Looking at the offer from a dispassionate perspective and assuming no change to their existing operating plan, near-term investor anxiety regarding Devon's ability to maintain their investment grade rating should be relieved,"" Simmons & Co analysts wrote in a note.

63,"  HOUSTON Devon Energy Corp will ramp up drilling and spending if oil prices continue to recover, executives said on Wednesday, joining a growing list of companies expecting an increase in activity as the commodity price picture improves.The Oklahoma City-based oil and gas driller could start adding incremental drilling activity if oil prices hit $50 a barrel and could double capital spending if they reach $60, Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager told investors on a conference call to discuss first-quarter results.It would ""probably take $60 oil or more to really get back to a capital spend level of close to $2 billion versus a $1 billion, where we're at now,"" Hager said. His comments come after rival producers Pioneer Natural Resources Co and Whiting Petroleum Corp said they could see a ramp-up of drilling and fracking, contributing to a growing consensus that a price rise above $50 could fuel a resurgence in the U.S. shale industry.U.S. oil prices have rebounded since hitting a trough just above $26 per barrel in February, and traded above $43 on Wednesday. [O/R] Devon shares slid 7 percent to $30.47. Devon had said it expected its 2016 oil output to exceed expectations by as much as 3 percent, even without additional capital spending. The company has also taken advantage of the recent price spike to hedge 25 percent of its expected 2016 oil output, using a ""collar"" strategy to guarantee a price floor of $39 a barrel and see benefits from spikes above $44 a barrel. Hager said the company had recently changed its hedging strategy, hedging some output each quarter on a ""consistent programmatic basis"" as far forward as six quarters, rather than relying solely on ""opportunistic"" hedges as it has historically.  Devon, which is active in the oil sands of Alberta, Canada, said operations were unaffected by the wildfires that swept the Fort McMurray area on Tuesday and Wednesday, prompting the evacuation of 88,000 people. The company posted a loss of 53 cents per share, excluding items, in the first quarter, less than analysts' consensus estimate of 64 cents. Revenue of $2.1 billion was below  expectations of $2.6 billion.

65,"   By Luc Cohen and Joshua Schneyer | NEWCASTLE, Okla.  NEWCASTLE, Okla. After intense lobbying, Oklahoma’s oilmen scored a victory two years ago. State lawmakers voted to keep in place some of the lowest taxes on oil and gas production in the United States - a break worth $470 million in fiscal year 2015 alone.The state’s schools haven’t been so fortunate. In Newcastle, 23 miles from the capital of Oklahoma City, John Cerny recently learned that the school attended by his five-year-old granddaughter, Adelynn, will open just four days a week next year. The Bridge Creek school district will slash spending because of a projected $1.3 billion state budget shortfall next year.Beth Lawton teaches first grade at Broadmoore Elementary in Moore, a city of 59,000  bordering the capital. In April, she and several colleagues were told their contracts won’t be renewed because of funding cuts. Broadmoore’s class sizes are expected to rise next year as a result.“I think our lawmakers have failed us, and I don’t understand how little they value education,” Lawton said. Oklahoma’s school-funding crisis is part of the pain inflicted by falling oil prices on energy-rich states across America that rely on natural-resources taxes to pay their governments’ bills. But the crisis in Oklahoma is especially dire, exacerbated by a legacy of large tax breaks bestowed upon oil companies.Before the recent 60 percent decline in oil prices, a drilling bonanza minted millionaires and billionaires in Oklahoma. The boom turned sleepy Oklahoma City into a thriving hub for drillers like Devon Energy (DVN.N), Chesapeake Energy (CHK.N) and Continental Resources (CLR.N) - the troika that lobbied hardest for the tax-break extension. The rebuilt downtown hosts top notch dining, hotels, arts venues, and a top NBA basketball team.But as private oil wealth created these emblems of prosperity, public services have come under severe strain. In contrast to other energy states, Oklahoma didn’t fill state coffers during flush years.Oklahoma taxed new oil and gas production from its prolific horizontal wells - the big money-makers of the fracking industry - at rates as low as 1 percent throughout the shale boom. In North Dakota’s giant Bakken oilfield, the going rate was 11.5 percent.MISSED OPPORTUNITY? The state actually began cutting back on funding for Oklahoma school children before the bust, and education funding is likely to contract much further, said Ryan Owens, a co-director at the Cooperative Council for Oklahoma School Administration, a professional association of educators.“Oil was $100 a barrel, and we still had less money per student,” Owens said. “We had an opportunity and we missed it.”Shale regions are hurting across the country. Since 2014, the U.S. energy industry has shed more than 100,000 jobs. But during the drilling spree of 2008 to 2014, oil-rich states like North Dakota and Texas saw a sharp rise in oil-and-gas tax revenue and salted away a chunk of it for education. Over the same period, Oklahoma’s oil and gas production tax revenue slid 32 percent, in spite of soaring oil prices and a doubling of oil output.“The state legislature can’t help when oil and natural gas falls,” said David Morrow, the Bridge Creek schools superintendent. “What has got the state of Oklahoma, in my opinion, is everything we gave away.”Oklahoma lawmakers voted on Thursday to eliminate a separate subsidy for the worst-performing wells in order to help plug the budget gap. While barely utilized during the boom years, the cost of that tax credit grew to more than $130 million in 2015, as sinking prices made more wells unprofitable. Overall, Oklahoma’s $3 billion education budget has been cut by $58 million since January. Though next year’s funding remains uncertain, the state’s projected 18 percent budget deficit has schools preparing for the worst.Across the state, at least 100 Oklahoma school districts are considering shorter weeks or school years, and 1,000 school jobs are at risk, according to the Cooperative Council.A SMILING BOY Among the hardship measures being implemented, according to recent school surveys: bigger class sizes, teacher pay cuts and hiring freezes, cutbacks in arts, athletics and foreign language instruction, fewer offerings for special needs and gifted students, and a moratorium on field trips. The Oklahoma oil industry is publicizing the role energy taxes play in helping fund schools. In March, a poster in the lobby of driller Continental Resources’ headquarters featured a smiling boy and read, “Oklahoma oil & gas produces my education.” Kristin Thomas, a spokeswoman for Continental, said the industry and its employees are the state’s largest bloc of taxpayers, while drillers pay billions more in royalties to landowners. She said tax breaks for other industries, such as wind energy, have hurt education funding.  “We don't have a revenue problem in Oklahoma,” Thomas said. “We have a spending problem.” The wind industry received tax credits and exemptions worth $306 million from 2004 to 2015, the Oklahoma Tax Commission said. State revenue data reviewed by Reuters show the horizontal-drilling tax breaks topped $1 billion between fiscal years 2012 and 2015 alone. Oklahoma’s education spending per pupil fell by 24 percent between 2008 and 2016, the biggest drop in the country, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington D.C. group that tracks budget and tax issues on behalf of low-income people. In North Dakota, where recent budget cuts have been less severe, spending per pupil grew 26 percent over the same period, the biggest gain in the country.Tax revenue on oil production helped North Dakota stash away more than $3.2 billion in an investment fund, in addition to $614 million set aside exclusively for schools. In Oklahoma, Governor Mary Fallin recently used the state’s $300 million rainy day fund for a $50 million “one-time fix” for public schools. Fallin declined an interview request. A spokesman said the tax breaks were created by her predecessors.A large portion of the tax on oil and gas production is funneled into Oklahoma’s General Revenue Fund, which provides schools with around half their funding. Many school districts also receive oil-production tax money directly, based on output in their counties.“HAPPY TO KEEP THIS AT ZERO” In 1994, Oklahoma began taxing new output from horizontal wells at just 1 percent, compared to 7 percent for conventional vertical wells. When the so-called incentive rates were first enacted, they were meant to be temporary support for what was then a nascent drilling technology. Horizontal wells have bores that extend lengthwise into reservoirs of oil and gas trapped in porous shale rock. The fossil fuels are typically unleashed by the process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking  - blasting the rock with a mixture of water and chemicals. Horizontal fracking wells have become central to the recent shale oil and gas boom in Oklahoma and around the United States.Over the years, Oklahoma’s lawmakers repeatedly extended the tax breaks on horizontal wells, even as the technology became common and far more productive, oil prices rose and output surged.  State tax regimes are often complex. In Oklahoma, horizontal wells were taxed at a discounted rate in their first years but subject to the nominal 7 percent rate after several years of production. The incentive rates were set to expire in 2015, a scenario that would have made all wells subject to 7 percent taxes through their lifespan.But the biggest drillers were keen to protect the reprieve from the higher rates: Horizontal wells often pump out their bounty quickly, generating their highest production by far during their first few years.So in 2014, the three big drillers made a lobbying push for lawmakers to make permanent the favorable tax treatment on early production.They had to fend off warnings about falling state energy tax revenues from critics of the breaks, such as Tulsa billionaire George Kaiser. Kaiser, whose interests include drilling, banking and philanthropy, urged lawmakers to let the tax breaks expire as planned. The benefits mainly went to out-of-state shareholders in oil companies, he told them, while ordinary Oklahomans paid the price through underfunded public services. Some lawmakers agreed. Mark McCullough was one of the few House Republicans to oppose extending the incentive. Horizontal drilling technology “is now very mature and widely used,” he said during the 2014 debate. “Is it really an incentive anymore? Or are we now getting into something else?” BIG BREAK Today, McCullough says, it’s clear that the enduring tax breaks were disastrous for state revenues, but a majority of lawmakers were quick to side with drillers during the boom. ""Oil and gas has a ton of weight, and by darn they wanted their credit,” McCullough told Reuters. “By golly they got their credit.”  To help win over lawmakers, Devon hosted dozens of them in its Oklahoma City skyscraper before the 2014 floor vote. The company had several talking points, according to state legislator Pat Ownbey, who attended the meeting. Among them: Higher taxes would only hurt state revenue, by prompting frackers to abandon Oklahoma for other states.   “While some may think that raising taxes on the oil and gas industry could provide additional funding for education, drilling less wells in the state will end up decreasing total revenue traditionally designated for education in the long-run,” Devon wrote in a later public statement. On April 29, 2014, three weeks before lawmakers voted to extend tax breaks, Fallin and Oklahoma’s finance secretary, Preston Doerflinger, held a private meeting at the governor’s mansion with Devon’s chairman and the chief executives of Chesapeake and Continental. The topic was oil production taxes, Doerflinger’s spokesman said.Those same companies were hoping for a 2 percent tax rate on horizontal wells for their first four years in operation, according to local media reports.   The following month, a 2-to-1 majority of Oklahoma lawmakers voted to tax all horizontal and vertical wells at 2 percent for the first three years of production. That’s when horizontal wells yield the most oil - and the most potential tax. After three years, output from a typical horizontal oil well in the state has declined by 86 to 89 percent from peak levels, according to industry consultant Drillinginfo.Drillers cheered the outcome, which was similar to their own proposal. For the first time, the vote would make the tax breaks permanent. Though it lifted the tax burden from 1 percent to 2 percent during a well’s early years, oil companies were now guaranteed some of the most driller-friendly rates in the country. Chesapeake declined to comment for this story. Devon referred Reuters to an industry trade group, the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association.""I PAY MY TAXES"" Its president, Mike Terry, said the low production taxes kept Oklahoma competitive and have helped make it “the most resilient in the nation at weathering the downturn in oil prices.” The number of rigs exploring for oil and gas in Oklahoma has fallen by 59 percent since late 2014, compared with a decline of 66 percent nationwide, he said.The legislative record shows that oil companies found a sympathetic audience at the capitol.“I find it odd that we’re thinking about castigating our number one industry instead of getting down and thanking them,” state representative Leslie Osborn said during a legislative debate before the vote. “I would have been happy to keep this at zero percent.” Osborn's district includes Oklahoma City, which in March announced plans to lay off 208 teachers and in April said it would fire 92 school administrators. The steps will save about $13 million a year. Osborn didn’t respond to requests for comment about the school cuts. Over Oklahoma’s boom period, energy production tax revenues fell instead of rising. The opposite happened in North Dakota and Texas, which saw big increases in revenue. In 2014, Oklahoma’s take was $860 million, down from a $1.3 billion peak in 2008.That’s partly because over time, more and more of Oklahoma’s production came from horizontal wells, taxed at the far lower rate.To be sure, lower natural gas prices also explain part of Oklahoma’s revenue crunch. Between 2008 and 2014, gas prices fell by around 50 percent, even as oil prices frequently topped the $100 a barrel mark. Still, the tax breaks alone cost Oklahoma around $800 million over the same period, according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute, a Tulsa think tank that draws some of its funding from Kaiser. Driller tax breaks have taken a toll in some other states. Louisiana exempts horizontal wells from tax for up to two years if drilling costs aren’t recouped first. The state’s Legislative Auditor said the breaks cost $1.1 billion from 2010 to 2014. But Louisiana hasn’t cut school funding as sharply as Oklahoma has. Per pupil spending is down 1.4 percent since 2008.  In Inola, Oklahoma, 30 miles east of Tulsa, 37-year-old machinist Jack Foster has four young sons enrolled in public school, where four-day weeks are already in effect. The family is unhappy about the cost cuts, and has to make alternative plans for the boys once a week.“I pay my taxes,” said Foster. “I want my kids to have a good education.”  (Edited by Michael Williams)",2016-05-17,DVN,"Tue May 17, 2016 | 3:23pm EDT","UPDATE 1-As oil boom goes bust, Oklahoma protects drillers and squeezes schools",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-oklahoma-bust-idUSL3N18E4G2?type=companyNews

To regain market share, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in late 2014 pumped more oil despite growing global oversupply. It aimed to drive prices lower and force higher-cost producers out of the market, with shale oil seen as especially vulnerable.The pain was acute. Industry revenue fell more than 30 percent in 2015 from the previous year, the U.S. drilling rig count dropped by more than 70 percent from when oil was still above $100 per barrel, stock valuations plunged and scores of small producers filed for bankruptcy. But so far no U.S. producer that pumps more than 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) has gone bankrupt. The survival of these big producers partly explains why overall U.S. production has slipped only about 10 percent since peaking at 9.69 million bpd.Their agility - which required slashing costs in half while doubling down on improved techniques to squeeze more oil from each new well - is now allowing the industry to cautiously focus on growth again.But this time, U.S. producers say they will stay focused on capital returns, having abandoned a culture of maximizing production regardless of costs.OPEC and Saudi Arabia ""thought that there would be major capitulation and damage to U.S. shale producers as a result of the deep downturn,"" said Les Csorba, a leadership consultant at Heidrick & Struggles who works with shale executives. ""But what happened was that it actually created a new paradigm among U.S. producers to transform their businesses.""

The company is using part of that cash to boost its capital budget by $200 million. WPX Energy Inc (WPX.N), which spent more on acquisitions last year than any U.S. oil company, sold 45 million new shares earlier this month, planning to use the funds to drill new Texas wells. ""We're a leaner organization than we were before the price crash,"" said Rick Muncrief, WPX's chief executive. True, costs were slashed in the height of the price downturn when oil plumbed $26 per barrel in February and ""there's a perception out there that if commodity prices go back up, you're going to lose those cost savings,"" Muncrief said.

83,"  TORONTO, July 12 Wolf Infrastructure, a midstream oil and gas firm backed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, is close to buying Devon Energy Corp's  50 percent stake in the Access Pipeline in Western Canada, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.The deal values Devon's stake in the Access Pipeline at as much as C$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) and could be announced as early as this week, the report said.CPPIB, which invests on behalf of Canada's national pension plan, has said it sees opportunities for long-term investors to take advantage of falling valuations in the energy sector due to a decline in the price of oil. If the acquisition materialises, it will be the third in the energy sector involving CPPIB in recent weeks.Teine Energy, a Saskatchewan-focused energy producer in which CPPIB holds a 77 percent stake, acquired assets from Canadian producer Penn West Petroleum in a C$975 million deal announced on June 11. Last week, Canadian oil producer Paramount Resources  agreed to sell some of its Deep Basin oil and gas properties in Alberta to Seven Generations Energy, in which CPPIB has a 16 percent stake, for C$1.9 billion.

Shares of U.S.-based Devon rose 2 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.""...Devon's divestiture program is now complete with proceeds totaling $3.2 billion, surpassing the top end of our $2 billion to $3 billion guidance range,"" Chief Executive Dave Hager said.Oil prices are yet to fully recover from the slump last year, forcing companies in the sector to sell non-core assets to lower debt and finance new projects. This has given investment companies, including CPPIB, a chance to buy assets at attractive valuations.  In the past month, CPPIB, which invests on behalf of Canada's national pension plan, has acquired assets from Canadian producers Penn West Petroleum Ltd (PWT.TO) and Paramount Resources Ltd (POU.TO) through companies it holds stake in.Devon will use the proceeds of the sale of stake in the Access pipeline to Wolf Midstream Inc to finance drilling activity in the U.S. shale fields, including the Stack basin in Oklahoma and the Delaware basin, Hager said.  The company will continue to use the pipeline, which carries heavy oil across northeastern Alberta, for a fee.

88,"   By Mike Stone and Devika  Krishna Kumar | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Acquisition-hungry energy companies are back on the prowl.Dealmakers have recovered from the shock of Britain's ""Brexit"" vote last month to leave the European Union and have resumed buying oil and gas fields in choice locations in Canada and the United States, restocking their inventories on a bet that a two-year slump in the price of oil has abated.""Buyers are increasingly confident in a stable to slowly increasing oil price - as are their funding sources, whether private equity funds or public market investors,"" said Bobby Tudor, chief executive of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, an oil and gas investment bank.Oil prices CLc1 have held steady at or above $45 a barrel for a majority of the last two months and touched a 2016 high above $51, ahead of the British referendum.Tudor said buyers were banking on it eventually settling at around $60 a barrel, giving them confidence about buying drilling acreage in some of the nation's shale heartlands.U.S. oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O) last week said it would spend $560 million buying leases on oil-rich land in the Southern Delaware Basin, within the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, where initial production results have been strong and costs are coming down.A day later, U.S. energy company Laredo Petroleum Inc (LPI.N) said it would spend $125 million buying acreage in the Midland Basin, also part of the Permian.These deals mark a resumption in buying after Brexit caused a temporary lull in acquisitions.Before the British referendum on June 23, buyers and sellers had grown comfortable with the idea that oil had rebounded from 12-year lows. That conviction helped to unclog the acquisition pipeline after a long-dormant period in which deals were offered but failed to materialize.About $5.1 billion of U.S. and Canadian properties traded hands in June, the largest dollar amount in more than a year according to PLS Inc, global M&A database for such deals.Acreage deals create confidence and open the door to acquisitions of entire companies, so long as oil remains relatively steady, according to nearly a dozen dealmakers interviewed by Reuters.More acreage deals are in the works, including ones that involve large exploration and production (E&P) companies such as Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Southwestern Energy Co  (SWN.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Restructuring bankers and attorneys anticipate that exploration and production companies that have emerged from bankruptcy, like Magnum Hunter Resources, or are going through the process, like Ultra Petroleum Corp [UPLMQ.PK], will be merger and acquisition targets for other oil and gas companies because they are financially healthy, having eliminated much of their debt.Magnum Hunter and Ultra Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Publicly traded companies are warming up to deals now, a change from when deals were mainly stagnant or acreage was sold to private equity firms in small transactions. Traditional E&P companies dominated acquisition activity in the second quarter, representing 69 percent and 76 percent of total transactions and deal value, respectively, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday.PRICE AND PRIME LOCATIONS The key dynamic that has developed and allowed buyers and sellers to get back to cutting deals is price.  Greater stability around the price of oil has enabled both sides to negotiate, where previously expectations of further falls kept them apart.Leading into the spate of deals in June was a nine-week period of relatively low oil volatility, when prices rose about 20 percent and traded between about $40 and $50 a barrel.  Transactions in June occurred at prices about 10 percent higher than the far forward crude price for three years out CLc36, according to bankers. That implies that buyers and sellers could agree upon a price of about $60 per barrel, the bankers said.That forward price has now returned to its pre-Brexit levels of about $54 a barrel, enabling deals once again.Another key ingredient for completed deals was their location. Many of the sales occurred in areas with the highest margins where pumping at about $50 per barrel is profitable. The acreage most sought-after is in Texas' Permian Basin and in Oklahoma's STACK area (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties), popular because of their easy-to-extract rock formations and relatively low break-even prices.     In June, Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) said it would spend about $888 million to acquire STACK acreage and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) said it would sell Texas acreage to Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) and an undisclosed buyer for $858 million.HOPING FOR HIGHER OIL PRICES     While there could be hurdles such as resurgent output and deceleration in demand growth over the next few months, many producers are more bullish on the prices of oil long-term.""Investors have become overly bearish on oil as concerns over rising U.S. rig activity and high fuel inventories raised doubts about the rebalancing of the market. We think those concerns are unwarranted,"" ANZ said in a note.""We think any further decline in prices will accelerate the supply closures again and set the stage for an even stronger price recovery in 2017.""On Friday, U.S. oil prices ended the week 1 percent higher.
