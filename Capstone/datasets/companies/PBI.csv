0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 31 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI) and its subsidiary, Pitney Bowes  International Holdings, Inc. (PBIH) at â€˜BBB-â€™. The Rating Outlook has been  revised to Stable from Negative. The Stable Outlook reflects the actions taken  by Pitney Bowes to reduce debt and leverage and improve its operations. A full  list of ratings actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are supported by: the significant and entrenched market position in  the core U.S. Mailing business; the necessity of mail equipment and services to  conduct business across all industries; the diversity of the companyâ€™s customer  base, from both an industry and size perspective. PBI has stated its commitment to investment grade metrics, although these  metrics and their levels have not been defined. Fitch believes that the actions  taken in 2013 demonstrate that PBI is committed to maintaining investment grade  ratings. These actions include the reduction in its quarterly dividend from  $0.375 to $0.1875 per share, a 50% reduction, resulting in a saving of  approximately $150 million per year. In addition, the company used proceeds from  the sale of its Management Services business to redeem its $300 million in  senior notes due in 2014. Over the last two years, PBI has reduced its total debt from $4.5 billion in  2011 to $3.6 billion at the end of 2013 (totals include PBIHâ€™s preferred  security). Fitch calculated unadjusted gross leverage has declined from 4.7x in  2011 to approximately 4.3x (leverage metrics for both periods are pro forma for  operating divestures), and core leverage has declined a full turn over the same  period. Fitch expects 2014 year-end total leverage to remain at 4.3x.  Fitch is not expecting material acquisition or share buyback activity, and there  is limited room within the ratings for any share buyback activity. Any  debt-funded share buyback activity or a material debt funded acquisition would  be outside of current ratings.  Fitch continues to be concerned with the continued revenue declines. Enterprise  business ended the 2013 year up 3.5% and digital commerce solutions was up 3.1%.  However, these gains were unable to fully offset the declines in the North  American small- and medium-sized businesses, which was down 5.3%. Total revenue  for 2013 was down 1.3%. Fitch notes that in the last three quarters, PBI has  delivered positive year-over-year revenue growth in equipment sales. Continued  positive growth in equipment sales could lead to improved financing, rental and  supply revenues. PBI has provided revenue guidance of down 1% to up 2%, on a  constant currency basis; Fitch believes this is achievable. There is limited  room in the ratings for PBI to fall short on these revenue expectations.  Ratings concerns include the secular and cyclical pressures inherent to the  business and top-line declines. The ratings also consider event risk, faced by  bondholders of all companies faced with secular challenges and underperforming  equity, of a potentially more aggressive financial policy and capital structure.  Fitch believes cyclical pressures accelerate the well-documented secular  challenges, as customers could look to digital mailing as a cost-reduction  mechanism, and choose to keep existing equipment. The acceleration of digital  substitution for physical transaction mail results in reduced need for PBIâ€™s  mailing equipment. Although the majority of PBIâ€™s revenue is not directly tied  to mail volume, Fitch believes continued mail volume declines could drive  reduced equipment needs, whether in terms of size, number or functionality.  PBIâ€™s initiatives to position itself more as a digital and services company  could gain traction. That said, in the near term, these initiatives will be  challenged in offsetting the declines in the high-margin North American mailing  space. These products could cannibalize existing physical business, but Fitch  believes such a strategy is unavoidable, given ongoing digital substitution. Liquidity Pitney Bowesâ€™ liquidity position at Dec. 31, 2013 was solid, consisting of: $908  million of cash; and an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility maturing in  April 2016, which backstops the companyâ€™s $1 billion commercial paper program.  Liquidity is further supported by the companyâ€™s annual free cash flow (FCF)  generation. Fitch calculates estimates 2013 FCF at approximately $300 million. Fitchâ€™s  current base case projections estimate annual FCF at $200 million-$250 million  for the next few years. Fitchâ€™s FCF calculation deducts Pitney Bowes common and  preferred dividend payments and does not add back cash flows associated with  restructuring payments, and tax payments related to sales of leveraged lease  assets. Pitney Bowes faces material annual maturities over the next several years.  However, Fitch recognizes that the company can address a significant portion of  its maturities organically with its pre-dividend FCF generation. As of Dec. 31, 2013, Pitney Bowesâ€™ total debt was $3.6 billion. Fitch estimates  that this consists of:  --$3.1 billion of senior unsecured debt, maturing between 2015-2022 ($2.2  billion), one maturing in 2037 ($500 million) and one maturing in 2043 ($425  million);  --$230 million in term loans due in 2015/2016;  --$300 million of variable-term voting preferred stock in the companyâ€™s  subsidiary, PBIH. Under Fitchâ€™s hybrid security criteria, Fitch assigns 0%  equity credit given the less than five-year maturity (based on the October 2016  call date).  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Given the secular challenges facing the company, Fitch does not expect  positive rating momentum in the near term. Sustainable revenue growth driven by  the companyâ€™s various product initiatives coupled with a commitment to continue  reducing absolute levels of debt may drive positive rating momentum.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --Lack of traction in the companyâ€™s digital initiatives and other growth  businesses amid ongoing declines in the traditional physical business. Also,  sustained revenue declines in the mid- to high-single-digits would pressure the  ratings;  --A sustained increase in total leverage from current levels, whether the result  of incremental debt or lower EBITDA; --Indications of a more aggressive financial policy.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Pitney Bowes --IDR at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Senior unsecured term loan at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Senior unsecured notes at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Short-term IDR at â€˜F3â€™; --Commercial paper at â€˜F3â€™. PBIH --Long-term IDR at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Preferred stock at â€˜BBâ€™. The Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative.

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Pitney  Bowes' (PBI) $500 million senior unsecured notes due 2024. PBI and its  subsidiary, Pitney Bowes International Holdings, Inc. (PBIH) have an Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. The new notes will rank pari passu with existing senior unsecured securities.  The proposed notes include a change of control put offer of 101% upon a change  of control and subsequent downgrade of the notes to non-investment grade. A change of control includes any person/entity acquiring 50% or more of the voting  control of the company, majority of directors of the board cease to be  continuing directors, or a sale 85% or more of PBI's total consolidated assets  in one, or a series, of transactions. The proposed notes also include a  limitation on liens of up to 15% of consolidated net tangible assets (in  addition to standard carve outs). The proceeds of the new notes are expected to fund a cash tender offer  (announced yesterday) for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of notes  with the following order of priorities: 1) 5.25% notes due 2037, $500 million outstanding; 2) 5.75% notes due 2017, $500 million outstanding; 3) 4.75% notes due 2016, $371 million outstanding; 4) 4.75% notes due 2018, $350 million outstanding; 5) 5.60% notes due 2018, $250 million outstanding. The tender offer expires on March 31, 2014. Notes that are tendered on or before  March 17, 2014 would receive an additional $30 in premium for every $1,000  tendered. Total consideration for the Notes due 2037 (Priority 1 Notes) is  $1,110 ($1,080 excluding the premium described above). Total consideration for  Priority Notes 2 to 5 will be based upon a fixed spread over the yield to  maturity of applicable U.S. Treasury Securities as specified in the Offer to  Purchase and Letter of Transmittal documents.  Fitch views the transaction as credit neutral as pro forma credit metrics remain  materially unchanged. If all of the 2037 notes accept the tender offer, $500  million in debt will shift to an earlier maturity bucket. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are supported by: the significant and entrenched market position in  the core U.S. Mailing business; the necessity of mail equipment and services to  conduct business across all industries; and the diversity of the company's  customer base, from both an industry and size perspective.

5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Pitney Bowes Inc. and its subsidiary Pitney Bowes International  Holdings, Inc. (PBIH) at 'BBB-' and revised the Rating Outlook to Negative from  Stable.  Fitch has also assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Pitney Bowes Inc.'s (PBI) $600  million of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due 2021. Net offering proceeds are to  be used to repay $300 million of existing 6.125% preferred stock callable in  October 2016 and for general corporate purposes including potential debt  repayment.  A full list of ratings actions follows at the end of this release. The Negative Outlook reflects PBI's gross leverage exceeding Fitch's negative  rating threshold of 4.0x. Fitch would likely stabilize the Outlook if the  company reduces leverage below 4.0x either through debt repayment or EBITDA  growth. Although Fitch views actions taken by the company including divesting  underperforming assets and consequent debt reduction as positive, continued  headwinds in mailing and software contribute to the Negative Outlook. Fitch believes the ongoing secular issues will challenge the company's ability  to maintain a credit profile indicative of an investment grade rating. If these  issues continue over the near-term, Fitch will likely reconsider the current  4.0x maximum total leverage threshold for the current rating, which would  increase negative rating pressure. KEY RATING DRIVERS Market Leadership: The ratings are supported by PBI's significant and entrenched  market position in the core U.S. Mailing business, the necessity of mail  equipment and services to conduct business across all industries, and the  diversity of the company's customer base, from both an industry and size  perspective. Top Line Declines: Fitch continues to be concerned with overall top-line  declines, driven by weakness in its small and medium-sized business (SMB)  segment, although the declines have been moderating. In constant currency  revenue, SMB ended the 2015 fiscal year down 5%, driven by continuing declines  in installed meters and weakness in international markets. The Enterprise  business was flat, as lower service revenue in production mail was partially  offset by increased volumes in presort services. Digital commerce solutions  increased 9%, driven by the acquisition of Borderfree, Inc. and higher volume of  packages shipped from the U.K. Within Digital commerce, software revenues  declined 10% on a reported basis in 2015 due to sales execution issues. Cyclical Pressures Compound Secular: Fitch believes secular pressures accelerate  PBI's challenges, as customers could look to digital mailing as a cost-reduction  mechanism, and choose to keep existing equipment. The acceleration of digital  substitution for physical transaction mail results in reduced need for PBI's  mailing equipment. Although the majority of PBI's revenue is not directly tied  to mail volume, Fitch believes continued mail volume declines will drive reduced  equipment needs, whether in terms of size, number or functionality. Transition Underway: Fitch views PBI's initiatives to position itself more as a  digital services company positively, and they continue to show traction. For FY  2015, Digital Commerce Solutions constituted 21% of total revenue, up from 14%  in FY 2014. However, in the near term, these initiatives will be challenged to  offset the declines in the high-margin North American mailing segment. While  these initiatives could cannibalize existing physical business, Fitch believes  such a strategy is unavoidable, given ongoing digital substitution. Conservative Financial Policy: Although PBI has stated its commitment to  investment grade metrics, they have not publicly defined metrics. Fitch believes  that various actions taken over the last few years demonstrate PBI's commitment.  PBI has reduced its total debt (including preferred securities) from $4.5  billion in 2011 to $3.4 billion at June 30, 2016. Unadjusted pro forma gross  total leverage has declined from 4.7x in 2011 to approximately 4.3x and core  leverage has gone from 4.3x to approximately 3.9x pro forma for the issuance  (assuming the remaining $300 million of net proceeds is used for debt repayment  after the preferred stock is repaid). KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for PBI include: --flat to low single digit top line improvement on a constant currency basis; --Minimal margin improvement as a majority of the company's expected cost  savings have been realized; --No material change to stated dividend;  --$215 million of share repurchases in 2016; --Majority of maturities are refinanced. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Given the secular challenges facing the company, Fitch does not expect  positive rating momentum in the near term. Sustainable revenue growth driven by  the company's various product initiatives coupled with a commitment to continue  reducing absolute levels of debt may drive positive rating momentum. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --Lack of traction in the company's digital initiatives and other growth  businesses amid ongoing declines in the traditional physical business; --A change in the company's strategy indicating a willingness to operate above  4.0x; --Indications of a more aggressive financial policy. LIQUIDITY PBI's liquidity position at June 30, 2016 was solid, consisting of $676 million  of cash on hand and an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility maturing in  January 2020, which backstops the company's $1 billion commercial paper program.  Liquidity is further supported by the company's annual FCF generation. Fitch calculates FY 2015 FCF at $180 million. Fitch's current base case  projections estimate annual FCF at $150 million-$250 million for the rating  horizon. Fitch's FCF calculation deducts PBI's common and preferred dividend  payments and does not add back cash flows associated with restructuring  payments, and tax payments related to sales of leveraged lease assets. PBI faces  material annual maturities over the next several years. However, Fitch  recognizes that the company can address a significant portion of its maturities  organically with its pre-dividend FCF generation and accessing the capital  markets. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the ratings for Pitney Bowes Inc. as follows: --$600 million senior unsecured notes due 2021 'BBB-'; Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows: Pitney Bowes --IDR at 'BBB-'; --Senior Unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured term loan at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Commercial paper at 'F3'.
