0,"  WASHINGTON Jan 2 Citigroup Inc. paid $250 million to taxpayer-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to settle a lawsuit over soured mortgage securities, the regulator of the two housing finance firms said on Thursday.General Electric Co. also paid $6.25 million to settle a similar suit, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said in a statement. Ally Financial Inc, the former parent of bankrupt Residential Capital LLC, paid $475 million.Citi, GE and Ally had previously settled the claims in 2013, but none had disclosed the financial terms.The banks are among 18 financial institutions that were sued in 2011 for allegedly misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the biggest provider of housing finance in the United States, into buying more than $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. Six institutions have since settled the accusations. GE and Citi were the first two to resolve the claims in early 2013, but the FHFA kept the terms confidential as they negotiated additional settlements.In October, JPMorgan agreed to pay $4 billion to resolve its lawsuit, and in December, Deutsche Bank entered a $1.9 billion accord with the agency. A seventh bank, Wells Fargo, which the FHFA never formally sued, also paid $335 million in November to resolve similar claims.In total, the U.S. has recouped nearly $8 billion through the settlements, the housing regulator said. The lawsuits accused the firms of violating securities laws and in some cases, committing fraud. The settlements came as the institutions suffered a series of disappointments in the litigation, failing to win dismissal of the lawsuits, among other setbacks.The deals are expected to be reflected in financial statements for Fannie and Freddie some time this year. If they wind up boosting earnings, profits will go straight to the U.S. Treasury in the form of dividend payments.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently back about half of existing U.S. home loans, were seized by the government in 2008 as mortgage losses mounted. They have received $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds to stay afloat, while paying about $185.2 billion in dividends to the government for that support.The two taxpayer-owned mortgage finance firms have rebounded to profitability as the housing market has recovered.",2014-01-02,GE,"Thu Jan 2, 2014 | 12:55pm EST",UPDATE 1-Citigroup paid $250 mln to resolve U.S. mortgage suit,http://www.reuters.com//article/citi-fhfa-idUSL2N0KC0O720140102?type=companyNews
1,"   By Andrea Shalal-Esa | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday issued a rare emergency order aimed at blocking the illegal re-export of two large, used U.S.-built commercial jet engines to Iran by a company based in Turkey.Assistant Commerce Secretary David Mills, who oversees export enforcement, signed the order on Friday after learning that Turkish-based 3K Aviation Consulting & Logistics planned to re-export two engines built by General Electric Co to Iran on Tuesday using Pouya Airline, an Iranian cargo airline.There has been a warming in U.S.-Iranian ties this year, including a November 24 deal to curb the Iranian nuclear program, but most exports to Iran remain strictly banned under U.S. law.The order, which will be in effect for 180 days, includes sweeping consequences for 3K Aviation, Pouya Airline and Adaero International Trade, the Illinois-based company that the department said had shipped the used aircraft engines to Turkey.The order bans all three companies and their key officers from engaging in negotiations, trade, transport or other activities involving any U.S. export-controlled items, not just the aircraft engines in question.The order also applies to banks, insurance companies and other parties that might be involved in financing or otherwise supporting any such transactions.The department issues one or two such orders a year, said one Commerce Department official. Sadettin Ilgin, managing director of Adaero International, denied any wrongdoing, and said he had been in touch with U.S. and Turkish authorities to clear his company's name.Ilgin told Reuters the company had documentation showing that it sold the engines, which came from Turkish Airlines, to International Aerospace Group, a U.S.-based company, for $4.1 million, and then shipped them from Istanbul, Turkey, to Frankfurt, Germany, in late December.He said he had expected the engines to be sent to Russia for use by Siberian Air and was shocked when he received the U.S. order aimed at blocking their transfer to Iran.""We did not sell the engines to 3K,"" said Ilgin, who worked for Turkish Airlines for 40 years. ""This was all done properly and we have the paperwork to show it."" Ilgin said Turkish officials had assured him that they had denied permission for Pouya Airline to pick up the engines in Antalya, southwestern Turkey. Officials at 3K told him they planned to send the engines back to Germany, he told Reuters.No comment was immediately available from 3k Aviation or from International Aerospace Group.A Commerce Department official declined comment on whether Turkey was cooperating with the U.S. government on the issue and how the department had learned about the planned transfer.GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the company had not been informed about the Commerce Department order. The engines in question were used and GE was not involved in their sale. It was not immediately clear what type of engines might have been involved in any previous transport by Pouya.The Commerce Department official declined comment on whether the U.S. government was investigating possible earlier illegal exports of U.S.-built engines to Iran by 3K Aviation.In the order, the Commerce Department said it could issue a temporary export ban if a violation of U.S. law appeared imminent, as in this case.In signing the order, Mills said the department's Bureau of Industry and Security had presented evidence that two GE CF6 engines were transported to 3K Aviation in Turkey on behalf of Adaero International and that 3K planned to send the engines to Iran using Pouya Airline on January 7.Two sources familiar with the aircraft engine market said the engines were likely intended for use on Airbus planes operated by Iran.Previous cases have led to criminal and civil charges against companies that re-exported goods to Iran.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; editing by Ros Krasny and Leslie Adler)",2014-01-06,GE,"Mon Jan 6, 2014 | 3:27pm EST",U.S. acts to block Turkish firm from sending GE engines to Iran,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-turkey-iran-engines-idUSBREA050ZB20140106?type=companyNews

AmEx jumped 3.6 percent to $90.97 a day after reporting quarterly results. Intel's stock slid 2.6 percent to $25.85 and was among the top weights on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes, a day after the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue and posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a penny.General Electric shares dropped 2.3 percent to $26.58 after the conglomerate reported disappointing 2013 profit margins.But at least some of the day's move could have been options related.""January options expiration tends to be among the most volatile, and today's an example of that,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist of Delta Global Asset Management in Boston.

Shares of United Parcel Service Inc fell 0.6 percent to $99.91 and the stock of Con-Way dropped 2 percent to $40.59 after fourth-quarter outlooks.After the S&P 500's 30 percent surge in 2013, largely due to stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the benchmark index started the year on a weak note. But the S&P 500 recovered recently to set a record closing high on Wednesday.The economy, expected to show further signs of recovery as the Fed slowly withdraws its stimulus, gave reassuring signs.

18,"  WASHINGTON Jan 23 The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday said that General Electric Hitachi Nuclear Energy Americas LLC has agreed to pay $2.7 million to resolve allegations that it made false claims to U.S. regulators about a nuclear reactor component.GE Hitachi, headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina, is a subsidiary of the conglomerate General Electric Co and  partially owned by Japan's Hitachi Ltd.The company allegedly made false statements to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy between 2007 and 2012 about the advanced nuclear Economic Simplified Boiling-Water Reactor (ESBWR), known as the steam dryer. The settlement made no determination of liability on the company's behalf.The NRC requires that applicants for nuclear reactor design certification show that vibrations caused by the steam dryer will not result in damage to a nuclear plant. The government alleged that GE Hitachi concealed known flaws in its analysis of the steam dryer, falsely represented that it had properly analyzed the dryer, and had verified the accuracy of its modeling using reliable data. ""Transparency and honesty are absolutely critical when dealing with issues relating to the design of a nuclear reactor,"" said Stuart Delery, assistant attorney General for the Justice Department's Civil Division.The lawsuit is captioned United States ex rel.

19,"   By Stephen Eisenhammer | NEWCASTLE, England  NEWCASTLE, England Jan 23 General Electric's oil and gas division will start pilot production of 3D printed metal fuel nozzles for its gas turbines in the second half of this year, a major step towards using the technology for mass-manufactured parts in the industry.Full production of the printed fuel nozzles is expected in 2015, Eric Gebhardt, Chief Technology Officer at GE Oil & Gas , told Reuters.The move follows hot on the heels of GE Aviation, which said last year it would use 3D printing to produce fuel nozzles for its LEAP jet engine, a high profile decision that for many sealed the commerciality of the technique.Oil services firm Halliburton has also used 3D printing to produce parts used in drilling although not on such a large scale.Forms of advanced manufacturing are increasingly vital in the oil and gas sector as companies move into extreme environments such as ultra deep-water or the Arctic.3D printing allows complex shapes to be built up in layers from particles of plastics or metal, enabling engineers to realise designs impossible to mass-manufacture before.GE Oil and Gas, one of GE's fastest growing divisions, is investing $100 million over the next two years on technology development with a ""significant portion"" going on 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing. The division has installed dozens of plastic and metal 3D printers across its businesses. Fuel nozzles, which feeds combustion in a gas turbine, are currently made by welding together a number of sub-components, a process hugely simplified by printing it in one piece.The other piece of kit that GE Oil and Gas is looking to produce using 3D printers is electric submersible pumps used to artificially bring oil to the surface.""Most of these are about four or five inches in diameter and then about an inch or two in height. It's the right size to put into some of the additive manufacturing,"" Gebhardt said.RAPID PROTOTYPING  The technology is still mainly used for prototyping, but even in this seemingly basic use, improvements can be dramatic.At GE's pipeline inspection plant in Newcastle, where monitoring robots known as pigs are assembled, the design loop which once took 12 weeks is now done in 12 hours thanks to an on-site 3D printer the size of a hotel minibar fridge.Pigs are custom designed to deal with the particular pipeline, whether it be hundreds of metres under the sea or full of corrosive sour gas. Trial parts can now be printed on location, in plastic, to see whether they fit and work properly. Only then is the part  ordered, paid for and delivered in the final material.For senior engineer Dave Bell the printer is one of the biggest shifts he has seen in his 30 years at the site.""It's a game changer,"" he said. ""Engineering is all about compromise and this allows you to trial concepts quickly and cheaply.""But challenges remain, predominantly around the size that can be printed and the surface finish produced.""Now we're going to have to see how large they can get over time,"" Gebhardt said. ""Will it follow Moore's law where it is going to double in size every 18 months? That's kind of what we're seeing right now. But when is it going to reach a natural inflection point? That's something we have to work through.""For Richard Hague, a professor at Nottingham University and an expert in additive manufacturing, the size of much of the equipment used in the oil and gas industry is simply too big.""It's cost effective if it's small and complicated, but when it's large and complicated it's much less effective.""",2014-01-23,GE,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 8:53am EST",Oil industry joins world of 3D printing,http://www.reuters.com//article/ge-3dprinting-idUSL5N0KW2OA20140123?type=companyNews

22,"   By Roberta Rampton | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON President Barack Obama on Friday took steps to get businesses and the federal government to hire more of the long-term unemployed, part of his initiatives to get the jobless back to work.""Just because you have been out of work for a while does not mean that you are not a hard worker,"" the president said at an event at the White House. ""It just means you had bad luck or you were in the wrong industry or you lived in a region of the country that's catching up a little slower than others in the recovery.""The president met with the leaders of more than 20 big companies which have agreed not to discriminate against the long-term unemployed and signed a memo directing government agencies not to use long-term unemployment as a basis for denying someone a job.""It's a cruel catch-22,"" the president said. ""The longer you're unemployed, the more unemployable you may seem.""The companies whose leaders Obama met are among about 300 which have agreed to a one-page list of best practices for recruiting people who had been without a job for six months or more, a group which has struggled to find work despite an improving economy.""It's saying that those who are long-term unemployed should get a fair shot,"" said Gene Sperling, Obama's top economic advisor.The U.S. jobless rate has remained stubbornly high at 6.7 percent, but Sperling told reporters the rate would be closer to 5 percent were it not for the barriers to finding work for the long-term unemployed.""We are trying to address what we feel is the heart of that negative cycle, which is the potential stigmatization of people merely for the sake that they are long-term unemployed,"" said Sperling, director of the National Economic Council.The meeting follows a promise by Obama to take steps to improve the economy despite a reluctance by Republicans in Congress to agree with other parts of his plan. Among those attending are the chief executives of eBay Inc, Boeing Corp, Bank of America Corp, McDonald's Corp, Marriott International and Walgreen Co, among others, the White House said in a statement on Friday ahead of the gathering.Obama has tried, but so far failed, to convince Congress to extend jobless benefits for people who have been seeking work for more than six months.Benefits for 1.6 million Americans have expired since the end of 2013, numbers that could swell to 4.9 million people by the end of 2014 unless legislation is passed.DEMORALIZING Research by the University of Toronto, McGill University and the University of Chicago which indicated a bias against long-term unemployed helped convince the White House to act. The researchers used 12,000 fictitious resumes to respond to real job openings in 100 cities. Some of the invented candidates had been ""unemployed"" for only a short period, while others had been out of work for months - but their work experience, education and demographics were identical.Applicants who had been out of work for eight months had 45 percent fewer callbacks from employers: ""fairly decisive evidence that merely the status of being long-term unemployed serves as a disadvantage,"" Sperling said.A second study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that someone unemployed for one month will get one interview on average for every 10 job applications, while someone out of work for seven months has to send 35 resumes to get just one interview.""It's very demoralizing to send out hundreds of resumes and not get an interview,"" Sperling said. Sperling began talking to business leaders in May about the issues and he and Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett began approaching businesses directly in late 2013 about committing to review screening of resumes and other hiring practices that shut out the long-term unemployed.Other companies who have signed on included Apple Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co, Proctor & Gamble Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and AT&T.Media mogul Rupert Murdoch signed up his companies, News Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, after Sperling pitched him the concept.""He responded directly by email to say he thought this was a strong idea,"" Sperling said.Obama on Friday will issue a presidential memorandum to ensure the federal government adopts the same best practices in its recruitmentHe also will announce $150 million in grants for public-private programs that help match the long-term unemployed with local employers. LinkedIn, a social networking website focused on jobs, has signed on to help programs identify potential candidates, the White House said.The White House said it did not have a projection of how many unemployed might land an interview because of the changes.""I can't give you an exact number,"" Sperling said. ""But these are companies that employ millions and millions and millions of people, and are going to be hiring more people, and I think this is going to have a significant impact.""(Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Stephen Powell)",2014-01-31,GE,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 12:57pm EST",Help wanted: Obama calls on CEOs to take on long-term jobless,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-obama-jobs-idUSBREA0U0KZ20140131?type=companyNews

28,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK As the next generation of narrow-body airplanes takes to the skies later this year, makers of the new fuel-efficient engines that power them are battling for market share.Orders worth $20 billion are up for grabs in the competition between Pratt & Whitney and CFM International. Pratt also stands to gain market prominence as it makes what some experts describe as an industry comeback.Pratt, a unit of United Technologies Corp and a major military contractor, has had a smaller commercial engine market presence in recent years.In contrast, CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran, has supplied the dominant engine on narrow-body, single-aisle planes, which are the best-selling Boeing Co and Airbus Group models.Single-aisle planes make up more than 60 percent of all commercial jets flying today, and are expected to account for 70 percent of the 35,000 new commercial jets delivered over the next 20 years, a market worth nearly $2.3 trillion.Jet engine sales are expected to top $500 billion over the next decade, according to the Teal Group, an aerospace research firm. Manufacturers fight hard for sales because a large installed base of engines yields big profits later through maintenance and replacement parts.While Boeing's 737 MAX and the Airbus A320neo will have aerodynamic improvements that make them more efficient, the new engines account for most of their fuel savings.Pratt and CFM have promised at least 15 percent lower fuel use than current-generation engines.""The most significant change on either of these jets is the engines,"" said Will Alibrandi, an aero turbine analyst for Forecast International.FOCUS ON NEO That means airlines will scrutinize the engines' performance and their choice will show in the A320neo competition. CFM has already sewed up a swath of the single-aisle market for its LEAP engine. CFM is the only engine option on the 737 MAX, the A320neo rival, a deal that keeps CFM as the top engine supplier in the single-aisle category.But Pratt's new power plant, known as the geared turbofan (GTF), the other option on the A320neo, aims to challenge CFM's dominance.Pratt also has signed exclusive deals to supply the GTF to four regional jet makers, including Bombardier Inc and Embraer. While each is much smaller than the 737 and A320, those jets combined will represent significant sales over time.The A320neo has so far won more orders than the 737 MAX, making it a big market opportunity for Pratt.And Pratt already is proving to be a tough competitor. So far, Pratt and CFM have evenly split the A320neo market. Out of 2,610 A320neo orders as of January, about 32 percent have selected CFM and 32 percent have selected Pratt, Airbus said. The contest for the remaining jets represents about 1,880 engines worth nearly $20 billion at list prices of about $11 million per engine.""Where you see the real competitive battlefront between these two is on the Airbus,"" said Ernest Arvai, an aviation industry consultant with AirInsight. ""It's a huge market.""START YOUR ENGINES The two engines use radically different designs. Pratt's GTF relies on a gearbox that lets the front fan operate at a different speed than the rest of the engine. On traditionally configured engines they run at the same speed. CFM's LEAP, among other improvements, uses new materials designed to reduce weight and add durability.Pratt's GTF will be the first engine into the sky on a new generation jet when Airbus A320neo flights start in the fourth quarter, and therefore the first to provide actual flight performance data that could help win over undecided airline customers.""A successful flight test program by all rights should generate more sales and should kick some folks off the fence,"" said turbine analyst Alibrandi. ""You can make all kinds of performance guarantees,"" but the proof is from engines actually flying on the plane. United Technologies, which poured $1 billion into developing the GTF, projects Pratt's revenue will roughly double to $26 billion by 2020, fueled in part by the GTF. Pratt also makes engines for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet. United Technologies - whose Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert was Pratt's president for seven years - posted $62.6 billion in revenue last year.""The GTF has become the cornerstone of Pratt & Whitney's commercial engine business,"" David Brantner, president of Pratt's commercial engines business, said in an interview.Aviation also is an important division for GE, accounting for about 15 percent of its $146 billion in 2013 revenue. The importance is likely to grow as the U.S. conglomerate focuses more on industrials businesses and moves away from exposure to the financial sector.Including orders from the China's Comac C919, CFM expects to continue to have about 75 percent of the engine market for single-aisle planes, said Chaker Chahrour, CFM's executive vice president.""We are certain that we will maintain the overall 75 percent,"" Chahrour said. ""The battle is not over. There are still many orders to come on these airplanes.""Beyond price, airlines want guarantees on performance and reliability, as well as agreements over maintenance and other costs over as long as 20 years, said Norman Hecht, an engine consultant and former Pratt veteran.The first Pratt-powered A320neo is due for delivery to customers in late 2015. The LEAP-powered A320neo is scheduled to enter into service in the second quarter of 2016.That means some airlines may take years to see how both engines perform before choosing.""It's early, and they both have very compelling products,"" said William Storey, Teal Group's president. ""The jury is out on who will win.""(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Alwyn Scott and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-02-18,GE,"Tue Feb 18, 2014 | 7:22am EST","Pratt, GE battle over billions in jet engine orders",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-aerospace-engines-analysis-idUSBREA1H0PA20140218?type=companyNews
29,"   By Ernest Scheyder  General Electric Co (GE.N) plans to intensify research focusing on complex energy projects such as waterless fracking and gas turbine efficiency by earmarking an additional $10 billion through 2020 for its ""ecoimagination"" budget.The commitment, which represents roughly two years' research spending for the manufacturing giant, comes as General Electric responds to new opportunities created by the U.S. energy boom.""The reserves are here. The potential is here,"" Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said on Monday, describing how new drilling technologies have unlocked vast oil and gas reserves.Energy companies need help reaching fossil fuels but also bringing them to markets and GE can offer that know-how, the executive said.""There's just technical intensity that is going into these industries,"" he said at a Bloomberg energy event in Washington.Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has revolutionized energy development but the technique requires huge volumes of water to rattle oil and gas from deep underground.The method is controversial as landowners and communities raise concerns about the safety of drinking water in energy patches and GE is trying to develop drill techniques that use gas rather than water, executives said.Energy is the fastest growth area for GE as the global manufacturer works to become a dominant supplier of equipment and services to oil, natural gas and alternative power companies. While GE doesn't forecast what it plans to spend on its main capital budget in future years, the new commitment gives investors a clue as to what the company's priorities will be into the next decade.The ""ecoimagination"" project, which was formed in 2005 to broadly focus on sustainability and other environmental issues and has cost nearly $15 billion, had been set to expire next year. Executives are extending it to 2020 with the additional $10 billion.While the overall goals of the project will remain, a larger percentage of the funds will go to energy-related projects, an acknowledgment of where Immelt and other executives see the future of the company Thomas Edison founded in 1892.""We have a very broad, long-standing commitment to energy,"" said Mark Little, GE's chief technology officer and head of global research.NEXT GENERATION FRACKING?

30,"  By Ernest ScheyderFeb 24 General Electric Co plans to intensify research focusing on complex energy projects such as waterless fracking and gas turbine efficiency by earmarking an additional $10 billion through 2020 for its ""ecoimagination"" budget.The commitment, which represents roughly two years' research spending for the manufacturing giant, comes as General Electric responds to new opportunities created by the U.S. energy boom.""The reserves are here. The potential is here,"" Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said on Monday, describing how new drilling technologies have unlocked vast oil and gas reserves.Energy companies need help reaching fossil fuels but also bringing them to markets and GE can offer that know-how, the executive said.""There's just technical intensity that is going into these industries,"" he said at a Bloomberg energy event in Washington.Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has revolutionized energy development but the technique requires huge volumes of water to rattle oil and gas from deep underground.The method is controversial as landowners and communities raise concerns about the safety of drinking water in energy patches and GE is trying to develop drill techniques that use gas rather than water, executives said.Energy is the fastest growth area for GE as the global manufacturer works to become a dominant supplier of equipment and services to oil, natural gas and alternative power companies. While GE doesn't forecast what it plans to spend on its main capital budget in future years, the new commitment gives investors a clue as to what the company's priorities will be into the next decade.The ""ecoimagination"" project, which was formed in 2005 to broadly focus on sustainability and other environmental issues and has cost nearly $15 billion, had been set to expire next year. Executives are extending it to 2020 with the additional $10 billion.While the overall goals of the project will remain, a larger percentage of the funds will go to energy-related projects, an acknowledgment of where Immelt and other executives see the future of the company Thomas Edison founded in 1892.""We have a very broad, long-standing commitment to energy,"" said Mark Little, GE's chief technology officer and head of global research.

38,"   By Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co (GE.N) is preparing to sell its energy unit that makes fuel dispensers in a deal that is expected to fetch more than $500 million, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The diversified conglomerate has recently contacted private equity firms and other parties to gauge their interest in buying its Wayne subsidiary, part of GE Energy, the people said.Credit Suisse Group is advising GE on the process, the people said, asking not to be named because the sale plans are confidential.Wayne was part of Dresser Inc, the energy infrastructure company that GE bought in 2010 for $3 billion. That deal marked its largest acquisition since the financial crisis and heralded a series of takeovers by GE in the energy space in following years.The Wayne unit, based in Austin, Texas, manufacturers fuel dispensers for petroleum retailers and commercial fleets as well as compressed natural gas equipment. Representatives for GE and Credit Suisse declined to comment.Generally, GE is investing more in its energy businesses as the conglomerate seeks to become a dominant supplier of equipment and services to oil, natural gas and alternative power companies. However, the fuel dispenser business is at the low-end of GE's energy offerings and is not a core interest.In a sign of its focus on the oil and gas sector, GE last year bought oilfield pump maker Lufkin for about $3 billion. Earlier this week, GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt announced plans for the company to spend an additional $10 billion through 2020 to boost research on complex energy projects. GE's oil and gas segment posted an 11 percent increase in revenue last year to nearly $17 billion, while the segment's profit rose 13 percent to $2.2 billion.The investment in its energy businesses is part of GE's overall increasing focus on its industrial businesses as it reduces exposure to the financial sector.To slim down its GE Capital division, the company is expected by the end of next month to file for an initial public offering for up to 20 percent of its North American retail finance business, part of a two-stage process to split off the business. GE's planned divestiture of Wayne is yet another example of diversified conglomerates trying to sell off non-core assets in an effort to focus on key areas and deploy capital elsewhere.Private equity, meanwhile, has shown a strong appetite for units being carved out of companies, seeking to avoid frothy auctions for publicly listed companies as markets rallied.Earlier this month, Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW.N) agreed to sell its industrial packaging unit to private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) for $3.2 billion.Another buyout firm, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, struck a $1.8 billion deal to buy the water technology unit of U.S. chemical manufacturer Ashland Inc (ASH.N) last week.(Reporting by Soyoung Kim in New York, additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)",2014-02-27,GE,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 12:49pm EST",Exclusive: GE seeks buyer for fuel dispenser unit - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ge-wayne-idUSBREA1Q1W120140227?type=companyNews

41,"   By Aman Shah  General Electric Co's credit card unit filed for an initial public offering on Thursday, the first step in the conglomerate's long-awaited plan to exit retail finance and reduce its dependence on its financing arm.GE announced plans in November to spin off the North American retail finance business into a publicly traded company, which bankers estimated could be worth roughly $16 billion to $18 billion.GE will look to raise as much as $3.5 billion from the IPO and seek a valuation of $20 billion to $25 billion for the unit, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the report.GE has been reducing its reliance on GE Capital, its financing arm, which at one point accounted for almost half of the company's profit. The unit's rising funding costs during the 2008 financial crisis nearly sank the entire company.With the spinout of the retail lending business, GE hopes to focus on its industrial divisions and better compete with rivals such as Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp, which have smaller financing arms.""We see the exit from North America retail finance as a net positive for GE over time, provided the price is right and capital is deployed wisely,"" Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote in a note.The unit, which makes credit card loans to consumers in the United States and Canada, will operate under the name Synchrony Financial, GE said in a statement.Synchrony will use proceeds from the offering to repay debt, increase capital and invest in liquid assets, according to the IPO filing. (r.reuters.com/hez57v)""MUSEUM PIECE""  GE said in November that it would float up to 20 percent of the credit card business through the IPO, with a target to complete the exit in 2015.The business traces its roots to 1932 when GE began providing financing to consumers to help meet demand for its appliances.It is now the largest provider of private label credit cards in the United States based on purchase volume and receivables, according to the filing.The cards are offered through major retailers and brands including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Lowe's Cos Inc and Ethan Allen Interiors Inc.The business had 62 million active accounts, financed about $94 billion of sales and reported net earnings of $2 billion for 2013, according to the filing.

42,"  * Files $100 million placeholder with the U.S. SEC* Unit to list on NYSE under symbol ""SYF""* Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley are lead underwriters* Unit seeks $20 bln to $25 bln valuation-BloombergBy Aman ShahMarch 13 General Electric Co's credit card unit filed for an initial public offering on Thursday, the first step in the conglomerate's long-awaited plan to exit retail finance and reduce its dependence on its financing arm.GE announced plans in November to spin off the North American retail finance business into a publicly traded company, which bankers estimated could be worth roughly $16 billion to $18 billion.GE will look to raise as much as $3.5 billion from the IPO and seek a valuation of $20 billion to $25 billion for the unit, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the report.GE has been reducing its reliance on GE Capital, its financing arm, which at one point accounted for almost half of the company's profit. The unit's rising funding costs during the 2008 financial crisis nearly sank the entire company.With the spinout of the retail lending business, GE hopes to focus on its industrial divisions and better compete with rivals such as Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp, which have smaller financing arms.""We see the exit from North America retail finance as a net positive for GE over time, provided the price is right and capital is deployed wisely,"" Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote in a note. The unit, which makes credit card loans to consumers in the United States and Canada, will operate under the name Synchrony Financial, GE said in a statement.Synchrony will use proceeds from the offering to repay debt, increase capital and invest in liquid assets, according to the IPO filing. ()""MUSEUM PIECE"" GE said in November that it would float up to 20 percent of the credit card business through the IPO, with a target to complete the exit in 2015.The business traces its roots to 1932 when GE began providing financing to consumers to help meet demand for its appliances. It is now the largest provider of private label credit cards in the United States based on purchase volume and receivables, according to the filing.The cards are offered through major retailers and brands including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Lowe's Cos Inc  and Ethan Allen Interiors Inc.The business had 62 million active accounts, financed about $94 billion of sales and reported net earnings of $2 billion for 2013, according to the filing.""(The IPO) will be a museum piece for the institutions that invest in it,"" said John Fitzgibbon, founder of IPO-tracking website IPOScoop.com.Investors will view the IPO favorably, given the business is well-established and profitable, Fitzgibbon said.Spanish lender Banco Santander SA took its U.S. consumer-finance arm Santander USA Holding Inc public in January, with shares rising as much as 10 percent in their debut.

45,"  TOKYO, March 14 IHI Corp, General Electric's jet engine partner in Japan, may tie up aircraft engine part production with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd which is more closely aligned with GE's competitors.IHI and Mitsubishi Heavy said there were discussing an alliance announcement after Japan's leading daily, the Yomiuri said the firms planned to establish a new company in which the Japanese government may also invest.Mitsubishi Heavy makes parts for Rolls-Royce Holdings and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. IHI, which is the primary supplier of aircraft engines to Japan's military, and Mitsubishi Heavy said in a joint statement that no decision had been made regarding what form any joint venture might take.The combination of the jet engine units of the two companies could bolster Japan as a leading maker of aircraft engines by creating a company with significant stakes in engine programmes that power much of the world's fleet of civilian jetliners. It would also align with the Japanese government's push to mould national champions out of the nation's fractured industrial landscape. ""Business alliances and partnerships to boost international competitiveness is in line with last autumn's law on industrial competitiveness,"" Japan's Minister of Economy Trade and Industry said at a regular press briefing on Friday when asked about the possible MHI and IHI partnership. Japan's other big maker of jet engines, Kawasaki Heavy Industries may also join the alliance, the Yomiuri reported.IHI is a major supplier and risk sharing partner on GE's GE-90 engine used on Boeing's 777 passenger jet as well as the more recent GEnX used to power Boeing's 747-8 and 787 Dreamliner. It also builds engines for Japan's F-2 fighter aircraft.Mitsubishi Heavy makes parts for Rolls Royce's Trent 1000 engine, which is also designed for Boeing's 787.

48,"   By Tim Hepher and Bill Rigby | SAN DIEGO  SAN DIEGO GECAS, the world's largest aviation leasing firm, is looking at investing at least $4 billion in ship financing and helicopter leasing to diversify its portfolio - a potential move that reflects concerns over the value of some current jets.The aviation leasing arm of General Electric Co (GE.N) invests up to $7 billion annually to resupply and expand its portfolio of 1,700 aircraft, which are rented out to airlines in exchange for a monthly fee, and support its other aviation businesses.But although there is record demand for new fuel-saving models of Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) narrow-body jets like the A320 and Boeing 737, GECAS is among those increasingly wary of investing in the models they will replace, as output starts to taper off.""You have to be careful of the last-of-the line planes. We don't want to buy as much,"" GECAS Chief Executive Norman Liu said.""But then we have to fill that gap unless we want to shrink. We are looking as they taper (production of existing models) to find replacement investments that are safe and secure.""Lessors like GECAS - short for GE Capital Aviation Services - rely on assets holding a predictable value as a cornerstone of their business, even though steep discounts may make it attractive to buy the outgoing models.Some fear the value of existing A320 and 737 models, the best-selling jets in the industry, will suffer from competition with new variants that burn up to 15 percent less fuel. But Airbus and Boeing say they continue to sell as planned.Liu told Reuters GECAS could spend about $2 billion on buying and renting out helicopters to oilfield service companies and another $2 billion offering shipping loans through its debt financing activity. He was speaking to Reuters ahead of a large gathering of aircraft traders, manufacturers and financiers in San Diego, California.Airbus Helicopters, formerly known as Eurocopter, has said leasing is beginning to take off in the sector.""I think it is an area of potential interest. It is a different distribution process because of the different client base but it is something where General Electric has an existing rotor engine product,"" said Liu.""We would like to get some scale over time - a couple of billion. On the other hand we want to do sensible deals; we could just do some loans through our PK AirFinance group."" Helicopters sell for about $20 million each, he said.In shipping, GECAS is not interested in getting its feet wet by buying cargo vessels and competing with the industry's many formidable tycoons, but would be interested in filling a lending gap left by European banks with roughly the same sums involved.The annual meeting of ISTAT - the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading - which started over 30 years ago as a meeting of jet scrap dealers and now attracts well over 1,000 people in the booming air finance industry, is being held amid fresh jitters in the world economy, notably emerging markets.""Long-term that is where the action is. As long as average GDP growth remains above 3 percent, the market should balance itself out, but there is no margin for error,"" said Liu. The leasing industry is in the midst of one of its periodic shake-ups after Dutch-based AerCap Holdings (AER.N) bought GECAS's main rival, International Lease Finance Corp, from insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N).Both GECAS and AerCap trace their roots to the collapsed leasing empire of Irish leasing baron, Tony Ryan, 20 years ago.GE Capital bought $1.3 billion of prime assets and struck an agreement to manage most of the rest to form GECAS - a marriage of ""metal and money"" that Liu said combined Guinness Peat Aviation's (GPA) hardware with GE's balance sheet.The remaining core of old GPA was later acquired by AerCap, which is now the main competitor to GECAS under Chief Executive Aengus Kelly. After an industry boom, both executives have signaled a relatively cautious approach to buying new jets.Liu said GECAS is studying Boeing's planned new 406-seat 777-9X for which parent GE makes the engines, but has no immediate plans to place an order. The aircraft is due to enter service in 2020, meaning those ordering now face substantial bills for inflation adjustments, industry experts say.He was non-committal on whether the lessor would order a possibly re-engined version of the Airbus A330 to be called A330neo, but said the market would be relatively limited in scope. Airbus is expected to make a decision on whether to upgrade its most profitable wide-body jet this year.(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Bill Rigby; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",2014-03-17,GE,"Sun Mar 16, 2014 | 8:55pm EDT","GECAS may spend $4 billion on ship, chopper investments: CEO",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-gecas-ceo-idUSBREA2G01320140317?type=companyNews
49,"  Federal regulators are conducting two investigations into General Electric Co's credit card business for potential violations of consumer finance laws, according to a regulatory filing related to the unit's planned initial public offering.The business, now named Synchrony Financial, said it was in talks with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding a review of its debt cancellation products and related marketing practices, according to the filing dated March 13.The consumer bureau was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law and charged with cracking down on financial scams that harm borrowers.The company said that it notified the CFPB about a problem with its Spanish-language filing after spotting it as part of an internal audit. (r.reuters.com/hez57v)The matter was referred to the Department of Justice (DoJ), which initiated a civil investigation over a possible violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as some Spanish-speaking customers and customers residing in Puerto Rico were excluded from certain statement credit and settlement offers, according to the filing.

About 22 million shares had changed hands by 1445 ET, making the company's stock among the most traded on the Nasdaq.The new power plants will combine First Solar's panels with General Electric Co's (GE.N) transformers.First Solar gets a bulk of its revenue from selling solar farms to utilities but has recently struggled to boost sales as the rate of new contracts from big U.S. power companies has slowed.The company in February reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hurt by irregular revenue from its solar projects.Some analysts have, however, said the company will continue to benefit from utility demand. Market commentator Jim Cramer said he was positive on the First Solar stock.""I prefer First Solar because it is an actual technology company with real momentum, that is the play today,"" Cramer said on CNBC television on Wednesday. First Solar is also trying to make a push into the residential rooftop market - currently dominated by SolarCity SCTY.O in the United States - and bought panel maker TetraSun last year.TetraSun's solar panels are better suited for small rooftop systems than First Solar's thin-film panels.""TetraSun should go into initial production later this year, positioning FSLR for the rooftop market,"" J.P. Morgan Securities analysts said in a note on Wednesday. First Solar forecast revenue of $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion for 2014. Analysts on average were expecting $3.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.First Solar's profit forecast of $2.20-$2.60 per share, however, fell short of market estimates of $3.21 per share.The company forecast much stronger-than-expected earnings for 2015. It expects to earn between $4.50 and $6.00 per share, compared with estimates of $3.68 per share.(Reporting by Shubhankar Chakravorty and Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Don Sebastian and Maju Samuel)",2014-03-19,GE,"Wed Mar 19, 2014 | 3:49pm EDT",First Solar forecasts up to 21 percent jump in 2014 revenue,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-firstsolar-outlook-idUSBREA2I1XO20140319?type=companyNews

The plant, which will start operating in 2018 in Setouchi in Okayama Prefecture, is expected to cost around 80 billion yen ($776 million), the daily reported. While a spokesman from GE Energy Financial Services confirmed the equity investment, he declined to provide details, saying the company was ""still discussing details within the project team.""""Because documents about this project have been publicly disclosed by the Setouchi municipal assembly, we can confirm that if certain conditions are met, GE plans to invest in the solar power project,"" GE Energy Financial Services spokesman Andy Katell told Reuters.

67,"  SHANGHAI A healthcare unit of General Electric Co has recalled hundreds of incubator-like infant ""warmers"" in China over safety concerns as Beijing tightens oversight of the country's fast-growing medical device sector.GE Healthcare recalled 223 of the U.S.-produced warmers after uncovering a potential safety issue that could restrict oxygen supply to the child, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) said in a statement on Tuesday.The cot-like warmers are used in hospitals to regulate the body temperature of tiny infants unable to keep themselves warm due to a lack of body fat. The devices also regulate airflow and monitor vital signs.The recall announcement coincides with tough messages from China's Cabinet this week that the government would increase oversight and fines in the medical device sector to address safety concerns.The crackdown could intensify the challenge for international medical device makers such as UK-based GE Healthcare, as well as rivals Siemens AG and Medtronic Inc, as they look to tap into the sector.

They will be serviced at facilities owned by GE or Germany's MTU Aero Engines (MTXGn.DE), which is licensed to do the work.He said GE officials would meet with officials from Iran flag carrier Iranair and MTU in Istanbul next week to discuss Iran's needs.A Boeing spokesman said his company received the license this week and would now contact officials in Iran to determine which parts were needed.He said the license covered only components needed to ensure continued safe flight operations of older Boeing planes sold to Iran before the 1979 revolution, and did not allow any discussions about sales of new aircraft to Iran. ""It's very limited,"" said the spokesman.The sales would be the first acknowledged dealings between U.S. aerospace companies and Iran since the 1979 U.S. hostage crisis led to U.S. sanctions that were later broadened during the dispute over Iran's nuclear activities.Reuters reported in February that both Boeing and GE had applied for permission to export aircraft parts to Iran during a six-month window agreed by Iran and six world powers in November. Iran agreed in November to curtail its nuclear activities for six months from January 20 in exchange for sanctions relief from Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. The deal provides for the sale of parts to flag carrier Iranair, the fleet of which includes vintage Boeing and Airbus (AIR.PA) jetliners delivered as long ago as 1978.A spokesperson for the Treasury, which enforces international sanctions, said the department does not comment on license applications or requests.Iran says the sanctions have prevented it from renewing its fleet, forcing it to use sub-standard Russian aircraft and to patch up jets that have long since exceed their normal years of service.

77,"   By Ernest Scheyder | NISKAYUNA, New York, April 7  NISKAYUNA, New York, April 7 Carbon dioxide, used for years to force crude oil out of old wells, likely will not replace water in fracking anytime soon because of technical challenges and limited infrastructure, says General Electric Co , which is studying the issue under a $10 billion research program.The delay means energy companies will continue to use more than 2 million gallons of water for each fracked well, equal to baths for some 40,000 people, stressing water supplies in arid American states and likely delaying fracking's expansion to western China and other water-stressed regions.GE, which is making a push into oilfield technology, is studying how a chilled form of CO2 known as a ""super-critical fluid"" - neither a liquid nor a solid - could be used as the new industry standard for hydraulic fracturing, the process commonly known as fracking.The conglomerate is working on the project with Statoil ASA , the Norwegian oil and gas producer, as part of its ecomagination program, which also is focusing on gas turbine efficiency, wind blade design and other energy projects.""Our ultimate vision is to have a fracking process that uses no water, but we're a ways off from that,"" Andrew Gorton, a GE mechanical engineer leading the project, said during a tour of the company's research facilities in upstate New York. The hydraulic fracturing of rock, or fracking, has allowed the global energy industry to access vast new supplies of oil and gas. Fracking opponents see a range of potential environmental damage from the process but are cautiously optimistic that using CO2 instead of water could reduce those risks.CO2 fracking was used on a small scale in the 1990s by the company Canadian FracMaster before it filed for bankruptcy protection. Engineers say they want to figure out how to widely replicate the process across many different geologies.Researchers are also trying to find the best viscosity, or thickness, for the CO2 at its chilled state to carry proppant, a type of sand that holds open cracks in rock so oil and natural gas can escape, much like water does in current methods. ""The hope is we can find a way to do it,"" said Mark Little, GE's chief technology officer.Studies have shown wells fracked with CO2 tend to produce more oil or natural gas from the outset because CO2 fracks tend occur at a higher pressure than ones that use water. Safely and cheaply transporting CO2, a compressible gas, on trucks to remote wells is also a concern where pipelines lag.GE is separately studying with the U.S. Department of Energy how coal-fired power plants could best capture CO2 emissions and use the gas in fracking and other uses. GE and Statoil currently get CO2 from industrial gas suppliers such as Linde  and Air Liquide.Collecting CO2 as a power generation byproduct and using it to frack would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But fracking would turn CO2 from a chilled fluid into a gas, and GE says it needs to devise a way to trap that gas back at the wellhead.Ideally, a well's owner would be able to re-use CO2 at the next well it fracks, since nearly all CO2 injected would return to the surface. By contrast, energy companies cannot re-use most of the water today used to frack, though some recycling projects are trying to address that.For years CO2 has been injected into old, conventional wells in places like California to boost pressure and increase the amount of oil that can be pumped out. This process is much less complex than using CO2 for fracking, as it doesn't require the CO2 to carry sand or other chemicals.

Thursday's earnings report from GE presents the next chance for analysts to address the company's strategy.""From my investor's point of view, the more they look like an industrial company, the better off they are,"" said Andrew Meister, an equity research analyst at Thrivent Investment Management.Meister and others say that GE's finance presence makes for a more complex company that forces its shares to trade at a discount to manufacturing rivals.GE trades at 15 times forward earnings estimates compared with 16.7 times for United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and 16.3 times for Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), according to Thomson Reuters data. Financial companies such as CIT Group (CIT.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) trade between 12 to 13.5 times forward earnings estimates. The future of GE Capital is central to a larger issue facing GE and other conglomerates: What mix of businesses makes the most sense? Barclays analyst Scott Davis raised the topic for GE last month in a research note with the provocative title: ""GE: Structurally Broken Story?""""The overwhelming evidence, in our view, suggests that GE should not be in the banking business; the appliance business; the lighting business; datacenters, or any other non-core, non-infrastructure based business,"" Davis wrote of the company, which makes large equipment including jet engines, gas turbines, and MRI machines.To be sure, GE has responded to the concerns by taking steps to reduce its exposure to finance, with the spin-off of its North American retail finance business being the most significant move.The unit -- which bankers and analysts have valued at anywhere from $16 billion to $30 billion -- filed for an IPO last month under the name Synchrony Financial, part of a plan GE laid out in November for separating the business entirely in 2015. It's not clear when this year the spinoff will happen. Synchrony's divestiture should put GE at least close to Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's goal of cutting the company earnings contribution from GE Capital from about 45 percent last year to 30 percent by 2016.The bulk of the remaining GE Capital business will focus on lending to small and mid-sized firms, which allows GE ""to keep their pulse on various industrial end markets,"" said Brian Langenberg, an analyst with Langenberg & Co.GE also finances sales of products in GE's main industrial areas, such as aviation, healthcare and energy, with about 5 percent of GE Capital that now funds GE's own products. In commercial real estate, GE Capital does plan to sell off assets in which it holds an equity stake such as buildings. But the company still sees providing financing for commercial real estate properties including refinancings and loans for new buildings as a core part of GE Capital.""It's an asset class we know very well, and it's a solid returning business,"" GE Capital spokesman Russell Wilkerson said, noting the company's 40-year history in such lending.Not everyone agrees with the fit.""The one (main) part that GE just doesn't seem aligned with other people is GE still wants to stay in the real estate debt book,"" said Shannon O'Callaghan, an analyst at Nomura.Said Daniel Holland, an analyst with Morningstar: ""You have to think really hard about a good reason for them owning that business.""(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Andrew Hay)",2014-04-14,GE,"Mon Apr 14, 2014 | 7:40am EDT",GE Capital seen ripe for more slimming after credit card IPO,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-general-electric-finance-idUSBREA3D0N520140414?type=companyNews

Tensions have been on the rise since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region last month, and armed protesters in eastern Ukraine have captured several towns.Separatists attacked a Ukrainian national guard base overnight in the worst fighting so far in a 10-day pro-Russian uprising. The United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union on Thursday issued a joint statement calling for the violence to end.""The statement reduces the geopolitical concerns that have been overhanging the market. That's why we've seen a pop up in Treasuries yields and the dollar,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The joint statement spurred traders to trim their safe-haven holdings in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, and boosted the Russian rouble to its highest level against the dollar in seven days.It also spurred selling in safe-haven U.S. government bonds. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 23/32 in price to yield 2.72 percent.The rising tension in Ukraine did not affect U.S. stocks, which were little changed.

Tensions have been on the rise since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region last month, and armed protesters in eastern Ukraine have captured several towns.Separatists attacked a Ukrainian national guard base overnight in the worst fighting so far in a 10-day pro-Russian uprising. The United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union on Thursday issued a joint statement calling for the violence to end.""It's encouraging because they are working together and they are trying to de-escalate the tension in eastern Ukraine,"" said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. The joint statement spurred traders to trim their safe-haven holdings in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, and boosted the Russian rouble to its highest level against the dollar in four days.It also spurred selling in safe-haven U.S. government bonds. The benchmark 10-year Treasury fell 27/32 in price to yield 2.729 percent.The rising tension in Ukraine did not affect U.S. stocks, which were little changed. Strong results from industrial conglomerate GE and investment bank Morgan Stanley were offset by disappointing results late on Wednesday from IBM and Google. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.027 point, or 0.03 percent, to 79.83.The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, rose 1.53 points or 0.37 percent, to 410.91.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.82 points or 0.15 percent, to 16,449.67, the S&P 500 gained 6.21 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,868.52, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 21.364 points, or 0.52 percent, to 4,107.589.Morgan Stanley reported a 55 percent jump in first-quarter earnings, General Electric posted a 12 percent rise in overall industrial profits, and both earnings and revenue of Goldman Sachs beat market estimates. ""The market is digesting the sharp move we've seen this week and is doing its best to ignore the results from IBM and Google, which didn't look great,"" said Steve Sosnick, equity risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.The number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose less than expected in the latest week and factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region expanded in April at a faster clip than expected.The U.S. Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits ticked up 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 304,000 for the week ended April 12, near the 6-1/2-year low touched the prior week.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index rose to 16.6 from 9.0 in March. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the mid-Atlantic region's manufacturing.European equities finished higher. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed up 0.44 percent.Gold futures were last down 0.73 percent, at $1,294 an ounce. Brent crude for June delivery was last down $0.21, or down 0.11 percent, at $109.51 a barrel. U.S. crude  was last up 41 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $104.17 per barrel.(Reporting by Sam Forgione in New York; Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn in London and Richard Leong in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-04-17,GE,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 2:12pm EDT",GLOBAL MARKETS-Global shares edge higher on U.S. data; dollar gains,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-global-idUSL2N0N918320140417?type=companyNews
92,"   By Lewis Krauskopf and Ernest Scheyder  General Electric Co (GE.N) posted a 12 percent rise in overall industrial profits on Thursday, as strength in its businesses selling gas turbines, jet engines and oil industry equipment offset weakness in healthcare and transportation.GE, which is increasingly focusing on its traditional manufacturing businesses over its finance unit, posted an 8 percent increase in industrial revenue, even as overall company revenue fell slightly short of Wall Street's target.GE shares rose 2.4 percent to $26.74 in afternoon trading as profit also edged past analyst estimates.""The big story is the organic revenue growth,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management, which owns GE shares. ""It really shows the return to an industrial emphasis is paying off, and where the company is focusing.""The results underscored GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt's strategy to focus the company even more on manufacturing of large industrial products as he reduces the company's dependence on its GE Capital finance unit. Immelt is also seeking to improve profit margins and slash administrative costs at the 307,000-employee company.Still, GE said it plans to divest $4 billion worth of industrial businesses this year as the conglomerate focuses its portfolio on high-returning businesses. The company is already in the process of spinning off its North American retail finance business as it seeks to reduce the contribution from GE Capital to 30 percent of company profits by 2016, compared to about 45 percent in 2013.""We are more active on the divestiture front this year,"" Immelt told analysts on a conference call.GE also is targeting acquisitions in the $1 billion to $4 billion range, although it would consider spending more if the deal was ""absolute strike zone,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview, including targets that fit with its main businesses and offer significant cost savings.Many conglomerates want to step up dealmaking but also must grapple with targets being expensive due to the rising stock market, a perspective that Bornstein echoed. ""Valuations are quite high and we will be very selective in what we do,"" Bornstein said.Rival U.S. diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) also posted slightly better-than-expected profit on Thursday, helped by sales of its automobile turbochargers in the United States and China.Honeywell shares were little changed on Thursday. But its shares this year have still outperformed those of GE, which through Wednesday had declined about 7 percent in 2014, worse than industrial rivals and the broader U.S. markets.GE's first-quarter net earnings fell to $3 billion, or 30 cents per share, from $3.53 billion, or 34 cents per share, a year ago, when the company's results were boosted by its sale of NBCUniversal. Excluding one-time items, operating earnings of 33 cents topped analysts' average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell 2.1 percent to $34.18 billion. Analysts were looking for $34.36 billion.Revenue in its two largest industrial segments, aviation and power and water, each rose 14 percent, while its oil and gas division posted a 27 percent increase.As expected, GE's transportation segment that makes locomotives was weak due to a poor environment for the mining sector. But its healthcare unit, which makes an array of MRI and other scanning machines, saw revenue slip 2 percent where some analysts were expecting growth.""Healthcare was pretty weak,"" said Perry Adams, a portfolio manager at Northwestern Bank. With a ""massive structural change"" in the U.S. healthcare market caused in part by President Barack Obama's healthcare law, Bornstein said hospitals and other GE customers may have been more cautious about spending.""I expect that softness to persist into the second quarter,"" Bornstein said, but he said the company expects healthcare to increase profits globally this year.GE's profit margins for its industrials businesses, a closely watched measure, improved to 13.4 percent from 12.9 percent a year earlier.That margin improvement was ""actually a little shy of what I would have expected,"" said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp, which owns GE shares.Still, DeGan said, ""the thing that surprised me was that organic growth was 8 percent when they were targeting for the year, 4 to 7 percent. To do that in the environment that we're in, indicates that as a whole they operated well in the first quarter.""GE's backlog of orders for everything from oil pumps to jet engines and turbines stood at $245 billion. Infrastructure orders for the quarter were $23.7 billion, unchanged from a year ago, disappointing some analysts.GE backed its previous major 2014 financial targets, including the expectation of industrial profits growing by at least 10 percent.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Franklin Paul, Chizu Nomiyama and Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-04-17,GE,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 12:46pm EDT","GE industrial profit boost underscores strategy, shares up",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-general-electric-results-idUSBREA3G0NH20140417?type=companyNews

102,"  * Sees strong year for jetliner engine sales* Defence revenue down, security sales recover* Aftermarket revenue below expectations, shares fall* CEO declines to say whether wants new mandate* French group still interested in Avio Spazio   (Adds analyst, Boeing earnings, GE comparison)By Tim Hepher and Cyril AltmeyerPARIS, April 23 France's Safran rattled investors with first-quarter aerospace revenue hampered by pressures ranging from delayed deliveries of defence equipment to weaker helicopter sales and cold weather in North America.The aerospace, defence and security group stood by an upbeat forecast for the commercial aviation sector, driven by emerging-market demand, and maintained a 2014 revenue target despite a strong euro.But its shares fell as much as 3.6 percent, leading France's blue-chip CAC 40 index lower.Overall revenue at the maker of products ranging from jet engines to 'green' taxiing systems and from precision bombs and bomb detectors, rose 3.3 percent to 3.443 billion euros, compared with market expectations of about 3.6 billion.Defence sales fell by a steeper-than-expected 12 percent due to delayed deliveries of missile guidance systems, but Safran said this would steady itself for the year as a whole. Safran is a major supplier to Airbus and Boeing , which are both producing record numbers of aircraft to keep up with expansion in emerging markets - demand which helped Boeing beat expectations for the quarter.Safran is a joint partner with General Electric in the world's largest engine maker by units sold, CFM International, which reported 402 deliveries and 1,163 orders in the quarter, bringing its backlog to seven years of production.""The market remains very active and there are a number of sales campaigns under way,"" Safran Chief Executive Jean-Paul Herteman told journalists. ""We are expecting a very, very solid year in 2014.""A recent rise in the value of the euro dampened revenues by 53 million euros, illustrating growing headwinds for export-driven European companies that report in the single European currency and have to collect revenues in dollars.Safran said its 2014 goal of mid-single-digit growth in adjusted revenue would be ""achievable"" if the euro stayed at its first-quarter rate of $1.37, up from $1.32 a year earlier. On Wednesday, the euro stood at $1.3830.Safran said it had softened the current impact by reining in its average hedge rate by 2 cents to $1.27 from a year earlier. Profits from U.S.-based operations also provided a cushion.Smaller French aerospace supplier Zodiac Aerospace  said on Wednesday it too remained exposed to risks from the rise in the euro, which penalizes especially the European aerospace sector against dollar-based U.S. rivals.POSSIBLE PURCHASE  Safran reaffirmed other targets including a low-double-digit percentage improvement in core operating income and a 10-15 percent increase in the ""aftermarket"" for civil spares and services, where engine makers often make most of their profits.The benchmark civil aftermarket grew 12.4 percent in dollar terms in the first quarter, compared with market expectations of closer to 15 percent. Safran's engine partner GE posted 17 percent higher spares revenue for the same quarter.""The figure is solid, but given the weaker comparable basis, a more positive surprise could have been expected,"" said Christophe Menard, head of aerospace and defence research at Kepler Capital Markets in Paris.The strongest quarterly gains in revenue came in equipment such as landing gear for the Boeing 787, which is catching up following earlier output delays and technical problems.Boeing reiterated on Wednesday it expected to deliver 110 of the high-tech 787s in 2014, almost twice the 65 seen last year.Also on the positive side, Safran's Security revenue rose for the first time in three quarters, adding 1.5 percent to 345 million euros after a boost from sales of detection systems.Herteman said Safran was continuing to work on a possible purchase of Italy's Avio Spazio, but had no further plans for acquisitions in the United States beyond completion of the $270 million purchase of some assets from Eaton Corp, expected in the first half.British private equity fund Cinven wants to sell its 81 percent stake in Italian space propulsion company Avio and has said several buyers, including Safran, have expressed interest. Airbus Group is also seen as a bidder.Herteman however sidestepped speculation about whether he would seek to remain chief executive when his mandate at the partially state-owned aerospace group expires in May 2015.   Such a decision would require a change in retirement age.Herteman, 63, said there was no proposal to discuss this at the company's annual meeting on May 27, but declined to say whether he would like to stay for another term after 2015.

103,"   By Natalie Huet and Benjamin Mallet | PARIS  PARIS Shares of Alstom (ALSO.PA) jumped 10.9 percent on Thursday after a report that U.S. conglomerate General Electric (GE.N) was in talks to buy the struggling French turbine and train maker for about $13 billion.The companies may announce the deal as early as next week, Bloomberg cited people with knowledge of the matter as saying late on Wednesday.If confirmed, a takeover offer from a foreign company would raise concern among politicians and unions in France, where Alstom employs around 18,000 people, or 20 percent of its global workforce.While Alstom is well known for both its transport and power turbine business, the latter is likely to be of most interest to GE, one person familiar with the industry said. A report in the French Le Figaro newspaper also said the power division was GE's main target.GE has bet heavily on its ""power and water"" segment, which is one of the conglomerate's top revenue generators along with jet engines. GE shares rose 0.2 percent on Thursday.Such a power-focused deal could leave Alstom's transport business as a separate publicly listed company in Paris, the person said.Acquiring Alstom's assets could propel GE toward its goal of increasing the earnings contribution from its core industrial manufacturing business to 70 percent from 55 percent last year, as it reduces its finance exposure.""Alstom is levered to those themes in which GE believes,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Steve Winoker said in a research note. ""GE would essentially be 'doubling down' on power generation, transmission, distribution and transportation."" Alstom, which has put its transport division up for sale in an attempt to fill a hole in its balance sheet, said on Thursday it was ""not informed of any potential public tender offer for the shares of the company"" and promised an update on its options when it releases annual results on May 7.A deal for the whole company could hand GE control of Alstom's high-speed TGV trains and rail-signal technology. GE has the support of Bouygues (BOUY.PA), Alstom's biggest shareholder with a 29 percent stake, the Bloomberg report said.Bouygues would not comment beyond saying that it supported Alstom's strategy. A GE spokesman declined to comment.LOW OFFER  Alstom was bailed out by the French state a decade ago and has strongly relied on orders from national rail operator SNCF and utility EDF (EDF.PA).Before the takeover bid report, Alstom shares had slumped 20 percent in the past 12 months on concerns over its cash flow. Those concerns prompted Bouygues to take a $1.9 billion writedown on its Alstom stake in February.Analysts at Espirito Santo investment bank said that at an enterprise value to forecast 2015 EBITDA multiple of 9.6 and a premium of 27 percent to Wednesday's close, the reported price GE was offering still represented a 14 percent discount to the rest of the European capital goods sector.Alstom shares leaped in early trade and closed up 10.9 percent at 27 euros compared with the potential offer price that works out at around 30.5 euros per share. Alstom has been hit hard by Europe's economic weakness and a drop in orders for power equipment from utilities, which in turn are suffering from low electricity prices. Its train business has held up better and secured record orders.The group announced 1,300 job cuts last year and put assets up for sale to raise cash, including a stake in its transport business, which makes France's prized high-speed TGV trains. [ID:nL5N0IR0GH]. An IPO of the business is also a possibility. [ID:nL5N0LB2HY]Analysts see sense in a tie-up. GE has the cash Alstom needs and a deal could help the U.S. group get infrastructure assets cheaply and make cost savings in power generation.

A report in the French Le Figaro newspaper also said the power division was GE's main target.GE has bet heavily on its ""power and water"" segment, which is one of the conglomerate's top revenue generators along with jet engines. GE shares rose 0.2 percent on Thursday. Such a power-focused deal could leave Alstom's transport business as a separate publicly listed company in Paris, the person said.Acquiring Alstom's assets could propel GE toward its goal of increasing the earnings contribution from its core industrial manufacturing business to 70 percent from 55 percent last year, as it reduces its finance exposure.""Alstom is levered to those themes in which GE believes,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Steve Winoker said in a research note. ""GE would essentially be 'doubling down' on power generation, transmission, distribution and transportation.""Alstom, which has put its transport division up for sale in an attempt to fill a hole in its balance sheet, said on Thursday it was ""not informed of any potential public tender offer for the shares of the company"" and promised an update on its  options when it releases annual results on May 7.A deal for the whole company could hand GE control of Alstom's high-speed TGV trains and rail-signal technology.

The board was due to meet again on Sunday to discuss the transaction, French daily Le Figaro said.""Talks are going ahead swiftly, the deal's structure is defined and everything is almost ready,"" one of the sources said.

French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg promised to protect the national interest and to study ""other solutions and scenarios"" for Alstom, one of France's top private-sector employers. He said he had already met Kron on Thursday and would meet GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt ""shortly."" Immelt was set to meet with French prime minister Manuel Valls and Montebourg on Sunday, according to news agency AFP.The French government has a history of blocking takeovers by foreign companies. Last year, Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) abandoned its plan to acquire a majority stake in online video website Dailymotion, owned by France-Telecom Orange, because of objections by the French government. In the energy sector, the government in 2006 brokered a deal to merge Gaz de France and Suez to block a bid for Suez by Italy's Enel SpA (ENEI.MI).GE has had its acquisition desires squelched by European regulators before. In 2001, the European Commission blocked GE's $42 billion purchase of rival diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc (HON.N).Analysts have speculated that a potential Alstom deal could allow GE to wring out a lot of cost savings, including through job cuts. But they said GE might not be able to fully realize the potential savings because the company will have to moderate any cuts to satisfy French authorities. Alstom was bailed out by the French state in 2004 and relies heavily on orders from national rail operator SNCF and utility EDF (EDF.PA).

The shares closed up 10.9 percent on Thursday after Bloomberg reported GE was in talks about a $13 billion full takeover bid for Alstom.Before that report, Alstom shares slumped 20 percent in 12 months on concerns over its cash flow, and its weakening prospects prompted Bouygues to take a $1.9 billion writedown on its stake in February.Alstom is much smaller than its other main rival, German group Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), and its orders have slumped since the 2008 economic crisis depressed demand for power equipment.

113,"  (Adds comment on profit mix target, paragraphs 17-18)By Ernest ScheyderNEW YORK, April 25 General Electric Co  expects annual profit from energy investments to double to nearly $800 million by 2020, highlighting the conglomerate's desire to remain a financing powerhouse for industry even as it slims its credit card portfolio.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt has made energy sector growth a key part of his plan to return the company to its manufacturing roots, adding oilfield pumps, wind turbines and similar products to the portfolio in recent years.Financing customers' purchases of those products, as well as investing in oil royalties, pipelines, wind farms and other energy projects, will compliment GE's industrial growth after the company spins off its North American consumer credit card business next year, executives said.""This is a business that the GE board wants to grow,"" David Nason, head of the GE Energy Financial Services unit, said in an interview on Thursday. ""It's not tied into the overall shrinking story of GE Capital. This is a core GE business.""The unit, which reported profit of $410 million last year, has a goal of posting double-digit-profit growth each year, in line with goals Immelt has laid down for the industrial part of the company's portfolio, Nason said.""I'd love to tell you it'd be faster,"" he said. ""I don't think anyone at GE would put the brakes on our growth."" The unit not only finances equipment purchases for customers, but directly invests in energy projects, regardless of whether they use GE products, though Nason acknowledged he would prefer to finance purchases from GE.In 2012, for instance, the unit teamed up with JPMorgan  to invest $225 million in a NextEra Energy Texas wind farm that used both GE and Siemens turbines.""I have a dual mandate: to generate returns and also to support GE,"" Nason said. ""Where they both fit, that's perfect. And where they don't fit, I still want to generate above-average returns.""About $10 billion has been invested in the past decade in renewable energy projects, and late Wednesday GE Energy Financial Services said it plans to invest $5 billion more on solar, wind and other renewable projects through 2020. TOO BIG TO FAIL? Even as GE Capital shrinks, investors say they are comfortable with the rise of GE Energy Financial Services. ""Financing on the industrial side is still a going concern at GE,"" said Tim Ghriskey, of Solaris Asset Management, which manages GE shares. ""And GE Capital remains a strong organization. When they became too exposed on the consumer side is when problems surfaced.""Nason, who worked in the George W. Bush administration and helped design the Troubled Asset Relief Program that capitalized American banks in 2008, took the top job at the unit last fall.GE Capital, the parent entity of GE Energy Financial Services, was named a systemically risky financial institution last year by the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council.The designation, commonly known as ""Too Big To Fail,"" in effect guaranteed more regulatory oversight of GE Capital, though Nason said he did not expect that to limit the company's growth in energy investments.""I think I'm uniquely qualified because I lived through the building of the (regulatory) architecture, and now can help a complex company navigate through that,"" he said.Immelt's goal for the company to achieve a profit mix of 70 percent from industrial sales and 30 percent from financing activities is something GE Energy Financial Services will try to mimic, Nason said, dismissing concerns the unit itself could grow to be too unwieldy even for GE to manage.""For our business to get too big for the rest of the company would represent a doubling or tripling of our current size,"" he said. ""It's hard to imagine that GE Energy Financial Services would grow to a point that it would alter the mix that Jeff (Immelt) and the board want.""

114,"   By Benjamin Mallet and Matthieu Protard | PARIS  PARIS U.S. industrial products giant General Electric (GE.N) is in talks to buy the global power division of struggling French engineering group Alstom (ALSO.PA) for more than $10 billion, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.The sources said a deal was backed by Alstom's main shareholder, French conglomerate Bouygues (BOUY.PA) with 29 percent, and could be announced in the coming days after an Alstom board meeting on Friday afternoon.""Talks are going ahead swiftly, the deal's structure is defined and everything is almost ready,"" one of the sources said. ""It would be a very big asset sale, enclosing the entire energy business.""Alstom Chief Executive Patrick Kron confirmed to union representatives there were talks about an ""industrial deal"", but did not name GE.Alstom, Bouygues and General Electric declined to comment.A deal to sell Alstom's power assets, which account for about 70 percent of total group revenue, would effectively break up the engineering group and leave Alstom as a pure transport business, already known for its high-speed TGV trains.It could however be less politically sensitive than a full takeover offer for the company, talk of which caused Alstom shares to soar on Thursday.""By separating Alstom Transport, which may remain an independent French company and national champion, resistance could stay muted,"" Berenberg's William Mackie wrote in a note. The French government weighed into the issue anyway on Friday. French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg promised to protect the national interest and to study ""other solutions and scenarios"" for Alstom, one of France's top private-sector employers. He said he had already met Kron on Thursday and would meet GE's Chief Executive ""shortly"".Alstom was bailed out by the French state in 2004 and relies heavily on orders from national rail operator SNCF and utility EDF (EDF.PA). It employs 18,000 people in France, half of them in the power business, out of 93,000 worldwide.The deal could value the group's power assets - which include turbines for coal, gas and nuclear power plants, wind farms and systems for power transmission and distribution - at over $10 billion, analysts said.One source familiar with the matter gave a price tag of $13 billion including debt.GE has a market capitalization of $265 billion. Trading in Alstom shares was suspended Friday pending a statement from the company. The shares closed up 10.9 percent on Thursday after Bloomberg reported that GE was in talks about a $13 billion full takeover bid for Alstom.Before that report, Alstom shares had slumped 20 percent in 12 months on concerns over its cash flow, and its weakening prospects prompted Bouygues to take a $1.9 billion writedown on its stake in February.Alstom is much smaller than its other main rival, German group Siemens (SIEGn.DE), and has seen orders slump since the 2008 economic crisis depressed demand for new power equipment.In need to raise cash, Alstom had reached out to GE, two industry sources said. Bouygues has declined to comment beyond saying said it supported the company's strategy. Alstom announced 1,300 job cuts last year and put assets up for sale to raise cash, including a stake in its transport business, which makes France's prized high-speed TGV trains. It also floated the possibility of an IPO.De facto, if a deal with GE left Alstom with just its transport arm, a listing would no longer be needed. Bouygues could remain a shareholder of the smaller entity.Shares in Bouygues closed up 4.17 percent on speculation a deal would enable Alstom to return cash deal to shareholders, either via an exceptional dividend or a share buyback.Industry sources said Alstom was strong in steam turbines used by the nuclear industry while GE is a top player in gas turbines and not so strong in steam. A deal would also enable GE to grow in wind power and grid technology, they said.GE, which already employs over 10,000 people in France, has signaled it wants to increase its industrial footprint relative to its financial activities.Ten years ago, when France was negotiating a bailout package for Alstom with European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, Siemens was in the frame as a potential buyer of its power arm. In the end, then French president Nicolas Sarkozy balked at the prospect of German ownership and Alstom stayed intact.A report in Friday's Le Figaro newspaper said Alstom had looked at a similar potential asset swap with Siemens more recently, whereby Alstom would have exchanged its power business against Siemens' rail business. Siemens declined to comment.(Additional reporting by Natalie Huet, Gilles Guillaume and Dominique Vidalon in Paris, Anjuli Davies in London and Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Writing by Natalie Huet and Andrew Callus; Editing by Andrew Roche)",2014-04-25,GE,"Fri Apr 25, 2014 | 2:32pm EDT",GE in talks to buy Alstom's power arm: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alstom-offer-idUSBREA3O1TC20140425?type=companyNews

Montebourg had planned to meet him but the encounter was postponed until later in the week after the minister advertised an alternative proposal by German rival Siemens.The Siemens proposal would create ""two European and global champions in the energy and transport domains - one around Siemens, the other around Alstom"", Montebourg said.French President Francois Hollande gathered his top ministers on Sunday evening to discuss Alstom's case. The company said separately it would make an announcement no later than Wednesday morning and that it had asked for its shares to remain suspended from trading until then. ""Alstom continues and deepens its strategic reflection,"" it said in a three-line statement.Montebourg said the government would not accept any hastily made decision, that it would seek to preserve France's jobs and industrial base and would in particular be ""extremely vigilant"" in ensuring the nation's nuclear industry remains independent.The warning compels Alstom and GE to tread carefully. However, sources familiar with the talks said these were very advanced.""Alstom has received a firm offer from GE and an expression of interest from Siemens. It's not at all the same kind of commitment,"" one of the sources said.TRAINS PLUS CASH  Earlier in the day, Siemens entered the fray with an announcement that it had written a letter to ""signal its willingness to discuss future strategic opportunities"" with the French group. Siemens gave no further details.A report on newspaper Le Figaro's website on Sunday said Siemens was offering Alstom half of its train-making business plus cash in exchange for its French rival's power turbines division.Le Figaro said Siemens was proposing that Alstom take on the Siemens high-speed trains and locomotives arm, but not its metropolitan trains division. A report in Germany's Handelsblatt outlined a similar scenario and put the value of the proposed deal at 10-11 billion euros ($14-15 billion).Alstom CEO Patrick Kron has said in the past he is against creating a Franco-German train manufacturer.As well as the power turbines arm GE wants to buy, Alstom makes TGV high-speed trains and is one of France's top private-sector employers.Though Alstom is struggling with heavy debt and weak demand, political sensitivities run deep in France. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front (FN) party that won widespread support in last month's local elections, said the government had ""abandoned Alstom to be dismantled for American or German profit"".A Siemens tie-up may be no more palatable to some than a deal with GE. A decade ago, Alstom was rescued by a state-backed restructuring when Kron and France's then-president, Nicolas Sarkozy, both balked at the prospect of a Siemens acquisition.OVERLAP A deal to sell Alstom's power assets, which account for about 70 percent of total group revenue, would effectively break up the engineering group and leave Alstom as a pure transport business, building its TGV trains, other rolling stock and rail signaling equipment.Alstom's power assets include turbines for coal, gas and nuclear plants, wind farms and systems for power transmission and distribution. They generated around 15 billion euros or 70 percent of Alstom's global revenue in the last fiscal year and are among the group's most profitable businesses.Alstom is the world's top supplier of turbine generator sets for nuclear plants. The company estimates that its equipment, which is used to produce electricity but is not located inside nuclear reactors, is used in 40 percent of nuclear plants.Alstom employs 18,000 people in France, about 20 percent of its total workforce, against GE's 10,000 French workers and Siemens' 7,000. A source familiar with the matter said there was lots of overlap between Siemens and Alstom's operations in France, more so than with GE.Alstom and Siemens are direct rivals in steam turbines, offshore wind power, hydro power and grid. For its part, GE is absent from offshore wind and hydro power and could use the boost in steam turbines and grid.Sources have said a deal with GE is backed by Alstom's main shareholder, French conglomerate Bouygues, which holds a 29 percent stake.Before the news of an approach from GE, Alstom shares had slumped 20 percent in 12 months on concerns over its cash flow, prompting Bouygues to take a $1.9 billion writedown on its stake in February. Trading of Alstom shares was suspended on Friday at the request of market regulator AMF.

A spokeswoman for Alstom, also a maker of railway rolling stock, had no immediate comment and could not confirm receipt of the letter.Sources close to the French government on Saturday flagged a likely meeting between Montebourg and Immelt on Sunday. They said Prime Minister Manuel Valls might also meet the CEO, head of one of the world's 10 largest investor-controlled companies, should the more senior politician return from a visit to Rome in time. GE had no comment late on Saturday. French media said last week that a decisive Alstom board meeting, the second since Friday, would also take place on Sunday.Socialist Montebourg has been a strong exponent of France's traditionally cautious approach to foreign takeovers of companies in flagship industries.Last week he said he would protect the national interest and study ""other solutions and scenarios"" for Alstom, also the maker of TGV high-speed trains and one of France's top private-sector employers, which is struggling with heavy debt and weak demand.Speaking ahead of the Siemens statement amid intense speculation it would not stand idly by, one source close to the talks said the government had been looking for alternatives for months without success. ""So I don't see what they will find now,"" the source said. DEJA VU SIEMENS Political sensitivities about a French national champion run deep, and a deal with Siemens foundered partly because of them a decade ago when Alstom was rescued by a state-backed restructuring. The plan had been to swap of Alstom's power business with Siemens' rail business. French politicians see a GE deal in a similar light.""I ask you, prime minister, to please tell the shareholders and management of the groups concerned that this transfer of control is out of the question,"" former Socialist minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said in an open letter to Valls.The source close to the talks said GE would argue there was not much concern about job cuts in France, where Alstom employs 20 percent of its workforce, about 18,000 people. The source noted that in gas turbines, for example, GE has its own turbine  business in France while some of Alstom's is in Switzerland.""The French state is asking for assurances from GE; all that is a game that implies a discussion around the disappearance of national champions,"" said the source. ""Conversely, GE will try not to offer too much."" Sources have said a GE deal is backed by Alstom's main shareholder, French conglomerate Bouygues, which holds a 29 percent stake. Alstom's Kron told union officials on Friday he was discussing an ""industrial operation"" but did not name GE.  Bouygues and GE have declined to comment.TRANSFORMATION A deal to sell Alstom's power assets, which account for about 70 percent of total group revenue, would effectively break up the engineering group and leave Alstom as a pure transport business building its well-known high-speed TGV trains, other rolling stock and transport industry equipment.It could, however, be less politically sensitive than a full takeover offer for the company, talk of which caused Alstom shares to soar on Thursday.Since its bailout in 2004, Alstom relies heavily on orders from national rail operator SNCF and utility EDF. It employs 93,000 worldwide, with about half of its French total of 18,000 in the power business.Alstom's power assets include turbines for coal, gas and nuclear power plants, wind farms and systems for power transmission and distribution.The trading of Alstom shares was suspended on Friday after Bloomberg reported that GE planned a full takeover of the company. Before the report, Alstom shares had slumped 20 percent in 12 months on concerns over its cash flow, prompting Bouygues to take a $1.9 billion writedown on its stake in February.Alstom is less than one twentieth the size of GE and much smaller than Siemens, too. Its orders have slumped since the 2008 economic crisis depressed demand for power equipment.(Additional reporting by Andrew Callus, Matthieu Protard, Yann le Guernigou and Natalie Huet; Editing by Mark Potter and David Goodman)",2014-04-27,GE,"Sun Apr 27, 2014 | 5:44am EDT",CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Siemens weighs in as GE prepares Alstom power deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/alstom-offer-idUSL6N0NI0P220140427?type=companyNews
131,"   By Natalie Huet and Benjamin Mallet | PARIS  PARIS France said it would defend jobs and its national interest as it met suitors eyeing a breakup of engineering group Alstom on Monday and suggested it preferred Germany's Siemens over U.S. giant General Electric.President Francois Hollande held talks with GE boss Jeff Immelt on Monday morning and sat down later with Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser to discuss the fate of Alstom, the maker of the country's prestigious TGV high-speed trains and turbines for power plants.""We won't let Alstom sell this national champion behind the back of its shareholders, its employees and the French government,"" Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg wrote on his official Twitter account before the meetings started, accusing Alstom's CEO Patrick Kron of ""a breach of national ethics"".Alstom, which is battling with big debts and falling demand, was bailed out by the French government in 2004 but now needs help again. Smaller than its suitors, it was hardest hit by a slump in orders for power equipment since the 2008 economic downturn depressed electricity prices.Monday's meetings follow a weekend of drama when Alstom's German rival Siemens proposed exchanging part of its train business plus cash for Alstom's power arm to counter a potential Alstom-GE energy tie-up. Montebourg said the Siemens plan would create ""two European and global champions"".Berlin weighed in on Monday morning, saying an Alstom-Siemens deal could offer ""great opportunities"" for Franco-German cooperation.Siemens also re-confirmed its interest in an Alstom deal.After GE CEO Immelt emerged from talks at the presidential palace late on Monday morning, the company issued a statement calling the dialogue ""open, friendly and productive"".""It was important to hear in person President Hollande's perspective and to discuss our plans ... We understand and value his perspective, and are committed to work together,"" it said.Hollande and Montebourg have said their concerns are related to jobs, the nation's energy independence, and the location of activities both in power and rail. A source familiar with the discussions said GE had offered some solutions to these concerns but that there was still a lot of work to do.Montebourg said before the meeting with GE that France would oppose any deal it considered unsuitable. But the minister, who has threatened in the past to nationalize assets belonging to steelmaker ArcelorMittal, stopped short of suggesting the state would do the same for Alstom.""It's too early to raise that question,"" he said. In the evening, Hollande met with Kaeser from Siemens and with Martin Bouygues, the billionaire chairman of family conglomerate Bouygues, which is Alstom's largest shareholder, with a 29.4 percent stake.Kaeser later issued a statement that he had had a ""very open, trustful and amicable exchange"" with Hollande and Montebourg, and the Siemens board would convene as soon as possible to decide whether to make an offer.Immelt arrived in Paris during the weekend, aiming to hammer out a $13 billion deal to buy Alstom's power turbines business. News of talks between the two surfaced last week, and sources with knowledge of them say they have been going on for months and are very advanced.However, Siemens may also be working on refining its proposal, a second source with knowledge of the talks said.""It is clear that Siemens wants to remain in the race. They could come back with a more binding offer or with another, more detailed letter addressing some of the issues pointed out in the press, such as antitrust and jobs.""A third source said it should confirm its offer on Tuesday.ASSET SWAP  Analysts see sense in an Alstom-GE tie-up. GE is relatively weak in turbines for nuclear and coal power generation, where Alstom is strong, and the French group's established base of power installations generated 70 percent of its global revenue in the last year. A deal would also enable GE to expand into offshore wind power and grid technology.Such a beefed-up GE would be a tough competitor for Siemens, hence its counter-attack, say industry sources.Citi analysts estimate that combined with Alstom, Siemens could account for 50 percent of the world's installed power capacity, well ahead of GE's 25-28 percent.GE has struck 50 deals worth more than $125 billion that have been approved by the EU in the past decade. That includes the acquisition of French motor maker Converteam for about $3 billion in 2011.Siemens, like Alstom, makes high-speed trains and other rolling stock as well as power station turbines, and according to sources familiar with its plan is proposing an asset swap that would make Alstom a more significant rail transport player while enhancing its own turbines and power grid equipment business.Its proposal also offers Alstom some cash, and puts an enterprise value of around 10 to 11 billion euros ($14-$15 billion) on Alstom's power arm. Sources close to the talks said that at this stage, the cash in GE's offer was more attractive to Alstom's top shareholder Bouygues, and would also help Alstom finance strategic acquisitions to grow as a pure player in transport.""Meanwhile, Siemens wants to offload a declining business that's partly redundant with Alstom's - that's not very attractive,"" one of the sources said.NATIONALISATION? A deal with Siemens - an option floated a decade ago but rejected by both Alstom's CEO Kron and then-president Nicolas Sarkozy - could be more complicated to carry out, due to more overlap and antitrust issues than with GE, the sources said.Alstom's unions warned a Siemens tie-up would mean big layoffs at both companies. Alstom employs 18,000 people in France, about 20 percent of its total workforce, against GE's 10,000 French workers and 7,000 for Siemens.""Why not a Franco-French solution? Can't the French state intervene directly by partly taking over the stake Bouygues holds?"" the CFE-CGC union said in a statement.The CGT union meanwhile called for Alstom's nationalization. Labor Minister Francois Rebsamen, asked about this option, told France Inter radio: ""I think nothing is out of the question at the moment.""Beyond Monday's brief statement, GE declined to comment. Bouygues has limited itself to saying it supports Alstom's strategy. Siemens said on Sunday it had written to Alstom about strategic opportunities.Siemens has hired Societe Generale and BNP Paribas to help it on a possible deal swap with Alstom, according to sources with knowledge of the situation who declined to be named.Rothschild and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are advising Alstom on the deal, while GE is working with Lazard and Credit Suisse, the sources said. BNP and Societe Generale declined to comment; the other banks were not immediately available for comment.Alstom's shares are suspended from trading until Wednesday while it considers its options. The shares, which had slumped earlier this month to a near nine-year low, jumped at the end of last week to reach their highest in five months.(Additional reporting by Elizabeth Pineau, Nicolas Vinocur, Matthieu Protard and Julien Ponthus in Paris, Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt and Sophie Sassard and Anjuli Davies in London; Editing by Sophie Walker and Will Waterman)",2014-04-28,GE,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 4:54pm EDT",France meets Alstom bidders with pledge to protect jobs,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alstom-offer-idUSBREA3P0ER20140428?type=companyNews

Siemens, like Alstom, makes high-speed trains and other rolling stock as well as power station turbines, and according to sources familiar with its plan is proposing an asset swap that would make Alstom a more significant rail transport player while enhancing its own turbines and power grid equipment business.Its proposal also offers Alstom some cash, and puts an enterprise value of around 10 to 11 billion euros ($14-$15 billion) on Alstom's power arm.Sources close to the talks said that at this stage, the cash in GE's offer was more attractive to Alstom's top shareholder Bouygues, and would also help Alstom finance strategic acquisitions to grow as a pure player in transport.""Meanwhile, Siemens wants to offload a declining business that's partly redundant with Alstom's - that's not very attractive,"" one of the sources said.NATIONALISATION? A deal with Siemens - an option floated a decade ago but rejected by both Alstom's CEO Kron and then-president Nicolas Sarkozy - could be more complicated to carry out, due to more overlap and antitrust issues than with GE, the sources said.Alstom's unions warned a Siemens tie-up would mean big layoffs at both companies. Alstom employs 18,000 people in France, about 20 percent of its total workforce, against GE's 10,000 French workers and 7,000 for Siemens.""Why not a Franco-French solution? Can't the French state intervene directly by partly taking over the stake Bouygues holds?"" the CFE-CGC union said in a statement.The CGT union meanwhile called for Alstom's nationalisation. Labour Minister Francois Rebsamen, asked about this option, told France Inter radio: ""I think nothing is out of the question at the moment.""Beyond Monday's brief statement, GE declined to comment. Bouygues has limited itself to saying it supports Alstom's strategy. Siemens said on Sunday it had written to Alstom about strategic opportunities.Siemens has hired Societe Generale and BNP Paribas to help it on a possible deal swap with Alstom, according to sources with knowledge of the situation who declined to be named.Rothschild and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are advising Alstom on the deal, while GE is working with Lazard and Credit Suisse, the sources said. BNP and Societe Generale declined to comment; the other banks were not immediately available for comment.Alstom's shares are suspended from trading until Wednesday while it considers its options. The shares, which had slumped earlier this month to a near nine-year low, jumped at the end of last week to reach their highest in five months.

133,"  BERLIN, April 28 The German government would rather see Siemens take over the power arm of its French rival Alstom than have it acquired by General Electric, a government source in Berlin told Reuters on Monday.Separately, the German economy ministry said it believes a Siemens-Alstom tie-up would be a great opportunity for both Germany and France and Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel is in contact with all parties, though it is a corporate decision. ""A possible partial takeover offers great opportunities for both Germany and France from a potential industrial and political point of view,"" a ministry spokesman said. The German engineering group is offering Alstom half of its train-making business plus cash in exchange for the French firm's power turbines division, Le Figaro newspaper reported on Sunday.

142,"   By Tim Hepher | PARIS  PARIS As General Electric (GE.N) tries to convince French leaders to back its offer to rescue engineering firm Alstom (ALSO.PA), it hopes that three letters will convince them of its good will: CFM.The initials mask a successful U.S.-French venture that will soon mark 40 years making jet engines.Co-owned by GE and Snecma, a unit of French aerospace group Safran (SAF.PA), CFM has grown from a risky attempt to break into new civil markets into an aviation powerhouse with 26,000 units sold and a CFM-powered jet taking off every two seconds.General Electric Chief Executive Jeff Immelt brought up the engine supplier during a meeting with French President Francois Hollande to press GE's $13 billion offer on Monday, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.Immelt ""stressed that CFM is an excellent example of co-operation"", the person said, asking not to be identified.By doing so, he not only boasted of GE's French credentials in the face of a rival offer from Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE).He also implicitly addressed French concerns over ""economic sovereignty"" by comparing his bid to a previous episode in which the United States agreed to share its own sensitive technology.Although now established in the aircraft industry, the creation of CFM in 1974 was so sensitive that it only went ahead after intervention by U.S. President Richard Nixon and French counterpart Georges Pompidou - one of the few points of agreement at an inconclusive Reykjavik summit a year earlier.That's because the Pentagon had opposed plans to build a new engine with the French, in which GE's contribution was to be closely related to an engine conceived for the B-1 bomber.Under a compromise deal, the first CFM engine tests were conducted in the United States away from the gaze of French engineers, who remained barred for some time from looking inside the sealed casing of the engine's ""core"" section supplied by GE. CFM has managed to thrive, breaking sales records even as France and the U.S. fought over trade and high-profile tie-ups such as Vivendi Universal and Alcatel-Lucent went wrong.It was the brainchild of two industrialists with colorful war records: a German-born fighter engineer who fought for the allies and was made a U.S. citizen by an act of Congress, Gerhard Neumann, and a French resistance hero called Rene Ravaud who lost an arm when the British bombed Brest in western France.It sailed unnoticed through the industry's biggest battles: a record trade dispute between its customers Airbus and Boeing, and a patriotic contest in which Boeing won the right to supply American tankers to the U.S. Air Force, whose existing fleet had quietly run on partially French-designed CFM engines for years.DRIVING FORCE Although three out of four medium-haul jets sold today have CFM engines, the firm is so low-key that few passengers will be aware of its name. But it has been a driving force behind some of the aerospace industry's most important changes, including huge increases in reliability for the workhorse short- and medium-haul jets that paved the way for low-cost airlines.Now, its main U.S. rival, Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N), is stepping up competition with a new generation of engines, prompting CFM to focus on plans for its own new engine series known as LEAP.After a push from leaders followed by a slow start that nearly saw CFM wound up, Immelt will hope that the firm's success shows what can be done in industrial politics.But industry sources say it may also demonstrate the limits of co-operation whenever sensitive assets or pride are at stake.CFM is one of two transatlantic partnerships that operated for decades with minimum publicity, the other involving Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) until Rolls recently exited. Alstom is seen unlikely to dodge the limelight in the same way, with thousands of jobs at stake and a history of getting bogged down in front-line politics. A previous crisis over its future topped French political headlines for weeks in 2004.Secondly, while the jet engine industry has long adapted to the idea that it must forge alliances to share overwhelming development costs, the power-plant industry is still mainly run by national champions, albeit with international activities.Most importantly, GE's offer for Alstom's power turbines appears a very different financial proposition from CFM, which skirted round questions of control by establishing a 50-50 venture and dual U.S. and French assembly lines.Although the ban on looking inside the engine has long ago been lifted, the separation of roles is so strict that to this day, GE and Safran don't know each other's costs on the world's most-sold jet engine, according to executives in both firms.The revenues of CFM International are pooled but each partner is responsible for its own costs and keeps its profits.""It is a partnership in which both companies have stayed on their own territory,"" said Jean-Paul Bechat, the former CEO of Safran and a former aide to CFM's co-founder Ravaud.Industry experts say such Chinese Walls and a growing market both eased CFM's relatively trouble-free development, but are not a model that would easily fit Alstom's entrenched problems.Whoever buys most of Alstom's assets is expected to want real control, while Hollande has called jobs and energy security his priorities for a deal.(Additional reporting by Geert de Clercq; Editing by Giles Elgood)",2014-04-29,GE,"Tue Apr 29, 2014 | 1:04pm EDT",GE trumpets 40-year jet engine venture to bolster Alstom bid,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alstom-offer-cfm-idUSBREA3S06X20140429?type=companyNews
143,"   By Geert De Clercq | PARIS  PARIS General Electric's (GE.N) bid for Alstom's (ALSO.PA) energy business will force a shakeout in the electrical engineering industry, regardless of whether it or a rival suitor succeeds in breaking up the struggling French group.While makers of wind turbines and solar panels have already gone through crisis and consolidation, firms supplying thermal turbines and network equipment to Europe's power generation and distribution industry have yet to undergo such an upheaval.The U.S. group's move on Alstom, which was rescued by the French government in 2004 and now needs help again, has forced German rival Siemens (SIEGn.DE) to prepare a counter attack even though the industry's European customers are themselves in trouble.""GE have clearly woken a sleeping giant,"" said William Mackie, senior capital goods analyst at Berenberg. ""It is very difficult to stand by and do nothing when a competitor like GE appears in your backyard.""The stage is therefore set for the kind of industry reshaping that typically follows a crisis when firms with deeper pockets buy up those with weaker finances such as Alstom, which makes TGV high speed trains as well as power station turbines.For GE, a major global manufacturer of gas-fired turbines,it makes sense to make a deal with Alstom, whose strength is in steam turbines. The U.S. group would achieve a greater presence in Europe, expand into power networks and raise its industrial clout as it retreats from its finance business.For Siemens, which has proposed exchanging part of its train business plus cash for Alstom's power arm, the justification is less clear-cut apart from foiling GE's $13 billion cash bid. For debt-laden Alstom, a deal is a matter of survival which will mean admitting it has failed to become a global energy player.Alstom, which has a market capitalization of $11.5 billion, is far outgunned by GE and Siemens which are worth $268 billion and $144 billion respectively. The French government is trying to stall GE's approach, pushing a deal with Siemens while looking at possible French options to save Alstom.CUSTOMERS IN CRISIS  The engineers' European customers, power utilities, are in their worst crisis since World War II. A glut of subsidized wind and solar energy has created overcapacity, while weak economies and a drive for energy efficiency has depressed demand.With fossil fuel generation in long-term decline and countries such as Germany pulling out of nuclear power, Siemens is being forced to consider investing more in a sector which has an uncertain future. Steam turbines use heat from coal or nuclear reactors to drive a generator while many gas-fired turbines, which resemble jet engines, are already lying idle.European utilities have mothballed or closed more than 20 gigawatts - the equivalent of 20 nuclear plants - of gas-fired power plants and virtually stopped investing in power generation assets, emptying their suppliers' order books.An acquisition of Alstom's power business would boost the energy share of Siemens's revenue to over a half from 30 percent now, said Rob Virdee, an analyst with Espirito Santo Investment Bank.""For Siemens, we see this as a defensive move, which they would not have made if it were not for the GE bid,"" he said. ""The question is to what extent Siemens wants to put so many eggs in the energy basket.""Because of the extensive overlap between Siemens and Alstom businesses, any deal would raise antitrust issues and could put more jobs at risk as the new company seeks efficiencies. Citi said in a note that if Siemens were to acquire all Alstom's energy assets, it would become the world number one in power generation equipment. It would also be global leader in high-voltage power transmission products, ahead of Swiss engineering group ABB ABBN.VX.At present, GE has 39 percent of the world's gas turbine market, compared with 28 percent for Siemens, 16 percent for Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) and just 4 percent for Alstom, SocGen estimates.In steam turbines - a much more fragmented business with more competition and lower margins - Alstom and Siemens each have 4 percent, and GE just 3 percent. The bigger players in steam are India's Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) (BHEL.NS) with 18 percent, Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T) with 10 percent and China's Harbin Electric (1133.HK) with 7 percent. A GE-Alstom or Siemens-Alstom tie-up would become the fourth-biggest player.In grids, the cabling and transformers that help transport electricity over long distances, SocGen estimates ABB is the leading player with 19 percent market share, followed by Siemens with 16 percent, Alstom with 10 percent and GE with just 3.Several analysts said European antitrust objections could be overcome, as the power engineering business is now much more global than a decade ago. A dominant position in any European country would need to be weighed against global competitors such as GE and Mitsubishi Heavy. Beyond Europe, the creation of a new Western heavy engineering giant could even challenge strong local players in growing emerging markets, such as Shanghai Electric Group (601727.SS) in China and India's BHEL.LESSER OVERLAP For Alstom, a GE deal would solve its debt problem and mean fewer layoffs due to the lesser overlap of businesses than with Siemens. Sources close to Alstom's leading shareholder, French group Bouygues (BOUY.PA) which has a 30 percent stake, say it iseager to take up GE's firm offer.However, an Alstom without the power division which makes 70 percent of its sales, would be a middling transport player, unable to compete globally and ripe to become a takeover target.Daniel Cunliffe, head of Nomura's capital goods team in London, says the most likely outcome is a Siemens-Alstom deal.A deal with Siemens would make Alstom the number one transport player in Europe, the world's biggest transport market, with 10-12 billion euros in revenue and able to take on Chinese transport giants such as China Southern Rail and CNR Corp 601299.SS.If GE wins the day, however, Alstom will end up with six to seven billion euros in cash and in the unenviable position of a small to mid-sized engineer. With revenues of four to five billion, it would be at best a top five player in the field of transport with huge competition from China.""They would have a small train asset, worth less than their cash,"" Cunliffe said.(Additional reporting by Natalie Huet)",2014-04-29,GE,"Tue Apr 29, 2014 | 11:18am EDT","Whoever wins Alstom power assets, industry faces shakeout",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alstom-offer-competition-idUSBREA3S0PU20140429?type=companyNews
144,"   By Julien Ponthus and Mark John | PARIS  PARIS General Electric's (GE.N) overtures to the power business of France's former industrial beacon Alstom (ALSO.PA) have shown again how the French state, for all its interventionist zeal, has limited room for maneuver against big business.Citing ""patriotic concern"" over loss of jobs and control of a group with a history stretching back 86 years, President Francois Hollande's government leapt into action to find ways of countering the offer after news of it emerged last week.While Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) - billed by Paris as a possible white knight - still has a month to make its intentions clear, Alstom's decision to review GE's $16.9-billion bid makes the U.S. giant the clear favorite to secure the turbine and grid assets that make up the bulk of Alstom revenues.If GE succeeds, it will mark the latest climb-down for a two-year-old government which has already ended up on the losing side of public stand-offs in the telecom and steel industries.""This is the end of an era. The state no longer has the means to protect weak companies in sensitive sectors,"" left-leaning Le Monde said in a front-page editorial entitled ""The state can't do it all"".Such views are not widely held in a country where the state holds stakes in dozens of blue-chip companies and governments of all stripes see it as their duty to intervene in corporate matters. A conservative government bailed out Alstom in 2004, five years before the economic crisis tore through the firm's order books.Yet the saga of the past week shows Hollande's Socialists unable or unwilling to get out the big guns of state weaponry to ward off the U.S. giant.France's move in 2005 to name dairy group Danone (DANO.PA) a concern of strategic importance to shield it from a feared takeover by U.S. drink-maker PepsiCo is now regarded as a textbook classic of ""economic patriotism"".But GE's offer to ring fence from the Alstom deal the turbines used by France's nuclear industry - which generates some 75 percent of the country's power - has meant the state has not played the strategic concern card this time. Unions are urging the government to purchase a 29 percent stake in Alstom held by industrial group Bouygues, which is seeking an exit to be able to invest in its telecom unit. Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said on Wednesday that he would study the option.But such a move was swiftly knocked down by the official government spokesman, while a source close to Hollande said it would run up against European Union antitrust laws.""Even if the state took on Bouygues' stake, it wouldn't be able to keep it for very long because the European Commission would tell us to get rid of it,"" said the source.Even the emergence of Siemens as a possible savior had an unlikely air about it.One industry insider told Reuters that no one at Alstom wanted a deal with Siemens because everyone - from the low-level worker to chief executive Patrick Kron - recalls how Siemens lobbied against state aid for Alstom back in 2004. Sector analysts noted that overlaps between the two groups made the risk of job losses among Alstom's 18,000 French staff high and questioned whether there was any logic in Siemens' pursuing the matter now that GE was in the driving seat.""We have a slightly critical view of this because it seems that this is more a reaction to GE's move,"" Tim Albrecht, fund manager at DWS Investment, said of Siemens' general expression of interest over the weekend.In taking a share in PSA-Peugeot-Citroen PSA.PA alongside China's Dongfeng (0489.HK), Hollande last month hailed a move aimed at ensuring the turn-around of the ailing auto-maker.But other efforts to intervene have fallen flat. Despite his 2012 promise to protect steelworkers from a plan to close two blast furnaces in northern France, Hollande's government ultimately proved unable to stop owner ArcelorMittal (ISPA.AS) from doing just that one year ago.It was humbled again this month when cable group Numericable NUME.PA won the battle to buy Vivendi's (VIV.PA) telecoms arm SFR despite overt state backing for a rival offer from Bouygues.A more sympathetic narrative is that the government - usually in the strident shape of Economy Minister Montebourg - is holding out for jobs and other key interests against forces that would put the quest for shareholder value above all else.Montebourg told parliament on Wednesday that his efforts had won a month's more time for negotiations on what he urged should be a ""partnership of equals rather than a takeover"".He pointed to the fact that GE boss Jeffrey Immelt had provided guarantees that the deal would boost employment in France and the group would locate global headquarters of several businesses in the country, from grids to hydropower.However, one source close to the discussions said it was likely that GE would have made the same concessions without Montebourg's intervention. Trade unions were equally skeptical of whether it had made a difference.""Promises are only for those who believe in them,"" said Dominique Gillier of the CFDT union, one of those who held crisis talks with Montebourg late on Tuesday.""What we need are guarantees on specific sites.""(Additional reporting by Nicholas Vinocur and Matthieu Protard; Editing by Peter Graff)",2014-04-30,GE,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 3:01pm EDT",GE's Alstom bid shows limits of French state intervention,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alstom-france-state-analysis-idUSBREA3T0XY20140430?type=companyNews
145,"   By James Regan and Benjamin Mallet | PARIS  PARIS Cash-strapped French engineering group Alstom said on Wednesday it would explore a $16.9 billion offer from General Electric for its energy arm while leaving the door open to a rival bid from Germany's Siemens.Alstom gave Siemens until the end of May to propose its own deal after the government of President Francois Hollande balked at the U.S. group's overtures last week, insisting any outcome must safeguard jobs at the one-time champion of French industry, while ensuring the nation's energy independence.But GE led the race to secure assets which would boost its position in producing steam turbines for power stations and technology for electricity grids. Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg - furious when news of the deal emerged last week - softened his tone towards GE, calling it a ""a serious company"".""We have a good relationship with GE,"" Montebourg told a parliamentary committee after Alstom confirmed in a statement it was reviewing the GE offer.""We are ready to discuss alliances, not an absorption. We prefer an equal alliance,"" he said, citing GE's 40-year-old CFM jet engine venture in France with a unit of Safran as a good example of Franco-U.S. cooperation.Reuters reported on Tuesday that GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt had relied on the success of the engine supplier, whose existence dates back to a deal between the late presidents Georges Pompidou and Richard Nixon, as a possible trump card in presenting the bid.GE said its all-cash offer for Alstom's thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses - valued at 7.9 times pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) - was based on an enterprise value of $13.5 billion and $3.4 billion of net cash.In a slide presentation, GE said it would fund the deal with $9.5 billion in cash and $4 billion in debt and that the accord, if it went through, would complete the allocation set aside for merger and acquisition activity this year.MOVE TO TRAINS Alstom's power assets account for around 70 percent of turnover, which was 20.3 billion euros ($28 billion) last year.Considered by many analysts too small to survive alone in the energy sector, Alstom said a GE deal would allow it to re-focus on transport including making TGV high-speed trains. ""Alstom would use the sale proceeds to strengthen its transport business and give it the means of an ambitious development, pay down its debt and return cash to its shareholders,"" the group said in a statement.Alstom shares, suspended since last week, were up 9.5 percent at 29.55 euros at 1330 GMT after trading resumed. They had halved in value over the last four years on concerns about its cash flow since the 2008 economic crisis hit order books.Immelt said talks with the French government on GE's offer had been productive. ""We think we've got a good deal and it's going to be executed,"" he told reporters in Paris. ""We think net employment in France will grow around the Alstom assets.""Industry sources note Alstom is strong in steam turbines used by the nuclear industry, while GE is a top player in gas turbines. A deal would enable GE to expand into grid technology.With the Alstom deal, GE expects its industrial businesses to contribute about 75 percent of company operating earnings by 2016, up from about 55 percent last year. NO SOLICITING Alstom was bailed out by the French state in 2004 and relies heavily on orders from national rail operator SNCF and utility EDF. It employs 18,000 people in France, half of them in the power business, out of 93,000 worldwide.Alstom said its board also noted a declaration of interest from Siemens on an alternative deal and that the German company would have access to information needed to make a binding offer.It added that French group Bouygues, which has a 29 percent stake in Alstom, had promised not to sell its shares until the deal had won final approval of shareholders.The agreement means Alstom cannot solicit offers from third parties to purchase all or part of its energy business, but can respond to unsolicited offers for the entire energy arm. If it recommends GE's offer, Alstom would pay a fee of 1.5 percent of the purchase price if it then backed another offer.Siemens said it had decided to make an offer provided it was given access to Alstom's data, as well as ""permission to interview the management during a period of four weeks"". Industry veterans say Alstom and Siemens have very different corporate cultures, and have competed aggressively against one another for decades, while analysts questioned whether there was any real sense in Siemens going up against a binding bid.""It makes sense (for Siemens) to take this opportunity to learn about Alstom's activities,"" said analyst Pierre Boucheny of financial services group Kepler Cheuvreux. ""This position doesn't imply necessarily the offer will be made.""Siemens declined to comment on Alstom's statement on the GE offer. German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Siemens had written to Alstom to complain about a lack of cooperation on the part of its chief executive Patrick Kron, who they said was not interested in direct talks.Montebourg told parliamentarians his objections had halted what he called an over-hasty rush by GE and Alstom to clinch a deal. But he was more circumspect on how the government would seek to influence the review period for the U.S. offer.He noted explicitly Alstom's promise that the review would take into account ""all stakeholders' interests including the French state"" and said it would examine a request by unions to raise its small 1 percent stake in the group - an option which the government spokesman later said was not on the table.However, he said the readiness of GE to leave under French control turbine assets vital to France's nuclear sector - which generates 75 percent of the country's power needs - meant France could not invoke strategic interests to block the deal.Hollande, whose poll ratings are at record lows due to his failure to tackle unemployment stuck at above 10 percent, has said the government will place a priority on preserving jobs.But unions remained unconvinced.

159,"   By Noah Barkin and Irene Preisinger | BERLIN  BERLIN When Joe Kaeser took the reins of German engineering giant Siemens (SIEGn.DE) last summer after a boardroom coup, he made clear his priority was closing a yawning profitability gap with rivals such as General Electric (GE.N).On Wednesday the 56-year-old Bavarian presents his grand strategy, but it is likely to be overshadowed by something that investors and even some Siemens executives fear could undermine his profit drive: a politically-charged battle with the U.S. group for France's Alstom (ALSO.PA).Kaeser is expected to unveil a major streamlining of the Munich-based company's structure involving thousands of job cuts plus a series of smaller acquisitions and disposals.Siemens announced last week that it would make a formal offer for Alstom - most likely in the form of a swap of power and rail assets - after being encouraged by the French and German governments to step in. Hours later, Alstom's board chose to accept a $16.9 billion GE bid for the French firm's energy unit.How Kaeser reacts - and the signals he sends about his true interest in Alstom - will be as closely watched as the strategic overhaul that he is to present at the firm's historic Siemensstadt complex in Berlin.Siemens already tried to snap up the energy assets of Alstom - chiefly the manufacture of turbines for power stations and electricity transmission equipment - when the French firm required a state bailout a decade ago.But Kaeser has yet to attempt a big deal since he replaced Peter Loescher as chief executive following a string of profit warnings. ""It is his first major act, his first big acquisition,"" said Christoph Niesel, a fund manager at Union Investment. ""If it goes wrong, he won't be able to blame his predecessor anymore. He will be responsible.""Siemens shares have risen nearly 17 percent since Kaeser's arrival. Earlier this year, they poked above 100 euros for the first time in six years, a sign of confidence in the no-nonsense pragmatist and 34-year veteran of Siemens who had previously been finance chief.LEANER, FLATTER  Hoping to keep the momentum going, Kaeser is expected to unveil a leaner, flatter structure that will put an end to the firm's four big divisions - industry, energy, healthcare and infrastructure/cities.In their place, according to German media, will come roughly 10 smaller divisions, including new ones focused on industrial software and digital production processes. The change could result in an additional 5,000 to 10,000 job cuts.Kaeser, who changed his first name from Josef during a stint in the United States, may also confirm the purchase of Rolls-Royce's (RR.L) energy business for just under 1 billion euros, and the sale of a majority stake in Austrian unit VAI Metals Technologies to Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T).For its fiscal second quarter, Siemens is expected to post a 27 percent increase in pre-tax profit to 1.7 billion euros on Wednesday, with revenues flat at just over 18 billion. But the focus will be on Alstom, a deal that would come with big risks for Siemens. Kaeser first approached Alstom CEO Patrick Kron about a deal in February when rumors surfaced that GE was interested in the French firm, but got the brush-off.Less than a year after Kron became CEO in 2003, Siemens tried to thwart the state bailout of Alstom in the hope of snapping up some of its best assets. Some executives worry how the two bitter rivals could ever work harmoniously together.There are also competition concerns, notably around the proposed transfer of Siemens' rail assets to Alstom in exchange for its energy business.The French government has said this swap would create two European champions, one supplying the energy industry and the other making rail equipment including high-speed trains. But authorities in Brussels could thwart the creation of a rail group which commands two thirds of the European market.Because of problems like these, some analysts suspect Kaeser may have thrown his hat into the ring merely to bid up the price for GE, and to avoid antagonizing the French and German governments, both big clients. Kaeser has already infuriated some in the Berlin government by meeting President Vladimir Putin at his residence near Moscow in the midst of the Ukraine crisis.MAJOR DISTRACTION German weekly Der Spiegel reported at the weekend that even members of the Siemens board had deep doubts about a deal with Alstom and were secretly hoping GE would emerge the winner.""The world won't end for us if we don't get it,"" one board member was quoted as saying. ""The future of Siemens does not depend on this.""On the contrary, some investors fear an Alstom deal would turn into a major distraction. They say Siemens concentrate on catching up with more profitable rivals such as GE and Philips (PHG.AS), paring back its vast, complex portfolio and getting a grip on the costly delays that have plagued off-shore wind and high-speed train projects.Tim Albrecht, a fund manager at DWS Investment, said he would prefer a low-risk strategy in which the company emphasizes organic growth over big acquisitions such as Alstom.""We had hoped the company would focus on its profitable businesses, sell off those with poor margins and use the proceeds to give something back to shareholders, either through a share buyback or dividend payout,"" he said.

Hours later, Alstom's board chose to accept a $16.9 billion GE bid for the French firm's energy unit.How Kaeser reacts - and the signals he sends about his true interest in Alstom - will be as closely watched as the strategic overhaul that he is to present at the firm's historic Siemensstadt complex in Berlin.Siemens already tried to snap up the energy assets of Alstom - chiefly the manufacture of turbines for power stations and electricity transmission equipment - when the French firm required a state bailout a decade ago. But Kaeser has yet to attempt a big deal since he replaced Peter Loescher as chief executive following a string of profit warnings. ""It is his first major act, his first big acquisition,"" said Christoph Niesel, a fund manager at Union Investment. ""If it goes wrong, he won't be able to blame his predecessor anymore. He will be responsible.""Siemens shares have risen nearly 17 percent since Kaeser's arrival. Earlier this year, they poked above  100 euros for the first time in six years, a sign of confidence in the no-nonsense pragmatist and 34-year veteran of Siemens who had previously been finance chief.LEANER, FLATTER Hoping to keep the momentum going, Kaeser is expected to unveil a leaner, flatter structure that will put an end to the firm's four big divisions - industry, energy, healthcare and infrastructure/cities. In their place, according to German media, will come roughly 10 smaller divisions, including new ones focused on industrial software and digital production processes. The change could result in an additional 5,000 to 10,000 job cuts.Kaeser, who changed his first name from Josef during a stint in the United States, may also confirm the purchase of Rolls-Royce's energy business for just under 1 billion euros, and the sale of a majority stake in Austrian unit VAI Metals Technologies to Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries .For its fiscal second quarter, Siemens is expected to post a 27 percent increase in pre-tax profit to 1.7 billion euros on Wednesday, with revenues flat at just over 18 billion.But the focus will be on Alstom, a deal that would come with big risks for Siemens. Kaeser first approached Alstom CEO Patrick Kron about a deal in February when rumours surfaced that GE was interested in the French firm, but got the brush-off.Less than a year after Kron became CEO in 2003, Siemens tried to thwart the state bailout of Alstom in the hope of snapping up some of its best assets. Some executives worry how the two bitter rivals could ever work harmoniously together.There are also competition concerns, notably around the proposed transfer of Siemens' rail assets to Alstom in exchange for its energy business. The French government has said this swap would create two European champions, one supplying the energy industry and the other making rail equipment including high-speed trains. But authorities in Brussels could thwart the creation of a rail group which commands two thirds of the European market.Because of problems like these, some analysts suspect Kaeser may have thrown his hat into the ring merely to bid up the price for GE, and to avoid antagonising the French and German governments, both big clients.Kaeser has already infuriated some in the Berlin government by meeting President Vladimir Putin at his residence near Moscow in the midst of the Ukraine crisis.MAJOR DISTRACTION German weekly Der Spiegel reported at the weekend that even members of the Siemens board had deep doubts about a deal with Alstom and were secretly hoping GE would emerge the winner.""The world won't end for us if we don't get it,"" one board member was quoted as saying. ""The future of Siemens does not depend on this.""On the contrary, some investors fear an Alstom deal would turn into a major distraction. They say Siemens concentrate on catching up with more profitable rivals such as GE and Philips , paring back its vast, complex portfolio and getting a grip on the costly delays that have plagued off-shore wind and high-speed train projects.Tim Albrecht, a fund manager at DWS Investment, said he would prefer a low-risk strategy in which the company emphasises organic growth over big acquisitions such as Alstom.""We had hoped the company would focus on its profitable businesses, sell off those with poor margins and use the proceeds to give something back to shareholders, either through a share buyback or dividend payout,"" he said.

165,"  NEW DELHI May 5 General Electric Co on Monday made tender offers to buy shares worth up to $389 million in two of Alstom SA's India units to comply with local rules, following its $16.9 billion bid to buy the French group's energy unit.GE has offered to buy 25 percent in Alstom T&D India Ltd  from public shareholders at 261.25 rupees a share in a deal valued at up to $278 million, according to a notice issued to Indian stock exchanges by the offer manager Credit Suisse.GE is also seeking to buy 26 percent of Alstom India Ltd  at 382.20 rupees per share for up to $111 million, said a separate filing. GE will proceed with the offers only if its bid for Alstom's energy arm goes through, the filings said. Cash-strapped French engineering group Alstom said last week it would explore a $16.9 billion offer from General Electric for its energy arm while leaving the door open to a rival bid from Germany's Siemens. Shares in Alstom T&D India were up 6.4 percent at 289.15 rupees, while Alstom India lost early gains and were trading down 0.8 percent at 452 rupees at 0504 GMT. The broader index  was up 0.28 percent. GE will indirectly acquire Alstom's 75 percent stake in Alstom T&D and 68.6 percent in Alstom India, if its bid to buy the French group's energy unit is successful, requiring the U.S. group to launch tender offer as per Indian market rules.

172,"   By Noah Barkin | BERLIN  BERLIN German engineering giant Siemens (SIEGn.DE) unveiled a long-awaited restructuring on Wednesday in a drive to catch up with more profitable competitors and said it would not be forced into a bidding war with GE (GE.N) for the energy assets of French rival Alstom.The Munich-based firm's Chief Executive Joe Kaeser has been working on the new strategy since taking power last summer following a boardroom coup that pushed out his predecessor Peter Loescher after a series of profit warnings.Ahead of Kaeser's presentation at the firm's historic ""Siemensstadt"" site in Berlin, the company posted weaker-than-expected earnings for its fiscal second quarter, hit by charges in its energy business, and announced a series of smaller deals.Siemens said it was buying energy assets from Rolls-Royce (RR.L) for 950 million euros ($1.32 billion) and transferring a majority stake in its Austrian metals business to Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) for undisclosed terms.As part of the overhaul, dubbed ""Vision 2020"" the company is taking out a layer of management by cutting back to nine core divisions, publicly listing its hearing aids business and separating out management of its healthcare business, a move several analysts said could be a first step towards a spin-off.Asked about the future of healthcare, Kaeser made clear a spin-off was not on the near-term agenda, but suggested capital markets could be tapped in the future if big acquisitions were required.The steps are aimed at strengthening Siemens' focus on electrification, automation and digitalisation -- processes to help industrial companies produce more efficiently. Taken together, they are expected to deliver productivity gains of 1 billion euros per year from the end of fiscal 2016.Siemens shares, which pushed to a six-year high above 100 euros earlier this year, rose 2.2 percent to 94.9 euros by mid-afternoon, slightly outperforming the European industrials index .SXNP and German benchmark DAX .GDAXI.According to Reuters data, the company still trades at a 7.3 percent discount to its major European peers on a 12-month forward EV/EBITDA basis.ALSTOM & PUTIN  The revamp comes as Siemens mulls a formal offer for the energy business of French rival Alstom (ALSO.PA), which is already the target of a bid from U.S. giant General Electric (GE.N).The French government views the GE bid with scepticism and has encouraged Siemens to enter the race despite lingering resentments between the European rivals over the German firm's attempt to snap up Alstom assets a decade ago when the French group was forced to accept a state bailout.Kaeser said he had discussed a possible combination with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government has sent positive signals about it, and would not be considering an offer for the Alstom business unless he was serious.But he made clear that a decision to bid would ""not be forced on us"" and said Siemens, which has been given four weeks to study Alstom's finances before committing, would insist on full control of any assets it purchased -- perhaps a reference to France's desire for job guarantees.Kaeser also expressed regret for referring to the crisis in Ukraine as ""short-term turbulences"" when he paid a controversial visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin in late March.""The situation has escalated and I am very concerned about developments,"" he said. Siemens has a partnership with the Russian railway monopoly, suppyling high-speed trains. Under former CEO Loescher, Siemens went on an aggressive drive for growth, leaving it lumbered with a complex portfolio of businesses.Kaeser, 56, a 34-year veteran of Siemens who previously served as its finance chief, is boosting employee share ownership and trying to restore pride at a company that has lagged its biggest competitors in terms of innovation and profitability.Siemens posted an EBITDA margin of 10.5 percent last year, falling short of Swiss engineer ABB's ABBN.VX 14.8 percent andGE's 18.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.The presentation at the vast ""Siemensstadt"" industrial complex -- built in the early decades of the 20th century and site of Siemens headquarters between the two world wars -- is a sign of Kaeser's determination to take the company back to its proud roots.

174,"   By Natalie Huet and Benjamin Mallet | PARIS  PARIS French industrial engineer Alstom (ALSO.PA) posted a drop in orders and annual profit and scrapped its dividend on Wednesday, underscoring its case for a deal with U.S. conglomerate General Electric (GE.N) to secure its future.Alstom, which makes power generation and transmission systems as well as trains and trams, said last week it was reviewing a binding $16.9 billion offer from General Electric (GE) for its energy arm.It also left the door open to a potential deal with Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE), an alternative European option promoted by the French government.The government has repeatedly tried to weigh into the talks with GE, in an effort to protect jobs and plants in what would be France's biggest ever takeover by a U.S. company.Alstom chief executive Patrick Kron said it was legitimate for the government to comment on the talks, but stressed the need for a quick fix for the group's problems. He said if Siemens made a formal offer it would be examined, but that the uncertainty risked hurting Alstom's business and staff morale.""My goal is to ensure the process is serene, rigorous and transparent, but also that it doesn't drag on for too long because in the end it would take a toll on the company and its employees,"" he told reporters.Siemens, which unveiled a long-awaited restructuring on Wednesday, confirmed it was considering an offer for Alstom's energy arm, but added it would not be pressured into a deal.Alstom was bailed out by the French state 10 years ago and now needs help again as it battles with big debts, tough competition and weak demand in the energy market. It saw orders fall 10 percent, net profit drop 28 percent and it also burned cash in its financial year ended March 31.The government, which has a stake of less than 1 percent in Alstom but whose opposition could be a deterrent to GE, has said its aim is to secure a better deal. After voicing its preference for a tie-up with Siemens, it suggested a deal combining GE and Alstom's rail businesses.Kron said he was more interested in GE's rail signaling activities than its diesel-powered locomotives, which are mainly used for freight. He called these a ""niche"" activity, mainly U.S.-centered and unlikely to bring synergies with Alstom's business, which focuses on passenger transit.If Alstom's board decided at the end of the month to accept GE's bid, Kron said the deal would be submitted to the vote of shareholders in September or October, after consultation with staff representatives and competition regulators. Alstom shares were up 0.9 percent at 1205 GMT. Analysts said the positive news came from stronger-than-expected free cash flow in the second half of the year. They also welcomed a late pick up in sales of gas turbines to 11 units over the full year, when Alstom had sold just one over the first nine months.SHELTERING FROM THE STORM A deal to sell Alstom's power businesses, which account for about 70 percent of its total revenue, would break up the group and leave it as a pure transport player. That side of the business has in recent years held up better than the power side, hit hard by a slump in orders for power equipment from utilities since the 2008 economic downturn depressed electricity prices.Kron hinted he would eventually step down from a refocused Alstom and a company spokesman confirmed it would be driven by current transport chief Henri Poupart-Lafarge.

175,"  * Orders and profit fall, scraps dividend, burns cash* CEO says uncertainty over GE deal could hurt business* CEO says won't stay in transport-focused Alstom* Margins up in transport, thermal but down in grid, wind   (Recasts with Alstom CEO comments, adds shares)By Natalie Huet and Benjamin MalletPARIS, May 7 French industrial engineer Alstom  posted a drop in orders and annual profit and scrapped its dividend on Wednesday, underscoring its case for a deal with U.S. conglomerate General Electric to secure its future.Alstom, which makes power generation and transmission systems as well as trains and trams, said last week it was reviewing a binding $16.9 billion offer from General Electric (GE) for its energy arm.It also left the door open to a potential deal with Germany's Siemens, an alternative European option promoted by the French government.The government has repeatedly tried to weigh into the talks with GE, in an effort to protect jobs and plants in what would be France's biggest ever takeover by a U.S. company.Alstom chief executive Patrick Kron said it was legitimate for the government to comment on the talks, but stressed the need for a quick fix for the group's problems. He said if Siemens made a formal offer it would be examined, but that the uncertainty risked hurting Alstom's business and staff morale. ""My goal is to ensure the process is serene, rigorous and transparent, but also that it doesn't drag on for too long because in the end it would take a toll on the company and its employees,"" he told reporters.Siemens, which unveiled a long-awaited restructuring on Wednesday, confirmed it was considering an offer for Alstom's energy arm, but added it would not be pressured into a deal.Alstom was bailed out by the French state 10 years ago and now needs help again as it battles with big debts, tough competition and weak demand in the energy market.It saw orders fall 10 percent, net profit drop 28 percent and it also burned cash in its financial year ended March 31.The government, which has a stake of less than 1 percent in Alstom but whose opposition could be a deterrent to GE, has said its aim is to secure a better deal. After voicing its preference for a tie-up with Siemens, it suggested a deal combining GE and Alstom's rail businesses. Kron said he was more interested in GE's rail signaling activities than its diesel-powered locomotives, which are mainly used for freight. He called these a ""niche"" activity, mainly U.S.-centered and unlikely to bring synergies with Alstom's business, which focuses on passenger transit.If Alstom's board decided at the end of the month to accept GE's bid, Kron said the deal would be submitted to the vote of shareholders in September or October, after consultation with staff representatives and competition regulators.Alstom shares were up 0.9 percent at 1205 GMT. Analysts said the positive news came from stronger-than-expected free cash flow in the second half of the year. They also welcomed a late pick up in sales of gas turbines to 11 units over the full year, when Alstom had sold just one over the first nine months.SHELTERING FROM THE STORM  A deal to sell Alstom's power businesses, which account for about 70 percent of its total revenue, would break up the group and leave it as a pure transport player. That side of the business has in recent years held up better than the power side, hit hard by a slump in orders for power equipment from utilities since the 2008 economic downturn depressed electricity prices.Kron hinted he would eventually step down from a refocused Alstom and a company spokesman confirmed it would be driven by current transport chief Henri Poupart-Lafarge.Kron said he was for now focused on leading the group's strategic transition and wanted above all to avoid a repeat of the bruising restructuring he carried out when he took the helm in 2003, when Alstom was on the verge of bankruptcy and ultimately rescued by the French state.""There is the option of waiting for the storm to come and see if we'll stay afloat,"" Kron said.

176,"  PARIS May 7 French engineering group Alstom  has more interest in General Electric's rail signaling activities than its freight train business, Chief Executive Patrick Kron said on Wednesday.The French government has said the U.S. conglomerate's offer to take over Alstom's power and grid business is not acceptable as it stands and has suggested a deal that would also combine the two companies' rail businesses.Kron called GE's freight locomotives business a ""niche"" activity, however, that was very U.S.-centered and unlikely to bring synergies with Alstom's transport business. Rail signaling, meanwhile, was a segment the French firm was eager to expand into. ""I'm much more interested in signaling activities than in diversifying into a business in which we are not present,"" Kron told reporters on a conference call. Kron also restated that Alstom would also give rival Siemens  fair access to its books to enable the German company  to make a competing binding offer.

Profit in the energy sector tumbled 54 percent to 255 million euros, largely due to 310 million euros in project charges related to two high-voltage direct current transmission (HVDC) projects in Canada. Kaeser took the reins of the company last summer following the ouster of Peter Loescher.

Increased demand for power distribution systems and railroad network equipment is expected to help profit at its energy and infrastructure unit double. While income from semiconductors is expected to fall, it will still account for more than half of operating profit.Toshiba, a leading supplier of flash memory chips used in smartphones and tablet computers, predicted operating income of 330 billion yen ($3.2 billion) in the year ending March 31, also boosted by an expected rebound in consumer appliances such as TVs and computers. The guidance, however, fell short of an average estimate of 355 billion yen from 22 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. In the business year just ended, it posted an operating profit of 291 billion yen, 47 percent higher than the previous year.Toshiba's power grid business is set to be in focus after the Nikkei business daily said the Japanese conglomerate will offer to buy Alstom's power grid unit if General Electric Co purchases the French firm's energy business.Alstom, which is reviewing GE's offer, has given Germany's Siemens AG until the end of May to make a rival bid.

187,"   By Noah Barkin | BERLIN  BERLIN France's economic woes are the result of poor policy choices at home and Paris should stop blaming its problems on the strength of the euro, Jean-Claude Juncker, the center-right candidate for European Commission president, told Reuters.The former prime minister of Luxembourg and long-time head of the Eurogroup forum of euro zone finance ministers spoke days after French Prime Minister Manuel Valls described the strong euro as a threat to growth and jobs.Valls, a Socialist, urged the European Central Bank to adjust policy to weaken the single currency, which reached a 2-1/2 year high just below $1.40 on Thursday before comments from ECB President Mario Draghi pushed it lower.France, the second biggest economy in the euro zone, has been dogged by high unemployment and weak growth, casting doubt on its ability to meet EU-mandated deficit targets. The economic weakness was behind President Francois Hollande's decision to reshuffle his government last month, bringing in Valls.""I don't believe France is the sick man of Europe,"" Juncker said after an EU election campaign appearance in Berlin on Thursday. ""But I do caution against looking for the causes of what is partly the result of (its) own mistakes somewhere other than at home."" Juncker, 59, said the strong currency had created problems for a number of euro zone member states, but that its level was the same for all. ""If France has a tougher time than other countries, then the reasons for this are to be found in France, not in exchange rates,"" he said.Speaking earlier, Juncker suggested that the German economy was doing better than France's because it was run by a center-right leader.Juncker is the lead candidate for the European People's Party (EPP) in May 25 elections for the European Parliament. His main rival for the Commission presidency is Social Democrat Martin Schulz, a German. EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS In comments that may be more warmly received in France, Juncker also backed the idea of European industrial champions, saying governments should use planemaker Airbus (AIRP.PA) as a model in promoting tie-ups across other sectors. In the past weeks, the French government has intervened to prevent U.S. conglomerate General Electric (GE.N) from taking over the energy assets of French rival Alstom (ALSO.PA), by encouraging Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) to make a counter-bid.Paris has argued that a transaction with Siemens has the potential to create two European champions - one in energy, the other in trains. But Alstom's management would clearly prefer to sell to GE, and Siemens seems lukewarm on the idea of a deal.In the interview, Juncker defended the right of governments to intervene in corporate deals that affect their interests, describing Airbus - the Toulouse-based commercial jet manufacturer created by France and Germany as a rival to Boeing (BA.N) - as a success story to be copied.""When the opportunity presents itself to put a (national) champion on a broader footing, we should try to launch European champions,"" Juncker said. ""Governments shouldn't decide for companies, but governments have an interest and a right to be part of such decisions.""(Editing by Catherine Evans)",2014-05-09,GE,"Fri May 9, 2014 | 3:05am EDT",Juncker says France shouldn't blame its woes on euro,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-france-euro-juncker-idUSBREA4803J20140509?type=companyNews
188,"  * Merkel: Government will not interfere in corporate decision* Hollande says top concern is for Siemens, Alstom employees* Alstom reviewing $16.9 bln offer from General Electric   (Adds sources on option of French state stake)By Andreas RinkeSTRALSUND, Germany, May 10 Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday the German government would support a tie-up between engineering firm Siemens and French rival Alstom if the corporate decision-makers decide that it would make sense.Cash-strapped Alstom, which makes power generation and transmission systems as well as trains and trams, is reviewing a binding $16.9-billion bid by U.S. giant General Electric  for the energy activities that make up the bulk of its business.Sources close to discussions on Alstom's future said the option of the French state taking a stake in the group had been mooted but was not under serious consideration for now.Speaking at a news conference with French President Francois Hollande in the Baltic town of Stralsund, Merkel said it was above all a corporate decision and her government did not want to intervene in that process. ""Those are corporate decisions and we, from the German side at least, will not get involved in that,"" Merkel said.""But we talked about it. If the corporate decisions lead to the point where one says 'that would be advantageous' then Germany will also positively accompany it.""Hollande agreed with Merkel that any takeover was above all a corporate decision and both said their governments were waiting for Siemens to make an offer. Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser has already discussed a possible bid for Alstom's energy business with Merkel and met French officials about it in Paris on Friday.""We are awaiting the detailed offer from Siemens before taking a position. We don't want to prejudge the choice,"" Hollande said.He also said the French government was focusing on what would be in the best interests of Alstom and Siemens employees. DOOR OPEN Alstom said last week it was reviewing GE's offer but would leave the door open to Siemens if it came forward with proposals by the end of the month. The French government had previously signalled it would prefer such a Franco-German tie-up.The French state currently has a 0.9 percent stake in Alstom via its CDC state holdings vehicle.France's interventionist Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg told parliament on April 30 the government would consider taking a larger stake in the group as urged by trade unions, but such an option was played down hours later by the government.One source familiar with the latest discussions said a shareholding in Alstom was ""one option the French state is looking into"" but other sources cautioned that it was unlikely to get traction.""That option might have been discussed (between French and German officials) but the likelihood of seeing it happen is close to zero,"" said one source familiar with the situation.

189,"   By Ernest Scheyder and Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co's (GE.N) $16.9 billion bid for Alstom SA's (ALSO.PA) power business will do little to slow down GE's oil and gas division, according to the head of the unit, even though such a transaction could preclude any more big deals by the U.S. conglomerate until after next year.""We're looking to continue the pace of growth and continue to grow in line with the market, if not ahead of the market, and increase our presence within GE,"" Lorenzo Simonelli, president of GE Oil & Gas, said in an interview.As the energy boom in North America's shale fields has gathered pace, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and other GE customers have been snapping up wellhead bores, compressors and sensors made by the unit, now GE's third-largest by revenue.Revenue at the unit has jumped more than 80 percent to nearly $17 billion over the past four years. During that time, GE Oil & Gas has struck a series of deals, including the $3 billion acquisition of Lufkin, which makes oil-field pumps that are the workhorses of the industry.But the sheer size of the Alstom bid could mean less investment at other GE units, at least in terms of big acquisitions. After all, GE executives promised the deal, if consummated, would effectively use up most of what the company has set aside for mergers and acquisitions this year and next.But Simonelli shrugs off such concerns. ""2015 is just around the corner,"" he said. ""It's not a long time, so really it doesn't disturb me too much."" INTERNATIONAL AMBITIONS Simonelli expects his division, which posted profit of $2.2 billion last year on revenue of $17 billion, to increase revenue at a high single-digit percentage rate in the coming years.GE's play for Lufkin last year has already helped the company take its oilfield pumps overseas to Argentina and other countries with fast-growing shale fields, Simonelli said.""The globalization of Lufkin is definitely one of our key priorities,"" he said. Under his leadership, the unit is focusing on three main areas: deepwater oilfield technology, shale development and liquefied natural gas products.Another priority is the $125 million research facility that GE is building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.The aim is to be closer to Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N), Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) and other independent oil and gas producers that are leading the U.S. shale development. The center, set to open next year, is similar to a research center that GE operates in Rio de Janeiro. Serving Statoil (STL.OL) and other GE customers, it would enable them to address operational problems in conjunction with GE scientists.Any patents or intellectual property rights emerging from the research there are to be negotiated beforehand on a case-by-case basis, Simonelli said. That is a potential sticking point, as the energy industry is traditionally secretive about research and such collaborations are rare.In addition, some energy companies, especially Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSa.L) and other international energy companies, have been trimming spending and selling underperforming assets to return cash to shareholders, potentially limiting funds for GE's services.Simonelli dismissed such concerns, saying that ultimately GE wants to help customers save money and develop new technology.""The best way to assist customers,"" he said, ""is to find better ways to manage costs and manage capital.""(Editing by Frank McGurty and Matthew Lewis)",2014-05-12,GE,"Mon May 12, 2014 | 7:03am EDT",GE oil chief sees more growth despite Alstom deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-general-electric-energy-idUSBREA4B07M20140512?type=companyNews
190,"   By Jean-Baptiste Vey and Benjamin Mallet | PARIS  PARIS The French government has issued a decree allowing it to block any foreign takeovers of French companies in ""strategic"" industries, throwing up a potential roadblock to General Electric's (GE.N) planned $16.9 billion bid for Alstom's (ALSO.PA) energy assets.The decree published in the official state gazette on Thursday, and seen by Reuters, will give the state much-increased powers to block foreign takeovers in the energy, water, transport, telecoms and health sectors.Any such acquisition will now need the approval of the Economy Minister, the decree published in France's Official Journal said.The government had not previously given any hint it was considering such a measure, although Economy and Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg has openly criticized the Alstom-GE proposal and instead advocated a European tie-up with Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE). The French engineering group has given itself until the end of the month to review its options.""With this decree, we're armed to continue discussions and negotiations with the two companies that have expressed an interest,"" a source close to Montebourg said. GE declined to comment. No one at Alstom was immediately available for comment outside European business hours.Cash-strapped Alstom, which builds France's high-speed trains, was bailed out by the French government a decade ago and is seen by many in France as an embodiment of the country's engineering prowess. ""This decree will smooth the way for talks with GE and Siemens and allow our demands to get more of a hearing,"" the source said. The veto will not necessarily be used, the source added, but is aimed at giving France a seat at the table.The source said France did not seek to block foreign investments but to ensure strategic sectors are protected in the nation's interest.The powers granted are similar to what already exists in other European countries and in the United States, where the president has powers to block certain deals, the source added.(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Writing by Michel Rose; editing by Geert De Clercq, David Evans and Andrew Hay)",2014-05-14,GE,"Wed May 14, 2014 | 7:01pm EDT",France issues law to block foreign takeovers of strategic firms,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-france-takeovers-idUSBREA4D0WG20140514?type=companyNews

193,"  (Adds fresh minister comments on Siemens)By Natalie HuetPARIS May 14 France's energy minister muddied the waters over the future of engineering group Alstom  on Wednesday, eventually toeing the government line on the need to examine a proposal from Siemens after first appearing to favour a tie-up with General Electric.In a magazine interview in which she also called her male colleagues ""cocksure machos"", former presidential candidate Segolene Royal said: ""General Electric is a very good opportunity for Alstom. It's the best industrial project.""Why not say it? ... And why do we always try to scare away foreign investment? We actually really need it.""Cash-strapped Alstom has welcomed GE's offer to buy its power turbines and grid business for 12.35 billion euros ($16.9 billion), but the French government has weighed into the talks in an attempt to get alternative offers. Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg has openly criticized the Alstom-GE deal and instead advocated a European tie-up with Germany's Siemens. Alstom has given itself until the end of the month to review its options.Royal changed tack later on Wednesday, saying she had no preference at this stage.Siemens ""has considerably improved its offer"" to include a ""European project"" in the areas of trains and renewable energy, she said after a meeting between French ministers and Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser in Paris. ""The different offers will be compared with each other, and these offers are in the process of improving, it's a good thing for jobs in France,"" she added.A source familiar with the matter said Kaeser did not bring any concessions to the table during Wednesday's talks.The outspoken Royal, who is also the mother of President Francois Hollande's four children, said in the Paris Match magazine interview that her male colleagues treated her with contempt. Angry with the resurgence in parliament of an environment tax she wants to bury, Royal, who made a political comeback when she was named minister in March, told the magazine she would not be silenced.""If they think they can muzzle me, they're mistaken,"" she said. ""Yes, I do speak my mind. This is my right and I will defend it whatever happens.""For its part, GE has entered talks to sell minority stakes in Alstom's wind and hydroelectric businesses, said a source close to the talks on Wednesday.When detailing GE's bid, CEO Jeff Immelt had signaled in a letter to Hollande that the U.S. group was willing to work with the government and to sell Alstom's wind turbine activities to French investors. Areva has been cited in newspaper reports as a likely buyer but has declined to comment.A spokesman for GE France declined to comment on Royal's comments. Alstom declined to comment beyond saying the committee of independent directors it had set up to review the GE bid was at work and that Siemens had still not made a formal offer.

General Electric (GE) said it would pursue its talks for a deal with Alstom, but some analysts suggested rival suitor Siemens would now be encouraged.The move extends a 2005 law on defense and other industries and gives the state much-increased powers to block foreign takeovers in the energy, water, transport, telecoms and health sectors - potentially affecting about a quarter of the companies in France's CAC-40 blue-chip equities index.Any such acquisition will now need the approval of the economy minister, the decree published in France's Official Journal said.The current holder of the post Arnaud Montebourg - a self-described ""economic patriot"" - has criticized the proposed Alstom-GE deal for fear of the impact on French jobs and prestige, and advocated a tie-up with Siemens, which he says would create European champions in power and trainbuilding.""With this reform, France will have a clear and efficient legal framework comparable to that in a number of other open economies within and outside Europe,"" he said in a statement.""This new measure will of course be applied in a selective and proportionate manner, taking into account the merits of each situation,"" he said, adding the decree would take effect within 24 hours of publication.""This is the end of laisser-faire,"" he told Le Monde in an interview published later. Alstom has given itself until the end of the month to review its options. Both it and Siemens declined comment, while GE said it would continue to discuss its plans with the government.""Our project is good for Alstom, for its employees and for France,"" GE said in an emailed statement, aiming to ""build a world leading business in the energy sector with four bases in France, preserving and creating jobs.""However, Berenberg analysts said the decree opened the door for an alternative deal with Siemens. ""With this new law, the risk that GE will reconsider its position increases,"" they said.ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM France already lags peers when it comes to foreigners buying its companies. Only 37 percent of acquisitions of French companies have involved foreign acquirers since 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with 55 percent for Britain and 59 percent Germany over the same period.Among the major European economies, only Italy has fewer foreign takeovers. The United States, with a much larger economy and bigger pool of domestic acquirers, has far fewer foreign takeovers - just 19 pct.Cash-strapped Alstom, which builds France's high-speed trains as well as power turbines and associated equipment, was bailed out by the French government a decade ago and is seen by many in France as an embodiment of its engineering prowess.Alstom shares were down 1.5 percent to 28.88 euros at 1255 GMT, within a CAC-40 down 0.3 percent and a flat European blue-chip index. The French government had given no hint it was considering such a measure, which comes 10 days ahead of European Parliament elections in which President Francois Hollande's Socialists are expected to be punished for their failure to create jobs and growth, and where the National Front - campaigning on a protectionist, anti-EU platform - is set to score big gains.France's flatlining economy was making separate headlines on Thursday, missing expectations for 0.2 percent growth in gross domestic product in the first quarter and in sharp contrast to Germany's robust 0.8 percent growth.The government move also comes amid mounting concerns in other countries about foreign takeovers, with lawmakers in both Britain and Sweden expressing opposition to U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's (PFE.N) attempts to buy rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L).Thursday's move returns the phrase ""economic patriotism"" to the French political lexicon. The expression was a key theme under the conservative premiership of Dominique de Villepin in 2005 after French fears grew that U.S.-based PepsiCo (PEP.N) would mount a hostile bid on dairy giant Danone (DANO.PA).The European Union reacted cautiously to the decree.""We will be looking at case law from the courts of justice ... and, of course, we will be looking at what's in the (European Union) treaties,"" Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the internal market, told reporters in Brussels.The French rule should not be so wide ranging as to subject ""all transactions of purchasing a company ... to a national authorization.

""This new measure will of course be applied in a selective and proportionate manner, taking into account the merits of each situation,"" he said, adding the decree would take effect within 24 hours of publication.""This is the end of laisser-faire,"" he told Le Monde in an interview published later.Alstom has given itself until the end of the month to review its options. Both it and Siemens declined comment, while GE said it would continue to discuss its plans with the government.""Our project is good for Alstom, for its employees and for France,"" GE said in an emailed statement, aiming to ""build a world leading business in the energy sector with four bases in France, preserving and creating jobs.""However, Berenberg analysts said the decree opened the door for an alternative deal with Siemens. ""With this new law, the risk that GE will reconsider its position increases,"" they said. ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM France already lags peers when it comes to foreigners buying its companies.Only 37 percent of acquisitions of French companies have involved foreign acquirers since 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with 55 percent for Britain and 59 percent Germany over the same period. Among the major European economies, only Italy has fewer foreign takeovers. The United States, with a much larger economy and bigger pool of domestic acquirers, has far fewer foreign takeovers - just 19 pct.Cash-strapped Alstom, which builds France's high-speed trains as well as power turbines and associated equipment, was bailed out by the French government a decade ago and is seen by many in France as an embodiment of its engineering prowess.Alstom shares were down 1.5 percent to 28.88 euros at 1255 GMT, within a CAC-40 down 0.3 percent and a flat European blue-chip index.The French government had given no hint it was considering such a measure, which comes 10 days ahead of European Parliament elections in which President Francois Hollande's Socialists are expected to be punished for their failure to create jobs and growth, and where the National Front - campaigning on a protectionist, anti-EU platform - is set to score big gains.France's flatlining economy was making separate headlines on Thursday, missing expectations for 0.2 percent growth in gross domestic product in the first quarter and in sharp contrast to Germany's robust 0.8 percent growth.The government move also comes amid mounting concerns in other countries about foreign takeovers, with lawmakers in both Britain and Sweden expressing opposition to U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's attempts to buy rival AstraZeneca.Thursday's move returns the phrase ""economic patriotism"" to the French political lexicon. The expression was a key theme under the conservative premiership of Dominique de Villepin in 2005 after French fears grew that U.S.-based PepsiCo  would mount a hostile bid on dairy giant Danone.The European Union reacted cautiously to the decree.""We will be looking at case law from the courts of justice ... and, of course, we will be looking at what's in the (European Union) treaties,"" Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the internal market, told reporters in Brussels.The French rule should not be so wide ranging as to subject ""all transactions of purchasing a company ... to a national authorisation.

199,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Days after jurors handed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a win in a $550 million fraud case, it is looking to secure a victory in a long-running insider trading case against a hedge fund manager.Jury selection begins Monday in New York federal court in a civil action brought in 2006 against Nelson Obus, a fund manager at Wynnefield Capital Inc accused of reaping $1.3 million after trading on inside information about the takeover of industrial products supplier SunSource Inc.The SEC, which began investigating Obus in 2001, is also taking to trial Peter Black, an analyst at Wynnefield, and Thomas Strickland, a former employee at General Electric Co's GE Capital who worked on the deal.The case marks the latest test for the securities regulator amid a push by SEC Chair Mary Jo White to strengthen enforcement and take more cases to trial.A federal Manhattan jury on May 12 found Texas businessman Samuel Wyly and the estate of his brother, Charles, liable for fraud in connection with undisclosed stock trading in offshore trusts.The transaction at the center of the Obus case is the 2001 $72 million buyout of SunSource by private equity firm Allied Capital Corp. GE Capital was a lender to SunSource during the deal. The SEC said that after Strickland was assigned to work on the transaction, he called Black, a close friend, on May 24, 2001, and told him about it. Black immediately told Obus, the SEC said.Obus, whose funds were invested with SunSource, then called the company's chief executive, Maurice Andrien, the SEC said. When Andrien called back, Obus told him a ""little birdie"" said SunSource was going to be sold, the agency said.On June 8, the SEC said, Obus directed Wynnefield to buy a large block of SunSource stock, netting $1.34 million when the deal was announced 11 days later. The defendants deny wrongdoing. They say Strickland called Black to ask him what he thought about SunSource after noticing Wynnefield was a shareholder.Obus in a deposition said when Black told him about the call, he thought GE might be involved in a different type of transaction and called Andrien to express his concerns.The defendants have noted that Obus allegedly waited two weeks before trading Sunsource stock. Normally when someone gets a hot stock tip, ""you run out and buy it as fast as you can,"" said Roland Riopelle, Strickland's lawyer. Adding to the case's complexity is the time that has passed since the SEC began its investigation. U.S. District Judge George Daniels dismissed the case in 2010, but it was revived two years later by a federal appeals court.""Mr. Obus has been fighting the SEC for a long time,"" said Joel Cohen, a lawyer for Obus. ""Recollection of long-ago discussions in 2001 will be a central focus of the trial.""The SEC declined to comment. A lawyer for Black did not respond to a request for comment.The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Obus et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 06-03150.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Andrew Hay)",2014-05-15,GE,"Thu May 15, 2014 | 7:13am EDT",Long-running SEC insider trading case heads to trial,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-sec-insidertrading-idUSBREA4E0BR20140515?type=companyNews
200,"  * Says wants alliances, not takeovers* Set to meet General Electric power chief Steve Bolze* Says government doesn't rule out taking a stake in AlstomPARIS, May 16 France is not for sale, Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg declared on Friday, brushing off criticism from the European Union that his stance on foreign company takeovers bordered on protectionism.The government gave itself the power to block takeovers in ""strategic"" sectors on Thursday, throwing up a potential roadblock to U.S conglomerate General Electric's $16.9 billion bid for Alstom's power business.The decree swiftly drew a warning against ""protectionism"" from the EU official in charge of competition, and was called a ""bad idea"" by France's main employers' group.The government has criticised GE's bid, which has the backing of the French engineer's board, favouring an alliance between the companies rather than a straight sale that would leave Alstom with just its smaller transport business.It also wants Alstom to consider an alternative proposal for an energy and transport asset swap with Germany's Siemens  to create two strong ""European champions"". ""We are not for sale. France is not for sale,"" Montebourg said, interviewed on RMC radio. ""We favour alliances, not takeovers... We are not prey, especially in such strategic areas.""""An alliance can be done with General Electric. It's not the case right now, but that can evolve.""Montebourg said he would meet GE executives on Friday and  Alstom union representatives next week to discuss the future of the company, which was bailed out by the French government a decade ago and has strongly relied on state orders for its trains and power turbines. Alstom has given Siemens until the end of the month to decide whether to make a formal rival offer before it enters exclusive talks with GE.Montebourg cited CFM, which makes jet engines and is co-owned by GE and Snecma, a unit of French aerospace group Safran, as an example of how a deal could work, calling it ""a brilliant French-American success"".GE has also been citing the venture's success in an attempt to convince French leaders of its goodwill.""Our strategy is no to dismembering, yes to alliances,"" Montebourg said, adding he had explained this preference to GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt. He also pointed out that he had not stepped in last year when French advertising company Publicis announced a merger of equals with U.S. rival Omnicom. The Publicis-Omnicom deal has since collapsed due to a battle for control.Montebourg said the government would not let domestic companies be ""dismembered, chopped up into pieces and devoured"" and did not rule out taking a stake in Alstom as part of an effort to secure its future.He noted that French state lender BPI had 3,000 stakes in companies and state fund APE had 71 stakes for a portfolio worth 110 billion euros ($150.88 billion).""We are used to having a sovereign fund that intervenes in companies' capital. Not ruling that out is I think a good way of working,"" he said.Steve Bolze, the president of GE's power unit, is among the executives set to meet Montebourg. A spokesman for GE France declined to comment on what Montebourg said and what would be discussed during the meeting.($1 = 0.7291 Euros)   (Reporting by Natalie Huet; Editing by Erica Billingham)",2014-05-16,GE,"Fri May 16, 2014 | 7:52am EDT",French Economy Minister talks tough on foreign takeovers,http://www.reuters.com//article/france-takovers-alstom-idUSL6N0O21UD20140516?type=companyNews
201,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 19 A lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told jurors Monday a New York fund manager had made a ""jackpot"" $1.3 million trading on inside information days before a 2001 merger.At the start of a civil trial in New York federal court against Nelson Obus, SEC lawyer Paul Kisslinger said the Wynnefield Capital Inc fund manager made the illegal profits trading off a tip ahead of the takeover of industrial products supplier SunSource Inc.The tip originated with Thomas Strickland, a former employee at General Electric Co's GE Capital working on the deal, Kisslinger said. Strickland told his friend Peter Black, an analyst at Wynnefield, who then told Obus, he said.""So as you consider this case, remember four things: Tip, tip, trade, jackpot,"" Kisslinger told jurors.But Joel Cohen, a lawyer for Obus, said for his client to be liable, he would have to be the ""most unskilled and lamest insider trader in history.""Cohen asked jurors to question SEC claims that Obus told top executives of SunSource and acquirer Allied Capital Corp about the alleged tip, noting an insider trader normally would keep something like that secret. ""The problem is, confessing is the opposite of concealing,"" Cohen said.The trial of Obus, Black and Strickland marks the latest test for the securities regulator amid a push by SEC Chair Mary Jo White to strengthen enforcement and take more cases to trial.On May 12, a federal jury sided with the SEC, finding Texas businessman Samuel Wyly and the estate of his brother, Charles, liable for fraud in connection with undisclosed stock trading in offshore trusts. Filed in 2006, the lawsuit in the Obus case centers on the 2001 $72 million buyout of SunSource by private equity firm Allied Capital. GE Capital was a lender to SunSource during the deal.Kisslinger told jurors Monday that after Strickland began working on the deal, he called Black, a friend from college, and told him about it.After the May 24, 2001, call, Black told Obus, Kisslinger said. Obus then called SunSource's chief executive, Maurice Andrien, telling him a ""little birdie"" at GE said SunSource was going to be sold. Obus subsequently on June 8 directed Wynnefield to buy a large block of SunSource stock, he said, 11 days before the deal was announced.""He knew what horse would win the race before he placed his bet,"" Kisslinger said.But Cohen said Strickland only called Black to ask him about SunSource's management since Wynnefield was a shareholder.And while Obus called Andrien, it was to tell him his concerns the company would engage in a different type of transaction that would affect shareholders. The idea Obus would tell Andrien he got a tip about the merger ""just makes no sense,"" Cohen said.The trial, which is expected to run two weeks, will continue Tuesday with further opening statements.The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Obus et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 03150.

Under pressure from the French government, however, it has opened its books to Siemens as well.Sources have told Reuters that Siemens is working on a formal offer to swap part of its rail business plus cash in exchange for Alstom's power business, which could come as early as this week.""Siemens is pursuing its work and has written to Alstom this morning asking for more information and a deeper understanding of Alstom, obviously with the aim to most certainly draw up a proposal,"" Montebourg told a parliamentary economic affairs committee on Tuesday.""We understand its determination to be constant, serious and diligent,"" he said.It was not immediately clear what more information the German company had requested. Alstom said it had given Siemens access to the same data as GE.Siemens declined to comment.Montebourg and the French government have criticized GE's bid, saying a sale of Alstom's power arm would weaken the once-bailed out engineering group by reducing it to its smaller transport business. Meanwhile, Paris and Berlin have played up an alliance between Alstom and Siemens as a European alternative that would create two industry champions, one around power with Siemens and one around transport with Alstom.Alstom has shown little interest in a deal with its longtime German rival, but a competing offer would give the French government more leverage with GE after it gave itself the power to block foreign takeovers in ""strategic sectors"".Montebourg said he was still waiting to see improved detailed offers from both groups. ""I cannot prejudge which one will be the best offer,"" he said. ""Nothing is certain; everything has yet to be decided.""WIND ASSETS UP FOR GRABS? To address French concerns over energy independence, Siemens could offer, among other sweeteners, to hand over Alstom's wind and nuclear power assets to French state-controlled energy group Areva (AREVA.PA), two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.Areva CEO Luc Oursel said earlier on Tuesday his group could be interested in Alstom's wind turbines unit. Alstom CEO Patrick Kron, who was auditioned after Montebourg by the same parliamentary committee, confirmed that talks were underway to bring together Alstom's and Areva's wind operations.""Why not, if that helps address some stakeholders' concerns,"" he said, while cautioning against options that would end up ""chopping up into pieces"" Alstom's various businesses.Throughout his audition, Kron continued to back GE's bid, saying it would help strengthen Alstom in the face of a power market depressed by weak demand and low electricity prices.He warned that prolonged uncertainty over a deal could discourage clients from signing new contracts with Alstom and thus risk further weakening the business and staff morale.He also said that if Siemens were to make a formal offer, it would be studied fairly by Alstom's board of directors. The board would consider not only the financial aspect of the bid but also its execution risk and its impact on jobs, he said.

Under pressure from the French government, however, it has opened its books to Siemens as well.Sources have told Reuters that Siemens is working on a formal offer to swap all of its rail business in exchange for Alstom's power business, which could come as early as this week.""Siemens is pursuing its work and has written to Alstom this morning asking for more information and a deeper understanding of Alstom, obviously with the aim to most certainly draw up a proposal,"" Montebourg told a parliamentary economic affairs committee on Tuesday.""We understand its determination to be constant, serious and diligent,"" he said.It was not immediately clear what more information the German company had requested. Alstom said it had given Siemens access to the same data as GE.Siemens declined to comment. Montebourg and the French government have criticized GE's bid, saying a sale of Alstom's power arm would weaken the once-bailed out engineering group by reducing it to its smaller transport business.Meanwhile, Paris and Berlin have played up an alliance between Alstom and Siemens as a European alternative that would create two industry champions, one around power with Siemens and one around transport with Alstom.Alstom has shown little interest in a deal with its longtime German rival, but a competing offer would give the French government more leverage with GE after it gave itself the power to block foreign takeovers in ""strategic sectors"".Montebourg said he was still waiting to see improved detailed offers from both groups. ""I cannot prejudge which one will be the best offer,"" he said. ""Nothing is certain; everything has yet to be decided.""WIND ASSETS UP FOR GRABS? To address French concerns over energy independence, Siemens could offer, among other sweeteners, to hand over Alstom's wind and nuclear power assets to French state-controlled energy group Areva (AREVA.PA), two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. Areva CEO Luc Oursel said earlier on Tuesday his group could be interested in Alstom's wind turbines unit.Alstom CEO Patrick Kron, who was auditioned after Montebourg by the same parliamentary committee, confirmed that talks were underway to bring together Alstom's and Areva's wind operations.""Why not, if that helps address some stakeholders' concerns,"" he said, while cautioning against options that would end up ""chopping up into pieces"" Alstom's various businesses.Throughout his audition, Kron continued to back GE's bid, saying it would help strengthen Alstom in the face of a power market depressed by weak demand and low electricity prices.He warned that prolonged uncertainty over a deal could discourage clients from signing new contracts with Alstom and thus risk further weakening the business and staff morale.He also said that if Siemens were to make a formal offer, it would be studied fairly by Alstom's board of directors. The board would consider not only the financial aspect of the bid but also its execution risk and its impact on jobs, he said.

220,"  PARIS May 22 The French government is studying an all-French solution for Alstom that could involve public funds to strengthen the engineering group if no deal is reached with suitors General Electric or Siemens , Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said on Thursday.Montebourg first floated this ""plan C"" during a meeting with Alstom representatives on Wednesday evening, presenting it as an alternative to the $16.9 billion bid from U.S.-based GE to buy Alstom's power arm, and to a rival expression of interest from Germany's Siemens.""We have launched a study of plan C,"" Montebourg told Reuters on the sidelines of a building visit in Paris.""Plan A is GE, plan B is Siemens, plan C is a home-based solution,"" he said, adding that the government was still working on this third option that would involve French capital, whether from privately-owned companies or state-owned companies.According to two trade unionists who met Montebourg on Wednesday, the minister said the proposals from GE and Siemens were both unacceptable as they stood. He said the government was seeking better offers and was ready to use a decree it issued last week to widen its power to block foreign takeovers in strategic sectors.The minister also told the trade unionists that the government would look at the opportunity of taking a stake in Alstom to strengthen the cash-strapped company, which already received a state bailout a decade ago, and have a bigger say in its future. ""He said he had asked his services to study a plan C in the spirit of the one that was done in 2003,"" said Philippe Pillot, a Force Ouvriere union representative at Alstom Transport.Back in 2003, the French state took a 21 percent stake in Alstom worth 720 million euros ($984 million). An Alstom spokeswoman declined to comment.Alstom is already in talks with GE over a 12.35 billion euro bid for its power arm, which it is due to review by the end of May. However, under strong political pressure, it has opened its books to Siemens so it can propose its own deal if it wants to.The French government has repeatedly criticised GE's bid, favouring an alliance between the companies rather than a straight sale of Alstom's power arm that would leave the French group with just its smaller transport business.Paris has advocated instead a European tie-up between Alstom and Siemens that would create ""industry champions"" in power and transport.

But U.S. conglomerate General Electric has made a 12.35 billion euro ($16.9 billion) bid for Alstom's energy business and says it is willing to sell its wind turbine unit.Earlier this month, the government awarded a 4 billion euro ($5.6 billion) tender for two offshore wind farms to a consortium led by GDF Suez, for which Areva will build 124 8-megawatt turbines - some of the largest in the world - with a combined capacity of 1,000 megawatts.

It has since installed an offshore base of six 5 megawatt turbines at the Alpha Ventus wind farm in the North Sea, operational since 2009, and has contracts to supply 120 turbines in Germany.

226,"   By Natalie Huet and Benjamin Mallet | PARIS  PARIS General Electric (GE.N) and Siemens defended rival proposals to buy the power arm of Alstom (ALSO.PA) on Tuesday, both assuring France that its prized engineering firm would emerge strengthened, including in its remaining transport business.Top executives for both groups told lawmakers their plans were good for Alstom, for France and its jobs, as they strived to address government concerns over the fate of the once bailed-out company and the nation's wider industrial footprint.During a parliamentary hearing, the chairman of Siemens France, Christophe de Maistre, said the German group hoped to submit by June 16 at the latest a formal asset swap offer that would create two European industry champions, one in power around Siemens, the other in rail around Alstom.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, meanwhile, spoke in defence of his group's 12.35 billion euro ($16.9 billion) bid for Alstom's power arm. He said GE would make detailed commitments to increase jobs in France, including by opening new sites, and was also considering a tie-up in rail signalling that would give Alstom control of that business.The French government has said it wanted better offers that would preserve jobs as well as the country's energy independence. Alstom is a supplier of turbines for nuclear plants worldwide, and Paris is concerned that a straight sale of its power arm could hurt France's position in the energy sector.The government is also worried that Alstom, which makes France's iconic TGV high-speed trains and was bailed out a decade ago, would be too weak as a standalone rail group.Tuesday's parliamentary hearing took place after GE agreed to extend its bid timetable by three weeks until June 23 at the government's request, a letter of intent from Siemens offering to pursue a rival proposal, and a French government decree giving itself an effective veto on any deal. CRITICAL MASS Siemens is interested in all of Alstom's power assets, except those France would see as essential to its energy independence, de Maistre told lawmakers. Sources familiar with the Siemens proposal told Reuters that it would ring-fence Alstom's steam turbines used in nuclear plants, as Paris fears that having these fall under U.S. control could jeopardise France's exports in the atomic power industry. Siemens would meanwhile hand Alstom all of its trains business, creating a bigger transport group that would be majority owned by France and would have its headquarters there. In rail signalling, Siemens would offer to take over Alstom's business but set up the headquarters of that unit in France.De Maistre noted that a tie-up between Alstom and Siemens in transport would give the business the critical mass Alstom needed in that sector, putting it on an equal footing with China's CNR and CSR and ahead of Canada's Bombardier (BBDb.TO).For his part, Immelt strived to convince lawmakers that a straight sale of Alstom's power turbines and grid business would not cause the French company to disappear, absorbed by GE, but would make it stronger as a whole and on a global stage. ""Alstom will not disappear. Through our industrial project France will have more influence in the global power business than you do today,"" he said.GE had already said it was talking with French investors about potential ventures in Alstom's offshore wind and hydro power assets and that it was looking to address French concerns over its nuclear-related assets.

227,"  * Siemens to submit rail-power asset swap offer by June 16* GE considering rail signalling tie-up controlled by France* Both groups say will make commitments on French jobs   (Recasts with GE and Siemens making their case for Alstom deal)By Natalie Huet and Benjamin MalletPARIS, May 27 General Electric and Siemens defended rival proposals to buy the power arm of Alstom  on Tuesday, both assuring France that its prized engineering firm would emerge strengthened, including in its remaining transport business.Top executives for both groups told lawmakers their plans were good for Alstom, for France and its jobs, as they strived to address government concerns over the fate of the once bailed-out company and the nation's wider industrial footprint.During a parliamentary hearing, the chairman of Siemens France, Christophe de Maistre, said the German group hoped to submit by June 16 at the latest a formal asset swap offer that would create two European industry champions, one in power around Siemens, the other in rail around Alstom.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, meanwhile, spoke in defence of his group's 12.35 billion euro ($16.9 billion) bid for Alstom's power arm. He said GE would make detailed commitments to increase jobs in France, including by opening new sites, and was also considering a tie-up in rail signalling that would give Alstom control of that business. The French government has said it wanted better offers that would preserve jobs as well as the country's energy independence. Alstom is a supplier of turbines for nuclear plants worldwide, and Paris is concerned that a straight sale of its power arm could hurt France's position in the energy sector.The government is also worried that Alstom, which makes France's iconic TGV high-speed trains and was bailed out a decade ago, would be too weak as a standalone rail group.Tuesday's parliamentary hearing took place after GE agreed to extend its bid timetable by three weeks until June 23 at the government's request, a letter of intent from Siemens offering to pursue a rival proposal, and a French government decree giving itself an effective veto on any deal. CRITICAL MASS Siemens is interested in all of Alstom's power assets, except those France would see as essential to its energy independence, de Maistre told lawmakers.Sources familiar with the Siemens proposal told Reuters that it would ring-fence Alstom's steam turbines used in nuclear plants, as Paris fears that having these fall under U.S. control could jeopardise France's exports in the atomic power industry.Siemens would meanwhile hand Alstom all of its trains business, creating a bigger transport group that would be majority owned by France and would have its headquarters there. In rail signalling, Siemens would offer to take over Alstom's business but set up the headquarters of that unit in France. De Maistre noted that a tie-up between Alstom and Siemens in transport would give the business the critical mass Alstom needed in that sector, putting it on an equal footing with China's CNR and CSR and ahead of Canada's Bombardier.For his part, Immelt strived to convince lawmakers that a straight sale of Alstom's power turbines and grid business would not cause the French company to disappear, absorbed by GE, but would make it stronger as a whole and on a global stage.""Alstom will not disappear. Through our industrial project France will have more influence in the global power business than you do today,"" he said.GE had already said it was talking with French investors about potential ventures in Alstom's offshore wind and hydro power assets and that it was looking to address French concerns over its nuclear-related assets. The talks are ongoing, ""open and constructive"", Immelt said.In transport, he said GE was now in talks with the government and Alstom over a deal combining both group's signalling assets and handing Alstom control of the business.""Alstom Transport would have the size, technology and financial strength to measure up to rivals such as Bombardier, Ansaldo and Siemens,"" Immelt said.($1 = 0.7325 Euros)   (Editing by David Evans)",2014-05-27,GE,"Tue May 27, 2014 | 3:45pm EDT","UPDATE 1-GE, Siemens defend rival plans for France's Alstom",http://www.reuters.com//article/alstom-offer-idUSL6N0OD5DA20140527?type=companyNews

230,"  * Jeff Immelt grilling due to start at 1630 GMT* Siemens France boss to be questioned beforehand* GE has extended its bid, Siemens seen readying rival offerBy Andrew CallusPARIS, May 27 General Electric boss Jeff Immelt faces a public French parliamentary grilling in person on Tuesday over his high-stakes plan to buy the power arm of engineering group Alstom, replacing a subordinate at the last minute.A statement from the parliamentary economics committee late on Monday put Immelt on its agenda for Tuesday's hearing, which was scheduled originally last week with the head of GE France, Clara Gaymard, on the stand.Immelt is scheduled to speak in defence of his 12.35 billion euro ($16.9 billion) bid for Alstom's power arm at 1630 GMT, an hour after Christophe de Maistre, chairman of Siemens France , is due to begin facing questions.Maistre, representing the European alternative to the GE offer, will make the case for a tie-up with the German engineering firm. Sources have told Reuters that Siemens was readying a formal offer under which it would transfer its rail activities and less than 7 billion euros in cash to its French rival in exchange for its power assets. GE's Immelt was due in Paris anyway this week for a meeting on Wednesday with President Francois Hollande and Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg.""The committee asked the country chiefs to attend, but Jeff is our CEO and he is running things,"" said a GE spokesman. ""He is in Paris anyway, so we decided he should attend. It's normal that he should come and defend the project.""The hearing takes place after GE agreed to extend its bid timetable by three weeks until June 23 following objections to the deal from the French government, a letter of intent from Siemens offering to pursue a rival proposal, and a French government decree giving itself an effective veto on any deal. CRITICAL MASS GE sees a chance to push on with a new focus on its engineering and industrial roots, expand its installed base of power turbines, and increase exposure to emerging markets.Siemens wants to head off the creation of an even more powerful rival and grab a chance to turn Alstom from a competitor into a part of its own power division. Alstom, meanwhile, has heavy debts and is short of cash. It was already rescued by the government a decade ago, amid protests at the time by Siemens.Analysts see the French group as lacking the critical mass to stand alone in either of its main markets, power turbines and rail equipment. Its top shareholder, the conglomerate Bouygues  with 29 percent, would welcome the cash from a GE deal as it faces a costly price war in its telecoms business.For the French government, represented frequently and vocally by Montebourg, the concerns are strategic, and reach deep into the nation's energy supply and power industry interests, especially in the field of nuclear power.With 18,000 workers in France out of a total 96,000, Alstom is an important manufacturing employer in a country suffering record unemployment, as well as a strong symbol of French engineering prowess, making the iconic TGV high speed trains.Alstom is also a main supplier of power turbines to the utility EDF, in which the government has an 84 percent stake and which has a near-monopoly on electricity supply in France and is a major power producer in Britain and Italy. Another key supplier is GE itself.EDF uses nuclear reactors to supply more than 70 percent of the domestic electricity consumption and is involved in construction of new nuclear plants in China and Britain. EDF, in turn, is the main customer of another state-controlled business, nuclear group Areva.($1 = 0.7325 Euros)   (Editing by Natalie Huet and Susan Thomas)",2014-05-27,GE,"Tue May 27, 2014 | 9:16am EDT",GE boss faces public Alstom grilling in Paris,http://www.reuters.com//article/alstom-offer-idUSL6N0OD32720140527?type=companyNews

239,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. employment returned to its pre-recession peak in May with a solid pace of hiring that offered confirmation the economy has snapped back from a winter slump.Nonfarm payrolls increased 217,000 last month, the Labor Department said on Friday, in line with market expectations. Data for March and April was revised to show 6,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported.""This was a very solid report with no obvious warts to detract from the underlying message of sustained improvement in economic activity,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.May marked a fourth straight month of job gains above 200,000, a stretch last witnessed in January 2000, even though it also was a slowdown from the 282,000 jobs created in April, when hiring was still bouncing back from a winter lull.The nation finally recouped the 8.7 million jobs lost during the recession, with 8.8 million more people working now than at the trough in February 2010. But the working age population has since increased 10.6 million while 12.8 million Americans have dropped out of the labor force.The upbeat jobs report hoisted U.S. stocks to record highs. U.S. Treasury debt prices slipped, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.ECONOMY GAINING TRACTION The pace of hiring adds to data from automobile sales to services and factory sector activity that have suggested the economy will grow at a pace of more than 3.0 percent this quarter after shrinking at a 1.0 percent rate in the first three months of the year. Other data on Friday showed consumer credit in April recorded its largest advance since November 2001, a sign households were feeling more secure in taking on debt.Last month, the unemployment rate held steady at a 5-1/2 year low of 6.3 percent as some Americans who had given up the search for work resumed the hunt.A measure of underemployment fell to its lowest level since October 2008. The gauge, which includes people who want a job but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time jobs, fell to 12.2 percent.Economists expect more previously discouraged workers to re-enter the labor force over the course of the year. While that would be a sign of confidence in the labor market, it could slow the decline in the jobless rate.The long-term unemployed accounted for 34.6 percent of the 9.8 million jobless Americans, down from 35.3 percent in April. The median duration of unemployment fell to 14.6 weeks, the shortest stretch in five years and a sharp drop from April. ""We are making progress, but we still have a very long way to go,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.The return of discouraged job seekers and drop in long-term unemployment will be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has cited low labor force participation as one of the reasons for maintaining an extraordinarily easy monetary policy.The workforce, which had declined sharply in April, increased by 192,000 people last month. That left the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, at 62.8 percent.Average hourly earnings, which are being closely watched for signs of wage pressures that could signal dwindling slack in the labor market, rose five cents, or 0.2 percent. On a year-over-year basis, earnings were up a tepid 2.1 percent, suggesting little build-up in wage inflation.But earnings in some sectors, such as mining and information services, are rising at a much faster clip. ""It's a difficult time for Fed policymakers,"" said Peter Molloy, president at Edison Investment Research in New York. He said the central bank normally would be raising interest rates by now given the level of the jobless rate but wanted to go slowly because the recovery has been weak by historic norms.The Fed has kept benchmark overnight rates pegged near zero since late 2008 and is not expected to begin nudging them up until well into next year.Employment gains in May were broad-based.Manufacturing payrolls increased by 10,000, expanding for the 10th straight month. Further increases are expected as auto sales outpace inventories.Construction payrolls rose by 6,000. It was the fifth consecutive month of gains, but the pace is slowing as the housing sector struggles to regain momentum.There were sturdy job gains in leisure and hospitality, and professional and businesses services. Healthcare added 33,600 workers, likely boosted by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Government payrolls increased 1,000, a fourth straight monthly increase. Retail employment also rose.The length of the workweek held steady at 34.5 hours, with a measure of total work effort rising by 0.2 percent.

240,"  * Siemens and MHI in talks over joint bid to counter GE* French government says does not favour one offer over another* Siemens-MHI plan would play alliance card - sources* Two French papers say Mitsubishi mulling stake in Alstom   (Adds French papers on Mitsubishi offer)By Benjamin Mallet and Natalie HuetPARIS, June 12 Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are trying to beat a bid by U.S. conglomerate General Electric for Alstom with an offer that would focus on alliances with the French engineering group, sources said on Thursday.The German and Japanese groups said on Wednesday they were discussing a joint offer for Alstom's energy assets that would compete with GE's $17 billion proposal and would be worth around $9.8 billion, according to the Nikkei newspaper.The Siemens-Mitsubishi plan would not be a direct buyout of Alstom's power assets but would rather set up one or several joint holdings in power, according to two sources familiar with the plan.They added that Siemens was still ready to give Alstom its train business as part of the deal, although the French group has so far not shown much interest in such an asset swap.Such a plan could, however, address calls from the government to favour partnerships over a straight sale of Alstom's power arm - 70 percent of group revenue. They fear the company would be left vulnerable once it was reduced to its smaller transport business.Two French newspapers said on Thursday that Mitsubishi is considering taking a direct stake in French engineering group Alstom as part of an offer with Siemens.Financial daily Les Echos said Mitsubishi is considering buying part of French Bouygues's 29 percent stake in Alstom and would also buy Alstom's steam turbines while Siemens would take over its gas turbines. At a later stage, after an expected offer for Alstom on June 16, Siemens would contribute its transport assets to Alstom, which would remain a listed company with activities in power grids, wind turbines and transports, Les Echos wrote.Le Figaro said Mitsubishi would propose an alliance with Alstom modelled on the Renault-Nissan alliance. That would involve Mitsubishi taking a minority stake in Alstom's power activities (excluding grids) or even buying part of Bouygues's stake.The paper also said Siemens would propose buying Alstom's gas turbines unit and give Alstom its rail transport business.Alstom is the maker of France's iconic TGV high-speed trains and supplies power equipment used in 40 percent of the world's nuclear plants.It employs some 18,000 people in France, around a fifth of its global workforce. It was rescued by the state from near bankruptcy a decade ago and has since depended on public orders for rail and power equipment. GOVERNMENT GOALS France has tried hard in recent weeks to drum up better offers for Alstom, saying it wanted to preserve the country's jobs and industrial know-how and even giving itself powers to veto a deal.French President Francois Hollande, Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg and David Azema, the head of French state holding company APE, met on Thursday to discuss the bids but made no statement.Another meeting is scheduled next week, an official at the president's office said, stressing that the government did not favour one offer over the other at this stage.""Our demands have never changed. What are our goals? To defend the country's energy independence, to maintain business and decision-making in France and to obtain the most favourable situation on the jobs front,"" the official said. ""It's against these criteria that we will continue to examine the proposals on the table. As far as our method goes, we don't have a preference for this or that proposal; we have demands.""Montebourg has been vocal on the Alstom case and has repeatedly warned against ""tearing apart"" the group, which he sees as a symbol of France's engineering prowess. He has openly favoured alliances and partnerships over divestment.BREAKUP OR ALLIANCE? News of Mitsubishi's partnership with Siemens emerged on Wednesday, and Hitachi, a joint-venture partner with Mitsubishi, said earlier on Thursday it also hoped to take part. The Nikkei report said the two Japanese companies would set up a joint venture to bid for Alstom's steam turbine operations, said to be valued at 500 billion yen ($4.90 billion).""The closer we get to the deadlines, the more we hear of other groups being involved,"" said Didier Lesou, an Alstom union representative from CFE-CGC. ""If the Japanese are in too, that would imply a breakup of Alstom's energy business. It's scary.""But two sources familiar with the matter, including one close to Siemens, said that was not the spirit of a Siemens-Mitsubishi plan, which would help allay antitrust concerns and would play the card of an alliance as advocated by Montebourg.""MHI's plan with Siemens is to leave as much as possible in the hands of Alstom, to maintain a strong Alstom presence in power and to build a partnership involving one or several joint ventures, notably in turbines,"" said the other source, which is close to the French government.Alstom declined to comment. Siemens, which also declined to comment, has said it plans to disclose a bid by Monday. Its supervisory board will meet on Sunday evening, according to a source close to the group.GE agreed last month to extend its offer until June 23, at the government's request.

247,"   By Jens Hack and Natalie Huet | MUNICH/PARIS  MUNICH/PARIS Germany's Siemens and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries presented a joint offer to France's Alstom on Monday that included 7 billion euros ($9.5 billion) in cash, challenging a bid by General Electric.Under the deal, Siemens offered to buy Alstom's gas turbines business for 3.9 billion euros in cash, and MHI to buy stakes in Alstom power assets including hydroelectric power equipment and grid, to be held in separate joint ventures.MHI would inject 3.1 billion euros in cash into Alstom and offer to take a stake of up to 10 percent in the French firm from shareholder Bouygues BOUY.PA.""Alstom would remain an independent energy and transport player with a strong brand,"" Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said. ""Its energy business would be strengthened through the partner MHI and we intend to explore opportunities with Alstom to create a European rail champion for the world market.""Alstom said it would review the proposal in the coming days.Sources familiar with the matter said the offer would be worth over 1 billion euros more than GE's, taking into account the value of the parts of the power businesses that would remain under Alstom's control.Mitsubishi would like to buy the Alstom stake alongside the French government but would not walk away from the deal if Bouygues was unwilling to sell, the sources said, adding that Bouygues would be contacted very soon.GE GE.N said it had made progress in its discussions with the French government on its offer for Alstom's energy business, which included ""proposing alliances in energy and transport"". A spokeswoman said GE would not however be drawn into a bidding war.The race to acquire power activities from the French train and turbine maker has entered a crucial week, ahead of a June 23 deadline set by GE for its 12.4 billion euro bid for all of Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses.The French government has criticized GE's proposal and gave itself powers to veto a deal on the grounds it does not want Alstom, an innovator and big employer, to sell the bulk of its business to a foreign firm without the state having a say.

""Its energy business would be strengthened through the partner MHI and we intend to explore opportunities with Alstom to create a European rail champion for the world market.""Alstom said it would review the proposal in the coming days.Sources familiar with the matter said the offer would be worth over 1 billion euros more than GE's, taking into account the value of the parts of the power businesses that would remain under Alstom's control.Mitsubishi would like to buy the Alstom stake alongside the French government but would not walk away from the deal if Bouygues was unwilling to sell, the sources said, adding that Bouygues would be contacted very soon. GE said it had made progress in its discussions with the French government on its offer for Alstom's energy business, which included ""proposing alliances in energy and transport"". A spokeswoman said GE would not however be drawn into a bidding war.The race to acquire power activities from the French train and turbine maker has entered a crucial week, ahead of a June 23 deadline set by GE for its 12.4 billion euro bid for all of Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses.The French government has criticized GE's proposal and gave itself powers to veto a deal on the grounds it does not want Alstom, an innovator and big employer, to sell the bulk of its business to a foreign firm without the state having a say.The government has also tried to negotiate better offers and alliances to preserve Alstom as a player in both transport and energy, seeing both as vital national industries at a time when unemployment is stuck above 10 percent and voters are increasingly turning towards the far-right.French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said Alstom and the government would examine both offers once they are on the table and base their decision on that.Alstom, best known overseas for making TGV high-speed trains, employs 18,000 people in France, around a fifth of its workforce.

251,"   By Geert De Clercq | PARIS  PARIS In a world where power generation capacity growth is driven by solar and wind, the bidding war for France's Alstom SA shows big players believe turbines connected to coal, gas and nuclear plants will be spinning for decades to come. With the growth of coal plants limited by emission concerns, the nuclear industry in a funk following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and dozens of gas plants around Europe mothballed as power demand stagnates, suppliers of the outsized turbines that generate power in traditional thermal power stations have suffered along with their clients, the utilities. Even so, Siemens AG and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd on Monday presented a bid to rival that from General Electric Co (GE), showing they take a long-term view on its prospects regardless of recent woes.""The battle for Alstom is about where utilities are going to be spending money five years from now, not where they will be spending in Q3 or Q4,"" said a London-based sector analyst who declined to be identified. With 43 percent of Alstom's sales made in Europe and 8 percent in the United States, a bet on Alstom is not just a bet on emerging markets, but on a recovery of European demand, analysts say. In a study last month, Deutsche Bank estimated European utilities will have capital spending of 60 billion euros ($81.7 billion) this year, with a significant share of this going to new electrical equipment - both generation and grids - and on maintaining existing machinery.While demand for new power plants is low, Alstom's huge installed base - it claims more than 20 percent of the world's installed steam turbine capacity, or 580 gigawatt - brings lucrative service contracts that made up more than half of the 9 billion euros worth of orders of Alstom's thermal power division in the financial year through March 2014. Steam turbines - a technology more than a century old and which led to the development of the jet engine - use steam generated by thermal plants to drive an electricity generator. The global steam turbine business is highly fragmented - Alstom and Siemens each have a market share of just 4 percent in terms of annual sales, and GE 3 percent, SocGen estimates show.  The bigger players in steam are India's Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) with 18 percent, Japan's Toshiba Corp with 10 percent and China's Harbin Electric with 7 percent. TECH LEADER  A GE-Alstom or Siemens-Alstom tie-up would only become the fourth-biggest player by sales, but would be a technology leader. Alstom builds the world's largest steam turbine generators, with output of more than 1.1 gigawatts (the equivalent of one medium-sized nuclear plant) and claims to have supplied the world's seven largest fossil fuel plants.  More than 30 percent of the world's nuclear power plants use Alstom steam turbine generator sets and the world's four largest operating nuclear units use Alstom's ""Arabelle"" turbines, which have capacity up to 1,900 megawatts. Alstom's smallest steam turbines have capacities of between 5 and 60 MW and are often used in biomass plants.In gas turbines - which operate like a jet engine by burning gas - Alstom is a small player, with a global market share of just 4 percent, compared with GE's 39 percent, 28 percent for Siemens and 16 percent for Mitsubishi Heavy, SocGen estimates.The implication is that there are likely to be few regulatory obstacles to a combination. So are there any potential hurdles?Sources familiar with Alstom's organization say it could be tricky to separate the firm's steam turbines from the gas turbines business, as proposed by Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy. While the steam turbines are made mainly in Belfort, eastern France, and the gas turbines made mostly in Switzerland and Germany, there are about 15,000 Alstom service workers worldwide paid to carry out maintenance on both kinds of turbines.Another possible negative is the impact on the utilities who are Alstom's customers, such as EDF and GDF, and who have also been victims of the industry trends which help propel Alstom shares to a 14-year low earlier this year. Yet Deutsche Bank's Martin Brough - who co-authored a study about whether utilities should care about what happens to Alstom - said utilities have relatively little to fear about the outcome of the bidding war on equipment supply costs, given the broader trends already outlined.Ultimately it is long-term developments in the energy sector which are most significant for the utilities, just as they are for the likes of Alstom and its future owners.

254,"  MUNICH, June 16 German engineering group Siemens  and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are expected to present their joint move on France's Alstom in Paris on Monday, challenging a formal offer from General Electric.According to sources close to the bidders, the German firm would acquire Alstom's gas turbines business under the deal, while the Japanese group would inject cash and industrial assets into a joint venture in steam turbines.The Siemens-Mitsubishi plan would not be a direct buyout of Alstom's power assets but would rather set up one or several joint holdings in power, sources have said. Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser is to present the joint offer with Mitsubishi to Alstom's management on Monday afternoon and outline details of the plan at France's parliament on Tuesday, several people familiar with the matter said.The offer comes ahead of a June 23 deadline set by GE for its 12.4 billion euro ($16.9 billion) bid for all of Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses. The rival approaches have prompted the French government to press for jobs guarantees as it sees the group's transport and energy activities, notably in nuclear power, as strategic at a time when the country's unemployment rate is stuck at above 10 percent. In a second step, separate to a turbines deal, Siemens is also to propose combining its rail activities with Alstom's, known for the high-speed TGV trains, sources have said. The French government has actively lobbied for this, saying it would create a European rail champion.($1 = 0.7345 Euros)   (Reporting by Jens Hack, writing by Maria Sheahan, editing by Louise Heavens)",2014-06-16,GE,"Mon Jun 16, 2014 | 3:09am EDT","Siemens, Mitsubishi to present Alstom offer on Monday - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/alstom-siemens-offer-idUSL5N0OX1EY20140616?type=companyNews

257,"   By Natalie Huet and Elizabeth Pineau | PARIS  PARIS The French government raised the stakes in the battle for engineering group Alstom on Tuesday, telling rival suitors General Electric and Siemens to come up with better offers.President Francois Hollande's government has given itself the power to veto a deal on the grounds it does not want Alstom (ALSO.PA), an innovator and big employer, to sell the bulk of its business to a foreign firm without the state having a say.In a crunch week ahead of Monday's deadline on GE's (GE.N) American bid, Germany's Siemens SIEG.DE presented Hollande with a joint proposal with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) that it said valued Alstom's power arm at 14.2 billion euros ($19.3 billion) - above GE's 12.4 billion offer.But Hollande's government swiftly responded by saying it expected better efforts from both bidders.""The talks between the state and the different companies are going to continue this week,"" a source in Hollande's office said after the meeting with chief executives Joe Kaeser of Siemens and Shunichi Miyanaga of MHI to hear their proposal.""The offers must be improved,"" the source said.However, Kaeser said he saw no reason to discuss improving a proposal which he reckoned was already the better of the two on the table for Alstom in terms of asset valuation, strategic future and jobs.""Why would a superior offer be improved if it is superior already? There is no reason for us to discuss that question at this time,"" he told a joint news conference with Miyanaga.A source close to GE said it was still discussing parts of the deal with the French state - notably on Alstom's rail, nuclear and renewable energy assets - but added: ""GE will not enter a cash bidding war and will not change the June 23 cut-off date.""Under the Siemens-MHI offer, Siemens would buy Alstom's gas turbines business for 3.9 billion euros in cash while MHI would buy minority stakes in various Alstom power activities, to be held in three separate joint ventures, for 3.1 billion in cash. MHI is also offering to take a stake of up to 10 percent in Alstom from 29-percent shareholder Bouygues (BOUY.PA).  FRENCH STAKE     Kaeser and Miyanaga told reporters and lawmakers that their plan gave Alstom a future in both power and transport and aimed to make a ""proud French icon"" even stronger. Alstom makes France's distinctive TGV high-speed trains and supplies power equipment used in around 40 percent of nuclear plants worldwide.Miyanaga also told French members of parliament he wanted France to take a matching 10-percent public stake in Alstom to demonstrate that the group would remain French. The government is willing to do so via state bank BPI, said an Alstom trade unionist who met Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg on Tuesday.   Finance Minister Michel Sapin told Reuters he was not aware of such a plan. Bouygues said it had been contacted by MHI to take a stake alongside BPI, but that it had been approached neither by BPI nor the state. BPI declined comment. Montebourg's office did not respond to requests for comment.    Montebourg told trade unionists last week that the state and MHI were looking to take equal stakes in Alstom and a source familiar with the situation said BPI was ""ready to be involved in any scenario"", whether with Mitsubishi or GE.Some labour representatives welcomed the Siemens-MHI plan, saying that, compared to the GE proposal, it would better preserve Alstom as a whole and came with a commitment to create 1,000 French jobs within three years and 1,000 apprenticeships. In a statement, the CFE-CGC union said GE would now have to offer a more balanced deal with Alstom that would not dismantle the French group.CHARM OFFENSIVE GE has meanwhile ramped up its charm offensive in the French media with ads saying an alliance with Alstom would create a global energy leader. It is offering to buy all of Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses and accounts for 70 percent of its revenue.Alstom said it would examine the Siemens-MHI proposal in the coming days. A source close to the company said the Alstom board would make a decision by Monday, June 23, at the latest. The source further noted the GE proposal had the status of a binding offer, unlike the Siemens-MHI proposal. Hollande's Socialist government has sought to negotiate better offers to preserve Alstom as a player in transport and energy, seeing both as vital national industries when unemployment is stuck above 10 percent and voters are increasingly turning towards the far-right.Last month, it assumed new powers to block foreign takeovers in sectors deemed strategic. The government's call for better offers comes as it battles with U.S. authorities to reduce penalties on France's biggest bank, BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), for breaching U.S. sanctions on Iran and other states. However, French officials have not drawn a link between the two issues, in public at least.Alstom shares closed down 1.24 percent, weighed down by the government intervention and uncertainty over a deal. Investors had initially welcomed GE's offer as a quick fix for Alstom's lack of critical mass in the international power market.On Tuesday, some analysts said the Siemens-MHI offer could be more attractive for Alstom in valuation terms and noted it would leave the company controlling most of its existing power arm. Yet others argued the offer would result in a more complex outcome that gave priority to political concerns.""GE's offer has the merit of being clear and coherent, something the Alstom board should appreciate,"" Aurel BGC strategist Tangi Le Liboux wrote in a note to clients.

264,"   By Natalie Huet and Benjamin Mallet | PARIS  PARIS General Electric's (GE.N) chief executive will on Thursday unveil to the French government and unions an improved offer for the energy arm of Alstom, a source close to the U.S. conglomerate said of its efforts to fend off a rival proposal.Alstom's board is due to announce by Monday its choice between GE's 12.4-billion-euro ($16.8 billion) cash offer and a competing proposal by Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (7011.T).The fight for the power business of the 86-year-old French company has turned into one of Europe's fiercest industrial tug-of-wars for years, drawing in a French Socialist government which has given itself powers to veto any deal in the name of protecting local jobs and influence over a key sector.    ""GE is seeing the government and the Alstom unions tomorrow,"" the source close to GE said on Wednesday. ""The offer will, of course, be improved."" A separate source close to the matter confirmed the meeting and added that Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg was set to meet GE management around midday on Thursday, before meeting with Alstom unions in the afternoon.Almost immediately after Siemens and MHI presented their rival plan on Tuesday, President Francois Hollande's government told both sides to come up with better offers.Siemens says its proposal with MHI values Alstom's power arm at 14.2 billion euros - nearly two billion euros more than GE's.But the two offers are very different in nature. Whereas the former involves Siemens buying just the gas turbines arm of Alstom and MHI taking minority stakes in its other power activities, the GE offer is for all Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses and accounts for 70 percent of its revenue.An ad hoc committee of independent board directors, led by former chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) Jean-Martin Folz, is due to give a recommendation on the merits of the two proposals to the Alstom board, likely on Friday, according to a source close to Alstom. ALLIANCES  Both GE and Siemens-MHI have stressed their commitments to keeping and creating jobs in France to win political favour.GE has said a deal with Alstom would create 1,000 French jobs within three years but the government is eager for it to formalise the pledge on paper. GE is also expected to address concerns over French access to strategic assets such as power equipment used in nuclear plants, wind and hydro turbines, as well as the fate of Alstom's remaining rail arm.GE has been discussing those parts of the deal with the government over the past weeks. GE's Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told French lawmakers last month his group would set up global headquarters for the grid, hydro, offshore wind and steam turbines businesses in France. Immelt also said GE was considering a tie-up in rail signalling that would give Alstom control of that business. [ID:nL6N0OD5DA]The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that GE was now considering selling the unit to Alstom.  Montebourg has said he would not let Alstom be ""devoured"" and is worried that the group, an innovator and big private employer in the country, would be weakened if reduced to its rail arm, which accounts for a quarter of group revenue. A source familiar with the matter said the government was looking for GE to offer more balanced ""alliances"". ""Alliances can take various forms... It can be capital alliances, industrial tie-ups, it can be joint-ventures, shareholdings,"" the source said.The same source said the government would make its view known at least to Alstom before its decisive board meeting.BOUYGUES QUESTION MARK  After a meeting with Montebourg on Tuesday, some Alstom unions welcomed the Siemens-MHI plan, saying that it would better preserve Alstom.But several sources close to Alstom told Reuters they were concerned about the relative complexity of the Siemens-MHI plan and that, unlike the GE offer, they did not consider it as having binding status.Those sources familiar with Alstom's thinking are sceptical that the Siemens-MHI plan can address Alstom's core problems: its lack of critical mass in a tough power market and the need to inject cash into its more promising transport arm.An all-cash purchase by GE of the power arm could return an exceptional dividend to Alstom shareholders and allow the company to refocus on its transport arm known for making France's iconic TGV bullet trains.Ratings agency Moody's said in a note that the Siemens/MHI offer had the potential to strengthen Alstom financially and bring its debt down.""It would however also leave Alstom in control of structurally declining (coal power generation) or competitive and oversupplied (power grid) businesses, whose further development could prove challenging,"" Moody's said.Further question marks remain over the intentions of 29-percent shareholder Bouygues. The group has publicly stated it would support any decision made by Alstom's board and wanted to keep its shareholding at 29 percent in the long term.However one source familiar with the conglomerate's thinking said it wanted a significant stake in a group which it believes has a future - with a stake of over 20 percent that enables it to consolidate related earnings - but would not want a diluted stake in a business it sees as wobbly.      A spokesman for Bouygues said on Wednesday morning that MHI had offered to take a stake of up to 10 percent in Alstom by buying up some of its stake along with French public investment bank BPI.

265,"  * GE's Immelt to meet France's Montebourg Thursday -sources* Alstom board decision expected by Monday* Govt eager for GE to formalise pledge on jobs -source* Other key points include rail, nuclear, renewables   (Adds detail on Montebourg-Immelt meeting Thursday, sticking points of the talks)By Natalie Huet and Benjamin MalletPARIS, June 18 General Electric's chief executive will on Thursday unveil to the French government and unions an improved offer for the energy arm of Alstom, a source close to the U.S. conglomerate said of its efforts to fend off a rival proposal.Alstom's board is due to announce by Monday its choice between GE's 12.4-billion-euro ($16.8 billion) cash offer and a competing proposal by Germany's Siemens and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI).The fight for the power business of the 86-year-old French company has turned into one of Europe's fiercest industrial tug-of-wars for years, drawing in a French Socialist government which has given itself powers to veto any deal in the name of protecting local jobs and influence over a key sector.""GE is seeing the government and the Alstom unions tomorrow,"" the source close to GE said on Wednesday. ""The offer will, of course, be improved.""A separate source close to the matter confirmed the meeting and added that Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg was set to meet GE management around midday on Thursday, before meeting with Alstom unions in the afternoon.Almost immediately after Siemens and MHI presented their rival plan on Tuesday, President Francois Hollande's government told both sides to come up with better offers.Siemens says its proposal with MHI values Alstom's power arm at 14.2 billion euros - nearly two billion euros more than GE's.But the two offers are very different in nature. Whereas the former involves Siemens buying just the gas turbines arm of Alstom and MHI taking minority stakes in its other power activities, the GE offer is for all Alstom's energy arm, which includes its thermal power, renewable power and grid businesses and accounts for 70 percent of its revenue. An ad hoc committee of independent board directors, led by former chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen Jean-Martin Folz, is due to give a recommendation on the merits of the two proposals to the Alstom board, likely on Friday, according to a source close to Alstom.ALLIANCES Both GE and Siemens-MHI have stressed their commitments to keeping and creating jobs in France to win political favour.GE has said a deal with Alstom would create 1,000 French jobs within three years but the government is eager for it to formalise the pledge on paper. GE is also expected to address concerns over French access to strategic assets such as power equipment used in nuclear plants, wind and hydro turbines, as well as the fate of Alstom's remaining rail arm.GE has been discussing those parts of the deal with the government over the past weeks. GE's Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told French lawmakers last month his group would set up global headquarters for the grid, hydro, offshore wind and steam turbines businesses in France. Immelt also said GE was considering a tie-up in rail signalling that would give Alstom control of that business.The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that GE was now considering selling the unit to Alstom.Montebourg has said he would not let Alstom be ""devoured"" and is worried that the group, an innovator and big private employer in the country, would be weakened if reduced to its rail arm, which accounts for a quarter of group revenue.A source familiar with the matter said the government was looking for GE to offer more balanced ""alliances"".""Alliances can take various forms... It can be capital alliances, industrial tie-ups, it can be joint-ventures, shareholdings,"" the source said.The same source said the government would make its view known at least to Alstom before its decisive board meeting. BOUYGUES QUESTION MARK After a meeting with Montebourg on Tuesday, some Alstom unions welcomed the Siemens-MHI plan, saying that it would better preserve Alstom.But several sources close to Alstom told Reuters they were concerned about the relative complexity of the Siemens-MHI plan and that, unlike the GE offer, they did not consider it as having binding status.Those sources familiar with Alstom's thinking are sceptical that the Siemens-MHI plan can address Alstom's core problems: its lack of critical mass in a tough power market and the need to inject cash into its more promising transport arm.An all-cash purchase by GE of the power arm could return an exceptional dividend to Alstom shareholders and allow the company to refocus on its transport arm known for making France's iconic TGV bullet trains.Ratings agency Moody's said in a note that the Siemens/MHI offer had the potential to strengthen Alstom financially and bring its debt down.""It would however also leave Alstom in control of structurally declining (coal power generation) or competitive and oversupplied (power grid) businesses, whose further development could prove challenging,"" Moody's said.Further question marks remain over the intentions of 29-percent shareholder Bouygues. The group has publicly stated it would support any decision made by Alstom's board and wanted to keep its shareholding at 29 percent in the long term.However one source familiar with the conglomerate's thinking said it wanted a significant stake in a group which it believes has a future - with a stake of over 20 percent that enables it to consolidate related earnings - but would not want a diluted stake in a business it sees as wobbly.A spokesman for Bouygues said on Wednesday morning that MHI had offered to take a stake of up to 10 percent in Alstom by buying up some of its stake along with French public investment bank BPI. However he said Bouygues had not been approached by the state or BPI at this stage.

A Mitsubishi spokesman said no decision had been taken and a Siemens spokesman declined comment.President Francois Hollande summoned key ministers including Montebourg on Thursday evening to examine the rival offers.""They will all reach a common position tonight,"" Francis Orosco, head of the CFTC energy sector trade union, told Reuters, adding: ""Montebourg has no preference.""GE said the new offer had been agreed with Alstom management and that it would create an ""alliance"", a term that France's Socialist government has said all along it favours to describe any tie-up involving the engineering group.While the new offer would create 50:50 joint ventures in grid, nuclear and renewable assets, GE would still end up with all of the lucrative gas turbines arm, which accounts for roughly a third of Alstom's revenue from power.The U.S. conglomerate's move to revise what was a straight purchase offer to include joint ventures across individual industrial sectors came after France's government said it would veto any deal that did not protect local jobs and interests.GE said its overall valuation for Alstom power assets at 12.4 billion euros ($16.9 billion) remained unchanged, while the cash component would drop to reflect the fact it was buying fewer assets outright. It stressed that the deal, if approved, would immediately boost the U.S. company's earnings per share. ""We have reached agreements with Alstom's management that will create an alliance between our companies in both spirit and practice,"" GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in a statement.""It creates jobs, establishes headquarters decision-making in France and ensures that the Alstom name will endure,"" said Immelt, who earlier met French government and union officials.The Siemens-MHI proposal would take just the gas turbines arm of Alstom and give MHI minority stakes in its other power activities. De Maistre said the Siemens-MHI proposal valued Alstom's energy business at around 14.2 billion euros, some 1.8 billion euros more than the GE plan.Bernard Devert, head of the metallurgy arm of the CGT trade union, told Reuters that MHI was now offering to put a further 800 million euros on the table to take higher stakes in two parts of Alstom's business. Such an offer, if accepted, would leave the Japanese group with 40 percent stakes in Alstom's steam, hydro and renewables business, he said.Siemens mentioned no such plan in an earlier statement arguing its existing offer was better than GE's.""The counter offer of GE reinforces the credibility of the joint MHI/Siemens concept. It actually follows our approach – but doesn't change the game. Our concept is still superior,"" Siemens France CEO Christophe de Maistre said.Alstom CEO Patrick Kron, who was present at GE France's headquarters in Paris as GE briefed journalists, declined to make any comment to Reuters on the new GE offer. NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS The nuclear alliance proposed by GE would see the government hold a preferred share, giving it a veto and other rights over issues related to security and technology of nuclear plants - a vital point in France, which relies heavily on nuclear energy.Sensitive intellectual property related to Alstom’s Arabelle nuclear steam turbine technology would also be transferred to a special purpose vehicle wholly owned by the French government.Alstom shares extended losses after the announcement and closed down 6 percent. One trader cited the state's veto right on nuclear issues as having spooked some investors.GE said it had also signed a memorandum of understanding with the French group's management to boost the transport activities of Alstom, maker of the famed TGV high-speed train.Under the plan, GE would sell its signalling business to Alstom and enter collaboration pacts for services, technology, manufacturing and support in the United States.

Also losing ground, shares in France's Alstom fell 6 percent after U.S. conglomerate General Electric  reshaped its offer for Alstom's power assets.The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended 0.6 percent higher at 1,395.58 points. The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index added 1.1 percent to 3,314.80 points, a level not seen since mid-2008.Late on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said the U.S. economy continued to recover and hinted it would raise interest rates slightly more next year than it had projected in March. But the central bank also lowered long-term projections for interest rates, evidence of diminished expectations.""The overall tone was pretty dovish and the forecast for economic growth seems lower than expected, which is good for equities. Central banks continue to drive markets big time,"" David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities, said.Banking stocks were among the top gainers, with France's Societe Generale up 1 percent, Italy's UniCredit  up 1.3 percent and Spain's Banco Santander up 1.6 percent. The Euro STOXX 50 Volatility index, Europe's main ""fear gauge"", tumbled 8.4 percent to 12.7 - a level not seen since 2006.The index, called VSTOXX, is based on put and call options on the Euro STOXX 50. It measures the cost of protecting stock holdings against market corrections and usually moves in the opposite direction to cash equities.Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index climbed 0.4 percent, Germany's DAX index added 0.7 percent, and France's CAC 40 gained 0.7 percent.Another big gainer was French car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen , rising 5.4 percent to near a three-year high. Bullish comments from the company's chief financial officer at an Exane BNP Paribas conference fuelled the rally and sent hedge-fund short sellers scrambling to close bets the shares would fall. ""Peugeot is a nice recovery play,"" Isabelle Enos, deputy head of asset management at B*Capital, said. ""The group's recent capital increase went smoothly, there's now much more visibility on governance and shareholding structure, and the icing on the cake is the recent pick-up in car sales in Europe.""Earlier this year, Peugeot was among the most shorted stocks across Europe, with nearly 20 percent of the company's shares out on loan in February. But the level dropped to 4.3 percent this week, according to data from Markit, while the stock price has surged 40 percent since February.Short selling - a trading strategy popular with hedge funds - involves borrowing a security and selling it, betting that the price will fall. Short sellers then buy it back at a lower price and return it to the lender, pocketing the difference.Europe bourses in 2014: link.reuters.com/pap87vAsset performance in 2014: link.reuters.com/gap87vToday's European research round-up(additional reporting by Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier in Paris and Alistair Smout in Edinburgh; editing by Jane Merriman and Keiron Henderson)",2014-06-19,GE,"Thu Jun 19, 2014 | 1:28pm EDT",Fed revives European stock rally; EDF sinks,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-europe-stocks-idUSL6N0P04RG20140619?type=companyNews
278,"   By Jean-Baptiste Vey and Natalie Huet | PARIS  PARIS France chose General Electric to form an alliance with Alstom on Friday, rejecting an offer from Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, but said the deal still needed some work and added the government would buy a 20 percent stake in the hotly-contested company.Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said he had used a newly-created state decree to reject both of the existing offers as not being in France's strategic interest, and had formulated fresh demands for GE (GE.N) Chief Executive Jeff Immelt.The decision ended weeks of suspense surrounding one of Europe's fiercest industrial battles in years, but left open major questions about the final shape of an alliance which GE hopes will give it access to new power markets.""The points we have raised with General Electric are precise and technical but necessary,"" Montebourg told a news conference after two days of talks involving the bosses of the three suitors, President Francois Hollande and top ministers.He said France had demanded strict conditions ""guaranteeing energy independence, job creation on national territory, and maintenance of decision-making centres in France"".He said the offer from Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (7011.T) was ""very serious"" and that he had backed it, but that the government ""had made up its mind"".""The offers were of equal quality but the truth is, the negotiations were much more advanced between Alstom and GE,"" said an Hollande aide.Siemens said it respected and understood France's efforts to preserve its national interests. MHI said it regretted the decision but looked forward to cooperating with other French companies as it has with nuclear group Areva (AREVA.PA).GE and Alstom declined to comment. Montebourg said he understood the Alstom board would meet later on Friday and give its view. Alstom's board is due to decide on the deal by Monday, when GE's binding offer expires. Montebourg confirmed that Alstom's lucrative gas turbines arm would be purchased by GE and said there would be discussions on the shape of joint ventures in other energy areas ranging from renewables to nuclear.He said that as a prerequisite to a deal and to ensure its demands are met, the French state would come in as the top shareholder in Alstom by purchasing a 20 percent stake in it from Bouygues (BOUY.PA), currently the holder of 29 percent. However, the government and Bouygues have yet to agree on the price of the stake, sources with knowledge of the talks said. Based on Alstom's current market capitalization, a 20 percent stake would be worth 1.7 billion euros ($2.32 billion).     A Bouygues spokesman declined to comment. Bouygues purchased its stake from the government in 2006, after Alstom was rescued from near-bankruptcy in 2004 through a state-backed bailout. Bouygues bought the stake for around 2 billion euros with the aim of creating a top player in nuclear power infrastructure.Alstom's sensitive nuclear activities will be held in a 50:50 venture with GE in which the French state would have a ""golden share"" giving it a veto, said the economy minister, a self-styled ""economic patriot"" from the French left.GE will also sell its rail signaling business to Alstom as part of plans to strengthen the transport activities of the French group, maker of the famed TGV high-speed trains.    Montebourg said the signaling business was valued at ""one billion dollars or euros, I am not sure"". He gave no other valuation details during the news conference. TOUGH POWER MARKET The government's active intervention in the GE-Alstom deal is ""indicative of the protectionist type of environment you have to deal with when doing business in France,"" said Russell Solomon, senior vice president and lead GE analyst at Moody's.    He noted however that GE, which employs some 10,000 people in France, is already very familiar with the business environment there and ""they know what needs to be done to get the regulator comfortable.""Alstom suffered more than bigger rivals from the 2008 economic crisis, which depressed electricity demand and caused a slump in the market for new power plant equipment, hitting its cash flow and ability to service debt.But its assets are valuable to rivals slugging it out in a tough market. Linking up with Alstom will allow GE to provide turbines for power stations and technology for electricity grids, something Siemens, eyeing Alstom's high-margin gas turbines for itself, and MHI wanted to prevent because it makes their U.S. rival even stronger. However analysts said that GE and Siemens both stood to benefit, regardless which one of them won the bid, as any deal would remove a competitor from the market that had been pushing down prices in a bid to grow its business. Alstom is the No.3 player in gas turbines after GE and Siemens, with a global market share that is estimated to be below 10 percent. ""Siemens should not be at a major disadvantage if GE buys the gas business,"" DWS fund manager Marcus Poppe told Reuters.APPEASING FRANCE GE (GE.N) had radically overhauled its bid on Thursday, hoping to appease unions and politicians by transforming what was originally a straight purchase of the power arm into an offer of joint ventures similar to that of the Siemens-MHI bid.In response, Siemens and MHI added 1.2 billion euros ($1.64 billion) to their offer for Alstom's energy business on Friday,  taking their cash component to 8.2 billion, and simplified the structure of the deal, hoping to see off GE.Siemens had said its offer, which valued Alstom's power businesses at 14.6 billion euros, well above GE's 12.4 billion, was ""superior industrially, financially and socially,"" and pledged to create new jobs in France, a commitment GE also made. Hollande's government blocked GE's initial advances on Alstom two months ago and forced it to improve its offer by encouraging Siemens to enter the fray and giving itself the power to block industrial tie-ups in strategic areas.Yet sources involved in the back-room discussions over the past seven weeks said it was not clear whether there was a single government line. Several union representatives of Alstom and political sources told Reuters the saga had drawn a divide between Montebourg, who they said lent towards the Siemens-MHI plan, and Hollande, in favor of GE.While no one has publicly drawn a link between the two cases, Hollande is also lobbying U.S. authorities to reduce the penalties which France's biggest lender, BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), faces for breaching U.S. sanctions in 2002-2009, notably its dollar-financing of oil trade out of Sudan.

283,"   By Mark John and Maria Sheahan | PARIS/FRANKFURT, June 20  PARIS/FRANKFURT, June 20 Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) raised their offer for Alstom's energy arm on Friday, challenging a revamped bid by General Electric as the deadline for a decision nears.President Francois Hollande's government, which has said it will veto any deal that does not protect French jobs and control over strategic activities, has yet to pronounce on either deal ahead of a decisive Alstom board meeting set for Monday at the latest.The French leader was due on Friday to consult key ministers before holding a further round of discussions with officials from GE and Siemens-MHI that could seal the fate of the ailing 86-year-old engineering group at the centre of one of Europe's fiercest industrial battles for years.Responding to a new GE bid on Thursday aimed at appeasing French political concerns, Siemens-MHI simplified the structure of its offer and raised its cash component by 1.2 billion euros ($1.64 billion) to 8.2 billion.This values Alstom's power businesses at 14.6 billion euros, Siemens said, 400 million more than previously and still well above GE's 12.4 billion.""Such (a) proposal is superior industrially, financially and socially,"" Siemens said, reaffirming pledges to create new jobs in France, a commitment the U.S. conglomerate has also made.The new Siemens-MHI proposal still foresees Siemens buying Alstom's gas turbine arm. But MHI is now offering to buy a 40 percent stake in its combined steam, grid and hydro businesses and bundle them in a single holding company rather than three joint ventures, a plan Alstom sources had said was too unwieldy. The French group reaffirmed that its board would meet no later than Monday to review the offers and that it planned to make no further statement in the meantime.GE on Thursday radically overhauled its offer following talks with French government and trade union officials, transforming what had been largely a straight purchase into an offer of joint ventures similar to that of Siemens-MHI.The cash component fell to an as yet unspecified level as it would sell its rail signalling unit to Alstom and set up 50/50 joint ventures in grid, nuclear and renewable assets. However, GE would still end up with the lucrative gas turbines that account for roughly a third of Alstom's power business. The nuclear alliance proposed by GE would see the government hold a preferred share, giving it a veto and other rights over issues related to security and technology of nuclear plants - a vital point in France, which relies heavily on nuclear energy.""OFFERS KEEP IMPROVING"" ""The offers of the two sides keep on improving,"" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told France Inter radio. ""We have more meetings today to move towards a decision in conjunction obviously with Alstom, because it ultimately must decide."" Valls said the French government's criteria were ""above all the preservation of strategic interests, preserving a certain number of decision-making centres in France and Europe, and obviously jobs"".Hollande's government has congratulated itself on blocking GE's initial advances on Alstom some two months ago and forcing it to improve its offer, not only by encouraging Siemens to enter the fray but also by signing off a decree giving itself the power to block industrial tie-ups in strategic areas.Yet sources involved in the back-room discussions over the past seven weeks said it was not clear whether there was a single government line.Several union representatives of Alstom and political sources told Reuters the saga had drawn a divide between Montebourg, who they said lent towards the Siemens-MHI plan, and Hollande, in favour of GE.""There are really two lines: Hollande and Valls who want to find the best solution and Montebourg who absolutely wants it to be Siemens,"" said one source familiar with the situation.While no one has publicly drawn a link between the two cases, Hollande is also lobbying U.S. authorities to reduce the penalties which France's biggest lender, BNP Paribas, faces for breaching U.S. sanctions in 2002-2009, notably its dollar-financing of oil trade out of Sudan.

292,"  * Alstom saga shows ""economic patriotism"" rules* Montebourg set the pace during two months of talks* French state will have say in GE-Alstom alliance   (Updates with Bouygues agreement)By Mark John and Jean-Baptiste VeyPARIS, June 22 There was dual cause for back-slapping in President Francois Hollande's Elysee Palace late on Friday night.France had thrashed Switzerland in the soccer World Cup, so largely assuring its place in the next round. And the government had just imposed its will to end a two-month fight for control over ailing French engineering group Alstom.""France has shown it can negotiate cleverly and openly with multinationals,"" an official close to Hollande said of the decision announced hours earlier defining the shape of a planned tie-up between Alstom and U.S. conglomerate General Electric .""France's international image was at stake ... We have shown we can stand up for our sovereign interests, as other countries do,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.It may be debatable what that image now is. But for prospective investors in France the Alstom saga has brought home one simple fact: in France, economic patriotism rules.From the moment in late April that GE revealed its interest in the 86-year-old group that built France's power grid and high-speed TGV trains, politics has never been far away.The battle was fought as Hollande's Socialists tried in vain to halt the rise in last month's European Parliament elections of the far-right National Front, whose protectionist platform attracts voters bewildered by France's economic decline.The pace-setter in the race for Alstom has not been GE or its German rival Siemens but 51-year-old French economy minister Arnaud Montebourg, a loose cannon who makes no secret of his own presidential ambitions.The future of Alstom is far from assured. Shareholder Bouygues agreed on Sunday to sell the French state a 20 percent stake in the French group as the government requested, but the exact shape of the GE-Alstom venture must still be defined.Yet the accounts of participants in the closed-door talks interviewed by Reuters show how the GE-Alstom tie-up now taking shape was partly dictated by Montebourg's push for an alliance in which French interests will be secured.""HARE-BRAINED"" When Montebourg learnt through media reports over two days from April 24 to 25 that GE was planning some form of approach to Alstom, he could not contain his rage.Only two months earlier when he held the more junior industry portfolio, he had dismissed as ""hare-brained"" suggestions that the government was worried about Alstom's future after its shares plummeted on a profit warning due to weak order books.Now, newly-promoted to the economics post in a government reshuffle, he looked embarrassingly out of the loop.""We won't let Alstom sell this national champion behind the back of its shareholders, its employees and the French government,"" he fumed on his official Twitter account.He further accused Alstom's CEO Patrick Kron of ""a breach of national ethics"" for not keeping him informed of GE's approach for its turbines and grid equipment business for price which sources put at $13 billion.That sense of betrayal, according to several sources who dealt directly with the minister, was at the root of his preference for a tie-up offer from Siemens - a group whose acquisition advances Kron balked at a decade ago.""For Montebourg this is personal. He's out to get Kron,"" said one of those sources.It was Montebourg who on April 27 first officially revealed a Siemens plan he hoped would create two ""European champions"" with tie-ups in energy and transport to counter the U.S. offer. Over the next week, he acted fast. He set much of the agenda for Hollande, whose unflattering nickname ""Flanby"" - a French brand of wobbly caramel custard - he owes to a Montebourg quip years earlier.While Hollande played down the prospect of the French state purchasing a stake and urging an ""industrial solution"", that was an option Montebourg never ruled out.And when the president accepted an invitation by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to join her one weekend in May in her constituency of Ruegen, a windswept island on the Baltic coast, Montebourg had already laid the groundwork.On the morning of May 9, Montebourg had met Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser in Paris before dashing to Berlin to meet his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, a fellow left-winger who is also  vice-chancellor in Merkel's grand coalition.The timing was perfect. A day later on Ruegen, where Hollande was treated to a boat tour and a stroll along the pier under drizzly skies, Merkel confirmed her government would back a Siemens tie-up if it made industrial sense.NUCLEAR WEAPON At home, political pressure for the government to show it was standing up for the interests of the 18,000 Alstom workers in France was growing.The National Front's Marine Le Pen had already accused the government of having ""abandoned Alstom to be dismantled for American or German profit"". Even the mainstream opposition noted that conservative ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy had agreed a state rescue for the group a decade earlier to ward off Siemens.It was then that Montebourg got out his nuclear weapon.On the evening of May 14, Reuters was tipped off that something of interest would appear shortly after midnight in France's Official Journal, the state gazette in which laws must be published to take effect.It turned out to be a decree stating that any deal in the energy, water, transport, telecoms and health sectors would require the approval of the economy minister - a substantial strengthening of existing state powers on takeovers. ""With this decree, we're armed to continue discussions and negotiations with the two companies that have expressed an interest,"" a source close to Montebourg said.The European Union's internal market authorities warned of the risk of protectionism and said they were looking at whether it was compatible with EU treaties.France's main employer group Medef said it was a ""bad idea"" in a country already more closed than its peers to international merger and acquisition activity. According to Thomson Reuters data, only 37 percent of acquisitions of French companies have involved foreign groups since 2000, compared with 55 percent for Britain and 59 percent Germany over the same period.But Montebourg was unrepentant, pointing out that other countries also had laws governing control of strategic industries while noting: ""This is the end of laissez-faire.""""PLAN C"" Alstom's fate remained uncertain. Siemens had outlined a proposal to Alstom worth $14.5 billion, offering to exchange part of its rail business plus cash in exchange for Alstom's power assets, but it had yet to make a formal offer.Behind the scenes, Montebourg had started to sound out local industrialists about an all-French solution. ""We have launched a study of Plan C,"" he told Reuters on May 22.""Plan A is GE, Plan B is Siemens, Plan C is a home-based solution,"" he said of an option that would involve French capital, whether from privately-owned or state-owned companies.In the end, Plan C did not fly. GE, meanwhile, had finalised its bid for Alstom at $16.9 billion, extended the offer deadline from June 2 to June 23 and went on a local charm offensive.Clara Gaymard, the head of GE France and the wife of a former French finance minister, was using her well-stuffed political contacts book to lobby for the U.S. group. CEO Jeff Immelt had already met Hollande in April to explain his plans and now, to the surprise of French lawmakers, said he was ready to submit to a grilling in parliament on May 27.""Jeff is our CEO and he is running things,"" said a GE spokesman. ""He is in Paris anyway, so we decided he should attend. It's normal that he should come and defend the project.""At a late-night session, Immelt promised lawmakers to increase jobs in France and revealed he was in ""constructive"" talks with the government to secure French access to Alstom's nuclear-related assets - a local concern.The U.S. group launched a print ad campaign based on hand-drawn pictures of wind turbines with the caption ""Tomorrow will be Made in France"" - a play to win over public opinion while wooing Montebourg by picking up the same slogan he used for a ""Buy French"" campaign.The end-game was nearing. On June 16, Siemens announced it had teamed up with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  (MHI) to make an offer for Alstom's turbines business involving $9.5 billion in cash and joint ventures.Under the deal, Siemens would buy Alstom's gas turbines business, MHI would buy stakes in Alstom power assets including grid and hydroelectric power equipment, and a venture would be formed to create a joint ""European rail champion"".But the government urged both bidders to do better. ""The talks between the state and the different companies are going to continue this week,"" a source in Hollande's office said last Tuesday. ""The offers must be improved.""U.S. PRESSURE? It set the stage for the frenzied last few days of the contest. GE turned its bid on Thursday from a pure purchase into an alliance involving joint ventures, a few hours before Siemens-Mitsubishi upped their cash component to $11 billion.Speculation grew of a split between Hollande, said to back GE, and Montebourg, still seen to favour Siemens. A Thursday meeting of the two and other ministers produced no consensus.One trade unionist said the minister had confided earlier in the week that he suspected Hollande backed the GE bid partly because he wanted to persuade U.S. authorities to ease penalties on French bank BNP Paribas for breaching U.S. trade sanctions between 2002-2009 - a link no French official has made publicly.""Montebourg told us on Tuesday, 'I have no idea what is going on inside the president's head, or what he will decide. But I do know there is huge American pressure to choose GE',"" a delegate for the CGT trade union said.Montebourg was denying local media reports of his resignation only a few hours before he announced on Friday afternoon that the government had chosen GE - with caveats.If the deal goes ahead, the U.S. firm will walk away with Alstom's gas turbines arm and its lucrative servicing contracts, but must negotiate joint ventures with Alstom in other fields.Aside from the 20 percent stake the French state will take in Alstom, it will hold a ""golden share"" giving it veto rights over strategy of the nuclear joint venture. GE must create at least 1,000 new French jobs or face fines.""This has shown that companies don't have a free hand and the wider interest can still prevail,"" said Dominique Gillier, general secretary of union CFDT's metallurgy arm. ""Montebourg managed to up the stakes and improve the bids. He can walk out of this with his head high.""But another source close to the talks expressed distaste at the way the government handled the affair. ""Alstom is a privately-held company. But the government is acting as if it were state-owned,"" said the source. ""It's unbelievable. What message does this send the world?""Still others point out that this should come as little surprise given the interventionist record of French leaders regardless of their political colour.Montebourg failed last year to keep open blast furnaces in eastern France which steel group ArcelorMittal wanted to shut down, threatening at one point to nationalise them.A conservative government's decision in 2005 to name French dairy group Danone a company of strategic importance - shielding it from a feared takeover by U.S. drink-maker PepsiCo - is now regarded as a classic example of ""economic patriotism"".Russell Solomon, senior vice president and lead GE analyst at Moody's credit ratings agency, said the saga was ""indicative of the protectionist type of environment you have to deal with when doing business in France"".""With that said, GE has been ... very familiar with the business practices and the regulatory environment in Europe generally and France in particular. The implication is that they know what needs to be done.""

After substantial revisions to address French concerns, the GE deal won government backing on Friday on condition that the state successfully acquired the Alstom stake from Bouygues.The government and Bouygues sought to reach a deal before the expiry on Monday of GE's formal bid valuing the Alstom energy business at 12.35 billion euros ($16.77 billion). For the next 20 months, their eleventh-hour agreement hands the state an option to purchase 20 percent of Alstom from Bouygues at an unspecified discount, provided the market value is at least 35 euros per share.If by then the state has not bought 20 percent, either from Bouygues or on the market, it has the right to purchase up to 15 percent at a similar discount whatever the market price.

294,"  (Adds details, background)PARIS, June 22 The French state has secured an option to buy 20 percent of Alstom from Bouygues , Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said on Sunday, clearing the way for an agreed tie-up between Alstom and General Electric.""We have a purchase option that enables us to buy when the price is as low as possible,"" he told France 2 television.Bouygues will initially lend Alstom stock to the French state so that the government can exercise an immediate role as the group's main shareholder, he added. The deal resolves a stand-off between Bouygues and the government that had threatened to complicate a wide-ranging alliance between Alstom and the U.S. conglomerate. After substantial revisions to address French concerns, the GE deal won government backing on Friday on condition that the state successfully acquired the Alstom stake from Bouygues.The government and Bouygues sought to reach a deal before the expiry on Monday of GE's formal bid valuing the Alstom energy business at 12.35 billion euros ($16.77 billion). For the next 20 months, their eleventh-hour agreement hands the state an option to purchase 20 percent of Alstom from Bouygues at an unspecified discount, provided the market value is at least 35 euros per share.If by then the state has not bought 20 percent, either from Bouygues or on the market, it has the right to purchase up to 15 percent at a similar discount whatever the market price.

295,"   By Laurence Frost and Marion Douet | PARIS  PARIS The French government was locked in negotiations on Sunday over its planned purchase of a stake in Alstom (ALSO.PA) from conglomerate Bouygues, the last hurdle in an announced tie-up between Alstom and General Electric (GE.N).Talks between government officials and Paris-based Bouygues (BOUY.PA) over the price of the 20 percent holding are ""on the right track"" to conclude later in the day, two sources said.France's Socialist government has made the stake purchase a precondition for approving the GE offer for Alstom's energy business, which formally expires on Monday. The government wants to ensure it has an influence in a complicated tie-up which will, for example, see Alstom's power grid and renewable energy businesses put in GE-controlled joint ventures in France.  Construction and telecoms company Bouygues, however, has balked at official demands that it sell the holding at the market price, which amounted to 28 euros per share at Friday's close of trading.""The negotiations are intense, but gifts to Martin Bouygues are out of the question,"" Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg told daily Le Parisien in an interview published on Sunday - referring to the group's chairman and CEO.The GE-Alstom deal ""will have zero cost to the French taxpayer,"" he added.Bouygues and Alstom declined to comment on the ongoing talks. Alstom on Saturday announced unanimous board support for the GE deal, which values Alstom's energy business at 12.35 billion euros ($16.77 billion).The government had endorsed the proposed deal a day earlier, rejecting a rival Siemens-Mitsubishi offer it had previously encouraged as ministers sought guarantees on domestic jobs and activities deemed strategic.    The announcement drew a line under a two-month battle for Alstom that had become heavily politicized as soon as the first reports of an agreed tie-up with GE appeared in April. President Francois Hollande's government and the main opposition UMP party were trading blows over GE-Alstom on Sunday, even before the tie-up was finalised.Luc Chatel, the center-right party's acting head, described the accord negotiated by Montebourg as a ""lose-lose deal"" for France and questioned why public funds were being invested.""There was an (earlier) offer on the table that would have avoided a public investment,"" Chatel said.Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and GE had both revised their bids before Montebourg backed the U.S. group, also announcing that the state would pay Bouygues the ""market price"" for 20 percent of Alstom.The declaration surprised Bouygues, which values the holding at 34 euros per share in its books - a premium of 380 million euros or 21 percent over its 1.73 billion market capitalization. ""Bouygues already intended to sell its stake, but they want to get out at 35 euros,"" a source close to the discussions said. ""The negotiations are purely about the price.""The pressure to bow to the government's will may be heightened by the embattled Bouygues Telecoms division's need for supportive government reform and regulation of the sector.Officials are examining possible deals or market measures to shield France's weakest mobiles operator and its jobs from low-cost rival Free (ILD.PA). Bouygues lost out in a recent bidding war for rival SFR (VIV.PA) despite Montebourg's backing.The GE-Alstom deal announcement followed intensive last-ditch talks between Montebourg, Alstom CEO Patrick Kron, GE boss Jeff Immelt and their Siemens and Mitsubishi counterparts. The U.S. group would acquire most of Alstom's energy business including gas and steam turbines for power plants, while selling its rail signaling division for $800 million to reinforce the TGV train manufacturer's transport offering.The tie-up also establishes GE-controlled joint ventures in France to house Alstom's power grid and renewable energy businesses. Strategically sensitive nuclear turbines would be placed under French government control.GE's 7.3 billion euro cash outlay amounts to a smaller windfall for Alstom shareholders than earlier envisaged - with a narrower perimeter of activities purchased outright.Despite the concessions, granted in response to French concerns, the revised plan ""remains accretive in year one"", GE chief Immelt said on Saturday.In an interview with France's Journal du Dimanche, Alstom's Kron said he would stay on for an unspecified transition period before bowing out in favor of a new management team.The deal is scheduled to close in 2015, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.($1 = 0.7366 Euros) (Additional reporting by Jean-Baptiste Vey and Benjamin Mallet; Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-06-22,GE,"Sun Jun 22, 2014 | 12:22pm EDT",France in push to buy Bouygues' Alstom stake ahead of GE deadline,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alstom-ge-deal-idUSKBN0EX0QA20140622?type=companyNews

299,"  * Alstom saga shows ""economic patriotism"" rules* Montebourg set the pace during two months of talks* French state will have say in GE-Alstom allianceBy Mark John and Jean-Baptiste VeyPARIS, June 22 There was dual cause for back-slapping in President Francois Hollande's Elysee Palace late on Friday night.France had thrashed Switzerland in the soccer World Cup, so largely assuring its place in the next round. And the government had just imposed its will to end a two-month fight for control over ailing French engineering group Alstom.""France has shown it can negotiate cleverly and openly with multinationals,"" an official close to Hollande said of the decision announced hours earlier defining the shape of a planned tie-up between Alstom and U.S. conglomerate General Electric .""France's international image was at stake ... We have shown we can stand up for our sovereign interests, as other countries do,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.It may be debatable what that image now is. But for prospective investors in France the Alstom saga has brought home one simple fact: in France, economic patriotism rules.From the moment in late April that GE revealed its interest in the 86-year-old group that built France's power grid and high-speed TGV trains, politics has never been far away.The battle was fought as Hollande's Socialists tried in vain to halt the rise in last month's European Parliament elections of the far-right National Front, whose protectionist platform attracts voters bewildered by France's economic decline.The pace-setter in the race for Alstom has not been GE or its German rival Siemens but 51-year-old French economy minister Arnaud Montebourg, a loose cannon who makes no secret of his own presidential ambitions.The future of Alstom is far from assured, and a definitive pact with GE still depends on tricky negotiations with minority shareholder Bouygues to sell the French state a 20 percent stake in the French group.But the accounts of participants in the closed-door talks interviewed by Reuters show how the GE-Alstom tie-up now taking shape was partly dictated by Montebourg's push for an alliance in which French interests will be secured.""HARE-BRAINED"" When Montebourg learnt through media reports over two days from April 24 to 25 that GE was planning some form of approach to Alstom, he could not contain his rage.Only two months earlier when he held the more junior industry portfolio, he had dismissed as ""hare-brained"" suggestions that the government was worried about Alstom's future after its shares plummeted on a profit warning due to weak order books.Now, newly-promoted to the economics post in a government reshuffle, he looked embarrassingly out of the loop.""We won't let Alstom sell this national champion behind the back of its shareholders, its employees and the French government,"" he fumed on his official Twitter account.He further accused Alstom's CEO Patrick Kron of ""a breach of national ethics"" for not keeping him informed of GE's $13 billion approach for its turbines and grid equipment business.That sense of betrayal, according to several sources who dealt directly with the minister, was at the root of his preference for a tie-up offer from Siemens - a group whose acquisition advances Kron balked at a decade ago.""For Montebourg this is personal. He's out to get Kron,"" said one of those sources.It was Montebourg who on April 27 first officially revealed a Siemens plan he hoped would create two ""European champions"" with tie-ups in energy and transport to counter the U.S. offer. Over the next week, he acted fast. He set much of the agenda for Hollande, whose unflattering nickname ""Flanby"" - a French brand of wobbly caramel custard - he owes to a Montebourg quip years earlier.While Hollande played down the prospect of the French state purchasing a stake and urging an ""industrial solution"", that was an option Montebourg never ruled out.And when the president accepted an invitation by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to join her one weekend in May in her constituency of Ruegen, a windswept island on the Baltic coast, Montebourg had already laid the groundwork.On the morning of May 9, Montebourg had met Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser in Paris before dashing to Berlin to meet his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, a fellow left-winger who is also  vice-chancellor in Merkel's grand coalition.The timing was perfect. A day later on Ruegen, where Hollande was treated to a boat tour and a stroll along the pier under drizzly skies, Merkel confirmed her government would back a Siemens tie-up if it made industrial sense.NUCLEAR WEAPON At home, political pressure for the government to show it was standing up for the interests of the 18,000 Alstom workers in France was growing.The National Front's Marine Le Pen had already accused the government of having ""abandoned Alstom to be dismantled for American or German profit"". Even the mainstream opposition noted that conservative ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy had agreed a state rescue for the group a decade earlier to ward off Siemens.It was then that Montebourg got out his nuclear weapon.On the evening of May 14, Reuters was tipped off that something of interest would appear shortly after midnight in France's Official Journal, the state gazette in which laws must be published to take effect.It turned out to be a decree stating that any deal in the energy, water, transport, telecoms and health sectors would require the approval of the economy minister - a substantial strengthening of existing state powers on takeovers. ""With this decree, we're armed to continue discussions and negotiations with the two companies that have expressed an interest,"" a source close to Montebourg said.The European Union's internal market authorities warned of the risk of protectionism and said they were looking at whether it was compatible with EU treaties.France's main employer group Medef said it was a ""bad idea"" in a country already more closed than its peers to international merger and acquisition activity. According to Thomson Reuters data, only 37 percent of acquisitions of French companies have involved foreign groups since 2000, compared with 55 percent for Britain and 59 percent Germany over the same period.But Montebourg was unrepentant, pointing out that other countries also had laws governing control of strategic industries while noting: ""This is the end of laissez-faire.""""PLAN C"" Alstom's fate remained uncertain. Siemens had outlined a proposal to Alstom worth $14.5 billion, offering to exchange part of its rail business plus cash in exchange for Alstom's power assets, but it had yet to make a formal offer.Behind the scenes, Montebourg had started to sound out local industrialists about an all-French solution. ""We have launched a study of Plan C,"" he told Reuters on May 22.""Plan A is GE, Plan B is Siemens, Plan C is a home-based solution,"" he said of an option that would involve French capital, whether from privately-owned or state-owned companies.In the end, Plan C did not fly. GE, meanwhile, sweetened its bid for Alstom to $16.9 billion, extended the offer deadline from June 2 to June 23 and went on a local charm offensive.Clara Gaymard, the head of GE France and the wife of a former French finance minister, was using her well-stuffed political contacts book to lobby for the U.S. group. CEO Jeff Immelt had already met Hollande in April to explain his plans and now, to the surprise of French lawmakers, said he was ready to submit to a grilling in parliament on May 27.""Jeff is our CEO and he is running things,"" said a GE spokesman. ""He is in Paris anyway, so we decided he should attend. It's normal that he should come and defend the project.""At a late-night session, Immelt promised lawmakers to increase jobs in France and revealed he was in ""constructive"" talks with the government to secure French access to Alstom's nuclear-related assets - a local concern.The U.S. group launched a print ad campaign based on hand-drawn pictures of wind turbines with the caption ""Tomorrow will be Made in France"" - a play to win over public opinion while wooing Montebourg by picking up the same slogan he used for a ""Buy French"" campaign.The end-game was nearing. On June 16, Siemens announced it had teamed up with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  (MHI) to make an offer for Alstom's turbines business involving $9.5 billion in cash and joint ventures.Under the deal, Siemens would buy Alstom's gas turbines business, MHI would buy stakes in Alstom power assets including grid and hydroelectric power equipment, and a venture would be formed to create a joint ""European rail champion"".But the government urged both bidders to do better. ""The talks between the state and the different companies are going to continue this week,"" a source in Hollande's office said last Tuesday. ""The offers must be improved.""U.S. PRESSURE? It set the stage for the frenzied last few days of the contest. GE turned its bid on Thursday from a pure purchase into an alliance involving joint ventures, a few hours before Siemens-Mitsubishi upped their cash component to $11 billion.Speculation grew of a split between Hollande, said to back GE, and Montebourg, still seen to favour Siemens. A Thursday meeting of the two and other ministers produced no consensus.One trade unionist said the minister had confided earlier in the week that he suspected Hollande backed the GE bid partly because he wanted to persuade U.S. authorities to ease penalties on French bank BNP Paribas for breaching U.S. trade sanctions between 2002-2009 - a link no French official has made publicly.""Montebourg told us on Tuesday, 'I have no idea what is going on inside the president's head, or what he will decide. But I do know there is huge American pressure to choose GE',"" a delegate for the CGT trade union said.Montebourg was denying local media reports of his resignation only a few hours before he announced on Friday afternoon that the government had chosen GE - with caveats.If the deal goes ahead, the U.S. firm will walk away with Alstom's gas turbines arm and its lucrative servicing contracts, but must negotiate joint ventures with Alstom in other fields.Aside from the 20 percent stake the French state will take in Alstom, it will hold a ""golden share"" giving it veto rights over strategy of the nuclear joint venture. GE must create at least 1,000 new French jobs or face fines.""This has shown that companies don't have a free hand and the wider interest can still prevail,"" said Dominique Gillier, general secretary of union CFDT's metallurgy arm. ""Montebourg managed to up the stakes and improve the bids. He can walk out of this with his head high.""But another source close to the talks expressed distaste at the way the government handled the affair. ""Alstom is a privately-held company. But the government is acting as if it were state-owned,"" said the source. ""It's unbelievable. What message does this send the world?""Still others point out that this should come as little surprise given the interventionist record of French leaders regardless of their political colour.Montebourg failed last year to keep open blast furnaces in eastern France which steel group ArcelorMittal wanted to shut down, threatening at one point to nationalise them.A conservative government's decision in 2005 to name French dairy group Danone a company of strategic importance - shielding it from a feared takeover by U.S. drink-maker PepsiCo - is now regarded as a classic example of ""economic patriotism"".Russell Solomon, senior vice president and lead GE analyst at Moody's credit ratings agency, said the saga was ""indicative of the protectionist type of environment you have to deal with when doing business in France"".""With that said, GE has been ... very familiar with the business practices and the regulatory environment in Europe generally and France in particular. The implication is that they know what needs to be done.""

300,"  (Repeats item first published on Monday with no changes to text)By Antoni SlodkowskiTOKYO, June 24 When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed at the World Economic Forum in Davos to take a ""drill bit"" to the ""solid rock"" of vested interests in reforming Japan's economy, executives at companies such as General Electric  and IBM paid attention.In the months that followed the January appearance at Davos, blue-ribbon panels sought out GE and IBM for advice on how to give companies more flexibility in hiring and pay.But the labour market deregulation to be announced on Tuesday, as part of an economic package aimed at boosting investment in Japan and lifting growth, stops far short of the sweeping change foreign business leaders had sought.That marks a setback at a time when investor optimism about the pace of ""Abenomics"" reforms has ebbed. The Nikkei  stock index, a closely watched indicator for Abe's closest advisors which rose more then 50 percent in 2013 as investors cheered the first blast of Abenomics, is down 5 percent this year.""Changes in labour regulations will be incremental. It's a step forward, but it's not that big,"" said Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG in Tokyo.The story of how Abe's promised deregulation faltered on job market reforms when confronted by resistance from Japan's bureaucracy and political controversy illustrates the challenge for Abe's ""Third Arrow"", a growth strategy intended to boost private investment and compliment earlier programmes of fiscal stimulus and monetary expansion by the Bank of Japan.Although Abe's reform panel sought ideas from companies such as Ikea and Danone in recent months, the crucial decisions were made behind closed doors by about half a dozen Tokyo bureaucrats over a few days in June, according to interviews with 11 people who participated in the process.The result: a pledge to end compulsory overtime allowance for workers earning more than the equivalent of $100,000 per year, a change affecting less than 4 percent of Japan's workers.The more contentious question of how and whether to make it easier for companies to fire workers was left unanswered with the government pledging to find a ""place for debate"" on the issue next year. Both rules on overtime and firing will be further discussed in a council at Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, where unions have a strong voice and have made it clear they will fight to prevent change.""It's true that right now it is only limited to the group which supports competitiveness the most, but I think it is still meaningful to offer them to be able to work according to new rules,"" said Makoto Murayama, the labour ministry official in charge of negotiations.""We can't go ahead looking only at the economic impact, but also have to protect the workers and gain the understanding of the citizens."" LONG HOURS, LOW PRODUCTIVITY At a London event targeting foreign investors in May, Abe seemed to promise a lot. ""Japan's population is declining. In order to grow, we must raise productivity,"" he said in answer to a question. ""We need to reform labour market regulation in order to make working conditions more flexible.""Abe's comments suggested that he was aiming at an overhaul of Japan's lifetime employment system. That entrenched practice gave workers secure jobs until retirement and was a feature in Japan's astonishing economic rise in the 1960s and 1970s. But it has been unravelling since an asset bubble burst in the 1990s and proponents of reform argue that a freer job market would lift growth and incomes.""This is a system that was built up over 30 or 40 years bit by bit,"" said Junji Annen, Chuo University Law School professor who advises on one of Abe's reform panels. ""No one thinks it can go on like this, but they are scared to change it.""The Japanese work long hours, but remain far less productive than workers in the United States or the European Union. Rules on firing are complicated and the outcome is uncertain for employers. In part because of the unpredictable costs of restructuring in a downturn, employers are reluctant to hire full-time. Almost 40 percent of workers are in a temporary class with limited protections and fewer benefits.Between the start of the year and April, representatives of Abe's economic reform team sought ideas from foreign companies such as Procter and Gamble and Unilever on the changes they wanted to see in labour regulation. In March, John Rice, GE's vice chairman, appealed directly to an Abe-appointed panel on foreign investment to give employers more flexibility and make it easier for employees to move between companies.""If labour mobility is high, productivity would go up and we could take on the challenge of managing through the business cycle,"" Rice said, according to a transcript of the Japanese translation.IBM, which has clashed with Japanese unions over its dismissal of workers who received below-average appraisals, was also consulted, officials involved in the process said.GE confirmed its executives talked to the government and provided the transcript of Rice's appearance at the panel. IBM Japan's spokesman Takeo Tamagawa declined to provide the details of consultations, but said that two main issues discussed with the government were the flexibility of working arrangements and a working culture in which workers were evaluated based on performance, not the time spent at work.'NO OVERTIME' Japan's rigid labour laws allow almost all workers to claim overtime if they work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week, with a narrow exception for executives and some occupations. Labour unions say the rules prevent abuses and ""karoshi"", the coined-in-Japan term for death by overwork.""The people who die by overwork in Japan are mostly white collar workers,"" said Yosuke Minaguchi, a lawyer specializing in labour law. ""These are not labourers toiling in factories but they also need protection.""For his part, Abe has wanted to take on overtime rules since his first brief stint as prime minister in 2006 and 2007, officials involved say.But a plan to carve out a ""white collar exemption"" for overtime in Abe's first term met strong opposition and contributed to a decline in his support ratings. This time, advisers say, he wanted to make sure that any reforms would not be characterized as an attempt to strip hard-working voters of overtime that could cost him support.""The prime minister had one request. To clarify to the public the difference between this proposal and the previous one,"" said Futoshi Nasuno, a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry official who prepared drafts of the policy proposals.After the consultations that included IBM and GE, the advisory panel proposed two kinds of exemptions from overtime allowance - one for mid-level managers and creative workers and another based on income for high performers earning more than about $100,000 per year, a threshold taken from a precedent in the United States.Then, in late April, Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest newspaper, ran a front page story that raised questions about whether the exemption was so broad it would amount to a ""no overtime pay"" policy. The leak of the plan put the advisory panel on the defensive, officials involved said.Wary of a public backlash, Trade ministry officials from the government's reform taskforce decided to narrow their demand to seek an exemption only for those earning more than $100,000. The exemption was so limited that officials decided not to even run an economic simulation of what it would mean for growth or income.Around the same time, trade ministry officials who were pushing reform were running up against resistance from the labour ministry on the wording of the final policy plan.""We were pushing to get specific dates and implementation periods for our projects into the bill. We asked for concrete words like 'establish' and 'create'.

304,"  * Siemens CEO earns praise for shrewd moves in Alstom battle* Kaeser refocusing on profits after ill-fated growth push* GE threat, restructuring remain challenges for Kaeser   (Adds GE comment)By Jens Hack and Maria SheahanMUNICH/FRANKFURT, June 23 Within weeks of taking the helm at Siemens in 2007, Peter Loescher splashed out $7 billion for U.S. diagnostics firm Dade Behring. It was the first of several acquisitions that went bad and ultimately cost the Austrian his job.Joe Kaeser replaced Loescher less than a year ago, promising a more disciplined approach. And in his first major test as CEO - the politically-charged battle for France's Alstom - he has been true to his word.On Friday, the French government announced it had chosen U.S. conglomerate General Electric over Siemens and its bidding partner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in the contest to acquire the energy assets of Alstom.But rather than looking like the loser, Kaeser - who celebrates his 57th birthday on Monday - emerged with his reputation for prudence intact and his dealmaker image burnished.Siemens may have missed out on Alstom, giving its biggest global competitor GE a stronger foothold in its European backyard. However the message to Siemens shareholders is clear: the Loescher era is over and under his successor the company will not do deals at any price.""Kaeser is looking pretty good now,"" said Ingo-Martin Schachel, an analyst at Commerzbank. ""He was not just disciplined but also clever in that he made it a little more difficult for GE to buy the Alstom assets.""Hans-Joachim Heimbuerger, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said: ""Siemens has lost the battle for Alstom. Our grief is limited.""INTERNAL CONCERN In early May, top executives at the German company were not so sure their Bavarian CEO would be able to say no to Alstom.As Kaeser put the finishing touches to a big restructuring of the 167-year-old company, some within it voiced concern that Siemens would waste time and money integrating its weakened French rival, according to officials at headquarters in Munich. Unions grumbled, concerned Kaeser would end up giving job guarantees to French Alstom workers that would ultimately hurt German employees. Other staff wondered whether Siemens would give away control of its train business to France - an asset-swap that could bolster the German firm's energy activities, but also saddle it with antitrust headaches given the dominance of a combined firm in turbines, transmission and hydro power.Finally, on May 7, at a presentation to reporters and analysts in the German capital, Kaeser unveiled ""Vision 2020"", the restructuring plan he had been honing for nine months. It was meant to signal a break from the go-for-growth Loescher era and usher Siemens into a new age of profitability.But the grand plan was overshadowed by questions about Alstom. The previous week Siemens had announced it was mulling an offer for the French firm to counter a potential deal with General Electric.Kaeser insisted he would not be forced into a deal. He was determined, Siemens officials say, not to overpay for Alstom and overstretch his management team.Even without the addition of the French group's power assets, Siemens' energy business needed close attention. Profit had tumbled in the second quarter and longtime head Michael Suess had been pushed out, replaced by Lisa Davis of Royal Dutch Shell, who would oversee the energy activities from the United States.MONTBLANC PLAN It was around this time that Kaeser hatched ""Montblanc"", codename for the joint bid with Mitsubishi - a company Siemens had got to know in recent months during talks on the sale of a majority stake in the German firm's Austrian metals business. ""The negotiation teams already knew each other and could get right back to negotiating,"" one person close to the matter said.The beauty of bringing Mitsubishi in: Siemens could limit its bid to the one Alstom asset it really wanted - gas turbines - and avoid the antitrust hurdles it would have faced had it bought the French group's full energy business as GE planned.Siemens workers and shareholders breathed a sigh of relief. Even if the deal came off, the risks to the German firm would be limited.When Siemens and Mitsubishi finally unveiled their joint offer on June 16, Kaeser sold the highly complex deal as an ""alliance"" that would keep Alstom largely intact - a key demand of the French government.Thrown on the defensive, GE was forced to retool its own 12.4 billion euro ($16.9 billion) bid to give the French greater say. On Friday, GE was anointed the winner but received a list of further French demands and news that the government would purchase a 20 percent stake in Alstom.In a letter to staff on Sunday, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, Kaeser said it was unfortunate that the Siemens-Mitsubishi offer had not won the day, but also made clear that there were benefits to having lost out.""Implementing the (GE-Alstom) deal will keep two of our competitors heavily occupied for years,"" he said in the letter. ""And with the French government as a major shareholder, it will be difficult (for GE) to push through American-style productivity and restructuring measures. This represents a huge opportunity for us.""A GE spokeswoman dismissed Kaeser's comments as ""good spin"" and noted that the U.S. company has successful joint ventures with several firms in which governments hold stakes, including France's Safran and Italy's Nuovo Pignone, an oil and gas equipment maker.""It's normal for us,"" the spokeswoman Deidre Latour said. ""This does not change the economics of the deal.""KAESER CHALLENGE Some analysts believe Siemens has missed an opportunity in losing Alstom.The French group's gas turbine activities, with their large installed base and service contracts, would have given Siemens the high growth, high margin business Kaeser has coveted.And now that GE has swooped on Alstom, Siemens can no longer boast about being the only big global player to offer both grid and power generation equipment.""Alstom was a relatively weak competitor financially that could hardly make its customers attractive offers,"" said Christoph Niesel, a fund manager at Union Investment. ""Now it can use GE's balance sheet to make offers that are just as attractive as those of Siemens.""On top of that problem, Kaeser may find the unions less friendly after he tried to offload the firm's rail business to Alstom as part of his offer. The Siemens veteran is well aware that worker unrest contributed to Loescher's downfall.More broadly, Kaeser still faces the challenge of closing a profitability gap with rivals like GE and Switzerland's ABB . To help achieve that goal, he has promised to deliver 1 billion euros in annual productivity gains through his corporate streamlining.With his shrewd manoeuvring over Alstom, Kaeser has reassured investors that he will not rush into deals like Loescher did with Dade Behring, a company whose value Siemens was forced to write down by 1.2 billion euros three years later.But his biggest challenge - transforming Siemens and its complex mix of businesses - remains.""Mr. Kaeser has promised shareholders a lot and hopes are high that things will improve,"" said Marcus Poppe, a fund manager at DWS. ""But until now we haven't seen an improvement in the numbers.""

306,"   By Benjamin Mallet and Laurence Frost | PARIS  PARIS France won an option to buy 20 percent of Alstom from construction group Bouygues on Sunday, in an eleventh-hour deal clearing the way for the agreed sale of Alstom's energy business to General Electric.The government had backed the tie-up on condition that it first secured the Alstom stake from Paris-based Bouygues - leaving less than three days to negotiate an agreement before GE's formal offer expires on Monday.Ministers are determined to maintain influence over a complex deal that parks some Alstom assets deemed strategically important to France within GE-controlled joint ventures.""This is a way of organising ourselves in the face of globalisation,"" Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg told France 2 television after announcing the option agreement.""It builds alliances rather than allowing France to become a giant shopping center for foreign corporations to come and prey on our companies,"" he said.GE and rival bidder Siemens - later joined by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - had both revised their offers as France sought guarantees on jobs and sensitive activities.The U.S. group's 7.3 billion euro ($9.9 billion) cash outlay brings Alstom shareholders a smaller windfall than envisaged at first, with a narrower perimeter of activities sold outright.Despite the concessions, granted in response to French concerns, the revised plan ""remains accretive in year one"", GE chief Jeff Immelt said on Saturday. Alstom said the same day its board had unanimously approved the deal, which values the business at 12.35 billion euros.Under its terms, GE is to buy most Alstom energy assets including gas and steam turbines for power plants, while selling its own rail signaling division for $800 million to reinforce Alstom's transport offering, which includes TGV trains.The tie-up also establishes joint ventures in France to house Alstom's power grid and renewable energy businesses, while sensitive nuclear turbines are placed under government control.In an interview with France's Journal du Dimanche, Alstom chief Patrick Kron said he would bow out in favor of a new management team after an unspecified transition period.The deal with GE draws a line under a two-month battle for Alstom that had become heavily politicized as soon as the first reports of a tie-up plan appeared in April. Luc Chatel, the centre-right party's acting head, described the accord negotiated by Montebourg as a ""lose-lose deal"" on Sunday and questioned the use of public funds.""There was an (earlier) offer on the table that would have avoided a public investment,"" Chatel said.The option deal with Bouygues ends a stand-off that followed Montebourg's surprise declaration on Friday that the government would pay only ""market price"" for its Alstom stock. The shares closed at 28 euros the same day.Raising the pressure in a weekend newspaper interview, Montebourg said that ""gifts to (CEO) Marin Bouygues are out of the question"". But Bouygues balked at the strong-arm tactics, sources close to the talks said, holding out for a price closer to 34 euros - a premium of 380 million euros or 21 percent over the holding's 1.73 billion market capitalizationUnder the compromise, Bouygues will lend Alstom stock commanding 20 percent of voting rights to the French government and surrender its two board seats, allowing the state to exercise an immediate role as the group's main shareholder.For 20 months, the government will then have an option to purchase up to 20 percent of Alstom from Bouygues - which currently holds 29.3 percent - with a 2-5 percent discount, at any point when the market price is 35 euros or more.If the government has not acquired 20 percent of Alstom by the end of that period, either from Bouygues or the market, it can purchase up to 15 percent from Bouygues with a similar mark-down, whatever the quoted share price.The loan of Alstom stock will be free of charge to the government, a Bouygues spokesman said, declining to comment on financial terms for the accompanying purchase option.Subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, the GE-Alstom deal is scheduled to close in early 2015.

And in his first major test as CEO - the politically-charged battle for France's Alstom - he has been true to his word.On Friday, the French government announced it had chosen U.S. conglomerate General Electric over Siemens and its bidding partner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in the contest to acquire the energy assets of Alstom.But rather than looking like the loser, Kaeser - who celebrates his 57th birthday on Monday - emerged with his reputation for prudence and his dealmaker image burnished.Siemens may have missed out on Alstom, giving its biggest global competitor GE a stronger foothold in its European backyard. However the message to Siemens shareholders is clear: the Loescher era is over and under his successor the company will not do deals at any price.""Kaeser is looking pretty good now,"" said Ingo-Martin Schachel, an analyst at Commerzbank. ""He was not just disciplined but also clever in that he made it a little more difficult for GE to buy the Alstom assets.""Hans-Joachim Heimbuerger, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said: ""Siemens has lost the battle for Alstom. Our grief is limited.""INTERNAL CONCERN In early May, top executives at the German company were not so sure their Bavarian CEO would be able to say no to Alstom. As Kaeser put the finishing touches to a big restructuring of the 167-year-old company, some within it voiced concern that Siemens would waste time and money integrating its weakened French rival, according to officials at headquarters in Munich.Unions grumbled, concerned Kaeser would end up giving job guarantees to French Alstom workers that would ultimately hurt German employees. Other staff wondered whether Siemens would give away control of its train business to France - an asset-swap that could bolster the German firm's energy activities, but also saddle it with antitrust headaches given the dominance of a combined firm in turbines, transmission and hydro power.Finally, on May 7, at a presentation to reporters and analysts in the German capital, Kaeser unveiled ""Vision 2020"", the restructuring plan he had been honing for nine months. It was meant to signal a break from the go-for-growth Loescher era and usher Siemens into a new age of profitability.But no-one wanted to talk about that plan any more. The previous week Siemens had announced it would make an offer for Alstom and all the talk was of how, encouraged by the French government, Kaeser was trying to counter a potential deal with General Electric. In Berlin, the questions for him were not about overhauling Siemens but rather how he intended to overhaul Alstom.He insisted he would not be forced into a deal - determined, Siemens officials say, not to overpay for Alstom and overstretch his management team. For regardless of Alstom, Siemens' energy business needed close attention. Profit had tumbled in the second quarter and longtime head Michael Suess had been pushed out, replaced by Lisa Davis of Royal Dutch Shell, who would oversee the energy activities from the United States.MONTBLANC PLAN  It was around this time that Kaeser hatched ""Montblanc"", codename for the joint bid with Mitsubishi - a company Siemens had got to know in recent months during talks on the sale of a majority stake in the German firm's Austrian metals business.""The negotiation teams already knew each other and could get right back to negotiating,"" one person close to the matter said.The beauty of bringing Mitsubishi in: Siemens could limit its bid to the one Alstom asset it really wanted - gas turbines - and avoid the antitrust hurdles it would have faced had it bought the French group's full energy business as GE planned.Siemens workers and shareholders breathed a sigh of relief. Even if the deal came off, the risks to the German firm would be limited.When Siemens and Mitsubishi finally unveiled their joint offer on June 16, Kaeser sold the highly complex deal as an ""alliance"" that would keep Alstom largely intact - a key demand of the French government.Thrown on the defensive, GE was forced to retool its own 12.4 billion euro ($16.9 billion) bid to give the French greater say. On Friday, GE was anointed the winner but received a list of further French demands and news that the government would purchase a 20 percent stake in Alstom.In a letter to staff on Sunday, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, Kaeser said it was unfortunate that the Siemens-Mitsubishi offer had not won the day, but also made clear that there were benefits to having lost out. ""Implementing the (GE-Alstom) deal will keep two of our competitors heavily occupied for years,"" he said in the letter.""And with the French government as a major shareholder, it will be difficult (for GE) to push through American-style productivity and restructuring measures. This represents a huge opportunity for us.""KAESER CHALLENGE Despite the positive spin, some analysts believe Siemens has lost an opportunity in losing Alstom.The French group's gas turbine activities, with their large installed base and service contracts, would have given Siemens the high growth, high margin business Kaeser has coveted.And now that GE has swooped on Alstom, Siemens can no longer boast about being the only big global player to offer both grid and power generation equipment.""Alstom was a relatively weak competitor financially that could hardly make its customers attractive offers,"" said Christoph Niesel, a fund manager at Union Investment. ""Now it can use GE's balance sheet to make offers that are just as attractive as those of Siemens.""On top of that problem, Kaeser may find the unions less friendly after he tried to offload the firm's rail business to Alstom as part of his offer. The Siemens veteran is well aware that worker unrest contributed to Loescher's downfall.More broadly, Kaeser still faces the challenge of closing a profitability gap with rivals like GE and Switzerland's ABB . To help achieve that goal, he has promised to deliver 1 billion euros in annual productivity gains through his corporate streamlining.With his shrewd manoeuvring over Alstom, Kaeser has reassured investors that he will not rush into deals like Loescher did with Dade Behring, a company whose value Siemens was forced to write down by 1.2 billion euros three years later.But his biggest challenge - transforming Siemens and its complex mix of businesses - remains.""Mr. Kaeser has promised shareholders a lot and hopes are high that things will improve,"" said Marcus Poppe, a fund manager at DWS. ""But until now we haven't seen an improvement in the numbers.""

308,"   By Antoni Slodkowski | TOKYO  TOKYO When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed at the World Economic Forum in Davos to take a ""drill bit"" to the ""solid rock"" of vested interests in reforming Japan's economy, executives at companies such as General Electric (GE.N) and IBM (IBM.N) paid attention.In the months that followed the January appearance at Davos, blue-ribbon panels sought out GE and IBM for advice on how to give companies more flexibility in hiring and pay.But the labor market deregulation to be announced on Tuesday, as part of an economic package aimed at boosting investment in Japan and lifting growth, stops far short of the sweeping change foreign business leaders had sought.That marks a setback at a time when investor optimism about the pace of ""Abenomics"" reforms has ebbed. The Nikkei .N225 stock index, a closely watched indicator for Abe's closest advisors which rose more then 50 percent in 2013 as investors cheered the first blast of Abenomics, is down 5 percent this year.""Changes in labor regulations will be incremental. It's a step forward, but it's not that big,"" said Robert Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG in Tokyo.The story of how Abe's promised deregulation faltered on job market reforms when confronted by resistance from Japan's bureaucracy and political controversy illustrates the challenge for Abe's ""Third Arrow"", a growth strategy intended to boost private investment and compliment earlier programs of fiscal stimulus and monetary expansion by the Bank of Japan.Although Abe's reform panel sought ideas from companies such as Ikea [IKEA.UL] and Danone (DANO.PA) in recent months, the crucial decisions were made behind closed doors by about half a dozen Tokyo bureaucrats over a few days in June, according to interviews with 11 people who participated in the process.The result: a pledge to end compulsory overtime allowance for workers earning more than the equivalent of $100,000 per year, a change affecting less than 4 percent of Japan's workers.The more contentious question of how and whether to make it easier for companies to fire workers was left unanswered with the government pledging to find a ""place for debate"" on the issue next year. Both rules on overtime and firing will be further discussed in a council at Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, where unions have a strong voice and have made it clear they will fight to prevent change.""It's true that right now it is only limited to the group which supports competitiveness the most, but I think it is still meaningful to offer them to be able to work according to new rules,"" said Makoto Murayama, the labor ministry official in charge of negotiations.""We can't go ahead looking only at the economic impact, but also have to protect the workers and gain the understanding of the citizens.""LONG HOURS, LOW PRODUCTIVITY  At a London event targeting foreign investors in May, Abe seemed to promise a lot. ""Japan's population is declining. In order to grow, we must raise productivity,"" he said in answer to a question. ""We need to reform labor market regulation in order to make working conditions more flexible.""Abe's comments suggested that he was aiming at an overhaul of Japan's lifetime employment system. That entrenched practice gave workers secure jobs until retirement and was a feature in Japan's astonishing economic rise in the 1960s and 1970s. But it has been unraveling since an asset bubble burst in the 1990s and proponents of reform argue that a freer job market would lift growth and incomes.""This is a system that was built up over 30 or 40 years bit by bit,"" said Junji Annen, Chuo University Law School professor who advises on one of Abe's reform panels. ""No one thinks it can go on like this, but they are scared to change it.""The Japanese work long hours, but remain far less productive than workers in the United States or the European Union. Rules on firing are complicated and the outcome is uncertain for employers. In part because of the unpredictable costs of restructuring in a downturn, employers are reluctant to hire full-time. Almost 40 percent of workers are in a temporary class with limited protections and fewer benefits.Between the start of the year and April, representatives of Abe's economic reform team sought ideas from foreign companies such as Procter and Gamble [PGEO.UL] and Unilever (ULVR.L) on the changes they wanted to see in labor regulation.In March, John Rice, GE's vice chairman, appealed directly to an Abe-appointed panel on foreign investment to give employers more flexibility and make it easier for employees to move between companies.""If labor mobility is high, productivity would go up and we could take on the challenge of managing through the business cycle,"" Rice said, according to a transcript of the Japanese translation. IBM, which has clashed with Japanese unions over its dismissal of workers who received below-average appraisals, was also consulted, officials involved in the process said. GE confirmed its executives talked to the government and provided the transcript of Rice's appearance at the panel. IBM Japan's spokesman Takeo Tamagawa declined to provide the details of consultations, but said that two main issues discussed with the government were the flexibility of working arrangements and a working culture in which workers were evaluated based on performance, not the time spent at work.'NO OVERTIME' Japan's rigid labor laws allow almost all workers to claim overtime if they work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week, with a narrow exception for executives and some occupations.Labor unions say the rules prevent abuses and ""karoshi"", the coined-in-Japan term for death by overwork.""The people who die by overwork in Japan are mostly white collar workers,"" said Yosuke Minaguchi, a lawyer specializing in labor law. ""These are not laborers toiling in factories but they also need protection."" For his part, Abe has wanted to take on overtime rules since his first brief stint as prime minister in 2006 and 2007, officials involved say.But a plan to carve out a ""white collar exemption"" for overtime in Abe's first term met strong opposition and contributed to a decline in his support ratings. This time, advisers say, he wanted to make sure that any reforms would not be characterized as an attempt to strip hard-working voters of overtime that could cost him support.""The prime minister had one request. To clarify to the public the difference between this proposal and the previous one,"" said Futoshi Nasuno, a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry official who prepared drafts of the policy proposals.After the consultations that included IBM and GE, the advisory panel proposed two kinds of exemptions from overtime allowance – one for mid-level managers and creative workers and another based on income for high performers earning more than about $100,000 per year, a threshold taken from a precedent in the United States.Then, in late April, Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest newspaper, ran a front page story that raised questions about whether the exemption was so broad it would amount to a ""no overtime pay"" policy. The leak of the plan put the advisory panel on the defensive, officials involved said.Wary of a public backlash, Trade ministry officials from the government's reform taskforce decided to narrow their demand to seek an exemption only for those earning more than $100,000. The exemption was so limited that officials decided not to even run an economic simulation of what it would mean for growth or income.Around the same time, trade ministry officials who were pushing reform were running up against resistance from the labor ministry on the wording of the final policy plan.""We were pushing to get specific dates and implementation periods for our projects into the bill. We asked for concrete words like 'establish' and 'create'. The labor ministry would come back with 'consider' or 'study' and vague commitments for implementation,"" Akiko Sugahara, who joined the government reform taskforce from business lobby group Japan Association of Corporate Executives told Reuters.Foreign investors had asked for changes to Japan's labor law, which gives broad discretion to judges in settling dismissal cases. As a result, labor-related cases take on average, twice as long as other civil cases, court data show.In the end, the Abe plan commits only to further debate on a ""dispute resolution system"" by stakeholders.

310,"   By Gilbert Reilhac | BELFORT France  BELFORT France In a joint trip to the eastern town of Belfort that is the cradle of their cooperation in France, the bosses of Alstom (ALSO.PA) and General Electric (GE.N) defended their tie-up as good for business, jobs and France. French train and turbine maker Alstom agreed over the weekend a $16.9 billion deal with GE that had been fiercely challenged by the French government and will be the U.S. conglomerate's biggest acquisition ever. To win over the government, GE has in the past weeks taken out full-page French newspaper ads reading ""Tomorrow will be made in France"" and flown its chief executive Jeff Immelt several times to Paris to meet President Francois Hollande and his Socialist government. Now with the deal sealed, Immelt on Tuesday headed to Belfort, a town in eastern France where Alstom and GE workers have been building power turbines in neighboring plants for the past 15 years.All smiles, Immelt and Alstom Chief Executive Patrick Kron chatted with local workers and posed for photographs in front of the Alstom steam turbines that will belong to a 50:50 joint venture as part of the deal sealed after a two-month tug-of-war with the government.""I think it's a three-fold win,"" Kron told reporters during the visit. ""It provides a future for the activities and employees of Alstom, it has an industrial logic that GE and ourselves called for, and it addresses the government's concerns regarding (France's) energy transition and nuclear sovereignty.""Alstom's steam turbines are fitted in 30 percent of the world's nuclear plants, including those sold by French utility EDF (EDF.PA), and the government was particularly worried to see them fall into foreign hands.  In May, it rejected GE's original offer - to buy outright all of Alstom's power business - and pushed during the following weeks for a more balanced alliance that would preserve France's energy independence, jobs and industrial know-how.Even after it got GE to substantially reshape its offer last week, the government threatened to block a deal until it secured on Sunday an option to buy 20 percent of Alstom from its current top shareholder Bouygues (BOUY.PA). Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said the move would ensure that GE fully meets the state's demands, notably to create jobs and maintain decision centers in France. Kron sought to reassure Alstom workers that the tie-up would guarantee them jobs over the long run, stressing that GE and Alstom complemented each other well in terms of technology, industrial sites and markets. HOLDING FIRM Kron also said he intended to remain at the helm of Alstom for the time being. He had said in May, when defending GE's original offer, that he did not see himself as indispensable over the long run to manage the French company once reduced to its smaller rail arm.Kron has faced harsh criticism from Montebourg over the past weeks.

312,"   By Gilbert Reilhac | BELFORT France  BELFORT France For Alstom workers in eastern France, news that General Electric has beaten rival bidder Siemens to a tie-up with their firm has brought relief and a response perhaps best summed up by the saying ""better the devil you know"".In the town of Belfort, some 2,500 Alstom employees have worked for more than a decade building electrical turbines just a few dozen metres (yards) away from a GE plant, whose workers they meet each day at lunchtime in a shared canteen.While French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg kept them on edge for weeks about the fate of their employer - forcing U.S.-based GE to sweeten its bid and prompting a rival one from Germany's Siemens - many Alstom workers admitted they had quietly been pushing for the former.""General Electric's people have been here for a long time, and this purchase ensures that the factories will remain,"" said Daniel, a 53-year-old maintenance worker for Alstom who asked to remain anonymous. ""My greatest fear was Siemens: with them in charge, we'd have been shut down in three years.""Montebourg, who is known for clashing publicly with foreign investors, reacted furiously in April when he learned through media reports that GE was planning some form of approach to buy Alstom's turbines and grid equipment business. He set to work stalling GE, soliciting a rival bid from Germany's Siemens and issuing a decree which stated that any deal in the energy, water, transport, telecoms and health sectors required the approval of the economy minister.Montebourg argued a GE-Siemens tie-up would create a European champion in which France would have a voice, while a GE takeover would put French strategic interest in the hands of a faraway foreign owner. ""We won't let Alstom sell this national champion behind the back of its shareholders, its employees and the French government,"" he wrote in April on his official Twitter account.DEEP ROOTS  However, that argument never held much sway in Belfort, near France's border with Germany, where GE has employed some 1,700 people since 1999, when it bought Alstom's gas turbine division and chose the town as the site of its European headquarters.Indeed GE's history in Belfort stretches back even further, to 1928, when one of its subsidiaries, Thomson-Houston, merged with the Societe Alsacienne de Construction Mecanique to form Alsthom, then spelled with an ""h"".It was in Belfort that GE's bid for Alstom got some of its loudest backing. The local chamber of commerce, a group of small- and medium-sized business owners and the town's centre-right mayor all urged the Socialist government to throw its weight behind GE's bid in an opinion article published in May.Many workers pointed to GE's long presence in France, a point which the firm underscored in a public relations campaign featuring television and print adverts. ""GE has been rooted here for longer than the others, which is quite reassuring,"" said Kamel Elgharbi, 36, an inventory worker. ""And if the (Alstom's) patents are protected, as they say they are, there should be no risk of outsourcing.""Some Alstom workers expressed regret at no longer being on the payroll of a French company, and welcomed the fact that the French government had struck a deal to purchase a stake in Alstom from its leading shareholder, Bouygues.""This is the least bad solution,"" said an engineer from the control systems department. ""It's the best solution in terms of keeping our jobs, compared with Siemens.""

313,"  WASHINGTON A former U.S. transportation safety regulator said pilot error will likely be the focus of a hearing on Tuesday on the cause of an Asiana Airlines crash at San Francisco International Airport last July in which three passengers died.""I think things that they're looking at very closely have to do with the performance of the pilots - their training, their preparation,"" Deborah Hersman, former head of the National Transportation Safety Board, said on the CBS ""This Morning"" television program.The board will examine causes of the July 6, 2013 crash landing of the Boeing 777, which also injured more than 180 passengers. It was the first fatal commercial airplane crash in the United States since February 2009.Asiana said in a report to the safety board that the crash likely was due to the pilots flying dangerously slow and an inadequate warning system that should have alerted them, according to documents released in March. [ID:nL1N0MT060] Hersman, who was board chairman until March, told CBS the board will likely focus on how well the pilots were trained.""Were they familiar with the system and the different modes that they operated in? Was there confusion? Did they know what was happening and were they prepared for the landing that happened in San Francisco on a clear day?"" she said. She also said the board believed that two of the passengers who died in the crash were not wearing seat belts.The third passenger who died, Chinese teenager Ye Mengyuan, 16, was covered in fire-fighting foam when she was run over by emergency vehicles at the crash sight. Hersman said the board will look at what went wrong in the emergency response to make sure it doesn't happen again.

314,"   By Ingrid Melander | PARIS  PARIS For the boss of General Electric, the trials and tribulations of doing business in France are summed up in the lyric of an old Rolling Stones’ song: ""You can’t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need.""This pragmatic approach to one of the Western world's most complex business environments, spelt out in a blog by Jeff Immelt to staff after GE (GE.N) secured parts of Alstom's energy business, highlights France's uneasy investment image.For some, government involvement in the Alstom saga - which included pushing through a decree expanding its powers to block takeover deals in strategic sectors, and the state taking 20 percent stake in Alstom (ALSO.PA) - has added to their concerns.""The GE-Alstom deal is another negative example of the protectionist French attitude,"" the German country head of a large investment bank said. ""In France, bosses are sometimes taken hostage and tires are burned, but on top of that the state interferes even if companies don’t ask for it,"" said the banker, who declined to be named to avoid harming prospects of doing business in France. He was referring to frequent worker protests over layoffs and so-called ""boss-nappings"" in which employees lock managers in their business premises overnight to demand concessions.Other observers are more phlegmatic. GE's experience shows that for all its reputation, France isn't necessarily hostile to foreign takeovers if the acquirers know which buttons to push.Ultimately, Paris agreed to the sale of Alstom's lucrative gas turbine assets and a joint venture in the sensitive nuclear arm, acknowledging the struggling firm could not go on alone. Indeed, the GE-Alstom deal was the second time in months that the Socialist government has allowed an iconic company to bring in foreign capital. China's Dongfeng (0489.HK) became a shareholder in car-maker PSA-Peugeot-Citroen alongside the French state as part of a capital injection. Shareholders backed the deal in April.""It's not like it's a forbidden land for M&A. Deals happen all the time,"" said Daniel Holland, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, who covers GE and other conglomerates.""It's just a reminder that the government still has a role regardless of how much you think the market should decide.""CHARM In the Alstom battle, patience, presentation and job creation were key. Immelt led a charm offensive which included meetings with President Francois Hollande and pro-intervention Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg, wooing lawmakers and trade unions as well as advertising in leading newspapers and radio.Faced with a rival offer by Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), GE totally revamped its offer to turn it from a straight purchase into one including joint ventures, a state stake-holding and veto on nuclear strategy. It sought advice from asset management and advisory firm Lazard - some of whose managers have ties with Hollande going back years - and vowed to create 1,000 new jobs within three years or accept a fine of 50,000 euros ($68,000) for every job short of that target.A strong asset for GE was having establishment insider Clara Gaymard - ex-head of the Invest in France agency and wife of a former minister - at the head of its French business and a very public advocate for the bid. GE also made widely known that it has had a permanent industrial presence in France for some 40 years, making it anything but a hostile American predator.      Put together, GE's approach allowed Hollande's government - enduring rock bottom popularity ratings due to the poor state of the euro zone's second largest economy - to claim a victory.""We live in a complicated world where multiple voices must be heard and understood,"" Immelt reflected in his blog.The government may have intervened in Alstom's case, but it did not step in on a much bigger takeover this year by Switzerland’s Holcim of French group Lafarge, the world's largest cement maker.It also stayed out of a now defunct plan by France's Publicis to merge with the U.S-based Omnicom to create the world's largest ad agency. To many analysts interviewed about Alstom, the clear message is that France will intervene only when it sees the business as strategic, or when many domestic jobs at stake.""France has given itself veto power but that's normal given the strategic nature of the matter and I'm sure other countries would have done likewise,"" one Italian investment banker said. The 2-trillion-euro economy is struggling more than other large industrialized countries to attract foreign investment but it is still a major target for M&A activity.Thomson Reuters data on M&A deals going back to 2000 show France as the sixth biggest target of cross-border deals with a total value of nearly half a trillion U.S. dollars. This puts it slightly behind neighboring Germany and the Netherlands and far behind Britain both in terms of value and share of M&A deals coming from abroad. But still, over a third of M&A deals targeting French companies come from abroad.Its regulations on foreign direct investment are slightly less open than those of 16 fellow EU countries but are still less restrictive than average among the main industrialized nations, according to rankings by the OECD think-tank.That said, foreign direct investment in terms of GDP lies far behind all other G7 countries except Japan, representing 0.2 percent of France's economic output last year, seven times less than the OECD average, data show. ECONOMY MORE A CONCERN France's reference daily Le Monde backed state intervention to get a better offer for Alstom but voiced concern that the state had taken a stake in Alstom for what it called political reasons to prevent the leftist Montebourg resigning. ""This could further put off foreign investors who will choose to avoid France and its interventionist state,"" the daily said in an editorial. ""If foreign direct investment in France, apart from real estate, is far below OECD average, there is a reason for that.""Officials note that France is not the only country keeping an eye on bids targeting flagship companies. Washington barred Dubai Ports World from buying port operator P&O in 2006 and stopped China's CNOOC buying oil firm Unocal in 2005. In Europe, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he wanted further commitments from Pfizer (PFE.N) before giving his blessing to a takeover bid for Britain's second largest drugs group AstraZeneca (AZN.L), which eventually fell through.Some argue the interventionist risk in France is manageable and that the real problem is a sluggish economy - which the statistics office sees undershooting the government's 1 percent growth target this year - and the failure of successive governments to bring about deep structural reform.""Investors have always known that (intervention) is the case,"" said Andrea Williams, European equity fund manager at Royal London Asset Management.""They would be more worried about the fact that the economy does not seem to be doing that well and the reforms are not being introduced by Hollande.""GRAPHICS LINKS: FDI inflows in G7 countries: link.reuters.com/fej32wCross-border M&A deals:  link.reuters.com/gac49vHoldings in public companies: link.reuters.com/sed47t(This story has been refiled to give Lazard's full title of asset management and advisory firm in paragraph 15) (Graphics by Vincent Flasseur; Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt, Stephen Brown in Berlin, ‎Alberto Sisto, Stephen Jewkes and Danilo Masoni in Rome, Jeffrey Dastin in New York, Sophie Sassard in London; editing by Mark John and Paul Taylor)",2014-06-25,GE,"Wed Jun 25, 2014 | 11:52am EDT",France tells investors: just learn to play game our way,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-france-alstom-investors-idUSKBN0F01GU20140625?type=companyNews
315,"   By Soyoung Kim and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. fast-food chain Del Taco, which specializes in Mexican cuisine as well as American favorites like burgers and fries, is in the early stages of exploring a sale that could fetch more than $500 million, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Founded in 1964, Lake Forest, California-based Del Taco owns and operates 546 restaurants in 17 U.S. states. The majority of them are in West Coast states including California and Oregon.Del Taco is owned by private equity firms that include Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners, Charlesbank Capital Partners and Leonard Green & Partners.The owners are working with Piper Jaffray and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) on the sale process, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is private. Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners led a new equity infusion into Del Taco in 2010, with existing investors Charlesbank Capital Partners and Leonard Green & Partners also contributing new capital to the recapitalization. Del Taco also refinanced its debt in April in a $260 million deal led by GE Capital (GE.N). Representatives of Del Taco, Goldman Sachs, Piper Jaffray and Leonard Green did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Charlesbank declined to comment. Del Taco offers made-to-order Mexican items such as tacos, burritos and quesadillas as well as American classics including burgers, fries and shakes.The company is one of a number of restaurant chains trying to sell themselves or go public as market valuations for the sector continue to hold strong.In May, Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N) agreed to sell its Red Lobster seafood chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital LLC for $2.1 billion. Carlson Restaurants Inc agreed to sell its TGI Fridays casual dining chain to private equity firms Sentinel Capital Partners and TriArtisan Capital Partners in May for more than $800 million.Recent public offerings from restaurant chains have included Zoe's Kitchen Inc (ZOES.N), Potbelly Corp (PBPB.O) and Papa Murphy's Holdings Inc (FRSH.O).

316,"   By Soyoung Kim and Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK, June 30  NEW YORK, June 30 Investor support for large acquisitions and a desire to trump rivals in consolidating markets have led chief executives to strike big transactions so far in 2014, raising year-to-date global deal volumes to their highest level in seven years.Corporate buyers did not shy away from going hostile if their targets proved unwilling to sell, while more U.S. companies rushed to buy overseas peers to lower tax rates and access cash held offshore in a practice known as inversion.The dealmaking frenzy could last for several months absent geopolitical or economic shocks, with buyers keen to take advantage of their strong stock prices, ample cash reserves and cheap available financing.""Companies have strategic imperatives to do deals, they have the cash to do deals, and they can borrow additional cash at record-low rates,"" said Frank Aquila, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. ""It really is a bit of a perfect storm when it comes to dealmaking.""Unlike the most recent heyday of dealmaking, which was back in 2007 when private equity used cheap money to load up companies with debt, this year's merger boom is being led by cash-rich corporations with strong balance sheets, such as Pfizer Inc, Comcast Corp and General Electric Co.""What is notable about the deal activity we have seen in the first half of the year is the blue-chip nature of the companies who are doing the acquiring. We have finally seen the return of the strategic acquirer,"" said Gregg Lemkau, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group.Year-to-date global deal volume as of June 26 surged to $1.75 trillion, up 75 percent from the year-ago period, according to Thomson Reuters data. That was the highest level since 2007, when deal volume reached $2.28 trillion.This year's increase came despite the number of global deals dropping slightly to 17,698 from 17,820 the year before.At over $1 trillion, the second quarter of 2014 was the highest in deal volume since the second quarter of 2007 and was up significantly from the $680 million in the first quarter of 2014.Thirty-eight unsolicited or hostile bids, worth more than $150 billion, were launched in the first six months of the year, compared with 19 such deals worth $8 billion in the same period last year.Pfizer made an abortive $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc , Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc is trying to buy Botox maker Allergan Inc  for more than $50 billion, and AbbVie Inc  plans to appeal to Shire Plc's shareholders after an unsolicited $46 billion bid was rebuffed.""With both the target and acquirer's stock generally up after deals are announced, buyers see value creation and tend to be more aggressive even if targets are not willing to sell,"" said Ravi Sinha, executive vice chairman of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.More CEOs and boards are willing to pull the trigger on transactions that have been contemplated for a while, with a view that financing conditions are at their peak and unlikely to improve, said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of Americas M&A at UBS AG. RISING VALUATIONS Risk-taking has been generally rewarded by investors, at a time when low cost of capital means buyers can obtain immediate boosts to their earnings from those deals.Nearly 70 percent of announcements of U.S. acquisitions worth $1 billion or more in the first half were followed by gains in the stock prices of the buyers, up from 60 percent in the same period last year and compared with a seven-year average of 55 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed.""In the early stages of an M&A wave, the returns to acquirers tend to be positive, but as the M&A wave matures, the returns turn negative as people get overconfident,"" said Bob Bruner, dean of the University of Virginia's Darden Graduate School of Business Administration and author of the book ""Deals from Hell.""""It would seem that we are still at the early stage of the wave,"" he said.With stock markets at record-high levels, the average premium buyers paid over target companies' four-week stock prices was 24.8 percent so far this year, down from 28.1 percent in the same period last year and 30.3 percent in 2012.But on an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) basis, valuations climbed. Buyers on average paid targets 13 times EBITDA in the first half of the year, compared with 11.8 times in the same period last year. That was the highest level since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data.""On an (earnings per share) accretion basis, nearly every deal looks great. However, on a return-on-invested-capital basis, values appear pretty high,"" Goldman Sachs' Lemkau said.""Many boards are being forced to think about whether their traditional return on invested capital thresholds remain appropriate in an environment where the cost of capital is so low,"" he added.The red-hot equity markets and rising deal valuations also forced buyout firms to the sidelines, with private equity-backed leveraged buyouts declining 9 percent to $120.3 billion so far this year, representing 7 percent of the M&A market. Private equity firms, however, took advantage of the M&A boom to sell more of their companies for top-dollar amounts.""It's a great debt market but the issue for private equity is that it has inability to do highly levered transactions, compared to the leverage levels in 2006 and 2007, given the federal limitations,"" UBS's Hourihan said.Goldman Sachs was the top M&A adviser worldwide, with $623 billion worth of deals so far this year. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co rounded out the top five. INVERSION TREND Inversions by U.S. companies, which allow them to be domiciled in countries that have a lower corporate tax rate, have moved center-stage in the healthcare sector, which was the busiest industry for dealmaking this year.Such transactions also helped boost cross-border M&A volume, which surged 132 percent so far this year to account for 39 percent of global activity.U.S. medical device maker Medtronic Inc struck a $42.9 billion deal for Ireland-based rival Covidien Plc  in June, in one of the largest attempted inversions.Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca, as well as AbbVie's takeover offer for Shire, would also enable these companies to cut their tax bills by moving to a country with a lower corporate tax rate while also allowing them to access the cash held offshore without paying U.S. taxes.Even excluding Pfizer's AstraZeneca bid which has been put on hold for now, healthcare deals more than tripled to $317.4 billion so far this year, representing 18.2 percent of total deal volume, Thomson Reuters data shows.Some companies that are still without a foreign domicile are now trying to catch up with rivals that have already gone offshore and taken advantage of their more favorable tax status to strike even more deals.""I think you will continue to see inversion transactions being contemplated. This is particularly relevant to the Healthcare and TMT sectors, where you have a lot of cash trapped offshore,"" Goldman's Lemkau said.Gary Posternack, head of Americas mergers and acquisitions at Barclays Plc, added that while there are a large number of U.S. companies interested in exploring inversions, finding the right partner at the right valuation can be a challenge.""The limiting factor for inversions will likely be the ability of U.S. companies to find attractive and willing partners,"" he said.The second-busiest sector for dealmaking this year was media and entertainment, which had deal volumes nearly triple to $220.7 billion on the back of two mega-mergers: Comcast Corp's $45.2 billion bid for rival Time Warner Cable and AT&T Inc's  proposed acquisition of DirecTV for $48.5 billion.The broader telecom sector is likely to get another boost in the near future as Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc  are in advanced talks about a deal that would combine the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless operators.""The tone in the boardroom has changed from one that was doubtful about strategic M&A activity to one that is questioning the status quo,"" Posternack said.""With all of the recent deal activity and the positive associated market reaction, the question now being asked is why are we not acting on the logical transactions?""

The deal, which sparked a two-month tug-of-war with the government, is expected to close in the first half of 2015. The deal will have to win the two-thirds majority approval from Alstom shareholders during an extraordinary meeting in the fourth quarter, Alstom Chief Executive Patrick Kron told the firm's annual shareholder meeting in Paris on Tuesday.It is not clear at this stage whether the firm's biggest shareholder Bouygues (BOUY.PA), with a 29 percent stake, will take part in the vote or accede to calls from some minority investors to step aside because of its role in the deal. The government gave its blessing to the tie-up only after it won the option to buy 20 percent of Alstom from the construction group. With the second-biggest Alstom shareholder having a stake of about just 5 percent, minority investors could play an important role if Bouygues decides not to participate in the vote.A Bouygues spokesman declined to comment.Throughout Tuesday's shareholder meeting, several minority shareholders voiced concern over the future shape and governance of the firm, which will be refocused on transport and is set to have the French state as its top shareholder.    Colette Neuville of shareholder lobby ADAM complained that minority investors had not been given enough information on the value of Alstom's various assets. She noted that Alstom shares had slumped over 10 percent since the deal was announced. ""I think this slump in shares is due to the fact we don't really know what role the state will play in the future Alstom,"" she said.CASH  The government had threatened for weeks to veto the sale of most of Alstom's power arm to GE, saying it would not let a strategic power and rail group be ""devoured"" by a foreign firm. It pressured GE to dramatically reshape its offer to include commitments to create local jobs and set up joint ventures giving Alstom a future in the power sector. Alstom will also buy GE's rail signalling unit as part of the deal.The government agreed to the deal after it won the option to buy Alstom shares from Bouygues, saying the move would help ensure that GE fully meets its demands. Alstom will be reaping 12.35 billion euros from the GE deal, but will re-invest about 2.5 billion euros into three 50:50 joint ventures created in its electricity grid, renewable energy and nuclear power businesses. Alstom has said it plans to use the proceeds to pay off debt, strengthen its transport arm via acquisitions and return cash to shareholders, but has not provided a breakdown. On Tuesday, Kron said only that Alstom would have 7.5 billion euros cash in excess of what is needed to pay off its 3 billion euros of debt.Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Tissot said on the sidelines of the meeting that after investing in the joint ventures and buying GE's rail signalling unit, Alstom would be left with around 4.3 billion euros in cash.Alstom shares closed 1.1 percent lower.Analysts at JPMorgan have cut their price target to 27 euros a share from 33 euros, below analysts' consensus for 31 euros, stressing that GE's amended deal came with less cash and more complexity.""What a shame, it could have been so good,"" they wrote.

320,"  * Global investment banking fees $47.1 bln in H1* JPMorgan tops league table, earns fees of $3.4 blnLONDON, July 2 Fees paid for investment banking services rose 12 percent in the first half of 2014, their strongest start in seven years, data showed on Wednesday, as surging stock markets encouraged firms to strike deals.Global investment banking fees totalled $47.1 billion in the first six months of the year, compared to $42.2 billion last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting. That was the highest level since 2007, when investment banks earned $56.8 billion.Fees in Europe showed the most improvement, rising 29 percent so far this year, while in Asia Pacific fees were 10 percent higher. They were up 6 percent in the Americas and down 15 percent in Africa and the Middle East. Record highs in stock markets and continued low volatility have prompted an increasing number of firms to hire investment banks to help them issue equity. Private equity firms have also sought their services as they seize the opportunity to sell out of investments made before the financial crisis.Cash-rich corporations with strong balance sheets, like Comcast Corp and General Electric Co, have led a revival in mergers and acquisitions, further adding to bankers' workloads and fee pools.Fees earned for advising on equity capital market (ECM) transactions, such as initial public offerings (IPOs), were 36 percent higher at $13 billion, reflecting a 16 percent increase in activity over the period. M&A fees rose 6 percent to $10.1 billion as deal volumes surged to $1.75 trillion, up 75 percent. Fees from syndicated loans were up 10 percent. JPMorgan was the highest paid bank, bringing in $3.4 billion in the six-month period and accounting for 7.3 percent of wallet share. In a repeat of the previous year's rankings, fellow U.S. institutions Bank of America Merrill Lynch  and Goldman Sachs followed in second and third respectively.Freeman Consulting Director Lam Nguyen said the second half looks positive for fees, as a number of deals are scheduled to close towards to the end of the year. Another buoyant period for IPOs is also expected, he added. If fees continue to be earned at the same pace in the second half as they did in the first, total fees should reach $95.4 billion, according to the data.""Overall 2014 should be a very good year,"" Nguyen said.Debt capital markets (DCM) have proved the only weak spot so far this year. Banks were paid $12.6 billion for DCM underwriting, down 0.6 percent from 2013.Nguyen said the slight drop compares to an exceptional level of activity last year and issuance remains strong.

334,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  The success of General Electric Co's impending initial public offering for its private-label credit card unit could ride on investors' willingness to bet that a lukewarm consumer-led U.S. economic recovery heats up.GE began its investor road show on Friday for the IPO of the unit, to be called Synchrony Financial, as it revealed new details about the business.Set for the end of the month, the IPO of 15 percent of Synchrony is expected to raise around $3.1 billion, surpassing Ally Financial Inc as the biggest U.S. financial services stock flotation this year.While the IPO could enjoy a positive initial reception given the strong demand for offerings this year and investors' eagerness to deploy cash in the market, its longer-term performance will likely be hitched to the strength of the belief in a consumer recovery.""It’s a good indicator and good investment based on people who believe the economy is going to continue to improve as it relates to the consumer,"" said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com, an IPO and secondary offering research firm.More than two-thirds of Synchrony's $9.4 billion in revenue last year came from its retail card business, which offers private label credit cards carrying brands of corporate partners such as Amazon.com Inc, JC Penney Co, Lowe's Companies Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Some of those retailers including JC Penney and Wal-Mart have struggled to find sales growth this year even as the broader economy has recovered, in part because a broad swath of consumers remains constrained by debt and worried about job prospects.Still, they could eventually benefit from a strengthening recovery. A gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in June, the U.S. Commerce Department reported earlier this week, indicating the economy ended the second quarter on stronger footing.Synchrony's rivals in the private label card business include consumer banks such as Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo. Synchrony's other revenue comes from financing for bigger ticket consumer purchases, such as electronics or jewelry, and for healthcare procedures. ""My sense is this is fertile ground for a new offering,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""Holders of this paper, they have to believe in the long-term health of the economy and the consumer.""IPOs have performed well initially this year, with stocks rising 22 percent on average between the final offering price and the first day's close, said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster LLC, which helps create index funds for IPOs.""Risk appetite is quite high because the market is obviously very strong,"" Schuster said. GE, which revealed details for Synchrony on Friday as it posted a 13 percent rise in second-quarter profit, valued the rest of Synchrony at around $17 billion. GE plans to offer the rest of the business to its shareholders through an exchange late next year. ""It is the most shareholder-friendly execution,"" GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview. ""It’s much more tax-efficient than selling the company outright for cash.""The separation is critical to GE's plan to slim down its GE Capital finance business and boost its industrial operations to 75 percent of company earnings by 2016, up from 55 percent last year.""For GE, it’s more about de-risking the company and focusing on the areas in industrial where they want to focus their growth,"" said Jim Corridore, an equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ.

U.S. President Barack Obama demanded that Russia stop supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine a day after the downing of a Malaysian airline by a surface-to-air missile, which he said was fired from rebel territory. The incident raised the prospect of more U.S. sanctions on Moscow.

The Russell 2000 index  popped back above its 200-day moving average of around 1,140, ending Friday up 1.6 percent at 1,151.61.For the week, though, the Russell 2000 still slid 0.7 percent.

A gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose solidly in June, the U.S. Commerce Department reported earlier this week, indicating the economy ended the second quarter on stronger footing.Synchrony's rivals in the private label card business include consumer banks such as Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo. Synchrony's other revenue comes from financing for bigger ticket consumer purchases, such as electronics or jewelry, and for healthcare procedures.""My sense is this is fertile ground for a new offering,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""Holders of this paper, they have to believe in the long-term health of the economy and the consumer.""IPOs have performed well initially this year, with stocks rising 22 percent on average between the final offering price and the first day's close, said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster LLC, which helps create index funds for IPOs. ""Risk appetite is quite high because the market is obviously very strong,"" Schuster said.GE, which revealed details for Synchrony on Friday as it posted a 13 percent rise in second-quarter profit, valued the rest of Synchrony at around $17 billion. GE plans to offer the rest of the business to its shareholders through an exchange late next year.""It is the most shareholder-friendly execution,"" GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview. ""It's much more tax-efficient than selling the company outright for cash.""The separation is critical to GE's plan to slim down its GE Capital finance business and boost its industrial operations to 75 percent of company earnings by 2016, up from 55 percent last year.""For GE, it's more about de-risking the company and focusing on the areas in industrial where they want to focus their growth,"" said Jim Corridore, an equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ.

At the top of the pack, shares of Google  jumped 4.1 percent to $604.62 a day after the company reported second-quarter results that beat investors' expectations. Facebook Inc shares gained 2.6 percent to $68.15. Market participants kept a close watch on geopolitical news. U.S. President Barack Obama demanded that Russia stop supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine after the downing of a Malaysian airline by a surface-to-air missile he said was fired from rebel territory raised the prospect of more sanctions on Moscow.Investors also remained wary after Israel stepped up its land offensive in Gaza on Friday.""As a market participant, what's more concerning to me are the latest round of U.S. sanctions on Russia. If the EU follows the U.S. and ratchets up pressure on Russia, what will happen to bonds of Russian companies such as Gazprom and Rosneft?"" said Putri Pascualy, credit strategist and portfolio manager at Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co. in Irvine, California.

General Electric shares shed 0.9 percent to $26.37 after the U.S. conglomerate reported growth in second-quarter operating earnings that matched analysts' expectations.Fellow Dow component International Business Machines Corp  slightly lost ground, down 0.1 percent at $192.32, a day after the world's largest technology company reported its software business grew less than expected even as quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations.But Honeywell International, a maker of aircraft cockpit parts and other electronic equipment, raised the lower end of its 2014 profit forecast range and reported better-than-expected quarterly profit. Its stock gained 1.6 percent to $96.73.S&P 500 companies' profits are expected to grow 5 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the 8.4 percent growth forecast at the start of April. Revenue is seen up 3.2 percent.Thomson Reuters data also showed that of 82 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported earnings through Friday morning, 68.3 percent beat Wall Street's expectations, roughly in line with the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters and above the 63 percent rate since 1994.

338,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co (GE.N) reported a 13-percent jump in quarterly net income Friday on improved sales of its jet engines and oil and gas equipment, and said it was targeting the initial public offering of its private-label credit-card business for the end of the month.The U.S. conglomerate has been planning a partial IPO of the North American retail finance business, to be called Synchrony Financial, as part of a plan to exit the business and slim down its overall GE Capital unit.GE expects a 15 percent offering would be worth about $3.1 billion at the mid-point of the IPO, according to a company presentation. It plans to retain about $17 billion of the business, with a full separation targeted for late next year.Shares of GE, whose quarterly profit matched Wall Street targets, rose 1.7 percent in premarket trading. The spin-off is a key part of Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt's plan to boost GE's earnings contribution from its industrials businesses to 75 percent by 2016, from 55 percent last year. Toward that end, GE last month agreed to buy the power turbine and other energy assets of France's Alstom for $16.9 billion, its biggest-ever deal.""GE has always been a steady re-allocator of portfolio assets,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management, which owns GE shares. ""It's nice to see that pick back up ... To me, that's what can really move the stock."" GE's second-quarter net income rose to $3.55 billion, or 35 cents per share, from $3.13 billion, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding items, operating earnings of 39 cents a share matched the average estimate of analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 3.4 percent to $36.23 billion, slightly below the $36.3 billion expected by analysts. Sales rose 15 percent for its aviation segment, and 20 percent for its oil and gas unit.Overall, revenue for GE's industrial businesses rose 5 percent, excluding acquisitions, and the company kept its forecast of organic industrial revenue growth of 4 percent to 7 percent for the year.GE's profit margin for its industrial businesses, a closely watched barometer by Wall Street, expanded 0.2 percentage point to 15.5 percent.  The company's backlog of equipment and service orders rose 10 percent to $246 billion. Orders for new equipment in the quarter dipped 3 percent, after also declining in the first quarter, although service orders rose 14 percent. GE last month prevailed in a two-month battle to acquire Alstom's power assets, fending off initial French government resistance and a bid from rival industrial giants.The deal is expected to close in 2015 and add 6 cents to 9 cents per share to earnings in 2016, the company said Friday. Analysts expect GE to earn $1.97 per share in 2016.

344,"  * Q1 transport orders 4.8 bln eur with Prasa contract* Thermal and renewable power sales fall 10 pct* Sees ""sustained"" organic sales growth in transport* Says cannot yet provide detailed guidance   (Adds details, background)PARIS, July 23 France's Alstom said it expected sustained organic sales growth at its rail arm this year but would not provide a revenue or profit target following a deal that will see General Electric buy most of its power business. The engineering group achieved record orders for rail equipment that offset a drop in sales in its power activities in the first quarter of its fiscal year. Over the period, these activities - thermal power, renewable power and electricity grid - had been the target of a two-month bidding war between GE, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Siemens.Alstom has over the past years suffered from weak orders for power equipment that hit its cash flow and credit ratings. But it agreed last month on a 12.4-billion-euro ($16.7 billion) deal that will see GE buy the bulk of that business while Alstom focuses on its better-performing rail arm. In a statement on Wednesday, Alstom said transport orders reached 4.8 billion euros in the first quarter of its fiscal year, helped by a 4-billion-euro contract in South Africa. Transport sales grew 17 percent on an organic basis.Quarterly sales in thermal and renewable power dropped 10 percent while sales in grid fell 5 percent. While the level of organic growth in transport ""should not be extrapolated"" over the full year, sales should grow at a ""sustained pace"" this year, mainly through the execution of a record backlog, Alstom said.The GE deal, which sparked a two-month tug-of-war with the French government, is expected to be submitted to shareholder approval by the end of this year and to close by mid-2015.Alstom plans to use the proceeds from the deal to pay off debt, strengthen its rail arm via acquisitions and return cash to shareholders, but it has not given details. Some analysts expect it to put aside around 2 billion euros for acquisitions and to return 2 billion to shareholders, via a special dividend or a share buyback.The government intervened in the deal to preserve jobs and ensure Alstom still had a future in the strategic power sector. As a result, three 50:50 joint ventures will be set up in electricity grid, renewable energy and nuclear power. Alstom will also buy GE's rail signalling unit to beef up its rail arm.

358,"   By Lynn Adler | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 8 GE Energy Financial Services (EFS), General Electric's energy investing business, expects to close Friday on the third in a growing stream of financings it has led for new gas-fired plants as U.S. environmental regulations steer power generation away from coal.EFS, through GE Capital Markets, led 14 other lenders providing $550 million in senior secured credit facilities backing construction of a natural gas-fired plant in Maryland for Competitive Power Ventures and its partners Marubeni Power and Toyota Tsusho.In addition to financing, the new plant will also use GE gas turbines and technology.The company declined to provide specific loan terms, other than that most are B to BB-plus credits and thus below investment grade.""With the shale gas revolution, and with EPA regulations changing such that many coal plants are out of favor and slated for decommissioning, you're starting to see new construction gas-fired projects gain traction in some parts of the country,"" Carl Peterson, EFS managing director and head of debt origination, said in an interview. EFS led or co-led $1.8 billion in financing for three new-build gas-fired plants over the past 12 months, driven by factors including the regulatory climate and shale gas revolution, he said. These were among the first major project financings for new gas-fired generation in the United States in at least five years.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants contribute to the shift from coal to natural gas. ""We might see half a dozen transactions like this a year in the short term,"" said Peterson. ""They didn't exist a couple of years ago. All three deals have been oversubscribed, and each deal gets more oversubscribed than the last deal.""EFS is growing while GE Capital as a whole is shrinking after the initial public offering of Synchrony, said EFS spokesman Andy Katell.GE's Synchrony, the largest private-label credit card provider in the United States, late last month raised $2.88 billion in the biggest U.S. IPO so far this year. ""There's a lot of liquidity in the system, a lot of interest in energy, more transparency in the power market and a hunger for yield, so you're seeing a lot of appetite in this space,"" said David Nason, CEO and president of EFS. ""This interest also introduces competitive pressures to the business.""In the project finance bank market, pricing has declined by about 75 basis points over the past year for most deals, lenders say.The two previous deals EFS participated in over the past year involved power plants in Newark and in Woodbridge, New Jersey.Stamford, Connecticut-based EFS holds about $16 billion in mainly North America-based investments.

367,"   By Mark Felsenthal and Susan Cornwell | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Aug 20 Business backers of the U.S. Export-Import Bank said on Wednesday they hope the institution's charter will be extended temporarily while Congress hashes out a longer-term reauthorization of the bank, which some lawmakers are bent on closing.Supporters said the bank's charter, which expires Sept. 30, could receive a short-term extension as part of a stop-gap government funding measure that lawmakers must pass before the end of the fiscal year.""We still have our fingers crossed that we might be able to get votes in both the House and Senate, but... more likely it will be a process that's going to extend,"" said John Hardy, president of the Coalition for Employment through Exports, a trade association that supports U.S. export agencies. ""It's not unusual, particularly these days, that a bill that has been as contentious as this one has required these sorts of extensions."" Since Congress is in session for only part of September, a short-term extension could give lawmakers more time - perhaps two or three months - to negotiate a reauthorization bill that could pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law by the president, Hardy told reporters on a conference call.One bill to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank has been introduced in the Democratic-controlled Senate while two other measures are being developed in the Republican-run House of Representatives. The bank, which provides loans to buyers of U.S. exports, has become a political flashpoint as conservative Republicans have singled it out as a government program that should not be renewed. Big beneficiaries of the bank are household names such as Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc and General Electric Co. The institution's detractors say the bank subsidizes big companies that don't need the help and puts taxpayers at risk.The Ex-Im Bank's charter renewal is in doubt despite backing from major business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Influential lawmakers such as new House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling - both Republicans - have said they favor letting the bank's charter expire. Representative Stephen Fincher, a Tennessee Republican, told reporters in July that he was working on a bill to reform the bank. A spokeswoman for Fincher said recently that he hoped to introduce his legislation soon after Congress returns in September, but she could not predict the exact timing.The spokeswoman, Elizabeth Lauten, said Fincher had spent much of August meeting other members of Congress, outside groups and businesses to discuss what would be the best reforms to the bank to make it ""more transparent, more accountable, and help create more jobs.""Jay Henderson, an official with the Coalition for Employment through Exports, said the group is trying to draw attention to businesses that benefit from the bank in regions of the country where lawmakers oppose renewing the charter. Target regions have included Indiana, North and South Carolina, and Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Florida, he said.

Industry rival Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), described by one source as a ""motivated"" bidder, could also participate in the final round of the auction, launched earlier this year by the Candiani family which wants to sell its majority stake.The sources said the binding offers could value the Italian company at more than 1 billion euros ($1.31 billion).The bidding process is complicated by the fact that another Italian family, the Lualdi, owns 40 percent of the company and is reluctant to sell.Petrolvalves, which was established in 1956 and generates the bulk of its revenues overseas, has set a deadline for binding offers towards the end of September in an attempt to sign a deal later this year, the sources said.U.S. firm General Electric could place a knockout bid and squeeze out Petrolvalves' minority shareholder, said two sources who cannot be named because the talks are private.General Electric took over the aerospace-parts business of Italy-based Avio for $4.3 billion last year.Petrolvalves expects core earnings of more than 70 million euros in 2014 and has about 300 million euros in cash, said a source familiar with the process.

Representatives of Petrolvalves, Emerson and CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL] were not immediately available for comment. General Electric, IMI and First Reserve declined to comment.ANOTHER FAMILY SAGA? The sale revolves around the Candiani family's plans to get out of the company after founder Mario Candiani died last year.

The Candianis are being advised on the sale by Banca Profilo, chaired by Arpe.The Lualdi, who are advised by Mediobanca, have been sounding out private equity appetite to submit a joint bid for the Candiani's stake, the sources said. But if a trade buyer were to offer an attractive price they would eventually sell, the same sources added.They said any rivalry between the Candiani and Lualdi families could be a problem, as this might deter some of the bidders who want to secure full control of Petrolvalves.When another Italian champion, Valvitalia, was auctioned off last year, international industry players including U.S.-based conglomerate Pentair (PNR.N) were interested. But in the end, Valvitalia's private equity owners had to turn their back on the industry bidders because the company's founder and minority shareholder succeeded in builing up his stake into a majority, with the support of Italy's state-backed private equity fund Fondo Strategico Italiano (FSI).""This could be another saga: private equity bidders and industry players are wary of investing in a business they can't fully control,"" said a source who cannot be named because the talks are private.Earlier this year, the Lualdi family entered into an agreement with London-based buyout fund Permira to study a joint bid but it has now expired, the sources said.

376,"   By Soyoung Kim and Sven Nordenstam | NEW YORK/STOCKHOLM  NEW YORK/STOCKHOLM Sweden's Electrolux AB is near a deal to buy General Electric Co's iconic appliance business for more than $2.5 billion, in a move that would significantly expand its reach in North America, people familiar with the matter said.The companies are hammering out final terms of a deal and could announce their agreement as soon as next week, the people said on Thursday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Shares of Electrolux jumped on news of a possible deal, rising 4.73 percent to 190.40 Swedish crowns and giving it a market capitalization of more than $8 billion.Discussions are ongoing and could still take longer to finalize, the people cautioned. Representatives for GE and Electrolux declined to comment.GE's century-old household appliance business, which along with lighting generated $8.3 billion in 2013 revenue, could help the Swedish appliance manufacturer expand beyond its core European market where growth has trailed that in North America.Electrolux, which sells under brands such as Frigidaire, AEG and Zanussi as well as its own name, is already the world's second-largest home appliance maker after Whirlpool Corp. GE had confirmed in August that it was evaluating strategic options for the home appliance business, including discussions with Electrolux and other interested parties.With a price tag of more than $2.5 billion, Electrolux appears to be paying top dollar to win the asset. The GE business, which sells products under the GE Monogram, GE Cafe and Hotpoint brands, could be worth between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, people familiar with the matter have previously said.The U.S. diversified conglomerate has revived efforts to divest the profitable, but low-margin unit as Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt seeks to exit businesses where GE is not a global leader and allocate resources to higher-growth businesses. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE put the business up for sale in 2008 but talks fizzled out in the face of the global recession. Immelt instead opted to invest $1 billion in new factories and products to make the business more competitive. Still, the unit is almost exclusively focused on the U.S. market and lacks global scale, and GE believes it could be more valuable when being part of a global appliances group such as Electrolux, said one person familiar with the divestiture plan.After suffering from weak economies and currencies in Europe and Brazil that cost cuts and improvement in the North American market could not offset, Electrolux has seen European demand start to recover this year, albeit it still lags North America. In 2013, western Europe accounted for 28 percent of group sales while North America represented 32 percent. Organic growth in North America was 7 percent while in Europe it was 0.4 percent.GE's Immelt is seeking to increase GE’s profit contribution from its industrial manufacturing businesses to 75 percent by 2016, up from about 55 percent last year, while reducing exposure to its finance arm.Toward that end, GE earlier this year struck a $16.9 billion deal to buy the power assets of France’s Alstom, and is exiting its North American consumer finance business.The U.S. conglomerate also wants to boost its industrial profit margin to 17 percent by 2016, up from 15.7 percent last year, as it seeks to simplify its operations and cut costs.

377,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co's fast-growing oil and gas business that supplies equipment and services is improving profit margins and is well-placed to outpace industry growth over the next several years, a top unit executive said in an interview.Spurred by $14 billion in acquisitions since 2007, the oil division's revenue has risen 75 percent to $17 billion since 2009, making it the U.S. conglomerate's fastest-growing industrial business in that period.But its 12.8 percent profit margin last year trailed by several percentage points GE's other major industrial businesses, such as aviation and healthcare, and GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt is seeking to improve the company's overall industrial margin from 15.7 percent last year to 17 percent by 2016.The unit's profitability is likely to be a prime topic for analysts and investors on Wednesday, when GE holds a half-day presentation in New York on its oil and gas business.""We're driving profitability up for this business as we look into the '14 time frame and as we look into the strategic plan we lay out for the next three years,"" said Rafael Santana, president of GE's turbomachinery solutions division, the largest business within oil and gas. The oil and gas unit will be a ""key part"" of driving toward Immelt's profit margin target for the whole company, Santana said on Friday. To improve margins, the unit is cutting costs by becoming more productive, while trying to develop products for which it can charge a higher price.For example, GE reduced the weight and footprint of an off-shore power generation product by 20 percent, allowing GE to charge a premium because the smaller product is more desirable to customers, Santana said.The analyst meeting next week is the first intensive review for investors that GE has held specifically for the oil and gas sector, whose results it began reporting separately in 2012. The business offers equipment and services to oil and gas exploration companies, including oil-field pumps, sub-sea drilling equipment, compressors and wellhead bores. Speaking to Reuters ahead of the meeting, Santana said one key message executives will convey is that GE's oil and gas business is poised to outpace broader market growth of 6 percent to 8 percent a year.""When we look at the industry ... we see the opportunity for us to grow beyond those numbers,"" Santana said, citing the breadth of GE's portfolio. For 2014, Santana said, the unit is on track to reach GE's target set in December for profit and revenue growth of at least 10 percent.Santana said the company can ""definitely drive growth organically"" rather than through further acquisitions.Asked whether GE will maintain its level of deal-making in the oil and gas sector, Santana said: ""We feel very good about the portfolio we have built. But if opportunities arise, we'll be looking.""

378,"   By Simon Johnson and Sven Nordenstam | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Sweden's Electrolux AB (ELUXb.ST) said on Monday it would double U.S. sales by paying $3.3 billion in cash for General Electric Co's (GE.N) appliances business in its biggest ever deal, giving it the scale to go head-to-head with larger rival Whirlpool (WHR.N).GE's century-old household appliance business, which had $5.7 billion in 2013 revenue, could help the Swedish company expand beyond its core European market, where growth has trailed that in North America.Electrolux, the world's second-largest appliance maker by sales, will see its annual sales in North America more than double to over $10 billion, similar in size to Whirlpool's sales there. It also gets to keep the iconic GE Appliance brands.The GE unit sells refrigerators, stoves, air conditioners and water heaters under the GE Monogram, GE Cafe and Hotpoint brands.""I think it's a historic event for Electrolux. I'm very excited about it. I think the fit - the strategic fit, the industrial logic - is compelling,"" Electrolux Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin told Reuters.While the price tag is higher than the $2 billion to $2.5 billion figure that some people familiar with the business had estimated, analysts said the company was not overpaying.

384,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co (GE.N) avoided using a geared design for its new engine for narrowbody jets because of concerns about weight and reliability, said a top GE executive on Monday as it battles with rival Pratt & Whitney for billions of dollars in engine orders.Pratt, part of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), developed a geared turbofan that relies on a gearbox and lets the front fan operate at a different speed than the rest of the engine, while on GE's traditionally configured engines the fans run at the same speed.Speaking at a Morgan Stanley investor conference, GE Chief Technology Officer Mark Little said the company had ""considered a geared approach ... and we chose very consciously not to take that approach.""""Some other application someday, maybe, but not for this one,"" Little said at the conference in Dana Point, California, that was broadcast over the Internet.Through its joint venture called CFM with France's Safran (SAF.PA), GE is competing against Pratt for airline and other customers that choose Airbus' (AIR.PA) new A320neo single-aisle plane. Both engines promise significant fuel savings over older models, and Airbus buyers can choose the Pratt or CFM engine.     CFM's LEAP, among other improvements, uses new materials designed to reduce weight and add durability.""We thought that the addition of the extra component would add reliability and weight challenges, and durability challenges that we could avoid by going the path we went,"" Little said.""We like the bet that we've made,"" Little said. In response to Little's comments, Pratt & Whitney spokeswoman Sara Banda said: ""We are confident in our PurePower Geared Turbofan engine technology and this is not just us saying this,"" noting that in addition to Airbus, four other aircraft makers have selected the GTF, including Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO).Pratt has completed more than 10,000 hours of testing for the GTF engine family, Banda said in an email, after 20 years of research and $1 billion invested into developing the engine.Barry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas Inc, told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense summit last week that of A320neo customers, so far about one-third have chosen the LEAP, one-third have selected the GTF, while one-third remain undecided. Pratt has had a smaller presence among commercial engines in recent years, so the GTF engine is its bid to return to prominence. By contrast, CFM has been the dominant engine on the narrowbody planes, including capturing a major portion of the new narrow-body market because it is the sole engine on Boeing Co's (BA.N) 737 MAX. The geared engine architecture won a vote of confidence in February, when Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR.L) also said it was pursuing such an approach for its future engines.Airbus has said the first A320neo flight, which will use Pratt's GTF engine, is expected sometime this month.

386,"  (Adds GE's interest to make a bid, updates share price)FRANKFURT, Sept 19 General Electric Co  and Germany's Siemens are considering bids for compressor and turbine maker Dresser-Rand that could derail a merger between Dresser-Rand and Swiss pump maker Sulzer , according to media reports.The Financial Times and Bloomberg reported that Siemens' supervisory board may vote on whether to table a bid at a meeting next week, with Bloomberg citing an offer of more than $85 a share. (bloom.bg/XtD1jq)General Electric, which has been in talks with Dresser-Rand, is also considering whether to make a bid, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times. (on.ft.com/1tzUwLM)Siemens and General Electric declined to comment. Sulzer's biggest shareholder, Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg's Renova Group, said in a statement on Friday it held a 4.99 percent stake in Dresser-Rand. It said it did not intend to comment further.Shares in Sulzer, whose chairman is former Siemens Chief Executive Peter Loescher, closed down 4.3 percent on fears that a move from Siemens could derail its plans for a merger with Dresser-Rand.Asked about a potential Siemens bid for Dresser, a Sulzer spokeswoman said: ""This isn't something we would like to comment on. As we have said before we are in non-exclusive negotiations (with Dresser-Rand). This means that for both parties other options are not excluded."" Germany's Manager Magazin first reported on Friday that Siemens could offer more than $6.1 billion, or $80 per share, for Dresser-Rand.Dresser-Rand has been rumored as a takeover target for large industrial companies such as Siemens in recent months. While Siemens has been working with advisers to assess a potential bid for years, it has not made a takeover offer for the company, people familiar with the matter said.Sulzer, and other suppliers of pumps and valves for mining, oil and construction firms, are considered ripe for consolidation. Scotland's Weir Group, for example, tried to buy rival Metso but the deal fell apart over price.A merger with Sulzer would combine Dresser-Rand's compressors and turbines serving the oil and gas industry with Sulzer's industrial pumps, giving the enlarged group a bigger footprint at a time when a North American drilling boom is boosting demand for energy services and equipment.Dresser-Rand shares closed 9.5 percent higher at $79.91 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The stock has risen 18 percent in the last three trading sessions after Sulzer said it was in talks to buy the company.   (Reporting by Georgina Prodhan.

That compares with a Friday closing price of $79.91, which was up 27 percent over the past three months on takeover speculation.Within minutes of that statement, it also announced the sale of its 50 percent stake in BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete GmbH to joint venture partner Robert Bosch GmbH for 3 billion euros ($3.85 billion), ending their more than 45 year alliance in household appliances. ""As the premium brand in the global energy infrastructure markets, Dresser-Rand is a perfect fit for the Siemens portfolio. The combined activities will create a world-class provider for the growing oil and gas markets,"" Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said in a statement on Monday.Reuters reported on Sunday that the companies were nearing a deal.The German industrial conglomerate had long coveted Dresser-Rand, which would help it grow its oil and gas business at a time when a North American fracking boom is boosting demand for energy equipment.But it shrank in the past from making a formal bid, balking at its high valuation. Dresser-Rand trades at 24.6 times 12 month forward earnings, a 60 percent premium to its peers in oil and gas equipment and services, according to Reuters data. CEO Kaeser said in July the company planned to focus on restructuring rather than acquisitions for the moment, but would have the financial firepower for the right acquisition target. Cash reserves stood at 8.21 billion euros at the end of June.Siemens is targeting more than 150 million euros in annual synergies by 2019 from the transaction, which complements Siemens's market position in turbo compressors, downstream and industrial applications as well as larger-sized steam turbines.Siemens expects to close the Dresser-Rand deal by summer 2015, while it aims to wrap up the sale of its stake in household appliance venture BSH with Bosch in first half of 2015.BSH will pay out 250 million euros to each of its owners Bosch and Siemens before the transaction is completed. Siemens has trumped a competing offer for Dresser-Rand from Swiss pump maker Sulzer AG, which had proposed an all-stock merger, according to people familiar with the matter.Sulzer's chairman is former Siemens CEO Peter Loescher, who Kaeser replaced in a boardroom coup last year.But other rival bidders may be lurking. General Electric  was considering whether to make a bid, the Financial Times cited people familiar with the matter as saying on Friday. (on.ft.com/1tzUwLM)Any GE involvement would mean their archrivalry picking up steam again. Siemens lost out to GE in a fierce bidding tussle over Alstom's energy business in June.The Dresser-Rand deal would eclipse Siemens acquisitions over recent year.

388,"  * Bids $83 per share in agreed deal* Sulzer withdraws from contest* Sells stake in household appliance JV for 3 bln euros* Siemens shares down 0.4 percent   (Adds financial, legal advisers in last paragraph)By Georgina Prodhan and Ludwig BurgerFRANKFURT, Sept 22 Germany's Siemens AG  has agreed to buy U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc for $7.6 billion in cash, paying a relatively rich price to belatedly beef up its presence in the U.S. shale oil and gas industry.The acquisition, which ranks among the biggest in the history of the industrial group, will strengthen Siemens' position in the United States, its weakest region, and bring it nearer catching up with rival General Electric Co.Siemens' oil and gas revenue will increase to around $11 billion, including the acquisition of Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc's  energy gas turbine and compressor business, announced in May, from less than $7 billion before the two deals.Analysts saw the deal - which coincided with another major German buy in the United States, Merck KGaA's agreed purchase of Sigma-Aldrich Corp, as strategic, but said the price looked high.It gave Dresser-Rand an enterprise value of about 16 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), about twice that of its peers.""Siemens has largely missed out on the U.S. oil & gas ... boom over the past years,"" JPMorgan capital goods analyst Andreas Willi wrote in a note on Monday. ""Siemens' increase in exposure comes potentially late in the cycle and value creation from this deal may have to depend very much on execution.""GE has spent $14 billion on acquisitions in the oil and gas field since 2007 and has built up a business there worth about $17 billion. Siemens shares closed down 0.4 percent at 95.97 euros, broadly in line with European blue-chip stocks as a whole .Siemens Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser denied Siemens was pushed into bidding for Dresser-Rand because the U.S. group was about to agree a merger with Swiss pump maker Sulzer AG , whose Chairman Peter Loescher is a former Siemens CEO whom Kaeser ousted.Sulzer said on Monday it had ended talks with Dresser-Rand.Siemens said its $83 per share bid was unanimously supported by Dresser-Rand's board of directors. While GE had also made contact with Dresser-Rand, it is unlikely the company would now pursue a bid, a person familiar with the matter said.The offer was 32 percent above Dresser-Rand's six-month average share price. Dresser-Rand had closed on Friday at $79.91, buoyed by weeks of takeover speculation. Brian Langenberg, an analyst at Langenberg & Co, said Dresser was a good asset and arch-rival GE ""should at least make sure Siemens is paying a full price."" He added: ""There may not be anything more to do here, but if there's something to do, GE would try it.""GE in June beat Siemens in a bidding war for the energy business of France's Alstom in a $16.9 billion deal.SLOWING GROWTH Annual capital expenditure on oil, gas and coal equipment has more than doubled in real terms since 2000 and surpassed $950 billion in 2013, according to the International Energy Agency. But JPMorgan estimated spending growth would slow to 4.7 percent this year and could decline in 2015. Kaeser said Siemens' investment would pay off in the long term and said Dresser-Rand's large client base and the fact that half its sales are in high-margin services meant it would contribute to profits from day one.""This industry does not count by quarter or year. This counts for a long period of time,"" he told analysts and journalists on a conference call. ""We do agree the price has been on the high side but, then again, it matters more what value we created.""Unconventional gas, including shale and ""tight"" gas, already accounts for about 60 percent of production in the United States, where it is driving a wave of reindustrialision as the country approaches energy independence.In Europe, where Siemens makes most of its sales, governments have eschewed shale gas exploration for environmental reasons and traditional power providers are suffering from weak demand and energy policy upheaval.Siemens embarked on a corporate overhaul in May dubbed ""Vision 2020,"" seeking to make up ground on more profitable competitors such as Switzerland's ABB Ltd as well as GE, while reducing its exposure to more cyclical consumer businesses where it has had limited success.As part of that drive, Siemens said it had also agreed to sell its stake in household appliances joint venture BSH to partner Robert Bosch, bringing in 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) to help finance the Dresser-Rand deal.The group said it expects to close the deal by summer 2015 and aims to wrap up the sale of its BSH stake in the first half of 2015, ending a more than 45-year alliance in household appliances.Siemens has had a chequered history in consumer markets. It sold its mobile phone business last decade, which later went bust. It exited the Fujitsu Siemens Computers joint venture in 2009 and spun off light-bulb maker Osram in 2013.BSH will pay out 250 million euros to each of its owners before the transaction is completed.Goldman Sachs Group, Deutsche Bank and Lazard Ltd advised Siemens on the Dresser-Rand transaction, while Latham & Watkins served as legal adviser. Morgan Stanley and Zaoui & Co acted as financial advisors to Dresser-Rand, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP were legal counsel.

402,"   By Natalie Huet | BERLIN  BERLIN (Story corrects Sept. 23 story in seventh paragraph that Siemens acquired Invensys Rail, not Invensys)Alstom's (ALSO.PA) purchase of General Electric's (GE.N) rail signaling unit is ""a fantastic deal"" for the French train maker, which will continue to seek acquisitions in this field, the head of Alstom Transport said on Tuesday.Alstom, which also makes turbines for power plants, agreed in June on a 12.4 billion euro ($16 billion) deal that will involve GE buying the bulk of its energy business while it focuses on its better-performing rail arm. The move had sparked a two-month tug-of-war with the French government, which feared for its national industry and only gave its blessing to the deal after it secured sweeteners - including the signaling acquisition - as well as an option to take a stake of up to 20 percent in Alstom. The power deal and the signaling deal are expected to both be completed at the same time, in the second quarter of next year, Henri Poupart-Lafarge told reporters at the InnoTrans biennial rail trade fair in Berlin.

""We will have a solid balance sheet that will allow us to fund the acquisitions we want to make,"" Poupart-Lafarge said, declining to give any figures but adding that the group would also consider joint ventures.The government taking a stake would be ""a good thing, that stabilizes Alstom"", he said, adding that in the long run, he would also welcome other industrial shareholders.For instance, Alstom could see its Russian partner Transmashholding, in which it holds a 25 percent stake, take a stake in Alstom in return, he said.The recent tensions between Russia and the West over the fate of Ukraine have not affected the companies' day-to-day operations, but they are closely monitoring the situation and hope it will ease, he said.

407,"   By Daniel Kelley | PHILADELPHIA  PHILADELPHIA Retired NFL players who sued the league over on-the-field concussions have overwhelmingly accepted a multimillion-dollar settlement despite serious misgivings about some of the terms, lawyers representing the players said on Tuesday.  Tuesday marked the deadline for players to agree to opt out or object to the terms of the settlement, before a Nov. 19 fairness hearing in the case.""The deal has overwhelming support of the player community,"" said Christopher Seeger, the lead lawyer representing retired players.U.S. District Judge Anita Brody granted preliminary approval to the deal in June after the NFL agreed to remove a $675 million cap on payments. Brody refused to sign off on the earlier deal because she worried the money set aside by the NFL would be insufficient.Under the revised terms, payments of up to $5 million will be guaranteed to any retired player who develops the neurological impairments, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, widely known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. Payments will be based on a formula that considers years played in the league and the players' age at diagnosis. The fund is set to last 65 years from when it is authorized.""It is nowhere near the deal it should be,"" Jason Luckasevic, an attorney who filed the first concussion case against the NFL, told Reuters.Despite the concerns, Luckasevic estimated that only two dozen of his 525 clients would opt out of the deal, freeing them to sue the NFL on their own. Despite the widespread acceptance, there remain pockets of serious concern.One group of players has asked to modify the deal, arguing it arbitrarily cuts off payments to those who are diagnosed with a condition known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, which is caused by repeated blows to the head and can lead to aggression and dementia.Under the current deal, the NFL will pay $4 million to the families of men who died from CTE before July 7, 2014. Those diagnosed afterward receive nothing. ""It makes no sense,"" Steven Molo, a lawyer representing seven former players or their families, said of the CTE issue. ""There's a whole group of people being excluded from any meaningful benefit.""The ability to diagnose CTE before a patient dies is only an emerging science.The settlement will affect about 20,000 retired NFL players, but analysts estimate that just 12,500 will participate.

409,"  (Adds details, background)Oct 13 General Electric Co's aircraft leasing unit announced plans on Monday to buy Dublin-based helicopter leasing company Milestone Aviation Group for $1.78 billion, branching out into an area tipped for solid growth in coming years.Milestone, co-founded by NetJets Inc founder Richard Santulli in 2010, owns a fleet of helicopters worth $2.8 billion and has placed orders worth $3 billion.The company's helicopters are primarily used in offshore oil and gas industries and for search, rescue and emergency medical services.""The addition of Milestone will deepen our domain expertise in aviation and oil and gas, two critical GE industries,"" GE Capital Chief Executive Keith Sherin said in a statement on Monday.The move confirms plans first outlined in March, when the head of GE Capital's aviation arm told Reuters in an exclusive interview that it could spend some $2 billion on diversifying into helicopter leasing and as much again on shipping. The world's largest aircraft lessor aims to carry out the diversification partly because of concerns over the value of some current-generation jets, Norman Liu, chief executive of GE Capital Aviation Services, said in the interview.The acquisition also, however, comes at a time when GE is trying to reduce exposure to financing and increase profits from its industrial businesses. GE CEO Jeff Immelt has said he planned to boost earnings contribution from the company's industrials businesses to 75 percent by 2016 from 55 percent last year.The company spun off its North American private label credit card business, Synchrony Financial, earlier this year.The Milestone transaction is expected to close next year. Leasing has long been an integral part of the passenger jet industry, accounting directly or indirectly for up to 40 percent of the aircraft delivered from Airbus or Boeing  factories.Now, the leasing model is increasingly taking hold in the helicopter industry, with leasing firms attracted by the flexibility of the machines and their tendency to hold their value, according to U.K.-based consultancy Ascend Flightglobal.Airbus Helicopters, formerly known as Eurocopter, the world's largest maker of civil helicopters, predicted earlier this year that leasing was set for expansion in the sector.The diversity of roles served by helicopters and a sustained period of high oil prices mean that they have not been as exposed as many industries to the global economic slowdown, Ascend said in a published report earlier this year.

The drop follows worries over the health of the global economy, the spread of the Ebola virus, as well as factors including lower oil prices and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's next steps. However, the broad index this week steered clear of correction territory, a 10-percent drop from its high.Friday's earnings offset some of the concerns about the impact of weak global demand on U.S. corporations. Honeywell  shares gained 4.3 percent to $90.06 after results.  General Electric shares rose 2.4 percent to $24.82 on its earnings.The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day percentage gain since Oct. 8 and some investors said the recent selloff may have run its course.""This should be it. The market should do well once we get by some of these geopolitical risks that are on top of us right now, the Ebola thing and the mid-cycle elections,"" said Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston, which oversees more than $11.3 billion.

434,"   By Marcin Goettig and Anna Koper | WARSAW  WARSAW Nov 5 Potential bidders for Poland's Bank BPH, which General Electric is looking to sell, will be turned down unless they meet rigorous credit rating standards, the country's financial watchdog said.GE said last month it is considering selling its near 90 percent stake in Poland's 10th biggest bank by assets as part of a shift away from finance and towards industry.In response, the head of financial supervisor KNF, Andrzej Jakubiak, said potential buyers should hold a debt rating at least equal to that of GE, which is pegged at AA+ by Standard & Poor's - much higher than Poland's A- sovereign rating.His deputy Wojciech Kwasniak denied on Wednesday that the bar had been set too high. ""This is a problem of GE, not of the supervisor,"" he told Reuters in an interview.He said it was unlikely that any bank already operating in Poland would get the KNF's approval to take over Bank BPH. Kwasniak said this was due to Bank BPH's structural risks tied to its relatively large foreign currency loan portfolio, currently covered by the potential of support from GE.""We have always said that from the point of view of banking supervision ... it is extremely important in conditions of  unstable financial markets, and this is still the case, not to swap better investors for inferior ones,"" Kwasniak said.On Tuesday, Moody's cut Bank BPH's long-term deposit rating and said it could cut it further following GE's announcement. NO SWISS FRANC LOAN RISK  Kwasniak also said GE had not fulfilled all the commitments it made to the KNF in relation to Bank BPH. He gave no details.""As a result we are referring to an uncertain state, where there is no decision (from GE) regarding the final plan,"" Kwasniak said.Kwasniak said that when Rabobank wanted to exit from its investment in Bank BGZ it had to find an investor with a similar rating.Turning to Swiss franc-denominated foreign currency loans, Kwasniak said they did not pose serious risks to Poland's banking system as the share of such credit that had gone sour had stabilised at about 3 percent.Franc-denominated mortgages account for about 8 percent of Poland's GDP. Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz had asked her economic council to look into the banking sector's resilience to a potential strengthening of the franc, the council's head Jan Krzysztof Bielecki said last week.

436,"  PARIS France's Alstom (ALSO.PA), which is selling most of its energy equipment business to General Electric (GE.N), said it expects its remaining rail arm to grow and generate cash this year after registering record orders in the first half.Over the medium term, the engineering group said it expects sales at the ""new Alstom"" to grow over 5 percent per year like-for-like and its operating margin to gradually improve within a 5 to 7 percent range.Alstom said in a statement that it would hold a shareholder meeting on Dec. 19 to approve the 12.4 billion euro ($15.55 billion) deal with General Electric (GE.N), which won the green light from French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday.""The project with General Electric is progressing well,"" said Chief Executive Officer Patrick Kron. The level of cash to be returned to shareholders from the deal, as well as the group's targeted balance sheet once it refocuses on its smaller transport arm, will be communicated ahead of the meeting, Kron added.Some analysts expect Alstom to put aside around 2 billion euros for rail acquisitions and return 2 billion to shareholders via a special dividend or share buyback. Alstom has suffered from weak orders for power equipment since the 2008 economic crisis that hit its cash flow and credit ratings.But when it agreed earlier this year to sell the cash-burning business to bigger U.S. rival GE, the news sparked a two-month tug-of-war with a French government worried about losing an industry champion.The government intervened in the deal to preserve jobs and ensure Alstom still had a future in the strategic power sector. After tough negotiations, GE agreed to set up three 50:50 joint ventures in electricity grids, renewable energy and nuclear power. Alstom will in return buy GE's rail signaling unit to beef up its rail arm, while the government secured an option to become Alstom's top shareholder with up to 20 percent.Alstom on Wednesday forecast ""high single-digit"" percentage growth in sales and positive operating free cash flow for the year to March 31 after revenue rose 13 percent in the first half of its fiscal year.Alstom won 6.4 billion euros of orders in the six-month period, more than twice the level of the same period a year ago, helped by a 4 billion euro rail contract in South Africa. First-half sales reached 3.1 billion euros. Its operating margin, at 5 percent after corporate costs, improved by 30 basis points, helped by tight cost control, Alstom said.

437,"  * Meeting on Dec. 19 to give shareholders say on GE deal* Alstom will detail use of cash ahead of meeting* H1 transport sales rose 13 pct to 3.1 bln eur* Op margin improved in transport to 5 pct   (Adds detail, background)PARIS, Nov 5 France's Alstom, which is selling most of its energy equipment business to General Electric, said it expects its remaining rail arm to grow and generate cash this year after registering record orders in the first half.Over the medium term, the engineering group said it expects sales at the ""new Alstom"" to grow over 5 percent per year like-for-like and its operating margin to gradually improve within a 5 to 7 percent range.Alstom said in a statement that it would hold a shareholder meeting on Dec. 19 to approve the 12.4 billion euro ($15.55 billion) deal with General Electric, which won the green light from French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday. ""The project with General Electric is progressing well,"" said Chief Executive Officer Patrick Kron.The level of cash to be returned to shareholders from the deal, as well as the group's targeted balance sheet once it refocuses on its smaller transport arm, will be communicated ahead of the meeting, Kron added.Some analysts expect Alstom to put aside around 2 billion euros for rail acquisitions and return 2 billion to shareholders via a special dividend or share buyback. Alstom has suffered from weak orders for power equipment since the 2008 economic crisis that hit its cash flow and credit ratings.But when it agreed earlier this year to sell the cash-burning business to bigger U.S. rival GE, the news sparked a two-month tug-of-war with a French government worried about losing an industry champion.The government intervened in the deal to preserve jobs and ensure Alstom still had a future in the strategic power sector. After tough negotiations, GE agreed to set up three 50:50 joint ventures in electricity grids, renewable energy and nuclear power. Alstom will in return buy GE's rail signalling unit to beef up its rail arm, while the government secured an option to become Alstom's top shareholder with up to 20 percent.Alstom on Wednesday forecast ""high single-digit"" percentage growth in sales and positive operating free cash flow for the year to March 31 after revenue rose 13 percent in the first half of its fiscal year.Alstom won 6.4 billion euros of orders in the six-month period, more than twice the level of the same period a year ago, helped by a 4 billion euro rail contract in South Africa. First-half sales reached 3.1 billion euros.Its operating margin, at 5 percent after corporate costs, improved by 30 basis points, helped by tight cost control, Alstom said. The transport activities posted an 85 million cash outflow - compared with a 1 billion outflow for the power arm.Alstom excluded activities being sold to GE in its orders, sales and operating income figures.

439,"  NAIROBI Nov 6 General Electric (GE)  plans to begin construction of a 100 MW wind power farm in Kenya early next year and expects it to be up and running within 18 months after that, a company executive said on Thursday.Kenya is pushing to expand its power generation capacity by 5,000 MW by 2017 from about 1,700 MW now to reduce tariffs, tackle power shortages and cut costs of doing business. It plans to do this by tapping renewable source like wind and geothermal energy. The GE wind power project, which will cost about $300 million to build, is located in the Kipeto area of Kajiado county in the Rift Valley. George Njenga, head of GE's distributed power business in sub-Saharan Africa, told reporters that construction would begin almost immediately after financial details are finalised in early 2015, and that the farm would begin supplying power to the grid 12-18 months later. ""Eighteen months is a safe date,"" he said. Other investors in the project include the World Bank's investment arm International Finance Corporation and Kenyan renewable energy company Craftskills Wind Energy International Limited. The project is also expected to get financing from the U.S. government's Power Africa programme.

444,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co (GE.N) expects developing markets to be a ""huge engine"" of growth due to demand for the company's products that provide infrastructure in these countries, GE's top international executive said on Wednesday.GE, which is increasingly focused on industrial products such as jet engines, power turbines and oil and gas equipment, should see double-digit percentage increases in orders in developing countries for the ""foreseeable future,"" said John Rice, vice chairman and president of GE's global growth organization.""We should continue to grow at double-digit rates in those growth markets, even with a global economy that's kind of inching along,"" Rice said in an interview at GE's New York offices. ""We think that there is still a significant pent-up demand for infrastructure.""Rice pointed to near-term opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa, where infrastructure needs are great, and in India, ""where we have played beneath our weight over the last 20 years."" India's new government and GE's pending acquisition of  power assets of France's Alstom (ALSO.PA), which has a significant presence in the country, ""gives us a completely different game today,"" Rice said.GE is shifting more toward industrial operations while shrinking its finance business and shedding non-core units such as appliances. Rice, a 36-year GE veteran, said in the past investors would question why the company was in businesses such as plastics or media.""When we talk about a focus on infrastructure and that being the predominant thing that we do, they can see that,"" Rice said. ""They have more clarity than they've had in our 130-year history."" The $16.9 billion Alstom deal stands to give a major boost to GE's aims as an infrastructure company, but to keep building that focus, ""I don't think it's a lot of M&A,"" Rice said.""We’re going to look for selective opportunities in our other businesses, and oil & gas is a place where we’ve said we would spend more, but it will be on a selective basis."" Despite the size of the Alstom deal, GE shares are little changed since terms were finalized in late June. ""When you look at Alstom, it's big, the operating performance hasn't been great,"" Rice said.

""The board wishes to ensure a solid financial structure for the group in order to address future operational needs and support its development,"" the company said in the statement.Alstom is best known for making France's high-speed TGV trains but it also makes turbines for power plants.

449,"   By Daniel Kelley | PHILADELPHIA  PHILADELPHIA Lawyers for the NFL and a class of retired players defended a proposed multimillion-dollar settlement for concussions sustained while playing football during a court hearing on Wednesday, while critics called the deal inadequate.Most of the 20,000 former players involved in the class-action lawsuit back the deal, which provides payments of up to $5 million to those with the most serious neurological impairments.U.S. District Judge Anita Brody, who granted preliminary approval to the deal in June after the National Football League agreed to remove a $675 million cap on payments, presided over the daylong hearing and will decide if the settlement is fair.Brody can approve the deal, demand revisions, or reject it, which would require the lawyers to rework it from a blank slate.Brad Karp, a lawyer representing the NFL, said the settlement provided prompt payments to players while avoiding costly litigation that could last years and might leave players empty-handed. ""The league could have fought these claims, in my view, for many, many years,"" Karp said.The deal has its critics, in part, over how it treats players with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, one of the most common neurological disorders suffered by football players.The proposed settlement calls for the NFL to pay $4 million to the families of those who died from CTE before July 7, 2014. Those diagnosed afterward would receive nothing. Steven Molo, who represents a group of players who oppose the deal, said the settlement released the NFL from potentially billions of dollars in claims without acknowledging when it knew about the possibly life-altering danger of concussions.He also faulted the settlement for failing to cover future CTE deaths.Chris Seeger, the lead lawyer for players who want the deal approved, said objections based on CTE compensation had been misleading. Seeger said the settlement ""maybe isn't perfect but it is really good and clearly fair.""Former Indianapolis Colts tight end Ben Utecht was the only former player to speak at the hearing. Utecht played with the Colts during their 2006 Super Bowl win but left the game after getting knocked unconscious in training camp.Utecht feared the 65-year settlement could run out of money before he collected. “I'm 33 years old, and I suffer from memory problems,” he said.

Blackstone earlier this year bought warehouses and development land in the U.S. from GE Real Estate. Last year Blackstone bought apartment buildings containing about 30,000 units located in the U.S. in a deal worth more than $2 billion.Blackstone's latest transaction is the largest property acquisition this year in Japan, topping Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte's purchase of an office tower in the prime business district in Tokyo for about 170 billion yen. The number of large property transactions has increased this year as Japan's market is accelerating its recovery.

470,"  * Settlement could come as early as next week -BBG* Alstom doesn't comment on ongoing proceedings* Alstom to sell most of struggling power arm to GEPARIS, Dec 16 Alstom is close to settling a bribery case with the U.S. Justice Department for $700 million, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.A settlement could be announced as early as next week, the newswire service added. An Alstom spokeswoman said the company does not comment on ongoing proceedings. The Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment.The Justice Department has evidence that a former Alstom executive tried to bribe officials to secure power projects in Indonesia, India and China, according to court filings seen by Reuters earlier this year.Alstom's power turbines unit has been under pressure over the past year, hit by a drop in orders, a cash crunch and the threat of hefty fines from several bribery probes. Alstom agreed in June to sell most of that power business to General Electric to focus instead on its smaller rail arm. The deal will be put to the vote of Alstom shareholders on Friday and is expected to close in the first half of 2015.The U.S. probe into Alstom initially focused on a $118 million contract to provide services at a power plant on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The contract, known as the Tarahan project and completed in 2007, was part of a joint venture between Alstom and Japan's Marubeni Corp. In March, Marubeni pleaded guilty to paying bribes to win that project and was fined $88 million.In July, a former vice president of Alstom's U.S. unit, William Pomponi, pleaded guilty over his own role in the scheme.Prosecutors accused him and other Alstom executives of bribing an Indonesian lawmaker and members of the state-owned electricity company to get their help in securing the contract. They concealed the bribes through payments to two purported consultants, prosecutors said.(Reporting by Natalie Huet in Paris and Aruna Viswanatha in Washington; editing by Keith Weir)",2014-12-16,GE,"Tue Dec 16, 2014 | 9:56am EST",Alstom nearing $700 mln U.S. bribery settlement -Bloomberg,http://www.reuters.com//article/alstom-bribery-idUSL6N0U03CK20141216?type=companyNews

475,"  * Shareholders back the GE deal with 99.2 pct of votes* DoJ to ask Alstom, not GE, to bear any bribery fine* Alstom shares close down 3.9 percent   (Adds closing price, CEO comments about overcapacity, share award)By Natalie Huet and Benjamin MalletPARIS, Dec 19 Engineering group Alstom  unsettled investors on Friday by saying it will not be able to transfer to General Electric a looming U.S. fine over bribery allegations.The French firm is selling most of its power businesses to the U.S. industrial conglomerate for 12.35 billion euros  ($15.15 billion) and transferring their liabilities as part of the package. Alstom investors had assumed that meant any related bribery costs would be GE's.A person close to the matter last week put the likely settlement at $700 million to cover claims Alstom bribed officials to secure power equipment contracts in Indonesia, India and China.That would make it the largest criminal fine levied by the United States for foreign bribery.Speaking at an extraordinary shareholders meeting at which over 99 percent approved the deal, Kron said the settlement talks were in the final stages and broke the news that Alstom, not GE, would probably foot the bill. ""If a settlement is found, which we expect in the near future, the (U.S.) Department of Justice is likely to require that any fine remains the liability of Alstom and cannot even partly be transferred to GE,"" he said.Shares in Alstom closed 3.88 percent lower on the news.Kron did not put a figure on the likely fine but said the impact would be mitigated by new positive adjustments to the deal, including fees GE will pay to use the Alstom brand.As a result, the overall negative impact would be around 1-2 percent of the deal, he said. That would amount to a hit of as much as 247 million euros.Alstom is also the target of an investigation in Britain over claims it paid bribes to win transport contracts in India, Poland and Tunisia.Under the GE deal, set to close by mid-2015, GE will buy most of Alstom's power turbine and grid businesses leaving it focused mainly on building trains and railway equipment.""Alstom Transport is a solid and viable company, with a 4-5 year order book,"" Kron said on French radio. But he added that Alstom's Belfort site had a problem of overcapacity.GE and Alstom will also set up three GE-controlled joint ventures in nuclear power, electricity grids and renewable energy, and GE will sell its rail signaling unit to Alstom.These adjuncts are designed to soothe government worries about control over French engineering know-how.Kron reaffirmed that Alstom could return up to 4 billion euros in cash to shareholders from the proceeds.Asked by French radio why he will receive some 150,000 Alstom shares -- worth 4 million euros at current prices -- when he leaves Alstom in a few months, Kron said the award was in line with ""good practices"".""Ask the board, they approved it,"" he said.($1 = 0.8153 euros)   (Additional reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Andrew Callus and Mark Potter)",2014-12-19,GE,"Fri Dec 19, 2014 | 2:03pm EST",UPDATE 2-Alstom to absorb U.S. bribery fine despite GE sale,http://www.reuters.com//article/alstom-ma-us-bribery-idUSL6N0U32CY20141219?type=companyNews

492,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  For massive conglomerate General Electric Co (GE.N), the plunge in oil prices stands to both help and hurt. On Friday, investors could find in GE's fourth-quarter report whether the pain has started to overtake the gain.     On the upside, cheap oil holds some promise if it helps GE's customers in aviation, transportation and other businesses to prosper, or if sustained low energy costs give the broader economy a boost.But there could be major problems for GE's business that supplies equipment and services to oil and gas companies. Since 2007, GE has invested $14 billion in this once-fast-growing unit through acquisitions.GE on Friday could reveal more about the extent of the fallout from low prices on its oil business, and any new silver linings.""We recognize that lower oil prices will affect this business, but no one knows how much yet,"" said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital, which holds about 1 million GE shares.The drop in oil has already pressured GE's share price, which has fallen some 5 percent this year, against a 1 percent decline for the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX. The oil division accounted for 12.5 percent of overall revenue and 17.5 percent of industrial revenue in the first nine months of 2014. At its outlook meeting in December, GE said its oil business revenue could fall by as much as 5 percent this year and that it was looking to cut costs.Since then, the price of U.S. crude CLc1 has dropped more than 14 percent. This has raised more questions about the unit, which relies on spending from oil customers that are slashing capital expenditure budgets.Asked at the December meeting if cheap oil was good or bad for GE, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said: ""It's probably close to a wash to a slight negative... I would say when our customers make more money, they spend more, but it's going to have an impact on our oil and gas business.""  Even without oil's slide, GE faces challenges. On the one hand, its move to split off GE Capital finance assets and rely more on manufacturing earnings has won praise from many investors, who say industrial profits are more highly prized on the stock market and less finance exposure will make GE less risky.But the move to shed finance assets such as its private label credit-card business will take overall earnings down over the next two years. GE forecasts a profit of about 60 cents per share from GE Capital this year, falling to about 40 cents in 2016.Analysts on average expect GE to increase overall earnings per share by 6.4 percent in 2015 and by 5 percent in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Scott Lawson, vice president of investment management firm Westwood Holdings Group, said GE might be hard-pressed to reach even those comparatively modest expectations for 2016, as the oil pressures compound sluggish outlooks for two other core markets, healthcare and power.""It’s kind of a challenge for them to grow over the next two years,"" Lawson said. ""Shy of a recession, most industrials should outperform that forecast that GE just outlined in December."" For example, Wall Street expects earnings growth of 10.1 percent this year and 10.9 percent in 2016 for Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and 9.8 percent this year and 9.4 percent in 2016 for 3M Co (MMM.N).

Orders in the unit also fell.""It’s going to be an albatross ... as long as energy prices stay low,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. “The sentiment on GE is very negative here, and I don’t see anything in the quarter that is going to change that.""GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said the U.S. conglomerate, which is shifting its focus even more to industrial operations and away from finance, recognized the risks from low oil prices. But he pointed to other areas of strength, including the improving U.S. economy.""The GE world remains balanced,"" Immelt said on a conference call with analysts. ""Our job is to manage the company through volatility.""Fourth-quarter net income rose 61 percent to $5.15 billion, or 51 cents per share, from a year earlier, when results suffered from GE's move to resolve financial obligations to Japan's Shinsei Bank. Excluding pension-related costs, earnings of 56 cents per share were 1 cent ahead of the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 4 percent to $42 billion, just missing Wall Street estimates of $42.16 billion. Shares of GE rose 1.8 percent in morning trading, while rival Honeywell International Inc, whose sales and earnings both narrowly beat expectations, gained 3.4 percent.  GE's organic industrial revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and deals, increased 9 percent.Sales in the power and water unit, which sells a variety of turbines and is GE's biggest industrial segment, rose 22 percent, while the aviation division's sales increased 4 percent.Revenue at the oil and gas division slumped 6 percent but was flat on an organic basis. Orders at the unit, which sells oil and gas equipment and services, fell 4 percent on an organic basis, but its quarterly profit edged up 1 percent. GE's profit margin for the industrial businesses, which Wall Street watches closely, rose by 0.5 percentage points to 18.8 percent. The company is cutting costs and simplifying operations to lift margins.Through Thursday, GE shares were off 4 percent so far in 2015, against a slight increase for the Standard & Poor's 500 index.

494,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  Even as the drop in oil prices hits its customer base, General Electric Co (GE.N) plans to ""play offense"" and separate itself from rivals offering oil equipment and services, its chief financial officer said on Friday.The steep drop in oil prices has raised questions about the prospects for GE's oil business, which contributed 17 percent of the conglomerate's industrial revenue in 2014. GE has forecast as much as a 5 percent decline in the unit's revenue and profit this year. Its shares have been pressured by the oil price drop, although they rose 1.9 percent on Friday after GE posted a slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit and kept its 2015 financial targets despite oil's slide. Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said that while GE was bracing for slowing oil business demand, ""This is going to create a lot of opportunities for us to distinguish ourselves.""That includes efforts to win business, scoop up talented workers, invest in technology for future gains, or lower costs by standardizing products. ""We’re expecting that there is going to be customer pullback,"" Bornstein said in an interview. ""I think you’d completely have your head in the sand if you didn’t think that was going to happen. Having said that, we’re going to play offense ... like crazy in 2015.""GE is aggressively seeking to cut costs at the oil and gas unit, including potentially through driving lower prices from suppliers, consolidating manufacturing sites and cutting jobs, Bornstein said. ""To offer the most competitive price point, you’ve got to have the most competitive cost point,"" he said.GE, which has spent $14 billion on deals to build its oil business since 2007, is open to further acquisition opportunities, he said.""If we saw something that we thought was really financially compelling and really strategically compelling, we would take a look at it,"" Bornstein said. ""A lot of these companies are worth 30 or 40 percent less than they were five months ago."" Sales at GE's oil unit fell 6 percent in the fourth quarter, while orders dropped 10 percent. Bornstein said that much of that performance stemmed from comparisons to the unit's strong results a year earlier and the negative impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. Low oil prices had a ""very modest impact"" in the quarter, Bornstein said.""I don't think we've yet seen the behavioral impact by the customer base,"" Bornstein said.

Mahama said the project would be the biggest in Ghana's history, exceeding production at the main hydroelectric source at Akosombo in the east of the country.""We stand ready to be a great partner for emergency power by the summer and also we'll invest and bring together some other investors to make this (thermal project) happen,"" Immelt said. The main project will be in two phases, comprising a 750-megawatt plant by 2017 to run on liquefied natural gas and a second plant two years later, he said. The government says it aims to reduce its dependence on crude oil for power plants. Since 2012, Ghana has faced power shortages caused by inadequate gas supplies to run thermal plans and low water levels in existing hydroelectric reservoirs.The economy has grown rapidly in recent years based on exports of oil, cocoa and gold, though economists say power rationing have constrained development. Ghana projects growth at 3.9 percent for 2015 due in part to fiscal problems.

""Our goal is to secure the required regulatory approvals and close the transaction by mid-2015,"" the company said in an emailed statement.GE has a checkered history with the Commission. Its planned takeover of U.S. industrial giant Honeywell was squashed by the EU watchdog in 2001 despite getting the green light from U.S. regulators.

They were trading 0.9 percent lower at 28.61 euros at 1552 GMT (10:52 a.m. EST).The EU competition authority is expected to announce the probe next week.

510,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS General Electric's 12.4 billion euro ($14.1 billion) bid for Alstom's power equipment business could lead to price rises, EU antitrust regulators said on Monday as they opened a full-scale investigation into the deal, increasing pressure on the U.S. conglomerate to offer concessions.GE has had its acquisition ambitions quashed by European regulators before. In 2001 the European Commission blocked its $42 billion purchase of rival Honeywell International Inc  despite U.S. regulatory approval, though GE says it has cleared more than 50 transactions in the region since then.The Alstom deal is part of GE's efforts to increase its focus on industrial operations and away from finance.However, the takeover would remove one of GE's three main rivals in heavy-duty turbines used in gas-fired power plants, the Commission said. The other global players are Germany's Siemens and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, a joint venture formed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hitachi. ""We are concerned that the proposed acquisition might not only lead to higher prices but also result in less choice for customers and less innovation in the sector,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.The Commission said it is worried that GE would discontinue the production of certain models of Alstom heavy duty gas turbines (HDGTs) and not bring to the market the French company's advanced HDGT technology. It will decide by July 8 whether to clear or block the deal. GE rejected the regulatory concerns.""We disagree with the preliminary concerns raised by the EC statement today and Phase II is the normal process for engagement on these issues. Our goal remains to secure the required regulatory approvals and close the transaction by mid-2015,"" it said. Alstom said it would cooperate with the Commission.GE has 47 percent of the global installed base of gas turbines, JP Morgan estimates, based on 25 years of orders. That compares with 26 percent for Siemens, 8 percent for Mitsubishi and 7 percent for Alstom.Expanding GE's installed base of turbines is a key rationale for the deal for the U.S. conglomerate, which makes significant profit from servicing the installed power equipment.Reuters reported on Feb. 18 that the European Union competition watchdog would open a full-scale investigation into the deal.

The other global players are Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, a joint venture formed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) and Hitachi (6501.T).""We are concerned that the proposed acquisition might not only lead to higher prices but also result in less choice for customers and less innovation in the sector,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. The Commission said it is worried that GE would discontinue the production of certain models of Alstom heavy duty gas turbines (HDGTs) and not bring to the market the French company's advanced HDGT technology. It will decide by July 8 whether to clear or block the deal.GE rejected the regulatory concerns. ""We disagree with the preliminary concerns raised by the EC statement today and Phase II is the normal process for engagement on these issues. Our goal remains to secure the required regulatory approvals and close the transaction by mid-2015,"" it said.Alstom said it would cooperate with the Commission.GE has 47 percent of the global installed base of gas turbines, JP Morgan estimates, based on 25 years of orders. That compares with 26 percent for Siemens, 8 percent for Mitsubishi and 7 percent for Alstom. Expanding GE's installed base of turbines is a key rationale for the deal for the U.S. conglomerate, which makes significant profit from servicing the installed power equipment.Reuters reported on Feb. 18 that the European Union competition watchdog would open a full-scale investigation into the deal.

516,"  DUBAI, March 5 Mubadala GE Capital, a joint venture between the Abu Dhabi state-owned fund and General Electric, reported a 3.9 percent drop in 2014 net profit as higher proceeds from the sale of financial assets could not offset a slump in fee income.The company made $99.4 million in 2014 compared with $103.5 million in the previous year, according to its financial statement published on Thursday. Contributing to the profit decline was a 91.8 percent slump in fee income, which fell to $4.2 million in 2014. This overshadowed the $19 million of gains from the sale of financial assets which the joint venture recorded in 2014, from offloaded loans and advances and investments in financial leases. It did not record any such gains in 2013, the financial statement showed. Mubadala GE Capital, which is a commercial finance venture between Mubadala and the U.S. conglomerate, held total assets worth $5.5 billion at the end of 2014, up 37.8 percent on the same point of 2013.

517,"  COPENHAGEN, March 9 Siemens gained over Vestas to top the global wind turbine market as measured by market share of newly installed machines connected to the grid in 2014, according to an industry report, but the gap between the top three companies is small.MAKE Consulting, a Danish renewable energy consultancy, said wind turbine units of Siemens and General Electric Co , and Danish turbine maker Vestas had between 10.8 and 10.1 percent each of global market share, showing the intense competition in the industry.The consultancy said, however, GE's climb to second position from fifth the previous year was due to turbines that had already been installed in 2013 but were only turned on in 2014. Siemens meanwhile is expanding rapidly in offshore wind, a new battleground for turbine makers as they produce larger engines to go further offshore to avoid local community complaints against their installation.Siemens accounted for 76 percent of new capacity installed offshore last year in the world and 88 percent offshore Europe. However, none of the top three feature as prominently in China, one of the biggest markets for wind where Chinese makers are dominant. Beijing-based Goldwind, United Power and Ming Yang were the top three turbine makers there respectively, MAKE said.

It is a critical new product for GE's power business -- the company's biggest industrial segment -- and its prospects are being closely watched by Wall Street.""Between now and 2030, our view is we're going to plant 500 (H-class turbines) in the ground,"" Vic Abate, GE's vice president of power generation products, said during the presentation for investors and analysts at GE's global research center in Niskayuna, New York. Abate said GE planned to build 7 H-class turbines this year with the capability of delivering 30 in 2016.The technology event comes as GE seeks greater focus on its industrial manufacturing operations and less on its finance business, a move many investors say will boost its market valuation. Executives from a range of businesses touted GE's ability to speed products to market and draw upon technology from other segments of the diverse manufacturer. GE reported nearly $5.3 billion in research and development costs last year, including about $1 billion from partners and customers including the U.S. government. It targets research spending at about 5 percent of its industrial sales, which GE's chief technology officer, Mark Little, noted was up from 2 to 3 percent of revenue the company used to spend.

As part of the 12.35 billion euro  ($13.07 billion) takeover, to be finalised mid-2015, GE had pledged to put its global headquarters for grids, offshore wind, hydro and steam turbines in France, in a nod to the French government anxious about seeing French jobs going abroad.

526,"   By Stephen Kalin | SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt  SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt General Electric Co (GE.N) has delivered a shipment of gas turbines to Egypt as part of a $1.9 billion deal to boost power capacity, and will invest $200 million in a planned economic zone near the Suez Canal, the firm said on Friday.The announcements were made at a conference where Egypt  hopes to secure billions of dollars in investment after years of political turmoil, focusing on energy and the Suez Canal zone.GE says it generates about 30 percent of Egypt's installed power capacity and the gas turbines will help ease the load on the overburdened energy grid ahead of peak summer usage.Egypt is suffering its worst energy crisis in decades, with high consumption and low output causing regular power blackouts.GE had delivered 34 turbines to Egypt out of a planned 46 total as part of a project to provide 2.6 gigawatts of power to the grid by May 2015, the U.S. conglomerate said in a statement. ""I track this project personally. We know how important this is to Egypt,"" GE co-chief executive Jeff Immelt told a news conference in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh.Electricity minister Mohamed Shaker said GE's delivery was part of Egypt's plan to add six gigawatts to the grid by the end of 2015, pushing total capacity to 38 gigawatts.Shaker said 3.6 gigawatts would be provided by new power stations at a cost of $2.65 billion, with GE providing 2.6 gigawatts and Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Italy's Ansaldo Energia providing the remaining one gigawatt. Siemens and Ansaldo Energia were unavailable to comment.Immelt said the value of the 46 turbines was proportional to the amount of power GE was providing from the overall 3.6 gigawatts. That would put the value of GE's turbine deal, which was signed in December, at about $1.9 billion. The company also said it was investing $200 million in a manufacturing and training facility in Suez City, which GE sees as part of an economic hub being built near the Suez Canal.The Suez project, announced by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi last August, aims to turn the canal area into an international industrial and logistics hub. In a separate scheme, the army began digging a second canal in August to allow the two-way traffic of larger ships.GE's investment in Suez City would focus on power generation, renewables, water, oil and gas, aviation and rail transport, it said.

528,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co (GE.N) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt is sticking by his company's model for housing diverse businesses under one roof at a time when other U.S. conglomerates are looking at hiving off units to please investors.In a wide-ranging annual letter to shareholders released on Monday, Immelt details advantages from such scale through shared technology and other areas through what he calls the ""GE Store.""""The value of the GE Store is captured by faster growth at higher margins; it makes the totality of GE more competitive than the parts,"" Immelt writes.As an example, Immelt cites how GE can use aircraft engine alternators to improve motors for pumping oil. He points to additive manufacturing, also known as 3-D printing, as a new technology for potential use across GE's businesses, which include power turbines, locomotives and MRI machines. Immelt's comments follow GE's meeting last week to showcase its technology to investors, in what some analysts also viewed as providing rationale for a conglomerate model. They also come after rival U.S. conglomerate United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) last week announced it would weigh a spinoff of its Sikorsky helicopter unit after a portfolio review. Other industrial companies, such as Tyco International Plc TYC.N and ITT Corp (ITT.N), have undergone more significant breakups in recent years.To be sure, Immelt has gotten GE out of businesses such as plastics, and last year decided to sell its appliances unit as it reshapes its industrial focus. It is also scaling back its finance division. Barclays analyst Scott Davis has in the past raised the prospect that investors want GE to go further, including shedding its medical business.Immelt writes in the letter that two of GE's newest products - its LEAP jet engine and H-class gas turbine - will generate $100 billion in combined revenue over their lives. He also says GE will register at least $1 billion in sales in Ghana this year, joining 22 other countries. While GE has warned sales in its oil segment could fall 5 percent this year amid the slide in oil prices, the CEO writes in the letter that the price drop presents an ""opportunity"" for the business, which supplies equipment and services to energy customers.

536,"  General Electric Co (GE.N) said it increased planned job cuts in its Lufkin oilfield equipment unit to 575, as it grapples with pressure on the unit from the drop in oil prices.The move follows GE's notification to regulators in January of the planned layoffs of 330 people at its beam-pumping manufacturing facility in Lufkin, Texas.The total number of reductions was raised to 500 people in February and then boosted again to 575. The cuts will impact workers in Angelina County, Texas.""As a result of increasingly challenging market conditions, we are announcing additional workforce reductions in our Lufkin business,"" said Kristin Schwarz, a GE Oil & Gas spokeswoman.

However, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company's oil and gas investments have come under pressure with the steep drop in crude prices.

539,"   By Nick Brown | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric would commit to financing a new natural gas plant in Puerto Rico under a debt restructuring plan proposed by creditors of the island's struggling power utility, according to plan documents obtained by Reuters.The plan, which also includes creation of more than 3,400 new jobs, comes during ongoing negotiations between the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and its creditors to restructure the utility's $9 billion in debt.Reuters reported on Saturday that an ad hoc group of PREPA creditors, including OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Templeton, offered $2 billion to finance a turnaround at PREPA, $1.2 billion of which would fund a new natural gas facility.While it remains to be seen if PREPA will accept the proposal, new financing could stave off a messy default that would reverberate around the U.S. municipal bond market, and allow the utility to modernize its business, a key element in fixing Puerto Rico's ailing economy. Early on Wednesday, an overview of the creditors' plan, which has not been released publicly but was obtained by Reuters, showed that the proposed natural gas facility in Aguirre, near Puerto Rico's southern coast, would be financed and operated by GE, which would sell the power to PREPA under a purchase agreement similar to the one PREPA currently has with EcoElectrica.A spokeswoman for GE did not respond to requests for comment on the financing of the Puerto Rico plant.The plan also projects creating 3,445 new jobs, including 2,300 from the construction of 25 new solar power facilities. It projects charging consumers a rate of 21.7 cents per kilowatt hour, or 22 percent less than the highest rate charged in 2014. It is unclear how much momentum the proposal has, and its feasibility may be challenged.Two people close to the matter told Reuters last week that PREPA is lukewarm to the offer. Stephen Spencer, a financial adviser to the creditors who proposed the plan, in a statement called the plan ""a big step toward restoring market confidence in the overall island economy"".PREPA has been in restructuring talks for months as the slide in oil prices has emboldened creditors to resist taking haircuts on their debt.Puerto Rico has lobbied the U.S. Congress to allow PREPA and other struggling utilities to file for bankruptcy, which would make it easier to impair creditors.Restructuring PREPA would go some way toward resolving a major uncertainty for investors at a time when the U.S. commonwealth is seeking to raise around $3 billion to stabilize its finances.",2015-04-01,GE,"Wed Apr 1, 2015 | 7:23am EDT","GE could fund turnaround of Puerto Rico utility, documents show",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-puertorico-prepa-idUSL2N0WY0HP20150401?type=companyNews

Yet the seeds of that deal were planted seven years ago, during the crisis.    After the Wall Street meltdown, U.S. regulators slapped rules on banks and other financial institutions aimed at curbing their risk taking. These requirements, including more burdensome capital requirements and the hiring of additional compliance staff, have raised the costs of real estate investing, driving some out of the business and prompting others to cut back.    As part of a wider restructuring, GE announced on Friday it would sell most of the assets of its GE Capital Real Estate unit to Blackstone and Wells Fargo & Co for about $23 billion.    This move away from finance operations will allow GE to break free from the regulatory constraints that came from its designation as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI).The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel of regulators created after the financial crisis, has already labeled four non-bank financial firms such as large insurers as SIFIs. It has now set its sights on the asset management industry, reviewing whether activities and products offered by firms such as BlackRock Inc and Fidelity Investments may pose risks to the broader economy. Blackstone, however, is smaller than such traditional asset managers. It said in its latest annual report it considers it unlikely it would be designated a SIFI.Major financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and American International Group Inc have all scaled backed their real estate investment operations since 2007.     Blackstone stepped into the void.

551,"   By Nick Carey and Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co will shed most of its finance unit and return as much as $90 billion to shareholders as it becomes a “simpler” industrial business instead of an unwieldy hybrid of banking and manufacturing.The company on Friday outlined a restructuring plan that includes buying back up to $50 billion of its shares, selling about $30 billion in real estate assets over the next two years and divesting more GE Capital operations. GE stock jumped 8.5 percent.""The stock has been under-owned by institutional investors, and that's going to change now,"" said Tom Donino, co-head of equity trading at First New York Securities.The repurchase program, which will be partly funded by $35 billion through money returned from GE Capital, is the second-biggest in history after Apple Inc's $90 billion plan. GE, which had 10.06 billion shares outstanding on Jan. 31, said it expected to reduce that by as much as 20 percent to 8 billion to 8.5 billion by 2018.In all, GE said it planned to shed $275 billion in GE Capital assets. That includes the previously announced spinoff of its Synchrony Financial credit card unit, the real estate transaction announced on Friday, and future sales of commercial lending and consumer banking businesses with assets of about $165 billion.The company plans to keep $90 billion in finance assets directly related to selling its products such as jet engines, medical equipment and power generation and electrical grid gear.GE has forecast earnings of $1.70 to $1.80 per share for this year, including 60 cents from GE Capital, but expects profit to be “substantially higher” in 2018, executives said on a conference call with analysts. Shrinking GE Capital will reduce earnings by 25 cents per share, they said, but the stock buybacks should offset that impact.The company already had a significant number of inquiries about GE Capital units before Friday’s announcement, said Keith Sherin, the finance unit's chief.Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo & Co confirmed that they were buying most of the assets of GE Capital Real Estate for about $23 billion.     This is the biggest deal in the commercial property market since Blackstone's acquisition of office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust in 2007 for $39 billion, including debt.FOCUS ON INDUSTRIAL The moves announced on Friday will dramatically reduce GE’s exposure to lending and other financial businesses.GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt told investors the company would try to generate 90 percent of its profits from industrial operations by 2018. He had previously forecast that share would grow to 75 percent by 2016 from 55 percent in 2013. “We just think the market timing is very good vis-a-vis the value of financial service assets,” Immelt said in an interview. “There have been moments in the past when there weren’t a lot of buyers. Now there are.” Immelt and other GE executives said they planned to spend $3 billion to $5 billion a year on industrial acquisitions.GE said it could return up to $90 billion to investors through a combination of dividends, the $50 billion in share buybacks, and completion of the Synchrony spinoff planned for late this year.	Executives gave several reasons for GE's accelerated retreat from financial businesses. One is that since the financial crisis, it has become more difficult for GE to fund its lending operations.GE funded many of its loans and leases by borrowing money from bond markets. During the financial crisis it lost access to that funding, bringing it uncomfortably close to running out of cash.  Lenders like GE Capital and CIT Group Inc, which cannot rely on bank deposits to fund their assets, have had to rethink the way they do business since the crisis. Many decided to either shed assets or become banks.GE Capital’s size and the potential risks in its lending portfolio made it subject to government regulation as a systemically important financial institution. GE said it would apply to escape that oversight in 2016 as it reduces the financial business' size. GE said it would take after-tax charges of about $16 billion for the restructuring in the first quarter, of which about $12 billion would be non-cash.Shares of GE were sluggish for the past year despite previous moves to reposition itself around the industrial businesses. Still, Friday’s more dramatic move away from finance caught some analysts by surprise.""What we did not expect was the speed with which management would move to undertake this transformation,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote. ""We view today's announcement as an overwhelming positive for the company.""During the conference call, Barclays analyst Scott Davis told executives that while he had been a critic, “this is good stuff ...

All 10 primary S&P 500 sectors ended up on the day but the S&P Industrials index, driven by gains in GE shares, was by far the best performer and rose 1.5 percent.General Electric rose 10.8 percent to $28.51, hitting its highest level since September 2008 after it said there was potential to return more than $90 billion to investors through 2018.Friday marked the biggest one-day jump for the stock, as well as the most active session, since March 2009. More than 351 million shares changed hands, making GE the most active name on the New York Stock Exchange by far. It was also the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer. ""This is indicative of a broader trend, a refocus on shareholders, and that can provide a support for markets,"" said David Lebovitz, global market strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management in New York. ""If we continue to see buybacks and higher dividends, and I suspect we will, that makes a more convincing case for equities going forward.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.92 points, or 0.55 percent, to 18,057.65, the S&P 500 gained 10.88 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,102.06 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 21.41 points, or 0.43 percent, to 4,995.98.For the week, the Dow is up 1.6 percent, the S&P is up 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq is up 2.3 percent. Both the Dow and S&P notched their second straight week of gains, helped by a pickup in merger activity. Investors are looking ahead to the first-quarter earnings season. While some companies reported this week, next week will see results from a number major firms, including several banks.  Profits of companies on the S&P 500 are projected to have declined by 2.9 percent in the first three months from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.""There's a bit of a rough patch ahead, but I think we should be able to jump over lower expectations,"" said Lebovitz, ""I don't anticipate a sharp fall in stocks throughout the season.""Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,782 to 1,232, for a 1.45-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,603 issues rose and 1,100 fell for a 1.46-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 26 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 93 new highs and 21 new lows.About 5.47 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, down from the month-to-date average of 6.22 billion.

556,"   By Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co.'s plan to retrench from the finance business will further reduce its already diminishing presence in the U.S. money market, which it has leaned on to fund consumer and business loans.This development from a major issuer of U.S. commercial paper comes at time when tighter regulations have caused money market funds, which own most of the $1 trillion of ultra short-dated debt issued by banks, brokerages and commercial lenders, to cut their holdings.There was no significant reaction on Friday in the money market in the wake of GE's plan, which includes shedding $375 billion in GE Capital assets. As part of the overhaul, GE will also reduce the lending unit's commercial paper to $5 billion by the end of the year from $22 billion at the close of 2014, analysts and investors said.""You are taking a large player who's winding down.

GE Capital's enormous size resulted in financial oversight from the U.S. Federal Reserve similar to large banks.

564,"   By James Saft  If shedding its financing arm did wonders for General Electric’s stock price, maybe too-big-to-fail bank peers like Citibank and JP Morgan should consider similar moves.Not that banks will become industrials, but rather the biggest banks might get a better valuation on their earnings by becoming smaller, simpler, easier to manage and less strictly regulated.GE last Friday announced a plan to divest most of GE Capital, taking operating earnings from finance eventually down to less than 10 percent of the whole as compared to 57 percent in 2007. GE's stock popped 11 percent on the news, which may allow the company to lose its designation as a 'systemically important financial institution' (SIFI) subject to tougher regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act.Investors were happy not simply because of the prospect of less burdensome regulation. More important is that GE will be a more focused industrial company, one which will produce more predictable and hopefully less volatile earnings. While finance was once the tail which wagged GE's industrial dog, allowing it to grow earnings both rapidly and with metronomic, if sometimes hard to credit, regularity, GE Capital's huge and complex book of financings threatened to take the company down during the financial crisis, bringing on a stock slump from which it is only now emerging.Though arguably in the pre-crisis era investors gave finance-based earnings at GE a bit of a pass, valuing them more highly than they would if produced by a similarly hedge-fund-like investment bank, those days surely ended with the crisis.There is also the conglomerate discount at work here, a phenomenon characterized by investors being unwilling to pay as highly for a given dollar of earnings at a conglomerate as they would at a mono-line or simpler company. That's partly because conglomerates, and here I include financial ones, have a bad track record of being run too much for the glory and enrichment of insiders, but also because investors want to do their own diversification rather than subcontract it to the whims of executives and their investment bankers. Note that GE's consumer finance arm Synchrony Financial, spun off last August, has seen its shares rise by a third, much better than both the broad market and most financial shares.The market seems to like simple stand-alone companies, even ones in finance. THE INVESTMENT CASE AGAINST TOO BIG TO FAIL So will any of this cut much ice with those making the calls at the too-big-to-fail banks? Very likely not, history and human nature being what they are, but perhaps it ought to. The largest banks do enjoy material advantages due to their implied status of being back-stopped by the government. Though the dimensions of this subsidy are hotly debated, as are the corresponding costs imposed by tighter regulation, the fact remains that they have an advantage in certain respects due to their size and scope. There are also those who still sincerely believe that large U.S. banks will be positioned to take advantage of a supposed growth in financial services worldwide, though the evidence for this too is contested.There is, however, good evidence to suggest that many large diversified financials, perhaps particularly the largest, might achieve better stock market valuations were they to break themselves up into more easily digestible pieces. Not only is this sector a byword for poor long-term stock performance, at least over the last decade and a half, but there is academic evidence to back up this thesis.A 2005 study which looked at banks in 43 countries, all with $100 million or more of assets, found that the market actually imposes a 'diversification discount' on those with more conglomerate-like corporate structures. This discount was about 6 percent of a standard measure of over- or under-valuation.""Across an array of sensitivity checks, the data suggest that diversity reduces the value of financial conglomerates. One explanation of these results is that financial conglomerates that engage in multiple activities intensify agency problems and destroy value,"" Luc Laeven, then of the World Bank, and Ross Levine, then of Brown University wrote. Agency problems are economist-speak for what happens when an agent, like, say, a bank CEO, is in a position to take advantage of those for whom he works. In short, the more diversified the financial, the more likely that it is being run for the benefit of the inmates.That's exactly why the biggest banks should be broken up, and why they probably won't.

565,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | April 15  April 15 As General Electric Co stock soared last Friday to its biggest one-day gain in six years, investor Patrick Kaser's fund made a choice: Sell it all.Kaser, who manages Brandywine Global's $7 billion large-cap value equity portfolio, said his fund unloaded its entire 6 million-share position after the U.S. conglomerate announced it would shed most of its GE Capital finance unit and focus on manufacturing turbines, locomotives, jet engines and other industrial goods. Other Brandywine funds still hold GE shares.""The industrial businesses right now do face some meaningful challenges,"" Kaser said. ""The valuation at about $28 looked very fair, and we see better opportunities in the market."" Kaser's decision points to the challenge GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt faces going forward, starting with the company's release of first-quarter results Friday. GE is expected to report profit of 30 cents a share before charges, down from 33 cents a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE said last week it will book a $16 billion charge related to the GE Capital divestitures in the first quarter.As of midday Wednesday, GE shares had declined 3.1 percent since Friday, when they closed at $28.51 after an 11 percent surge on the divestiture news. GE is projecting industrial earnings to rise by high single or low double-digit percentages a year through 2018, excluding share buybacks. The company last week backed its 2015 forecast of industrial earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 per share, which equates to an increase of at least 15 percent.Weak oil prices and a strong dollar could make it tough to hit those goals. GE has forecast a drop of as much as 5 percent in profit and sales for its oil and gas unit, but some analysts say the decline will be worse. ""Everybody's question top and center is what is really going to be the prospect in '15 for oil and gas?"" said Nick Heymann,  analyst at William Blair.Meanwhile, the strong dollar helps European competitors in the healthcare and power industries. That puts more focus on Immelt's promise to cut administrative spending toward a target of 12 percent of revenue in 2016.""They are assuming the industrial side grows at a pretty good clip between now"" and 2018, said Scott Lawson, vice president of investment management firm Westwood Holdings Group. ""We'll just have to see how it works out.""

566,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 15 (Fitch) General Electric's planned divestment of the majority  of GE Capital Corporation (GECC) highlights the increasing capital allocation  focus for U.S. systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), says Fitch  Ratings. Fitch believes that management's key aim with the divestitures is to  boost GE's equity valuation through the disposal of substantial parts of GECC  while refocusing on its core industrial businesses. GE will also seek  de-designation as a SIFI, which if successful, should reduce the additional  capital requirements and compliance costs associated with stricter oversight. GECC is unique among U.S. SIFIs in that the majority of its businesses, namely  middle-market lending, commercial real estate and consumer lending, are not  highly synergistic with its parent's focus on industrial technology. The  strategic move is therefore unlikely to set a precedent for other U.S. SIFIs  that have much more synergistic and interconnected operations. Nevertheless,  tougher regulatory scrutiny for banks that have the systemically important  designation has resulted in a stream of divestments aimed at more efficiently  allocating their capital.  Post-crisis, many banks have exited businesses due to regulatory restrictions,  or because less synergistic or highly capital intensive operations are deemed  not worth the regulatory scrutiny and costs. Examples include exits from  mortgage servicing, student lending, physical commodities trading, and balance  sheet investments in alternative investments, among others. These assets have  largely shifted to the less regulated non-bank financial institutions sector,  but the non-bank financial sector's appetite for large-scale asset acquisitions  may diminish as those non-banks get larger, especially if they want to avoid the  scrutiny of a SIFI designation. In Fitch's view, alternative investment firms are among the potential  beneficiaries of GE's plans, particularly those with the size and platform  diversity to absorb assets coming out of GECC. Blackstone's ability to place a  significant amount of GECC's real estate portfolio across its various funds is  the clearest example of this. However, alternative investment managers with  credit-oriented funds may also be active buyers of GECC's middle-market loans,  should these be available via asset sales rather than platform sales. Other  middle-market lenders (such as regional banks, Madison Capital, Golub Capital,  CIT, and business development companies) could benefit from the exit of the  sector's most dominant lender. International banks without a significant U.S. presence or a desire to deploy  deposits outside of their home countries may also be active participants in the  sale of GECC's remaining U.S. assets. There would also be opportunities to buy  GECC's assets in overseas markets, primarily in Europe.

568,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch  The S&P 500 posted its biggest percentage loss since March 25 on Friday as investors shunned risk amid new trading regulations in China, renewed worries about Greece running out of money, and tepid U.S. corporate earnings.Selling followed sharp overseas stocks declines and was broad, with all 10 major S&P 500 sectors losing ground.Among the biggest drags, the S&P financials index was down 1.3 percent, with shares of Dow component American Express falling 4.4 percent to $77.32 after revenue missed analysts' estimates, partly due to the currency impact.The Dow and S&P 500 both snapped two weeks of gains. For the week, the Dow was down 1.3 percent, the S&P 500 down 1 percent and the Nasdaq down 1.3 percent. Both Honeywell International and General Electric blamed the strong dollar for lower revenue.

577,"   By Leela Parker Deo and Lynn Adler | NEW YORK, April 17  NEW YORK, April 17 General Electric Co's  plans to sell most of its finance unit, GE Capital, will create opportunities for new lenders in U.S. middle market leveraged loans as a dominant player in commercial lending and sponsor finance leaves the field.GE announced plans on April 10 to shed approximately $200 billion in GE Capital assets, including its $74 billion U.S. commercial lending and leasing unit and its $16 billion sponsor finance business, which finances private equity buyouts.The sponsor finance business includes GE Antares Capital and The Senior Secured Loan Program (SSLP), a lending platform jointly managed by GE Capital and Ares Capital which had $9.9 billion of funded commitments at December 31, 2014, according to Fitch Ratings.GE Capital has already received significant interest from a range of potential buyers, a GE Capital spokesperson said.GE's retreat from lending and broader move to reduce its exposure to its finance arm comes as US regulators curb aggressive lending by financial institutions that could pose systemic risk.The firm was designated as a non-bank SIFI, or Systemically Important Financial Institution, in July 2013 when the Financial Stability Oversight Council said that any material financial distress at General Electric Capital Corp (GECC) could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability due to its size and role in the global economy.As a non-bank SIFI, the firm would be subject to regulatory capital, liquidity, stress testing, capital planning, risk management and other requirements under enhanced prudential standards proposed by the Federal Reserve Board in November 2014, GE said in its 2014 annual report.GE said that it is now working with regulators to terminate the SIFI designation.ONE OR MORE BUYERS  The key issues are whether GE will sell its multi-billion sponsor platform to one or several buyers and whether a bank or non-bank will purchase the assets, bankers and investors said.""I think they're going to try to sell the sponsor business as a business, but it's possible they could separate the people from the assets, or divide the assets into categories,"" said David Golub, president of credit asset manager Golub Capital.""We've been asked if we would be an interested buyer, and the answer is yes.""Citigroup and JP Morgan are advising GE on the sale of the sponsor finance business, market sources said.There is considerable interest in the sponsor business from a range of institutions, including banks, although the most likely buyer is likely to be a large asset manager, private equity firm or insurance company, sources said.Bank interest will depend on asset size, as banks also have to take regulatory considerations into account, they added. Middle market loan pricing is not expected to change significantly if a regulated entity buys the syndicated loan portfolio assets, as banks  benefit from similar funding costs, unlike non bank buyers, a banker said.""The second possibility is that the buyer will be a nonbank, and then the key riddle for the buyer will be how to finance the business,"" Golub said.""GE has had the benefit of cheap capital - pre-crisis it was a AAA credit issuing commercial paper and post-financial crisis as a bank. A non-bank buyer will have a much higher cost of capital than GE.""OPPORTUNITIES  Beyond the sale of GE Capital's assets, GE's exit will create opportunities for other lenders to gain ground in U.S. middle market lending,  by competing for lead arranger mandates, pitching new business to GE's existing portfolio companies or by winning larger allocations on deals, middle market lenders and investors said.GE Capital Corp topped the U.S. Middle Market sponsored bookrunner league table in the first quarter of 2015 and arranged $1.48 billion of leveraged loans for middle market companies backed by private equity firms, giving a market share of 17.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.Middle market sponsor lending was fragmented before the financial crisis but has become increasingly concentrated among a handful of key lenders battling for market share, that includes GE as well Golub, Ares, NXT Capital and Madison Capital Funding.GE Capital often makes large commitments and holds positions of $75-125 million in one loan, which are often split between its balance sheet and its co-investment vehicles.GE's absence going forward will free up paper for more investors to join leveraged loans where GE would previously have taken a substantial chunk, sources said.U.S. middle market capacity and demand will not however be disrupted by the sale, an investor said.""There are more than enough lenders willing to step in, put money to work and underwrite transactions,"" he added.Bankers said that the timing of the sale was favourable for GE as regulations bite and new middle market platforms compete  for business.Successful recent sales of GE's Australia and New Zealand consumer lending business and a 2014 initial public offering of GE's North American consumer business known as Synchrony Financial, show that asset valuations are strong and the market is receptive, the GE Capital spokesperson said.GE said that it will retain its ""vertical"" financing businesses - GE Capital Aviation Services, Energy Financial Services and Healthcare Equipment Finance - which directly relate to its core industrial businesses.

587,"   By Serajul Quadir | DHAKA  DHAKA A joint venture of Summit Group, Bangladesh’s leading power producer, and a unit of General Electric Co has started a plant initially supplying up to 240 megawatts (MW) of electricity to the country's national grid as it seeks to plug a shortfall in electricity supply.Bangladesh's current production capacity of 7,000 MW falls far short of its demand of 10,000 MW, with only 65 percent of its 160 million population having access to the national grid.The new combined cycle plant is located in the north western district of Sylhet, 278 kilometers (174 miles) from Dhaka. It will eventually produce another 130 MW and will be completed by September 2015.The $310 million project will raise electricity output by the power unit of Summit, a conglomerate whose activities range from shipping to communications, to nearly 1,200 MW, almost 12 percent of Bangladesh’s total, and will take the group's total investment in the power sector to $1.2 billion. Muhammad Aziz Khan, managing director of the unit and chairman of Summit Group, told Reuters the project was financed in part via 15 year loans of $70 million each from International Finance Corp, a commercial arm of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank.The loans were provided at an interest rate of around 4.65 percent. “The remaining $100 million is equity, of which Summit has provided 80 percent and the rest 20 percent comes from General Electric,” Aziz said.The plant will use 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Bibiyana gas field owned by state-managed Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corp (Petrobangla). The field  is operated by Chevron. It is just one of a number of plants being opened by Summit.

GE has until next month to offer concessions if it cannot convince the EU enforcer.The EU's competition authority, which is due to decide on the deal by Aug. 6, has warned of possible price rises because the merger would remove one of GE's three main rivals in the manufacturing of heavy-duty turbines for gas-fired power plants.The two companies compete with Germany's Siemens  and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, a joint venture formed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hitachi.

589,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co on Monday announced collaborations with Qualcomm Inc and Apple Inc as it uses digital technology and the growing appetite for data to reinvigorate its 130-year-old lighting business.With chipmaker Qualcomm, GE is offering retailers a way to connect with shoppers' smartphones through technology embedded in LED light bulbs, the company said. One use of the ""indoor positioning"" technology could be to transmit customized coupons to shoppers depending on their store location.GE also said it will produce an LED bulb compatible with Apple's yet-to-launch connected-device platform HomeKit. The bulb can change colors to align with the natural rhythms of the body.The tie-ups underscore GE's plans to dive into the emerging and increasingly competitive market for connected lighting that integrates with smart devices.While GE sees an opportunity in selling energy-efficient LED bulbs, it will seek to use sensors and other technology embedded in LEDs to the advantage of consumers, businesses and cities, said Beth Comstock, who leads GE Business Innovations. Services offered by GE stand to provide revenue that could offset pressure should the LED bulb business become more commoditized.""There’s now a data stream from light that is going to create opportunity to be more productive,"" said Comstock, in her first interview about the lighting strategy since September, when the unit became part of GE's innovations division.GE itself is undergoing a sweeping overhaul, jettisoning the bulk of its finance division to focus on big-ticket industrial products such as jet engines and power turbines. Some analysts have speculated the U.S. conglomerate will divest lighting after deciding last year to sell its appliances segment and moves by Siemens and Philips to hive off lighting units. GE Lighting totaled about $2.5 billion in revenue last year, 2.3 percent of the company's overall industrial sales.Comstock said lighting fits smoothly with GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's desire to marry software and analytics with GE's various industrial equipment, which GE calls the ""Industrial Internet."" ""LEDs plus software, it helps GE continue its Industrial Internet expansion and I think the lighting business has a big role in GE's future because of that,"" Comstock said.Along with traditional lighting manufacturers, the ""intelligent lighting"" market is drawing companies that manage other building controls such as Honeywell, and start-ups focused on lighting controls, according to Jesse Foote, analyst at Navigant Research.""There are so many kinds of companies getting into the space,"" Foote said.

The Alstom deal, which would be the biggest acquisition in GE's history, stands to expand GE's installed base of power turbines, which would allow the U.S. company to earn more revenue from servicing the equipment.GE has said it expected Alstom to add about 1 cent per share in earnings this year, and between 6 cents to 9 cents in 2016. Those earnings could be even more important given GE's new plan to divest most of its finance assets over the next few years.GE has a checkered history with the Commission, the EU executive, which blocked its planned $42 billion takeover of Honeywell International in 2001 but has since cleared more than 50 deals.($1 = 0.8957 euros)   (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Jan Strupczewski, Pravin Char and David Clarke)",2015-05-04,GE,"Mon May 4, 2015 | 2:06pm EDT",UPDATE 2-GE boss to meet EU antitrust chief probing Alstom deal - source,http://www.reuters.com//article/eu-general-electric-alstom-idUSL5N0XV2NZ20150504?type=companyNews
592,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  May 4 General Electric Co on Monday announced collaborations with Qualcomm Inc and Apple Inc as it uses digital technology and the growing appetite for data to reinvigorate its 130-year-old lighting business.With chipmaker Qualcomm, GE is offering retailers a way to connect with shoppers' smartphones through technology embedded in LED light bulbs, the company said. One use of the ""indoor positioning"" technology could be to transmit customized coupons to shoppers depending on their store location.GE also said it will produce an LED bulb compatible with Apple's yet-to-launch connected-device platform HomeKit. The bulb can change colors to align with the natural rhythms of the body.The tie-ups underscore GE's plans to dive into the emerging and increasingly competitive market for connected lighting that integrates with smart devices. While GE sees an opportunity in selling energy-efficient LED bulbs, it will seek to use sensors and other technology embedded in LEDs to the advantage of consumers, businesses and cities, said Beth Comstock, who leads GE Business Innovations.Services offered by GE stand to provide revenue that could offset pressure should the LED bulb business become more commoditized.""There's now a data stream from light that is going to create opportunity to be more productive,"" said Comstock, in her first interview about the lighting strategy since September, when the unit became part of GE's innovations division. GE itself is undergoing a sweeping overhaul, jettisoning the bulk of its finance division to focus on big-ticket industrial products such as jet engines and power turbines.Some analysts have speculated the U.S. conglomerate will divest lighting after deciding last year to sell its appliances segment and moves by Siemens and Philips to hive off lighting units. GE Lighting totaled about $2.5 billion in revenue last year, 2.3 percent of the company's overall industrial sales. Comstock said lighting fits smoothly with GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's desire to marry software and analytics with GE's various industrial equipment, which GE calls the ""Industrial Internet.""""LEDs plus software, it helps GE continue its Industrial Internet expansion and I think the lighting business has a big role in GE's future because of that,"" Comstock said.Along with traditional lighting manufacturers, the ""intelligent lighting"" market is drawing companies that manage other building controls such as Honeywell, and start-ups focused on lighting controls, according to Jesse Foote, analyst at Navigant Research.""There are so many kinds of companies getting into the space,"" Foote said.

594,"  * U.S. fine and Russia write-offs push Alstom into red* Company plans to return cash when GE deal done* Maintains medium-term earnings targets   (Adds analyst forecasts, CEO comments)PARIS, May 6 A U.S. fine for bribery and write-offs on Russian assets pushed France's Alstom to a 719 million euro ($808 million) annual net loss, a big swing from a 556 million profit in the  previous year.The French transport and power firm said in December it would pay a record $772 million fine and plead guilty to settle U.S. criminal charges that it funneled millions of dollars in bribes to win business around the globe.The company's income from operations in the year to the end of March rose 19 percent to 318 million euros and sales increased 8 percent to 6.2 billion, Alstom said on Wednesday. The company said it would propose no dividend payout at its annual shareholder meeting but confirmed its medium-term earnings targets.Analysts had expected sales of 6.3 billion and an operating profit of 247 million euros and the company's shares rose 2.2 percent to 28.40 euros by 0720 GMT.Alstom is reshaping by selling its power equipment business to General Electric (GE). Alstom Chief Executive Patrick Kron said on a conference call that he expected the GE deal to close in coming months.General Electric's CEO Jeff Immelt met Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager this week to push for unconditional EU approval for GE's 12.4-billion-euro ($13.8 billion) bid.""Post-deal the environment will remain very competitive,"" Kron said. Once the deal is closed, Alstom will call a shareholder meeting to vote on the amount of cash to be distributed, he said. He reiterated the company would propose a share buyback of 3.5 to 4 billion euros.Kron said the funds from the GE deal would reduce debt and allow new investments but that organic growth would remain the priority.""However we would consider any opportunities for external growth in order to complete our product range or boost or geographical reach,"" he said.Alstom said it registered a record 10 billion euros in order intake in 2014/15, up more than 60 percent, thanks to a number of large deals, including a rail contract in South Africa, tramway systems in Qatar and Australia, trains for the Paris metro and a full metro system in Mexico.Net income from continued operations was hit by a number of exceptional items, including a 720 million euro provision for the U.S. fine, 90 million in asset write-offs in Russia and restructuring charges of about 100 million, Alstom said.

The European Commission opened a full investigation in February to consider competition implications of a deal that would remove one of GE's three rivals in the manufacturing of heavy-duty turbines for gas-fired power plants.EU regulators typically prefer merging companies to sell overlapping assets or make it easy for rivals to enter the market.

The Alstom deal, which would be the biggest acquisition in GE's history, stands to expand GE's installed base of power turbines, which would allow GE to gain even more lucrative revenue from servicing the equipment.GE already altered the deal to win the French government's backing during last year's two-month battle, in which it fended off Siemens and Mitsubishi.In the interview, Bolze acknowledged the ""protracted process"" for Alstom, and said GE was focused on ""how to move ... forward as it makes sense.""In GE's first-quarter conference call last month, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt backed the deal's fit for GE, but said if it ""ever would become unattractive, we wouldn't do it.""

601,"  * Most opportunities expected in fragmented Polish market* Swiss franc mortgages seen as main risk for investors* Czech sales expected from Citibank and GE MoneyBy Marcin Goclowski and Jason HovetWARSAW/PRAGUE - May 12 More mid-sized banks are coming up for sale in central Europe as foreign owners retrench and stubbornly low interest rates squeeze others, creating openings for investors looking for a foothold in economies offering faster growth than the euro zone.In Poland, the biggest economy in the European Union's emerging east, three banks are slated to change hands and the regulator has pushed for new entrants to step in rather than existing players.In neighbouring Czech Republic, meanwhile, General Electric's GE Money Bank is expected to leave the market within two years, potentially bringing a new player to the region.""We will see further consolidation (in Poland) as some banks struggle to maintain profitability,"" the chief executive of one of Poland's biggest banks said, asking not to be named.The attraction for investors is that the region's economies are growing faster than the European average, while debt as a share of gross domestic product is lower than in western Europe, which implies more room for growth.Polish regulator KNF may be pushing for new entrants, but the more likely scenario is for mergers of incumbents looking to benefit from economies of scale. The biggest risk for potential buyers is from the region's Swiss franc-denominated home loans, which have become more expensive for borrowers since the franc's surged in value, bringing political pressure for increasing the regulatory burden on lenders.Yet Poland and the Czech Republic could still offer an opportunity to crack profitable markets, particularly with the Polish government now thought unlikely to force its banks to allow customers to convert Swiss franc mortgages into zlotys at historical rates after the central bank warned that such a move would be too costly.Poland's economy is expected to expand by more than 3 percent in both 2015 and 2016 according to the European Commission's spring forecast. The Czech Republic is expected to increase by 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent respectively while euro zone growth is seen at 1.5 percent and 1.9 percent this year and next. FRAGMENTED SECTOR Emerging Europe's second-biggest lender Raiffeisen  is the most visible name readying for a Polish exit as part of a restructuring drive.It operates Poland's seventh-largest bank, with a market value of a little more than 2 billion euros ($2.23 billion) based on the median price-to-book value for the Polish banking sector. That is almost half its parent company's market value of 4.5 billion euros.Raiffeisen is also selling its Slovenian business and internet banking arm Zuno in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.Henry MacNevin, associate managing director at ratings agency Moody's, said that the large number of operators in Poland's fragmented banking sector gives scope for consolidation among mid-sized players. ""There is more opportunity to pick up something that has greater market share,"" he said. Alior Bank is another Polish lender likely to find a new owner. Carlo Tassara, the holding company for French financier Romain Zaleski, plans to sell 25.3 percent of the bank, representing the largest single stake in the company.France's Societe Generale had been a front runner, but Polish insurer PZU has emerged as a rival suitor. PZU, the region's biggest insurance company, is looking to build its own banking business, potentially through two or three of the smaller lenders, which would provide a natural distribution channel for its asset management and investment products.Alior ranks 15th among Polish banks by assets and has a market capitalisation of 6.7 billion zlotys ($1.84 billion). It's valuation is at 1.8 times price-to-book value, according to Thomson Reuters data, against a sector median of 1.7.Austria's Erste Bank, meanwhile, has publicly declared its interest in Citigroup's assets in the Czech Republic and Hungary after the U.S. group began its withdrawal from consumer banking in 11 markets as part of global cost-cutting. Erste is already the second-biggest bank in the Czech Republic and No.6 in Hungary.Raiffeisen is also in the running for Citi's Czech consumer business, newspaper Hospodarske Noviny reported in March. A Citi spokeswoman declined to comment on the report and it remains unclear how such a move would fit with Raiffeisen's restructuring plan.The Czech market is more concentrated than that in Poland, making any big consolidation unlikely, focusing attention on the potential sale of GE Money's Czech business as the most likely way in.""Some smaller banks may be interested, but I think a bigger possibility is someone not already in the market will buy GE Money,"" said Milan Lavicka, a banking analyst for J&T.Analysts have said that a Chinese capital may be interested in the Czech banking sector and the deputy CEO of Bank of China Hungary told the Czech President on Monday that the bank will open a branch in the Czech Republic by September.

603,"  BRUSSELS May 12 European Union antitrust regulators have resumed their investigation into General Electric's 12.4-billion-euro ($13.97 billion) bid for Alstom's energy unit after receiving requested data from the U.S. conglomerate.The European Commission said on Tuesday that it would now decide by Aug. 21 whether to clear the deal, General Electric's biggest acquisition.""We have now received the information requested from the parties,"" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email.

days after a deal is  filed for a first-stage review.

Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

605,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  May 15 Transportation services company Penske Corp is exploring a sale of Truck-Lite Co LLC, in a deal that could value the maker of lighting, wiring harnesses and mirrors for trucks at close to $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.Penske, a company controlled by billionaire former race car driver Roger Penske, owner of the eponymous racing team, has hired investment bank Robert W. Baird & Co to run an auction for Truck-Lite, the people said this week.Truck-Lite has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $100 million, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential. Representatives for Penske, Truck-Lite and Robert W. Baird did not respond to requests for comment. Based in Falconer, New York, Truck-Lite manufactures lighting and safety accessories for the heavy-duty truck, trailer and commercial vehicle industries.Founded in 1955, Truck-Lite was acquired in 1997 by Penske with backing from General Electric Co. Private equity firm Kelso & Co acquired a stake in Truck-Lite in 2010. Penske is a holding company for subsidiaries operating in the retail automotive, truck leasing, transportation logistics and professional motorsports markets. Its businesses have annual revenues in excess of $19 billion.Penske's biggest holding is its 35 percent stake in Penske Automotive Group Inc, the second largest U.S. car retailer, which generated $17.2 billion in revenue in 2014.

606,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON General Electric Co (GE.N) would lose a $350-million deal to build locomotives for Angola, and perhaps billions of dollars more in future export opportunities, if Congress closes the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a senior GE executive told Reuters.""It would be gone,"" GE Transportation unit president Russell Stokes said of a not-yet-finalized agreement announced by the global conglomerate in March for 100 lightweight diesel-electric locomotives to be built in Erie, Pennsylvania.Up to 1,800 jobs at GE, its suppliers and local businesses in 12 states would be put at risk because, without Ex-Im financing, Angola would buy Chinese-built locomotives, he said.GE, along with other major U.S. exporters including Boeing Co (BA.N) and business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, is fighting to save the Ex-Im Bank. The export credit agency's critics, mostly conservative Republicans, want Congress to allow Ex-Im's charter to expire on June 30.Stokes spoke to Reuters on Capitol Hill between visits to lawmakers late last week to persuade them to keep the bank open.The alternative would be the end of an institution formed 80 years ago to help finance exports of U.S. goods and services, which the bank says counters foreign competition and protects jobs. Ex-Im, funded from fees and interest, generated a $675 million surplus in fiscal 2014 above its operating cost. The bank's opponents argue that its loans put taxpayers at risk, distort free enterprise and amount to ""corporate welfare.""  GE reported revenues of $149 billion and profits of $15 billion in 2014.  ""GE should seek private financing if it wants the Angola deal to go through,"" said David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth, an advocacy group allied with  Republican politicians attacking Ex-Im. ""It's not the role of the federal government to secure sales for GE.""But in the fierce international competition for locomotives, GE's Stokes said private financing could never compare to the lower rates offered by government-backed export credit agencies. In many emerging markets, including the Angola tender, bidders are required to offer export credit agency financing, he said.""We'd still go out and try to compete, but I'm telling you it will be very difficult,"" he said. ""On some of these big international tenders like this one, you're going to lose.""Ex-Im has agreed to finance another $650 million in not-yet-awarded power and infrastructure projects for Angola, and those would go to other countries if the bank dies, Stokes added.  GE Transportation's 4,500-strong workforce in Erie, plus thousands more at 900 suppliers such as Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp (WAB.N), have benefited from a boom in export orders financed in part by Ex-Im.With Ex-Im support, GE last year split a 465-locomotive South African order evenly with China's state-run train builders CSR Corp (601766.SS) and China CNR 601299.SS. Stokes said the firms are GE's toughest international competitor, and their pending merger will make them stronger.NO HOUSE BILL   Representative Jeb Hensarling, the leading Ex-Im opponent in Congress, said on Tuesday he was ready to let the bank expire and presented no plans to introduce reauthorizing legislation.""People at Boeing and GE have expended a lot of funds lobbying on this issue,"" the Texas Republican told a news conference. ""It's frankly a bit of bluster.""But Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois said he has a list of seven major export deals that would fall through if Ex-Im closes, and is using it to drum up support for a charter renewal measure that he will try to attach to a transportation funding extension needed in July.""I think if we pass through the expiration deadline it will help me gather votes for Ex-Im,"" Kirk told reporters.     GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt in a blog post to GE employees this month said that without Ex-Im, U.S. companies will lose deals to foreign rivals with export credit agency backing or shift some production abroad ""to countries that are more supportive of their exporters.""

609,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co's (GE.N) chief on Wednesday gave a faster timeline for the U.S. conglomerate's massive finance asset sale as he more than doubled a target for benefits from its purchase of Alstom's (ALSO.PA) power equipment business.GE, which announced plans last month to sell $200 billion in GE Capital finance assets, now expects to be largely done with the process by 2016 instead of finishing in 2017, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told the Electrical Products Group investor conference on Wednesday.GE estimated selling about $100 billion of the assets this year, up from its earlier target of $90 billion, with deals for $20 billion to $30 billion targeted by the end of the second quarter.""I'd be disappointed if we don't beat these numbers,"" Immelt said. ""I think we have the potential to do very well on this transaction.""GE's finance pullback would leave it primarily as a maker of big-ticket industrial products such as jet engines, locomotives and power equipment. But its planned 12.4 billion euro ($13.8 billion) purchase of Alstom's power equipment business, the biggest in GE's history, is still awaiting regulatory approval a year after it was announced. ""We like this deal. We're confident it's going to get approved,"" Immelt told the conference.Immelt said GE now expects $3 billion in cost savings and other benefits five years after the completion of the Alstom deal, up from $1.2 billion. GE said the deal will add 15 to 20 cents per share in profit in 2018.Reuters reported last week that the deal was unlikely to win unconditional approval from the European Commission, and GE has said it would be willing to consider concessions. On Wednesday, Immelt said GE would consider selling intellectual property around a product to get the deal through, but would reject anything that would hurt its service revenue stream. Revenue from servicing power turbines and other equipment generally carries high profit margins.Immelt also said he expects profit at GE's oil and gas business to decline by between 5 and 10 percent this year; or be unchanged or drop as much as 5 percent, excluding foreign currency fluctuations. Previously, GE had forecast a drop of as much as 5 percent. Like other suppliers to the energy sector, GE is seen as vulnerable to a sharp slide in oil prices as customers reduce capital expenditures. Immelt said GE plans to cut $1 billion in costs from its oil business, including $600 million this year. ""We expect to have a good business going forward in oil and gas,"" the CEO said.GE shares rose 1 percent to close at $27.64 on the New York Stock Exchange.

UK FTSE futures  were flat.Data also showed that manufacturing activity in Asia's top two economic powerhouses remained stuck in low gear in May, though an absence of inflation pressures suggested that authorities could inject yet more stimulus if needed.On the European economic data front, traders awaited preliminary manufacturing and services PMI numbers for France and Germany for May, as well as UK retail sales.""(There is) some concern that the recent recovery seen in some of the Q1 data could start to plateau in Q2,"" said Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets.Germany's Deutsche Bank is set to hold what promises to be a stormy annual general meeting later on Thursday after reshuffling its management board, consolidating restructuring authority under co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain while bidding farewell to retail banking head Rainer Neske.DEUTSCHE BANK The German lender reshuffled its management board late on Wednesday, consolidating restructuring authority under co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain while bidding farewell to its retail banking head Rainer Neske.SYNGENTA  Monsanto Co, the world's largest seed company, said on Wednesday it plans to divest Syngenta Ag's seeds and genetic traits businesses as well as some overlapping chemistry assets to win regulatory approval for a takeover of its Swiss rival.ZURICH INSURANCE The insurer said it was still on track to reach its 2016 strategic objectives, helped by additional cost cuts, after it fell short of its key return on equity goal last year.

614,"  (Adds details on the bidders)By Lewis KrauskopfMay 27 As General Electric Co seeks to unload most of its finance assets, it is prioritizing the sale of businesses that provide lending to U.S. and European private equity firms, and to healthcare-related businesses, GE Capital's top executive said on Wednesday.Because these businesses have a lot of ""franchise value...customers won't do any business with us unless they know who the owner is. We have to get those done quickly,"" Keith Sherin, chief executive of GE Capital, told an investor conference in New York. GE Antares, which provides private-equity-related loans, is ""in the marketplace, it's happening quickly,"" Sherin said. The process for a similar, smaller business in Europe is also ""going quickly,"" he said. People familiar with the matter said this week that Guggenheim Securities Inc, Apollo Global Management LLC, Ares Management LP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board were among the bidders for GE's private equity lending arm. Representatives for these firms either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.The sale of that business could come in early June, the people added, asking not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. A healthcare financial services business, which also lends to private equity in healthcare as well as provides real estate loans to operators of assisted living facilities, is also a priority, Sherin said. GE is not selling its healthcare financing business for MRI machines and other equipment, which ties into healthcare products that GE manufacturers.GE announced plans last month to exit $200 billion worth of finance assets as it focuses on manufacturing of industrial products. Last week, GE CEO Jeff Immelt said he expected to sign $20 billion to $30 billion worth of deals by the end of June, as he gave a faster timeline for the overall exit.

Milan-based GE Capital Interbanca specializes in lending and financing transactions for medium-sized Italian firms. It  employs around 600 people and has a book value in excess of 1 billion euros ($1 billion), the source said, without saying how much it might fetch.Interbanca operates two subsidiaries, namely GE Capital Finance, active in accounts receivable financing, and GE Capital Servizi Finanziari, providing equipment lease and fleet services.Deutsche Bank could conduct a piecemeal sale and offload Interbanca's units such as lending, factoring, leasing and fleet as standalone businesses as a way to maximize value, one of the sources said.It could also combine some of the assets with their European equivalents and favor a ""bundle"" deal provided there is enough appetite from prospective bidders, he said. Spokesmen at GE Capital and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.GE on April 10 announced plans to shed most of its finance unit and return as much as $90 billion to shareholders as it becomes a simpler industrial business instead of an unwieldy hybrid of banking and manufacturing.In all, GE said it planned to shed $275 billion in GE Capital assets. That includes sales of commercial lending and consumer banking businesses with assets of about $165 billion. The sale of GE Capital Interbanca will kick off at the end of a strategic review which aims to identify whether the business will be sold in parts or in an outright deal, a source said.But the asset has already drawn interest from several banking institutions and investment firms which have signaled their potential desire to submit bids, one of the sources said.  Private equity firms alongside hedge funds and distressed equity funds are among interested parties, with the latter targeting Interbanca's non-performing loans portfolio, he said. Formerly part of Banco Santander's (SAN.MC) Banca Antonveneta unit, it was acquired by GE Capital in 2008 and became part of its GE Commercial Finance division.

626,"   By Edward Krudy | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co has assembled an ""exploratory team"" to look at moving its headquarters out of Connecticut after lawmakers passed a budget that includes $1.2 billion in tax increases despite protests from some of the state's biggest corporations.In an email sent on Thursday to GE's Connecticut employees and obtained by Reuters, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he had asked the team to examine the company's options to relocate the headquarters to a state with a ""more pro-business environment."" GE has 5,700 employees in Connecticut.Lawmakers passed a $40 billion biannual budget late on Wednesday. GE, Aetna Inc and Travelers Cos Inc as well as the state's Republicans slammed the measures, which extend a 20 percent surcharge on corporate tax and introduce a tax on group-wide income even if it originates out of state. GE and Aetna, which also has a corporate headquarters in the state, said on Monday they would consider leaving Connecticut, but Immelt's email is the first sign a major corporation is taking concrete steps that could lead to it quitting the state.The loss of GE would be a huge blow to Connecticut, which bled thousands of jobs after the financial crisis and has been one of the slowest states to recover from the recession. The state's economy grew just 0.9 percent in 2013, compared with 2.2 percent for the United States as a whole, while job growth has also lagged. ""If this budget would wind up driving employers out of state, it would be even harder to fund the services that this budget is intended to fund,"" said Jared Walczak at the Washington-based Tax Foundation.Walczak said the budget would increase business taxes by around $500 million over two years.Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy had trumpeted the budget as an ""historic investment"" in roads, bridges, rail and other infrastructure slated to reach $10 billion over five years. Facing the growing backlash on Thursday, a spokesman for his office said: ""We have spoken with GE in recent days and have been kept apprised of their thinking.""Separately, Aetna issued another statement on Thursday saying its annual $65 million state tax bill would jump 27 percent once all the budget measures were implemented.""Elected leaders have failed to address the state's budget obligation responsibly,"" Aetna said. ""But it's Connecticut's businesses and residents that will pay the price.""  The state also increased a tax on data processing that Aetna said would ""hurt our ability to remain competitive and invest in our employees and customers."" The extension of the temporary 20 percent surcharge maintains Connecticut's effective corporate tax rate at 9 percent, compared with a base rate of 7.5 percent, the fifth-highest in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation.The budget also raises the top rate of income tax to 6.99 percent from 6.7 percent, cuts property tax credits and boosts the sales tax on luxury items to 7.75 percent from 7 percent. That includes automobiles over $50,000, jewelry over $5,000, and clothing and accessories over $1,000.

Three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the joint venture was studying options in the wake of the U.S. conglomerate's decision to exit most of its GE Capital operations. Two of the sources said Mubadala was actively seeking buyers for GE Capital's shares in the joint venture.""Given the strength of Mubadala GE Capital's portfolio we are in the process of evaluating a range of options for the future structure of the business,"" a spokesman for Mubadala GE Capital said.Mubadala GE Capital, set up in 2009 as a 50/50 venture to invest globally in GE Capital-originated commercial finance assets, reported assets of $5.5 billion at the end of 2014, up from $4 billion in 2013. GE said on April 10 it would shed the bulk of its finance arm to become a simpler industrial business.

637,"   By David Lawder and Krista Hughes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Senate expressed strong support of the U.S. Export-Import Bank on Wednesday in a test vote amid efforts by conservatives to close the export credit agency when its mandate expires at the end of the month.The Senate voted 65-31 against setting aside an amendment to a defense bill that would renew Ex-Im's charter and implement some reforms to the 80-year-old trade bank.While the amendment was subsequently withdrawn due to other hurdles, the vote suggests that a separate measure to keep Ex-Im open had more than enough support to beat back any blocking attempts and easily pass the Senate.""This will be a signal to the markets that the Senate is in support of the bank,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, prior to the vote. He was a co-sponsor of the Ex-Im amendment, along with Republican Senator Mark Kirk and Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp. A vocal group of conservative Republicans in both the Senate and House of Representatives want to close the bank because they believe it represents free-market interference by government bureaucrats, puts taxpayer funds at risk and promotes ""crony capitalism"" by subsidizing foreign sales by large corporations such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co.Democrats and more moderate Republicans warn that closing Ex-Im will hurt U.S. exports and cost thousands of manufacturing jobs by giving an advantage to foreign governments that generously subsidize their own exports.If Congress does not act by June 30, Ex-Im will have to stop lending and writing new trade guarantees. But attaching Ex-Im to the National Defense Authorization bill now under consideration in the Senate is considered problematic because the two issues are not directly related. President Barack Obama also has threatened to veto the defense measure over funding levels and other issues.Lawmakers and aides in both parties say that a more plausible scenario would be to attach the Ex-Im renewal to a transportation funding bill that will be considered in July.

A third global rival would be Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems.GE is seeking to counter the commission's concerns with some concessions, the sources said.

An EC spokesman declined to comment. Alstom had no immediate comment. GE said it was working constructively with the regulator.""We are focused on a positive outcome that preserves the deal economics,"" GE said, adding it was confident of closing the transaction in the second half of 2015. GE has said it won approval for more than 40 deals in Europe in the past decade. But the EC blocked its planned $42 billion takeover of Honeywell International Inc in 2001 even though the deal had received U.S. approval. This stirred up a political storm that prompted U.S. President George Bush to express concerns about the veto.The Alstom deal is not expected to face a similar outcome, despite the commission's concerns, since GE will probably offer enough concessions to satisfy regulators. The commission must also consider the French government, which has an option to acquire 20 percent of Alstom as part of letting the GE deal through.GE would consider selling intellectual property rights to a product but not make concessions that would affect lucrative service revenues, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said last month.

645,"   By Edward Krudy | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy on Friday proposed cutting planned business taxes by $223.7 million over two years after several large corporations threatened to leave the state.Connecticut's state legislature passed a $40 billion biannual budget last week that hiked taxes by $1.2 billion over the next two years, prompting a backlash from businesses including General Electric Co, Travelers Companies Inc and Aetna Inc.Aetna and GE, both of which have headquarters in the state, have said they would consider leaving Connecticut. GE's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said he had already assembled a team to look for alternative locations.Malloy's plan involves scrapping a proposed increase on a tax on data processing, deferring the introduction of company-wide taxation, and raising a tax credit cap.Malloy, a Democrat, said he will ask the legislature to make cuts by 1.5 percent across the board. ""Even as we have one of the lowest effective corporate tax rates in the nation, these steps are being made to protect Connecticut's long-term interests,"" Malloy said in a statement.Connecticut's lawmakers will meet this month in a special session to implement the budget plan. That would allow them to pass Malloy's amendments before the start of the fiscal year on July 1.""While the Connecticut business climate continues to be very challenging, this announcement is a step in the right direction.  We will review these changes in more detail and monitor developments through the special legislative session,"" a spokesperson for Aetna said in a statement. Last week's spending plan extended a temporary 20 percent surcharge on corporate tax, which makes Connecticut's effective corporate tax rate 9 percent, compared with a base rate of 7.5 percent, the fifth-highest in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation.""The governor and the legislature should do the right thing for small and large businesses and the citizens of Connecticut to improve the economic vitality of the state,"" GE said in a statement. The company did not comment on the substance of Malloy's proposals. Travelers said it was ""pleased that the governor has listened to the concerns expressed by the business community and has proposed changes to the budget.""""We will closely monitor the legislature’s reaction to these proposed changes,"" the company said.Malloy's revised plan also calls for revenue generated through sales tax on car washes and parking to be eliminated. Taxes on Internet services would be set at 1 percent.

The deal however has sparked regulatory worries that it would leave just two gas turbine companies in Europe, with GE competing only with Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE).

If Czarnecki is pursuing BPH, he would be in competition with central Europe's biggest insurer, state-controlled PZU , which has also expressed its interest in BPH. BPH declined to comment, as did Getin Holding, which is owned by Czarnecki. Czarnecki owns Poland's No. 6 lender Getin Noble Bank . Acquiring BPH would catapult his banking empire to fourth position on the market.But analysts say it may be difficult to gain approval from financial regulator KNF for such a transaction, as both Getin Noble and BPH have huge portfolios of Swiss franc-denominated mortgages, which are deemed by the regulator to be a source of risk.

651,"  * Says LEAP engine performing as expected in tests* GE-Safran venture faces steep production increase   (Adds quotes, details)By Tim HepherPARIS, June 13 French-U.S. jet engine maker CFM International pledged to meet ambitious production goals for its newest model, designed to power the industry's best-selling passenger jets, and said testing was going smoothly.A successful increase in production of the LEAP engine, developed by a joint venture between France's Safran  and U.S. giant General Electric, is crucial to the smooth introduction of revamped Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s.""We are really serious about delivering on promises,"" Jean-Paul Ebanga, president of the four-decade-old venture said.""We want to do what we said and even if sometimes it is not where the buzz is, what we have done over all these years proved to be very consistent.""He was speaking ahead of the June 15-21 Paris Airshow, where the industry's focus is expected to turn towards the production challenges created by a boom in commercial jet orders. CFM already produces the industry's most-sold jet engine, the CFM56, which powers all Boeing 737s and about half of Airbus's A320 series.That engine's successor, the LEAP, will power two aircraft under development: the Boeing 737 MAX, for which CFM remains the sole supplier, and the Airbus A320neo, where CFM will continue to compete with Pratt & Whitney.A new Chinese passenger jet, the Comac C919, will also use the LEAP engine. CFM plans to increase production from 1,560 engines in 2014 to 1,670 engines this year. It expects a gradual transition to the LEAP engine, which will dominate production by 2020.The company could increase its projected production of traditional CFM56 engines but its plate is full for the time being with planned LEAP production, company officials said.That echoed cautious comments by the head of Safran who said this week it was too early to consider further production increases being tenatively explored by some planemakers.CFM said it expects a fall in orders this year following a record 2014. ""We are still confident it will be a good year,"" Ebanga said.It sold 4,244 engines in 2014, including 1,527 of the CFM56 engine and 2,717 new LEAP engines, which is designed to save fuel partly through the use of lightweight materials. The company plans to announce new orders at the June 15-21 air show.So far this year it has sold 314 CFM56 engines and ""about 500"" of its LEAP engines, Ebanga said.The LEAP and Pratt & Whitney's competing Geared Turbofan both aim to deliver about 15 percent in fuel savings.CFM officials dismissed recent speculation of a shortfall in performance during testing of the LEAP.""We did have a few bumps in the road but none of them has caused us to change the design of the engine,"" Executive Vice President Allen Paxson said. ""It is right where we expect it to be today.""

""We have a 1,080 megawatt project ... (in partnership) with General Electric. The power goes to the national grid. What we are doing is to build up power projects in this way,"" Nnaji, a former Nigerian minister of power, told Reuters late on Tuesday on the sidelines of a power conference in Lagos.Nnaji said the firm was in discussions with some Chinese, European and U.S. investors and expected financial close by year-end. Construction would start early next year. Geometric Power, which has a 141 megawatt captive power for industrial use in Abia State, said the new plant would also be located in Abia State, southeast Nigeria. Nigeria, with a population of around 170 million, has installed power capacity that fluctuates between around 6,000 to just over 7,000 MW, but experiences severe electricity shortages that are crippling its growth.Some of the older plants, sold in October 2013, are in dire need of an upgrade while the fledgling generating firms lacking the cash as distributors struggle with non-paying consumers and inadequate gas supplies required to keep the plants running.Nigeria is also in talks with Russia's state-owned Rosatom to build nuclear power plants.

660,"  (Repeats story published late Thursday; no changes to text)By Byron KayeSYDNEY, June 26 General Electric Co said it will help fund a $348 million Australian windfarm, the country's third largest, after political leaders ended a deadlock over state subsidies that had stalled the $13 billion industry for over a year.GE, Swiss private equity firm Partners Group Holding AG , Canadian pension fund OPTrust and UK-based Renewable Energy Systems Ltd said they will fund the 240-megawatt Ararat windfarm, three days after the government passed a law securing future subsidies for renewable energy. Windfarms are Australia's No. 2 renewable energy source, behind hydropower but ahead of solar, providing a quarter of the country's clean energy and 4 percent of its total energy demand. But investment in the sector froze after the conservative government said last year it wanted to cut the country's Renewable Energy Target (RET).The Ararat windfarm, which will power 123,000 homes, was among dozens of projects shelved, and the commitment to revive it signals the industry is kicking back to life now the level of state support has been agreed. Under Australian law, the RET must be agreed by both the Federal government and opposition. ""With certainty comes investment,"" said GE's president and CEO for Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, Geoff Culbert.""That's our experience overseas and that's what we'll see here in Australia now that the RET is fully resolved. This decision has immediately unlocked half a billion dollars of direct foreign investment into Australia,"" Culbert added.

663,"   By Byron Kaye | SYDNEY, June 26  SYDNEY, June 26 General Electric Co said it will help fund a $348 million Australian windfarm, the country's third largest, after political leaders ended a deadlock over state subsidies that had stalled the $13 billion industry for over a year.GE, Swiss private equity firm Partners Group Holding AG , Canadian pension fund OPTrust and UK-based Renewable Energy Systems Ltd said they will fund the 240-megawatt Ararat windfarm, three days after the government passed a law securing future subsidies for renewable energy.Windfarms are Australia's No. 2 renewable energy source, behind hydropower but ahead of solar, providing a quarter of the country's clean energy and 4 percent of its total energy demand. But investment in the sector froze after the conservative government said last year it wanted to cut the country's Renewable Energy Target (RET). The Ararat windfarm, which will power 123,000 homes, was among dozens of projects shelved, and the commitment to revive it signals the industry is kicking back to life now the level of state support has been agreed. Under Australian law, the RET must be agreed by both the Federal government and opposition.""With certainty comes investment,"" said GE's president and CEO for Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, Geoff Culbert. ""That's our experience overseas and that's what we'll see here in Australia now that the RET is fully resolved.

664,"  * American chief executive to leave Electrolux-report* Company awaiting green light for GE deal* GE Appliances boss tipped as successor   (Adds comment, detail, background, share)STOCKHOLM, June 25 Swedish appliances maker Electrolux is seeking a replacement for chief executive Keith McLoughlin, business daily Dagens Industri reported on Thursday, creating uncertainty over who will drive further cost savings in coming years.The American's eventual successor could inherit a larger company. McLoughlin agreed last September to buy General Electric's appliances division for $3.3 billion, Electrolux's biggest ever deal, which is now awaiting regulatory approval.Dagens Industri said the American, who will be 60 next year, would step down on his own initiative but gave no specific timing. His family moved back to the United States from Sweden a couple of years ago, prompting many to assume he would follow at some stage. Electrolux did not comment directly on McLoughlin's plans other than saying he had not resigned.""It is normal practice that well-run public companies conduct succession planning,"" it said in a statement which did nothing to dispel the speculation about his departure.McLoughlin, who joined Electrolux in 2003 and has been its CEO for four and a half years, imported manufacturing practices from the auto industry to cut costs and raise profitability. Electrolux has also promised large cost benefits from the GE deal, which was cheered by investors and has helped push up Electrolux shares. The deal would double the Swedish company's annual sales in North America.They now trade at a premium against U.S. rival Whirlpool  while the shares had similar valuations early last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.Dagens Industri said Charles Blankenship, the head of GE Appliances would be the top candidate to succeed McLoughlin, provided the purchase of the GE division is approved by U.S. authorities and can be finalised. Electrolux shares were down by 0.6 percent at 1110 GMT, underperforming the Stockholm bluechip index which was roughly unchanged.Electrolux is also busy trimming costs in Europe and analysts said McLoughlin would be missed.""He is a very important person from an investor point of view,"" said Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Karri Rinta.""If Keith McLoughlin were to remain, you could count on him to deliver. If there is a new CEO, it will always be a bit more uncertain whether they will be able to deliver or not.""(Reporting by Sven Nordenstam; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Keith Weir)",2015-06-25,GE,"Thu Jun 25, 2015 | 7:25am EDT","UPDATE 1-Cost-cutter McLoughlin to quit as Electrolux CEO, Swedish newspaper says",http://www.reuters.com//article/electrolux-ceo-idUSL8N0ZB17F20150625?type=companyNews

667,"   By Euan Rocha, John Tilak and Lewis Krauskopf | TORONTO/NEW YORK, June 26  TORONTO/NEW YORK, June 26 General Electric's  sale of its finance assets is set to shape and potentially shake-up Canadian M&A league tables this quarter as bankers scramble to get deals across the finish line before the end of June.In April, GE unveiled a plan to sell about $200 billion in GE Capital assets as it moves away from finance and focuses on manufacturing of industrial equipment. GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt sped up GE's sales timeline last month, including the expectation for $20 billion to $30 billion in finance deals by the end of June.Three sources familiar with the matter say bankers are scrambling to get the sale of GE's vehicle fleet-management business inked before the end of June. GE has said the business includes $9 billion in assets.Bankers familiar with the GE sale process say that with many Canadian firms scouting other portions of the GE portfolio, that sale process is potentially likely to shape Canadian M&A league tables not only in the quarter, but for the rest of the year. Canada's Element Financial is close to buying a big chunk the business, with a smaller portion being taken by another party.The deal would generate large advisory fees and push Bank of Montreal, Barclays and boutique firm INFOR Financial Inc, who are advising Element up in the Canadian M&A league tables. JPMorgan, GE's main advisor on the entire sale process, will also see its position elevated. GE's private-equity lending portfolio was bought by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board earlier in June for $12 billion.JPMorgan and Citigroup advised GE on that transaction, while Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley acted as CPPIB's advisors. While the bulge bracket firms have dominated cross-border deal activity during the quarter, a couple of large energy deals are potentially set to boost the position of Canadian banks.Royal Bank of Canada and BMO advised the two parties in the long-anticipated Enbridge drop-down deal that was inked this week.Canada's largest oil pipeline company Enbridge has agreed to transfer some of its Canadian pipeline and renewable energy assets to the Enbridge Income Fund. Including debt the transaction is worth C$30.4 billion ($24.64 billion).Sources close to the matter told Reuters that Cenovus Energy Inc is moving closer toward selling its oil and gas royalty lands to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in a deal that could fetch C$2.5 billion to C$3 billion. TD is advising Cenovus on that process.

""With certainty comes investment,"" said GE's president and CEO for Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, Geoff Culbert.""That's our experience overseas and that's what we'll see here in Australia now that the RET is fully resolved. This decision has immediately unlocked half a billion dollars of direct foreign investment into Australia,"" Culbert added. Asked about comments by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who this month described windfarms as ""visually awful"" and a potential health hazard, Culbert noted that Australia's health guidelines body, the National Health and Medical Research Council, had concluded there was no evidence that wind farms cause adverse health effects.""The RET represents a bipartisan solution, and we applaud the Coalition and ALP (Australian Labor Party) for achieving that,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""It's important that the views of all groups are heard, and that any concerns are addressed with fact and science.""The government plans to appoint a windfarm commissioner to process complaints about the industry.

677,"  (Adds details on competitor)By Euan Rocha, John Tilak and Lewis KrauskopfTORONTO/NEW YORK, June 26 General Electric Co's  sale of its finance assets is set to shape and potentially shake-up Canadian M&A league tables this quarter as bankers scramble to get deals across the finish line before the end of June.In April, GE unveiled a plan to sell about $200 billion in GE Capital assets as it moves away from finance and focuses on manufacturing of industrial equipment. GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt sped up GE's sales timeline last month, including the expectation for $20 billion to $30 billion in finance deals by the end of June.Bankers familiar with the GE sale process say that with many Canadian firms scouting other portions of the GE portfolio, that sale process is potentially likely to shape Canadian M&A league tables not only in the quarter, but for the rest of the year.Three sources familiar with the matter say bankers are scrambling to get the sale of GE's vehicle fleet-management business inked before the end of June. GE has said the business includes $9 billion in assets. Canada's Element Financial Corp is close to buying a big chunk the business, with a smaller portion being taken by another party.The deal would generate large advisory fees and push Bank of Montreal, Barclays Plc and boutique firm INFOR Financial Inc, who are advising Element, up in the Canadian M&A league tables. JPMorgan Chase & Co, GE's main advisor on the entire sale process, will also see its position elevated. Element, which also executed a significant equity raise, has been scouting for acquisitions in the U.S. market.GE's private-equity lending portfolio was bought by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board earlier in June for $12 billion.JPMorgan and Citigroup advised GE on that transaction, while Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley acted as CPPIB's advisors. While the bulge bracket firms have dominated cross-border deal activity during the quarter, a couple of large energy deals are potentially set to boost the position of Canadian banks.Royal Bank of Canada and BMO advised the two parties in the long-anticipated Enbridge drop-down deal that was inked this week.Canada's largest oil pipeline company Enbridge Inc  has agreed to transfer some of its Canadian pipeline and renewable energy assets to the Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc . Including debt the transaction is worth C$30.4 billion ($24.64 billion).Sources close to the matter told Reuters that Cenovus Energy Inc is moving closer toward selling its oil and gas royalty lands to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in a deal that could fetch C$2.5 billion to C$3 billion.

The index's financial group  dropped 2.3 percent as a whole. The banks' fall, however, was deemed more of a knee-jerk reaction than a retreat that will be sustained.""I don't think any Canadian bank has one dollar of assets in Greece anymore. If they do, shame on them because everybody knew about this four years ago,"" said Barry Schwartz, portfolio manager at Baskin Financial Services.At 10:29 a.m. (1429 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 224.20 points, or 1.51 percent, at 14,583.89. All 10 of its main groups were in negative territory, with seven stocks falling for every one that gained. ""Anybody who is a net saver and plans to be investing for the next many, many years should use any market selloff as an opportunity to buy,"" Schwartz said. ""The alternative, sitting in cash earning negative returns, is unthinkable.""A Reuters poll showed that strategists expect Canadian stocks to edge higher in the second half of the year before picking up further in early 2016.The energy group retreated 1.7 percent as U.S. crude  prices fell 1.7 percent to $58.62 a barrel and Brent crude  lost 1.8 percent to $62.11.

684,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  The head of General Electric Co's (GE.N) finance unit said Tuesday he expects the pace of GE Capital asset sales will accelerate in the third quarter as the U.S. conglomerate eyes unloading an even bigger chunk of assets.""We’re going to pick up the pace in the third quarter,"" GE Capital Chief Executive Keith Sherin told Reuters in an interview. GE, which is shedding $200 billion in finance assets to focus on industrial manufacturing, earlier on Tuesday announced the $2.2 billion sale of its European private equity financing business to Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. A day earlier, GE said it had agreements to shed its fleet management arm. A deal to sell its U.S. private equity lending business was disclosed earlier in the month.Analysts have said the finance asset sales have garnered high deal prices so far, but it remains to be seen if future sales will realize the same value and allow GE to reap more than the $35 billion in proceeds it has targeted for share buybacks.A hefty portion of the businesses that have yet to be sold are part of GE's North American commercial lending and leasing portfolio. Overall, GE's North American units are ""highly coveted,"" Sherin said.""Globally, we have strong businesses but they’re not as strong as some of these North American franchises,"" he said. All told, since April 10 GE Capital has announced asset sales totaling $23 billion in ending net investment, GE's measure of assets that excludes non-interest bearing liabilities. With the most recent deals, GE hit a target of announcing $20 billion to $30 billion in asset sales during the second quarter.""We’re going to have more announcements in the third quarter, and it will be more than we had in the second quarter,"" Sherin said. Sherin confirmed that meant exceeding $23 billion in second-quarter announced deals, but did not give a specific target.Sherin reaffirmed GE's earlier goal to close deals for $100 billion in assets this year. The company has announced buyers for $68 billion in assets thus far. GE had prioritized the sale of three businesses, Sherin said last month, of which only healthcare financial services remained without an announced buyer. An agreement for that business, which lends to private equity in healthcare as well as provides real estate loans to operators of assisted living facilities, is ""in the near term, I hope,"" Sherin said on Tuesday.GE's decision to sharpen focus on manufacturing of big-ticket items such as jet engines and power turbines won wide favor from investors who said the company's finance division, and the regulatory burden that came with it, was weighing down its stock valuation.GE Capital's size and the potential risk from its lending portfolio has made it subject to government oversight. The company plans to apply next year to escape its designation as a systemically important financial institution, although Sherin said the path to do so was not entirely clear. “We’re the first, there’s no specific process,"" he said. ""We understand why we were designated as a systemic financial institution and if we address those factors ... we think we will be able to achieve that goal.""Some analysts have worried that rising interest rates or a drop in the stock market could hurt valuations for GE Capital's remaining assets.Sherin said he is not particularly concerned about a slight rise in interest rates.“A severe dislocation in financial markets of some type would slow us down, for sure,” Sherin said.

685,"   By Taiga Uranaka | TOKYO  TOKYO General Electric Co (GE.N) said it would sell its European private equity financing business to a unit of Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) for about $2.2 billion as the U.S. conglomerate sheds financial assets amid a restructuring.The portfolio represents about $2.2 billion of total invested capital, GE said on Tuesday.The portfolio carries a wider spread margin than most corporate loans, a source familiar with the matter said. This makes the deal attractive to the core banking unit of Japan's third largest bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) (8316.T), which is trying to diversify away from the fiercely competitive corporate lending sector.Major Japanese banks such as SMFG have been aggressively buying businesses and extending loans overseas to make up for a weak domestic market. In 2012, SMFG acquired an aircraft leasing company from Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS.L) for $7.3 billion and this year, Mizuho Financial Group Inc (8411.T) agreed to buy the U.S. and Canadian loan portfolio of RBS for $3 billion. In April, GE announced plans to exit $200 billion worth of finance assets which made it subject to government regulation as a financial institution. The U.S. industrial conglomerate has since signed agreements to sell about $23 billion worth of assets, including the latest deal.  GE Capital's Japanese commercial finance operations are part of this wider sale process, with one person familiar with the matter valuing them at around $5 billion.GE is also shedding other assets. The company said on Monday that it was selling its fleet management arm in the United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand for $6.9 billion.  GE is also selling its European fleet segment for an undisclosed sum that a source close to the matter said would be around $3.3 billion.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Global Markets were GE's financial advisers and Clifford Chance was its legal adviser.GE shares closed at $26.64 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

687,"  * GE shedding financial assets, plans to avoid SIFI designation* Japanese banks keen on M&A, overseas as home market stagnant   (Changes source, adds details from GE's statement)By Taiga UranakaTOKYO, June 30 General Electric Co said it would sell its European private equity financing business to a unit of Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) for about $2.2 billion as the U.S. conglomerate sheds financial assets amid a restructuring.The portfolio represents about $2.2 billion of total invested capital, GE said on Tuesday.The portfolio carries a wider spread margin than most corporate loans, a source familiar with the matter said. This makes the deal attractive to the core banking unit of Japan's third largest bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), which is trying to diversify away from the fiercely competitive corporate lending sector.Major Japanese banks such as SMFG have been aggressively buying businesses and extending loans overseas to make up for a weak domestic market.In 2012, SMFG acquired an aircraft leasing company from Royal Bank of Scotland Group for $7.3 billion and this year, Mizuho Financial Group Inc agreed to buy the U.S. and Canadian loan portfolio of RBS for $3 billion. (reut.rs/1g6apGT) In April, GE announced plans to exit $200 billion worth of finance assets which made it subject to government regulation as a financial institution.The U.S. industrial conglomerate has since signed agreements to sell about $23 billion worth of assets, including the latest deal.GE Capital's Japanese commercial finance operations are part of this wider sale process, with one person familiar with the matter valuing them at around $5 billion. GE is also shedding other assets.The company said on Monday that it was selling its fleet management arm in the United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand for $6.9 billion.GE is also selling its European fleet segment for an undisclosed sum that a source close to the matter said would be around $3.3 billion.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup Global Markets were GE's financial advisers and Clifford Chance was its legal adviser.GE shares closed at $26.64 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Up to Monday's close, the stock had risen about 5 percent this year.

691,"   By Diane Bartz and Lewis Krauskopf | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The United States filed a lawsuit on Wednesday to stop Sweden's Electrolux AB, which owns the Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan brands, from buying General Electric Co's appliance business, the Justice Department said in a statement.It said the $3.3 billion deal would hurt competition, and consumers, by combining two of the three top makers of stoves, cooktops and ovens. Whirlpool Corp, which bought Maytag in 2006, is the third.Electrolux shares traded in the U.S. on the OTC Pink market fell 9.3 percent, with more than 40,000 shares exchanged. GE's share price was steady.GE, which also has the Hotpoint brand and sells almost exclusively in the United States, said in a statement that its goal remained to close the deal in 2015. ""Electrolux and GE intend to vigorously defend the proposed acquisition,"" the company said in a statement.In its complaint, the Justice Department said that Whirlpool, GE and Electrolux had 90 percent of the U.S. market for stoves and ovens.Leslie Overton, a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, said the Electrolux deal would lead to higher prices for consumers. ""This lawsuit also seeks to prevent a duopoly in the sale of these major cooking appliances to builders and other commercial purchasers,"" she added.But Electrolux disagreed. Its antitrust attorney Joe Sims argued that LG, Samsung and others were moving into the market to challenge the Big Three.""There is absolutely no barrier of any kind to any other manufacturer participating,"" he said. Sims said that the company and Justice Department had been in settlement talks.""We are rational and are therefore more than happy to come to a reasonable settlement if the DOJ (Justice Department) is. If not we're just going to have to win in court,"" said Sims, who said the deal could close by the end of the year.The Justice Department has settled other major deal challenges, most notably a merger of American Airlines and US Airways and Anheuser-Busch InBev and Grupo Modelo, both in 2013. But for the ones not settled, the Justice Department has been on a winning streak in court, stopping H&R Block from buying a rival company in 2011 and the Bazaarvoice deal for PowerReviews last year. The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission teamed up this year to stop Comcast's purchase of Time Warner Cable, while the Federal Trade Commission stopped a merger of big food distributors and challenged a second big merger this year.GE's move to sell off its appliances business is part of a shift the U.S. conglomerate is making to sharpen its focus on manufacturing big-ticket industrial products such as jet engines and power turbines. To that end, GE in April announced it would exit $200 billion worth of finance assets, while it is seeking to acquire the power equipment unit of France's Alstom .European regulators have expressed concerns that GE's purchase of Alstom's power unit would leave just two gas turbine companies in Europe, with GE only competing with Germany's Siemens. GE has been working on concessions to save the planned 12.4 billion euro ($13.7 billion) purchase, which would be the biggest in the U.S. conglomerate's history.GE on Tuesday warned that the appliances sale would not close in the second quarter because of an ongoing regulatory review, and expected an after-tax gain of roughly 5 cents to 7 cents per share should the deal close.

700,"   By Sven Nordenstam | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM The head of Sweden's Electrolux (ELUXb.ST) said he believed a $3.3 billion deal to buy the GE Appliances (GE.N) business could be salvaged after the United States moved to block it.The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Wednesday to stop the purchase, arguing that it would hurt competition in the market for cooking appliances.The deal would be the biggest in the Swedish company's history and more than double its annual U.S. sales. Electrolux CEO Keith McLoughlin wants to preserve as much of it as he can.""I don't see a scenario where, for either party, it would make much sense to split the baby,"" said McLoughlin, who is an American.He remained confident that the deal could still be completed by the end of the year, even though talks on remedies with the Department of Justice (DOJ) had so far been unsuccessful. Analysts said disposals might help to settle the dispute.   The Justice Department said the deal would be likely to hurt consumers through higher prices on major cooking appliances.It also said it would create a duopoly in the supply of these products to buyers such as home builders and property managers. Electrolux, GE and rival Whirlpool (WHR.N) had a combined market share of 90 percent in this segment, it said. ""We don't agree with their numbers and we will show numbers that are different than that,"" said McLoughlin, whose company makes appliances under brands such as Frigidaire and Zanussi as well as its own.POSSIBLE DISPOSALS  Electrolux shares fell by 27.50 crowns -- more than 10 percent -- to 235.70 crowns by 1445 GMT (10:45 a.m. EDT) on the news, removing some of the support the stock has enjoyed since the move was announced last September.Mathias Leijon, head of fundamental equities at Nordea Investment Management which holds Electrolux shares, said he still believed the deal would happen regardless of whose interpretation of market share data prevailed, perhaps aided by concessions by the Swedish firm.""I believe Electrolux is prepared to go quite far to make this deal go through. It is a fantastic strategic fit, and there are also substantial cost synergies,"" Leijon said, adding his bank estimated the present value of the deal at around 60 crowns per Electrolux share.Analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove said disposals might help to save the deal. ""The high market share in cooking was a known concern but our base case view was that this could be addressed by the disposal of the Hotpoint cooking business (part of GE),"" they said.At times sounding exasperated, McLoughlin said the DOJ had failed to grasp how much more competitive his industry had become in recent years with inroads made by Asian rivals.""I think it was difficult for them to get the nuances of how the business actually works, in general and also of the competitiveness of this industry -- I don't think they got that at all.""

705,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS General Electric (GE.N) met EU antitrust regulators on Thursday, hoping they will take a softer line on its 12.4-billion-euro ($13.7 billion) bid for Alstom's (ALSO.PA) energy unit.The U.S. conglomerate asked for the closed-door hearing after the European Commission said the deal, GE's biggest ever, would harm competition because it would leave just two gas turbine companies in Europe - GE and German rival Siemens (SIEGn.DE). Steve Bolze, president and CEO of GE Power & Water, GE's biggest industrial unit, is expected to counter the Commission's concerns with data showing that the merged company's market power would not be as dominant as painted by the regulator.He is also likely to call for a broader assessment of the sector to take into account Chinese rivals, which the Commission has excluded from its review. GE is expected to offer concessions in the coming days. It has said it would be willing to give up some intellectual property rights related to some of Alstom's assets but not anything that would affect lucrative service revenue streams.GE's team at the hearing included its lawyer, Sharis Pozen, a former acting assistant attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice, who led the U.S. enforcer's veto against AT&T's (T.N) $39 billion bid for T-Mobile TMUS.N and opened a case against Apple's eBooks deals with five publishers. Alstom Chief Executive Patrick Kron also attended the hearing, which kicked off at 0730 GMT and was due to end at around 1500 GMT.Other participants included rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, Toshiba Corp (6502.T) and Italian company Ansaldo. A source who attended the hearing said German competitor Siemens (SIEGn.DE) was not present. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority sent its director in charge of mergers, Nelson Jung. The Commission's deputy director general for mergers, Carles Esteva Mosso, led the EU team.

Electrolux, which owns the Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan brands, fell around 10 percent after the United States filed a lawsuit to prevent it from buying General Electric's  appliance business.The Swedish company was the worst-performing stock on the broader, pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, which was flat at 1,534.30 points. The euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index was also flat. The mood among many traders was one of caution with Greece just days away from a referendum that may decide its future in the euro zone, while many investors were also awaiting U.S. jobs data later in the day.Defiant Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras urged his country to reject an international bailout deal on Sunday, which comes after Greece defaulted on debt owed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier in the week.European partners have said the Greek referendum would effectively be a vote on whether Greece stays in the euro or returns to the drachma. The twists and turns of Athens' stand-off with international creditors have pushed European market volatility to levels not seen since the end of 2014, while June was the worst month for euro-zone equities since 2013.JPMorgan analysts also warned a Greek exit from the euro zone might have spill-over effects on the region's banks via losses on their bond portfolios.Today's European research round-up    (Additional reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Toby Chopra and Mark Potter)",2015-07-02,GE,"Thu Jul 2, 2015 | 6:29am EDT",Electrolux sinks as Greek uncertainty pegs back European shares,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-europe-idUSL8N0ZI1BZ20150702?type=companyNews

710,"  * Sees portfolio changes slowing down* Should reach lower end of profit guidance, depends on Q4* Could still be interested in Alstom if assets become available   (Releads with comments on portfolio change, adds details on Alstom, one-off charges)By Georgina ProdhanMUNICH, Germany, July 6 Siemens could still be interested in buying power-generation assets from French rival Alstom on the same terms it offered a year ago if General Electric's deal to buy them falls through, a senior management source said.However, the Germany company sees the pace of change slowing down after a flurry of acquisitions, disposals and job cuts, the person added on Monday.Chief Executive Joe Kaeser has transformed the Munich-based group since taking the helm almost two years ago, aiming to focus on core strengths in automation, electrification and mobility and close a profit gap with GE and other rivals.It has made its biggest acquisition to date, buying U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand, shed businesses including hearing aids and household appliances, and carved out its healthcare business to make it an independent company.Now, a period of bedding-down should be expected, said the senior manager, who asked not to be named. The person also said that the kind of large, out-of-the-blue one-off charges that used to blight Siemens' quarterly results were not on the cards this quarter.Siemens has been criticised for paying too much for Dresser-Rand, which it is buying for $7.8 billion, when oil prices have been hammered by weak demand, a boom in cheap U.S. shale oil and now market turmoil over Greece and China.The deal followed a setback for Siemens when it lost out to GE in a bid to buy Alstom's gas turbines, after being asked by the French government to mount a rival bid.Siemens had refused to part with its rail signalling business, which France had wanted to combine with Alstom's, and the person said only the same ""constellation"" would be of interest to Siemens now.The GE-Alstom deal faces hurdles. GE met European regulators last week to allay worries its 12.4 billion euro ($13.7 billion) acquisition of Alstom's power equipment business would leave Europe with only two gas turbine players. SEEKING IMPROVEMENTS The disposals Siemens has made have been welcomed by investors but analysts are now keen to see signs of operational improvements that will justify the restructuring.Siemens expects flat sales this year, plus or minus 1-2 percent, and a rise of at least 15 percent in earnings per share, boosted by the disposals. The senior manager said Siemens still expected to reach the lower end of its targeted 10 to 11 percent profit margin range for its industrial businesses this year, although much depended on the fiscal fourth quarter.Next year, reported EPS is likely to fall as large disposals are unlikely, while sales should rise, at least relative to the market, the senior manager said.The company will, however, no longer give guidance for group industrial profit from 2015/16 any longer, but will rely on the multi-year operational profit guidance ranges it gives for the individual businesses, the manager said.Siemens shares were down 1.2 percent to 89.44 euros by 1430 GMT, broadly in line with the blue-chip DAX.Siemens introduced the industrial profit margin target only this year, partly to ease benchmarking against rivals such as GE and Swiss ABB, whom it still lags in profitability.But in future Siemens wants to be judged less as a conglomerate and more on the quality of its individual businesses, the senior manager said.It will also continue to give sales and earnings-per-share guidance for the group, the person said.Siemens declined to comment.

712,"   By Diane Bartz  The Justice Department's decision to file a lawsuit last week in a bid to stop Electrolux from buying General Electric's appliance business is wrong-headed because of growing sales by powerful foreign rivals, a top lawyer for Electrolux told reporters last week. Joe Sims, of Jones Day law firm, said the complaint filed by the Justice Department to stop the deal failed to show any evidence that customers were concerned about the transaction or produce any documents showing the companies wanted to buy GE's appliance business to avoid competition.

""The deadline for remedies is July 16,"" said the source, who declined to be named because the date is not public knowledge. The Commission is scheduled to decide by Aug. 21 whether to clear the deal.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt has said the company is ready to offload intellectual property rights to some of Alstom's assets but industry players suggest that it may have to do more, such as selling assets. Competition regulators in China, India, Brazil, South Africa and 11 other countries have already waved through the deal without demanding concessions.($1 = 0.9073 euros   (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",2015-07-08,GE,"Wed Jul 8, 2015 | 9:27am EDT",GE has until July 16 to offer EU concessions on Alstom deal - source,http://www.reuters.com//article/alstom-general-electric-eu-idUSL8N0ZO2OW20150708?type=companyNews

718,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  Three months after General Electric Co (GE.N) shares posted their biggest one-day jump in six years, the stock has lost much of those gains and analysts say the company needs to show its industrial operations can generate stronger profits.GE is to report second-quarter results on Friday, and analysts on average are forecasting earnings before one-time items of 28 cents per share, down from 39 cents a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Since GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt announced in April that the conglomerate would largely exit its financial services businesses, investors are zeroing in on the remaining industrial operations.""I want to see operating metrics improve on the industrial side,"" said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory, which holds GE shares. Atop DeGan's list is progress with margins, orders, revenue growth and administrative cost cuts. GE shares have receded 6 percent since the company's announcement it would exit most of GE Capital. The company has faced regulatory pushback to two deals designed to spur its industrial manufacturing focus, while global growth concerns have undercut shares of GE and its multinational rivals.Wall Street is bracing for tepid financial performance overall this quarter for diversified industrial companies. Investors will seek signs that recent stock market upheaval in China could stall growth there, the world's second largest economy, further weakening prospects.""We see little reason for optimism"" in the quarter, Goldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie said in a report. Revenue at more than 20 diversified manufacturers is only expected to grow 0.2 percent on average in the quarter, excluding effects of foreign exchange and acquisitions, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray. That would be the worst performance in more than two years.The picture is particularly bleak for those supplying to the oil sector, which has cut capital expenditures as a result of the drop in oil prices. Revenue is expected to drop 2.2 percent for oil-exposed manufacturers, according to Dray. GE, which provides equipment to oil and gas customers, is expected to report a 14 percent decline in revenue for its oil segment, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe. But Coe projects a nearly 6 percent revenue increase in GE's power and water division, helped by gas and wind turbine shipments.GE wants to expand its power division with its proposed 12.4 billion euro ($13.6 billion) purchase of Alstom's  (ALSO.PA) energy business. The deal has met resistance from European antitrust regulators, and investors will be eager to understand any potential concessions from GE.

""The organic growth rates were quite compelling in various parts of the industrial segment."" GE posted an overall second-quarter net loss of $1.36 billion, or 13 cents per share. For the second consecutive quarter, results were weighed down by charges related to GE's decision to sell some $200 billion worth of financial services businesses announced in April.Excluding one-time items and the finance businesses that GE plans to exit, the company posted operating earnings of 31 cents per share. That beat analysts' average estimate of 28 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 1.5 percent to $32.75 billion. For GE's industrial businesses, revenue was $26.9 billion, roughly unchanged from the year-ago quarter as four of seven segments grew.  Sales of GE's power and water unit, which sells a variety of power turbines, rose 8 percent, while its oil and gas segment saw sales dropped 15 percent. Like other suppliers to the energy sector, GE is vulnerable to a sharp slide in oil prices as customers reduce capital expenditures.    Profit margins for the industrial businesses expanded to 16.2 percent from 15.5 percent a year ago, helped by cost cuts. GE expects industrial operating earnings in a range of $1.13 to $1.20 this year, raising the low end from $1.10.""Since the street is at the lower end of this range, we would expect numbers to increase,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe said in a research note.Through Thursday, GE shares had climbed 7 percent so far this year, compared to a 3 percent rise in the S&P 500.

For the second consecutive quarter, results were weighed down by charges related to GE's decision to sell some $200 billion worth of financial services businesses announced in April. Excluding one-time items and the finance businesses that GE plans to exit, the company posted operating earnings of 31 cents per share. That beat analysts' average estimate of 28 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 1.5 percent to $32.75 billion. For GE's industrial businesses, revenue was $26.9 billion, roughly unchanged from the year-ago quarter as four of seven segments grew.Sales of GE's power and water unit, which sells a variety of power turbines, rose 8 percent, while its oil and gas segment saw sales dropped 15 percent. Like other suppliers to the energy sector, GE is vulnerable to a sharp slide in oil prices as customers reduce capital expenditures. Profit margins for the industrial businesses expanded to 16.2 percent from 15.5 percent a year ago, helped by cost cuts.GE expects industrial operating earnings in a range of $1.13 to $1.20 this year, raising the low end from $1.10.""Since the street is at the lower end of this range, we would expect numbers to increase,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe said in a research note.Through Thursday, GE shares had climbed 7 percent so far this year, compared to a 3 percent rise in the S&P 500.

737,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co wants to be a ""sizable"" player in the market for systems that store energy to manage power volatility, a sector the company expects to quadruple to $6 billion by 2020, the head of GE's energy storage business told Reuters.Demand for industrial battery systems is being driven by increasing reliance on intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar power and the potential to add energy to the grid quickly when power needs spike.This need has attracted a wide range of companies, including Elon Musk's Tesla Motors Inc, which said in April it plans to package batteries for use for utilities as well as homes and businesses. ""We believe in the space and its ability to grow,"" Jeff Wyatt, GE's general manager for energy storage, said in a recent interview. ""We think we can be a sizable player within it, and that’s really what we’re intending to do.""GE over the past year has overhauled its approach to the energy storage market, as it saw weaker demand for the battery it developed.Now Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE is repositioning itself as a one-stop shop for power producers seeking to install energy storage systems, offering inverters, control systems, software as well as financing options.Earlier this year, it scaled back production of its own Durathon industrial batteries, reducing its manufacturing workforce from 200 to 50 at the Schenectady, New York plant where the battery is made.

738,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | July 26  July 26 General Electric Co wants to be a ""sizable"" player in the market for systems that store energy to manage power volatility, a sector the company expects to quadruple to $6 billion by 2020, the head of GE's energy storage business told Reuters.Demand for industrial battery systems is being driven by increasing reliance on intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar power and the potential to add energy to the grid quickly when power needs spike.This need has attracted a wide range of companies, including Elon Musk's Tesla Motors Inc, which said in April it plans to package batteries for use for utilities as well as homes and businesses.""We believe in the space and its ability to grow,"" Jeff Wyatt, GE's general manager for energy storage, said in a recent interview. ""We think we can be a sizable player within it, and that's really what we're intending to do.""GE over the past year has overhauled its approach to the energy storage market, as it saw weaker demand for the battery it developed.Now Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE is repositioning itself as a one-stop shop for power producers seeking to install energy storage systems, offering inverters, control systems, software as well as financing options.Earlier this year, it scaled back production of its own Durathon industrial batteries, reducing its manufacturing workforce from 200 to 50 at the Schenectady, New York plant where the battery is made. The company is focused on improving Durathon's longevity, including managing its chemical degradation.As part of its new energy storage package, GE is offering customers the option to install lithium-ion batteries made by other companies.

749,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON General Electric Co is taking steps to shift some U.S. manufacturing work overseas now that the U.S. Export-Import Bank will be shuttered at least until September, the industrial giant's global operations boss told Reuters on Thursday.GE Vice Chairman John Rice said the conglomerate is bidding on over $10 billion worth of projects that require support from an export credit agency (ECA) like Ex-Im.With Ex-Im unable to extend new loans or guarantees thanks to an effort by congressional Republicans to shut it down, GE is arranging with ECAs in other countries to finance the deals involved, with much of the production going to GE plants in those foreign locations. The prospective government partners include Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Hungary, he said.""We're submitting the tenders now. So we are identifying where we'll bid this and the ECA support that comes with it, and it's not in the United States,"" Rice told Reuters in a telephone interview from AtlantaEx-Im has been unable to consider any new financing requests since Congress allowed the bank's charter to expire on June 30. Rice's comments come as the U.S. Congress starts a five-week summer recess with no clear path to revive Ex-Im in the months ahead. A group of conservative Republicans, who say the 81-year-old trade bank is a nest of ""crony capitalism"" that doles out government welfare to GE, Boeing Co and other wealthy corporations, want to keep it closed for good.An effort to revive the bank as part of a multi-year transportation bill won strong support in the U.S. Senate, but stalled this week when the House of Representatives approved a short-term funding extension without the Ex-Im provision.Boeing chairman Jim McNerney on Wednesday said the aircraft maker was actively looking at moving ""key pieces"" of its operations to other countries that could offer export credits. Rice, who is based in Hong Kong, said GE is not moving to shift work and jobs overseas ""just to make a point"" to Congress, but to win contracts that require export credit agency support. ""We're doing this because if we don't, we can't submit a valid tender,"" he said.In one such power-sector bid, for example, GE would do final assembly work on its aero-derivative gas turbine power generation units at GE plants in Hungary or China instead of a factory in Houston. It already has capacity in place, and export credit agencies willing to support the work, he said.   ""Next year, if we win this bid, work that would have been in Houston will be someplace else,"" Rice said.GE also is seeking financing from another country's export credit agency to save a $350 million locomotive deal with Angola that has lost access to Ex-Im support, Rice said.Ex-Im opponents say the private sector will innovate to fill any void left by Ex-Im. ""The sky hasn't fallen"" since Ex-Im halted lending, Ted Cruz, the Republican senator and presidential candidate, said earlier this month.But Rice said more business will move overseas if Ex-Im stays dead.""The people who are on the other side of this don't really understand how global business is conducted,"" he said.

751,"  * H1 rev 8.40 bln euros, up 5 pct on comparable basis* Adjusted recurring operating income 1.17 bln euros* Sees 2015 op income up mid-teens pct vs low double-digits   (Adds CEO comments)PARIS, July 30 France's Safran revised its core profit forecast higher on Thursday as it reported a stronger-than-expected 22.5 percent rise in first-half operating income, buoyed by civil jet engine overhauls.The aerospace and defence group said it expects 2015  operating income to rise by a percentage in the mid-teens instead of the low double-digits. Its main revenue and cashflow targets were left unchanged.Together with General Electric, Safran co-owns the world's biggest jet engine maker by annual units sold, CFM International.Safran's closely watched civil aftermarket revenue rose 27.8 percent in dollar terms in the first half as recent versions of CFM56 narrowbody engines and large GE90 engines started coming in for overhaul. ""The (aftermarket) trend we have seen since the beginning of the year should be maintained throughout 2015,"" Chief Executive  Philippe Petitcolin told reporters, noting however that the year-on-year comparison would be tougher in the second half.Safran revised up its 2015 target for growth in such revenue to a percentage in the high teens from around 10 percent.Analysts welcomed the surge, while noting it depended in part on deferred maintenance that would not last indefinitely. The aftermarket figures ""should go a long way towards removing concerns about whether Safran was vulnerable to a slowdown in this segment of the market,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts Rob Stallard said in a note.PRODUCTION TARGETS  With the help of a strong dollar, Safran posted a 16.6 percent rise in first-half revenue to 8.40 billion euros ($9.2 billion). On a comparable basis, revenue grew 5 percent. First-half adjusted recurring operating income was 1.17 billion euros.Petitcolin, presenting his first results since becoming CEO in April, said Safran was mobilised to meet ambitious production targets. However he reiterated the group was not prepared to go beyond what it had already promised to Airbus and Boeing.After a boom in plane orders, CFM has sold 9,580 of its new LEAP engines and faces a steep climb in production after they enter service with Airbus in 2016, followed by Boeing in 2017.Safran and GE last month warned Airbus and Boeing against hiking production too quickly, saying they would need time to study the risks of going beyond current goals that are equivalent to 50 to 52 single-aisle jets a month per planemaker.Safran's first-half net profit grew sharply to 1.16 billion euros from 616 million, helped by a gain from selling its main block of shares in Ingenico.Safran said it had sold a further residual stake of 2.2 million shares in the payments technology maker to an unnamed financial institution and would receive proceeds by year-end.

754,"  WARSAW, July 31 Caixabank is not planning any acquisitions outside Spain, the lender's chief executive said on Friday, denying reports it is bidding for General Electric's (GE) Polish Bank BPH.Earlier on Friday, Polish daily Puls Biznesu said Caixabank, Italy's UniCredit, Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki and local insurer PZU were all in the race for BPH, Poland's No. 11 lender in terms of assets. ""We're not looking for acquisitions outside Spain,"" Caixabank CEO Gonzalo Gortazar said during a webcast with analysts, according to a spokesman for Caixabank. Three banking sources, however, said the Puls Biznesu report was accurate. PZU, BPH, GE, UniCredit and the press office for Czarnecki, who controls Polish financial group Getin Noble Bank, all declined to comment.

755,"  * Pekao says did not submit offer to buy smaller competitor BPH* GE wants to sell its Polish lender BPH worth $840 mln* The only interested parties are PZU and billionaire CzarneckiBy Marcin GoclowskiWARSAW, Aug 4 Central Europe's largest insurer PZU and Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki are the only players left in the race to buy Polish Bank BPH  from General Electric (GE), with PZU seen as the most likely winner.A source close to Czarnecki, who controls Polish banking group Getin Holding, told Reuters that he was still in the game to buy Bank BPH. Another source said that PZU was very interested.Czarnecki's press office, PZU and Bank BPH all declined to comment. Sources said last week that Italy's UniCredit and Spain's Caixabank were also interested in buying BPH, Poland's No. 11 lender in terms of assets worth $840 million.But Caixabank said on Friday that it was not planning any acquisitions outside Spain, while Unicredit's Polish unit Bank Pekao said on Tuesday that it had not filed a bid to buy BPH and nor had its Italian parent.Poland's banking sector has been one of the healthiest and most profitable in Europe but now faces lower profits due to an expected banking tax, record low interest rates and increased fees for a bank guarantee fund. Additionally, the government plans a scheme to convert households' Swiss franc-denominated loans partly at banks' expense - a move that could cost lenders billions of zlotys, and prompt some foreign players to withdraw from Poland.Banking analysts doubt that financial regulator KNF would allow Czarnecki to take over another bank as his group is already burdened with a large Swiss franc mortgage portfolio.That leaves PZU as the only serious buyer, analysts say. PZU's Chief Executive, Andrzej Klesyk, said last month that he wants to create a top five Polish lender and PZU would have to buy up to four banks to achieve that goal.The state-controlled insurer has already acquired a 25 percent stake in Alior Bank.PZU's acquisition plan is backed by the ruling Civic Platform party, while the opposition Law and Justice party, which is leading in opinion polls ahead of a parliamentary election in October, is in favour of a so-called ""repolonisation"" of the banking sector aimed at curbing foreign ownership, now at about 60 percent.General Electric put BPH up for sale last October. It did not give a price indication, but BPH's market capitalisation has shrunk by more than a tenth since then in U.S. dollar terms.A financial sector source told Reuters in July that PZU could sign a preliminary agreement to buy BPH this year as GE was under pressure to sell as many of its financial arm's assets as possible this year.

777,"  (Wraps FX loan conversion stories, adds quotes and background)WARSAW Aug 25 Polish banks' foreign owners plan to seek compensation for any losses incurred by their operations from a bill on Swiss franc-denominated mortgages, according to letters they sent to Poland's Senate.Poland's lower house of Parliament passed a draft law this month that would allow nearly half of holders of Swiss franc mortgages - whose repayments have spiralled due to a surge in the Swiss currency - to convert their loans to zlotys at the banks' cost.On Tuesday, the Senate published letters it had received from U.S. conglomerate General Electric (GE) and Germany's Commerzbank, owners of Poland's Bank BPH  and mBank, respectively, criticising the proposed bill.Commerzbank's Chief Executive, Martin Blessing, and Chief Financial Officer, Stephan Engels, said in a letter to Poland's Senate, prime minister and finance minister, that the bill would infringe EU law, as well as the Polish constitution. ""The effects of the bill for the Polish banking sector, especially for mBank, will be very damaging. Commerzbank will consider further steps and legal actions,"" they said in the letter.GE Capital's Chief Executive, Keith Sherin, in a separate letter, said that GE would seek ""full compensation for any damage caused by the adoption and signing of the bill.""Germany's Deutsche Bank, owner of Deutsche Bank Polska, also sent a letter to the Senate, saying the bill ""would undermine the stability and predictability of the investment environment in Poland and the free movement of capital in the European single market"", according to an email the bank sent to Reuters. More than half a million Poles took out home loans in Swiss francs, mostly between 2007 and 2008, hoping to benefit from low interest rates. Since then, the franc has risen by more than 80 percent against the zloty, trapping owners in homes whose value is well below the zloty market price.Polish lenders, also including PKO, Banco Santander's BZ WBK, Getin Noble Bank, and Millennium, hold Swiss franc portfolios worth 144 billion zlotys ($39.1 billion), about 8 percent of Poland's gross domestic product (GDP). According to a Reuters source, Millennium's owner, Portugal's Millennium bcp, also sent a similar letter to parliament. Millennium bcp was not immediately available for comment.The bill, which will now be voted by the Senate and return to the lower house, imposes 90 percent of the cost of converting the mortgages on banks.The central bank has estimated it will cost banks more than $5 billion, much more than an original draft which had envisaged splitting the cost equally between lenders and clients, but was amended on the insistence of opposition parties.The Polish financial watchdog and the central bank have both voiced concerns about the bill, but Swiss-franc borrowers may be seen as a big enough influence group in a general election year. Poland will hold parliamentary elections in October.

DSCA said the proposed upgrades and refurbishment of the 50 helicopters would allow Britain to work more closely and seamlessly with U.S. forces. It said Britain would use the Apache helicopters to conduct various missions, including counter-terrorism and counter-piracy operations.

786,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co is expected to win regulatory approval next week for its purchase of the power equipment business of France's Alstom, allowing the U.S. industrial conglomerate to finally carry out a major cost-cutting program 16 months after first announcing the deal.The European Commission has set a Sept. 11 deadline to decide on the roughly $13.5 billion deal, the biggest acquisition ever for GE, which will bring together two of the world’s largest manufacturers of power plant hardware. European regulators have expressed concerns over the combined company's control of the gas turbine market. GE has not disclosed what changes it has agreed to make to win clearance from European competition regulators.In May, GE told investors it expects $3 billion in cost reductions over the next five years as it combines its operations with those of Alstom, more than double the previous target when the deal was first announced in April 2014. GE has also projected the deal would add 15 to 20 cents per share to earnings in 2018, or nearly 10 percent of GE's overall profit expected that year by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   To hit those goals, GE will consolidate manufacturing operations, cut duplicated overheads, and make savings on purchasing expenses, according to GE presentations on the deal. But to gain the blessing of the French government last year, GE committed to add 1,000 jobs in the country, possibly handcuffing the conglomerate's ability to reap savings from Alstom's home base.Outside of France, GE said last year that 18,000 of Alstom's 65,000 total employees involved in the deal worked in Europe, where works councils can make job cuts difficult.""The challenges in making it work is you’re buying a huge European-centric organization, and history has said it’s hard to get synergies in Europe,"" said Peter Bates, portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price's global industrials fund, adding that he still thinks GE will be able to pull off the integration. GE is also in the middle of its own cost cutting plans, which aim to reduce industrial sales and administrative expenses to 12 percent of revenue, from just under 16 percent in 2013, while improving gross margin by about 0.5 percentage points in 2015 and 2016.Meanwhile, GE has stressed the benefits of having Alstom as part of its operations. The French company has a strong franchise in steam turbines and sells equipment GE has previously lacked, such as heat recovery steam generators. Those are needed for ""combined cycle"" power plants that increase efficiency by using both gas and steam turbines. Such plants are expected to account for more than 70 percent of future gas turbine purchases, GE said last year.GE also stands to profit from servicing Alstom-made equipment. RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray says service revenue could be the ""jewel"" of the deal, noting that GE's service margins for thermal equipment are nearly twice those of Alstom's.  GE still has obstacles to climb. Sluggish global economic growth could temper power demand in the near term, especially in emerging markets, and undercut revenue prospects. Meanwhile, Alstom's financial performance has weakened as the deal has been reviewed, with sales in its energy business down 7 percent and orders down 12 percent in its most recent fiscal year.""Even with some top-line risk, they should be able to make the deal work based on the cost synergies,"" UBS analyst Shannon O'Callaghan said.

791,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  The head of General Electric Co's (GE.N) power division said on Tuesday the company will come ""out of the box very strong"" as it seeks to wring out $3 billion in cost savings over five years from its acquisition of Alstom's energy business (ALSO.PA).The deal with France's Alstom, cleared by European Union regulators earlier on Tuesday, will add up to 65,000 employees to GE's current workforce of about 305,000, and significantly expand GE's reach in the global market for power generation equipment.Steve Bolze, head of GE's power business, called the Alstom acquisition a ""game changer."" ""We’re positioned to be the broadest base power supplier with the largest installed base of services,"" Bolze told Reuters in an interview shortly after EU regulators approved the deal.Bolze said GE employees know how the combined company will be shaped, ""so that people know how we're going to hit the ground, day one, on organization."" A GE spokesman said the company has not indicated how many jobs could be cut through the Alstom deal, only that the company has committed to adding 1,000 jobs in France.Investors will be tracking GE's efforts to deliver promised cost savings. Alstom's large base in Europe, where works councils can make job cuts difficult, could pose obstacles for GE's plans. The weaker economic outlook, especially in emerging markets,  presents another challenge by potentially crimping power demand.""We see the world as complicated,"" Bolze said. However, over the long term, global power demand is expected to rise by 50 percent over the next 20 to 25 years, he said.The Alstom acquisition is a key part of the U.S. conglomerate's move away from financial services into big-ticket industrial products.   GE shares closed up 4 percent at $24.96 after the European approval was announced, the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrials index .DJI.GE has some regulatory hurdles left, but Bolze said the company plans to close the deal ""as early as possible"" in the fourth quarter.""At this point, we see clear path to closing and we’re ready to roll."" To win EU approval, GE agreed to sell off more Alstom assets and service agreements than originally proposed. That was one of several factors that contributed to a change in the purchase price to 8.5 billion euros ($9.5 billion) from the original 12.35 billion-euro ($13.8 billion) price tag GE put on the deal. GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in May that the company would reject any EU demand to give up highly profitable service business. But Bolze said divested service contracts affected only a small part of Alstom's total base of 750 gas turbines.""Everything we need in terms of expanding and growing the service franchise - all intact,” he said.Bolze, 52, is a potential candidate to succeed Immelt, 59, and leading the integration of Alstom will be a high-profile test, analysts say. Bolze said he is focused on the task at hand. ""The rest of the things will be resolved by the board.""

793,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS General Electric (GE.N) has won EU approval for its 12.4-billion-euro ($13.9 billion) acquisition of Alstom's (ALSO.PA) power business after agreeing to sell some of the French company's turbine assets to Italian rival Ansaldo Energia.EU officials said the concessions allayed concerns that the deal would reduce competition in the European market for heavy-duty gas turbines to two major players, namely the merged company and Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE), potentially leading to higher prices and pushing up the cost of electricity. The U.S. conglomerate's acquisition of Alstom's energy business - its largest deal ever - will bring together two of the world's biggest manufacturers of power plant hardware and is crucial to GE's plans to increase its focus on industrial operations and shift away from finance.    The EU decision, as well as creating a major new player in the sector in Ansaldo, will allow GE to press ahead with a cost-cutting programme. It told investors in May it expects $3 billion in cost reductions over the next five years as it combines its operations with those of Alstom.The deal has been approved by regulators elsewhere, including in the United States on Tuesday. But overcoming the European hurdle will nevertheless come as a relief to GE, as EU officials stymied its $42 billion offer for Honeywell International 14 years ago despite U.S. clearance. Both Alstom and GE said they expected to finalise the deal as early as possible in the fourth quarter.The head of GE's Power & Water division described the acquisition as a ""transformational deal"" as GE focuses more on big-ticket industrial products. Alstom comes with about 500 gigawatts of installed power around the world, while it has taken GE ""since the days of Thomas Edison"" to build up its 1,000 gigawatts of installed power generation, Steve Bolze said in an interview.CONCESSIONS Under GE's concessions, it will divest Alstom's heavy-duty turbine product line and the technology it is developing for very large turbines to Ansaldo, of which Italian state-backed investment fund Fondo Strategico Italiano and China's Shanghai Electric (601727.SS) each own 40 percent. The U.S. conglomerate will also sell Alstom's service contracts for 34 installed turbines and its U.S.-based subsidiary Power System Manufacturing to Ansaldo [ANSD.UL].European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ansaldo was already an established player in the heavy-duty gas turbine market and, with the addition of Alstom's assets, would be able to replace Alstom's role in the market.Kepler Cheuvreux analyst William Mackie said Ansaldo had been given the means to become a significant player along GE and Siemens as it was ""going to be offered some of the latest technology - in the GT26 and GT36 - in and around large gas turbines"".Credit Suisse analysts said the GE concessions were also positive for Shanghai Electric, as through Ansaldo acquiring Alstom assets it would gain a strong footing in the European and the U.S. gas turbine market. ""Traditionally the Chinese thermal equipment manufacturers have had very limited gas turbine technology,"" they added. Vestager pointed to the cordial ties with her U.S. counterparts working on the case, contrasting it with the turmoil when the Commission blocked GE's Honeywell deal.""We have gone a very, very long way with transatlantic cooperation since GE tried to acquire Honeywell at the beginning of the millennium. Things have changed.""Reuters reported on Aug. 14 that the GE-Alstom deal would be approved with conditions.

But overcoming the European hurdle will nevertheless come as a relief to GE, as EU officials stymied its $42 billion offer for Honeywell International 14 years ago despite U.S. clearance.Both Alstom and GE said they expected to finalise the deal as early as possible in the fourth quarter.The head of GE's Power & Water division described the acquisition as a ""transformational deal"" as GE focuses more on big-ticket industrial products.Alstom comes with about 500 gigawatts of installed power around the world, while it has taken GE ""since the days of Thomas Edison"" to build up its 1,000 gigawatts of installed power generation, Steve Bolze said in an interview. CONCESSIONS Under GE's concessions, it will divest Alstom's heavy-duty turbine product line and the technology it is developing for very large turbines to Ansaldo, of which Italian state-backed investment fund Fondo Strategico Italiano and China's Shanghai Electric each own 40 percent.The U.S. conglomerate will also sell Alstom's service contracts for 34 installed turbines and its U.S.-based subsidiary Power System Manufacturing to Ansaldo. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ansaldo was already an established player in the heavy-duty gas turbine market and, with the addition of Alstom's assets, would be able to replace Alstom's role in the market.Kepler Cheuvreux analyst William Mackie said Ansaldo had been given the means to become a significant player along GE and Siemens as it was ""going to be offered some of the latest technology - in the GT26 and GT36 - in and around large gas turbines"".Credit Suisse analysts said the GE concessions were also positive for Shanghai Electric, as through Ansaldo acquiring Alstom assets it would gain a strong footing in the European and the U.S. gas turbine market.""Traditionally the Chinese thermal equipment manufacturers have had very limited gas turbine technology,"" they added.Vestager pointed to the cordial ties with her U.S. counterparts working on the case, contrasting it with the turmoil when the Commission blocked GE's Honeywell deal.""We have gone a very, very long way with transatlantic cooperation since GE tried to acquire Honeywell at the beginning of the millennium. Things have changed.""Reuters reported on Aug. 14 that the GE-Alstom deal would be approved with conditions.($1 = 0.8949 euros)   (Additional reporting by Dominique Vidalon and Tommaso Mazzanti in Paris, and Lewis Krauskopf in New york; Editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Pravin Char)",2015-09-08,GE,"Tue Sep 8, 2015 | 2:05pm EDT",UPDATE 2-GE clears final hurdle to $14 bln Alstom deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/alstom-ma-general-electric-eu-idUSL5N11E39I20150908?type=companyNews

806,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Thursday it would seek to sell its asset management arm to an investment management firm, as the U.S. conglomerate further sharpens its focus on industrial products.GE Asset Management had $115 billion in assets under management as of June 30, according to GE, and manages retirement plans for the vast majority of GE's 136,000 U.S. employees as well as assets for outside institutional investors including third-party retirement plans.The plan to unload the asset management arm comes after GE announced in April it would seek to sell some $200 billion of its GE Capital assets as it moves away from financial services and focuses more on manufacturing jet engines, power turbines and other big-ticket industrial equipment. GE Asset Management is separate from GE Capital.The company said proceeds from the transaction would be deposited into the GE Pension Trust, increasing trust assets used to pay GE pension plan benefits. GE said in its annual filing that the GE Pension Plan was underfunded by $15.8 billion at the end of last year, compared to $4.7 billion as of the end of 2013. GE will retain responsibilities as plan sponsor following any sale, and is appointing an independent fiduciary to review the transaction.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said there had been ""significant interest"" over time from investment firms in acquiring the business. ""As we continue to transform GE to focus on our industrial core, now is the right time to explore such a sale,"" Immelt said in a statement.  Assets in GE's principal pension plans earned 5.9 percent last year, according to the company's annual report. Average annual returns through last year were 9 percent over five years, 5.9 percent over 10 years and 8.4 percent over 25 years. The company said in the annual report it assumed a long-term expected return of 7.5 percent.The average return for the top 100 U.S. corporate pension plans was 10.9 percent in 2014, according to benefit consulting firm Milliman. According to Morningstar, a group of 17 funds GE manages for outside investors and amounting to about $17 billion in assets ranked on average in the top 35 percent compared with similar funds, based on the past 10 years' performance.    GE Asset Management has about 300 employees, most in Stamford, Connecticut, where the unit is based.GE said it hired Credit Suisse as its investment banker in the transaction.

810,"  (Adds fund performance information)By Lewis KrauskopfSept 10 General Electric Co said on Thursday it would seek to sell its asset management arm to an investment management firm, as the U.S. conglomerate further sharpens its focus on industrial products.GE Asset Management had $115 billion in assets under management as of June 30, according to GE, and manages retirement plans for the vast majority of GE's 136,000 U.S. employees as well as assets for outside institutional investors including third-party retirement plans.The plan to unload the asset management arm comes after GE announced in April it would seek to sell some $200 billion of its GE Capital assets as it moves away from financial services and focuses more on manufacturing jet engines, power turbines and other big-ticket industrial equipment. GE Asset Management is separate from GE Capital.The company said proceeds from the transaction would be deposited into the GE Pension Trust, increasing trust assets used to pay GE pension plan benefits. GE said in its annual filing that the GE Pension Plan was underfunded by $15.8 billion at the end of last year, compared to $4.7 billion as of the end of 2013.GE will retain responsibilities as plan sponsor following any sale, and is appointing an independent fiduciary to review the transaction. GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said there had been ""significant interest"" over time from investment firms in acquiring the business.""As we continue to transform GE to focus on our industrial core, now is the right time to explore such a sale,"" Immelt said in a statement.Assets in GE's principal pension plans earned 5.9 percent last year, according to the company's annual report. Average annual returns through last year were 9 percent over five years, 5.9 percent over 10 years and 8.4 percent over 25 years. The company said in the annual report it assumed a long-term expected return of 7.5 percent. The average return for the top 100 U.S. corporate pension plans was 10.9 percent in 2014, according to benefit consulting firm Milliman.According to Morningstar, a group of 17 funds GE manages for outside investors and amounting to about $17 billion in assets ranked on average in the top 35 percent compared with similar funds, based on the past 10 years' performance.GE Asset Management has about 300 employees, most in Stamford, Connecticut, where the unit is based.GE said it hired Credit Suisse as its investment banker in the transaction.

The deal will support GE bids for international power projects. U.S. plants in Greenville, South Carolina; Schenectady, New York; and Bangor, Maine, will lose out on those jobs if GE wins the power bids, a GE spokeswoman said.GE also said 100 additional final assembly jobs for smaller turbine generator sets derived from aircraft engines will move next year from outside of Houston to Hungary and China. No U.S. facility will close, a GE spokeswoman said.The company is bidding on $11 billion worth of international power projects that require export credit agency financing, including some in Indonesia.The announcement rang alarm bells on Capitol Hill as lawmakers, still ramping up from a long summer recess, searched for a strategy to revive the trade bank after letting its charter expire on June 30. ""This is what happens when Congress sits idly by while thousands of jobs are on the line,"" said Republican Representative Stephen Fincher, who has led efforts to revive EXIM in the House of Representatives. The lack of clarity on whether EXIM will ever resume lending has companies scrambling to make alternative plans.

""There are many other companies other than us that are impacted by this.""Boeing Co (BA.N), EXIM's biggest beneficiary, on Tuesday said it lost a second signed or potential satellite deal as Singapore's Kacific said it would not consider the bid without EXIM guarantees.

""If EXIM isn't going to happen, or it's going to be a regular fight to be reauthorized, we've got to make other plans,"" he said.Conservative Republicans in Congress, led by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, successfully blocked EXIM's renewal and are trying to kill the 81-year-old trade lender for good, charging that it represents ""corporate welfare"" and puts U.S. taxpayers at risk.Four House Democrats sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner reminding him that a majority of House members and 65 senators support EXIM, and urged that a compromise be worked out.But Boehner, mindful of his party's strong conservative faction, has said little about his intentions for EXIM's future, even though he has backed the bank in the past.

827,"   By David Lawder and Lewis Krauskopf | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Turning up the pressure on Congress to revive the U.S. Export-Import Bank, General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Thursday it would open a new development center for turboprop engines in Europe because it cannot access U.S. export financing.The GE's move was the latest effort by a big company to raise the alarm in Washington about the shutdown of new financing by EXIM, so far with little evident impact on Congress.   GE said the $400-million turboprop project would create 500 to 1,000 jobs. It said it will develop, test and produce engines for larger aircraft, a new market for GE Aviation.The largest U.S. industrial conglomerate also said it will invest $55 million in Celma, Brazil, to build a new engine testing facility, and will spend $23 million on expanding its engine testing capability in Winnipeg, Canada.Several European locations are being considered for the turboprop center, including in the Czech Republic, where GE now builds turboprop engines for small aircraft, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said. Talks are underway with export credit agencies in those countries for financing and loan guarantees. GE stopped considering U.S. locations for the new facility after Congress allowed EXIM's charter to expire on June 30, the result of a campaign by conservative Republicans against the bank, which they say exemplifies ""corporate welfare.""On Tuesday, GE announced plans to shift up to 500 U.S. power turbine manufacturing jobs to Europe and China because it can no longer access EXIM financing.The warning shots, along with a visit by GE Chairman Jeff Immelt to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, thus far have not jolted Congress into action to revive EXIM. House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling and a vocal group of other conservative Republicans have blocked legislation to reauthorize the 81-year-old bank. House Republican lawmakers said on Thursday there have been no discussions of trying to attach EXIM legislation to a spending bill needed to keep the government open past Sept. 30.GE has said it is bidding on $11 billion worth of international projects that require export credit agency financing and has started talks with several foreign export credit agencies since EXIM's lending authority expired.Kennedy said EXIM's closure would put GE Aviation at a competitive disadvantage with its rival in the turboprop business, Pratt & Whitney Canada, a division of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), because Pratt can provide government-backed credit assistance from Canada to its customers. GE Aviation employs 25,000 U.S. workers, including 9,000 in the southwest Ohio area where the division is headquartered.Those facilities are close to the Ohio district represented by Republican House Speaker John Boehner. He has supported EXIM in the past, but has been largely silent about whether he will allow renwal legislation to proceed. ""The only commitment the speaker has made is to give Chairman Hensarling the opportunity to amend any Senate-passed vehicle that may include Ex-Im,"" said Boehner spokeswoman Emily Schillinger. ""Chairman Hensarling asked the speaker for this consideration and he agreed to it.""

829,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON More U.S. companies are considering moving plants overseas given concerns about the shutdown of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the largest U.S. aerospace trade group said Friday, a day after General Electric Co (GE.N) announced plans to build a $400 million turboprop engine plant in Europe.David Melcher, president of the Aerospace Industries Association, said he expected similar announcements from Boeing Co (BA.N) and other companies, which are already losing business due to lack of access to U.S. trade credits.""Any company that has traditionally depended on EXIM financing as part of their strategy to sell internationally will start to hedge their bets with thoughts of moving their business overseas where they can get that support from a different government,"" Melcher told Reuters in an interview.Melcher said AIA, which lobbies Congress on behalf of its member companies, was actively engaged in the fight to resurrect EXIM after its charter expired at the end of June. GE, Boeing and others argue that a campaign by conservative Republicans against the bank is damaging U.S. competitiveness. Boeing, EXIM's biggest beneficiary, this week said it had lost a second satellite deal because of the issue. EXIM opponents say the bank represents ""corporate welfare"" and puts U.S. taxpayers at risk. Supporters argue that it actually brings in money for federal coffers, and levels the playing field for U.S. firms when they compete against rivals that have access to trade credits from other countries.Citing its lack of access to U.S. export financing, GE this week said it would open a new turboprop engine plant in Europe, and would shift up to 500 U.S. power turbine manufacturing jobs to Europe and China. Boeing Chairman Jim McNerney in July said his company was looking at moving operations to other countries, but no specific plans have yet been announced.Melcher said the news from GE and Boeing ""may just be the tip of the iceberg because they’re big enough to do it quickly.""He said many smaller companies that benefited from trade credits offered by EXIM were also facing lost orders. Melcher said he remained confident that Congress would ultimately revive the bank. He said enough lawmakers supported the measure, if only House Speaker John Boehner would allow the measure to be brought for a vote.""There will be a small faction of disgruntled conservative Republican who won’t like it, but they ... they won’t be the majority in a vote,"" he said.

838,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co (GE.N) has struck a deal for up to $12 billion in financing from Britain's export credit agency, possibly creating as many as 1,000 jobs in the country.The deal, announced on Thursday, could be seen as the latest sign of U.S. exporters' unhappiness at the winding down of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which lent money to foreign customers of U.S. exporters. Its charter lapsed on June 30 after conservatives in the U.S. Congress cast it as a promoter of ""crony capitalism."" GE is already shifting jobs overseas because of the lack of U.S. export financing and plane-maker Boeing Co (BA.N), the largest U.S. exporter, is threatening to do the same. Boeing chairman Jim McNerney said on Thursday it was ""inevitable"" that his company would move work offshore if Ex-Im is not allowed to lend. He said he believed the bank ultimately would be reauthorized. It is unclear how much business the United States stands to lose with the closure of Ex-Im, or how many companies will follow GE's lead. Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution think-tank, said GE's moves could be a ""trial balloon"" designed to test the response from Washington. ""If the federal government doesn’t respond to this, it is going to be far more widespread,"" he said.GE's deal with UK Export Finance, a department of the UK government, would support orders for oil and gas and other energy projects in Brazil, Ghana, India, Mozambique and other countries. The jobs are dependent on GE winning bids for the work. Only last week, GE cited the absence of Ex-Im financing when it announced plans to shift up to 500 U.S. power-turbine manufacturing jobs to Europe and China.

839,"  (Adds economist comment)By Lewis KrauskopfSept 24 General Electric Co has struck a deal for up to $12 billion in financing from Britain's export credit agency, possibly creating as many as 1,000 jobs in the country.The deal, announced on Thursday, could be seen as the latest sign of U.S. exporters' unhappiness at the winding down of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which lent money to foreign customers of U.S. exporters. Its charter lapsed on June 30 after conservatives in the U.S. Congress cast it as a promoter of ""crony capitalism.""GE is already shifting jobs overseas because of the lack of U.S. export financing and plane-maker Boeing Co, the largest U.S. exporter, is threatening to do the same. Boeing chairman Jim McNerney said on Thursday it was ""inevitable"" that his company would move work offshore if Ex-Im is not allowed to lend. He said he believed the bank ultimately would be reauthorized.It is unclear how much business the United States stands to lose with the closure of Ex-Im, or how many companies will follow GE's lead. Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution think-tank, said GE's moves could be a ""trial balloon"" designed to test the response from Washington. ""If the federal government doesn't respond to this, it is going to be far more widespread,"" he said.GE's deal with UK Export Finance, a department of the UK government, would support orders for oil and gas and other energy projects in Brazil, Ghana, India, Mozambique and other countries. The jobs are dependent on GE winning bids for the work. Only last week, GE cited the absence of Ex-Im financing when it announced plans to shift up to 500 U.S. power-turbine manufacturing jobs to Europe and China. It also stopped considering U.S. locations for a new development center for turboprop engines, selecting Europe instead.Regarding Thursday's UK deal, a GE spokeswoman said it was unlikely that GE would have made the investments in the United States even if Ex-Im had been operating, but the agreement was representative of the type of opportunities GE can no longer pursue in the U.S. while the bank is closed.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, who has been campaigning for reauthorization of Ex-Im, in a statement praised Britain as ""pro-export and pro-manufacturing,"" saying that ""in today's competitive environment, countries that have a functional export credit agency will attract investment.""U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, who has led conservative Republicans in halting Ex-Im, said on Thursday that Congress should focus on reforming taxes and regulations, which together ""will do far more to help our exporters and grow our economy than Ex-Im's taxpayer-provided subsidies ever could.""

841,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Monday it will move production of large, gas-powered engines to Canada from Wisconsin, along with 350 jobs, to access export financing no longer available in the United States. In its latest salvo aimed at persuading Congress to renew the U.S. Export-Import Bank's charter which expired in June, GE will invest $265 million in a new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant at a Canadian location yet to be determined.The facility, to open in about 20 months, can be expanded to provide flexible manufacturing capacity to support other GE businesses, including engines for railroad locomotives, GE said.In exchange for moving the production from Waukesha, Wisconsin, Export Development Canada will provide financing support for a range of future products, including some still made in the United States. These are expected to come from GE's Water & Power, Oil & Gas and Transportation units, a GE spokeswoman said.  At the 106-year-old Waukesha plant, GE builds piston engines for power and oilfield use that run on natural gas or methane from landfills. But these engines are not typically sold with EXIM financing, so the move is more aimed at finding government export credit for other businesses, the GE spokeswoman said.The company also acknowledged that the recent downturn in oil and gas drilling activity was a factor in the decision to end engine manufacturing in Waukesha.     The announcement stands in sharp contrast to a 2014 visit to the site by President Barack Obama, in which he touted its worker training program as ""a model for the country.""""I'd say the workers at Waukesha are the real world casualties in the right-wing fight to close the EXIM Bank,"" said Frank Larkin, a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists, which represents plant workers.Republican Representative James Sensenbrenner, who represents Waukesha and opposes EXIM ""in its current form,"" said in a statement that the move was a ""sober reminder of the urgent need to stay competitive in the global marketplace"" and called for lower corporate tax rates. In recent weeks, GE has announced several deals to locate  thousands of new jobs out of the United States following EXIM's closure and to access government export credit from the United Kingdom, France, Hungary and China. GE Vice Chairman John Rice told Reuters that foreign export credit agencies are ""rolling out the red carpet"" for the industrial conglomerate, more than tripling the export financing capacity it received under EXIM.

843,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Alcoa Inc (AA.N) said Monday it will break itself in two, separating a faster growing plane and car parts business from traditional aluminum smelting operations as shareholders seek higher returns amid a commodity slump.  Pressured by a 42 percent drop in its share price this year and a surge in Chinese aluminum exports, Alcoa is joining a wave of major corporations which recently have sought to break up to add shareholder value, such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N).Alcoa shares rose 2.4 percent to $9.29 as analysts applauded its intensified focus on products for expanding businesses like aerospace and auto. The 127-year-old company was the biggest percentage gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 index, as U.S. stocks slumped broadly on Monday.A global glut of aluminum, which has depressed prices, has battered Alcoa stock, driving the company's market value this year down to about $12 billion. ""Alcoa has faced this problem for decades: No matter what they have done to enhance their product line, their stock has traded based on metal prices,"" said analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research.In another stark example of such a link, Glencore (GLEN.L) shares tumbled almost 30 percent to close at an all-time low on Monday, on fears that the mining and trading company was not doing enough to rein in its debt to withstand a prolonged fall in global metals prices.Alcoa's traditional business, which also includes better-performing bauxite and alumina, will retain the Alcoa name. The newer company is still unnamed. The split is expected to be completed in the second half of next year. ""We are interested in creating value for our customers, for our shareholders, for our employees, and at this point this is the option we see that creates the biggest value,"" Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld told Reuters.  Kleinfeld will become CEO of the new company, and remain Alcoa chairman during a transition period. ""We believe both entities have gotten into a shape that they are competitive and sizeable and they can stand on their own,""  Kleinfeld said.Alcoa had already been in the process of a transition, including acquisitions to beef up its business for such sectors such as aerospace and autos, said Josh Sullivan, an analyst with Sterne Agee CRT.  ""The commodity business was a significant drag, not only on valuation but on the resources of the company,"" Sullivan said.Alcoa did not provide details on the cost of carrying out the split, which it said should be tax free for shareholders. It is targeting an investment grade credit rating for its ""value-added"" business and ""strong non-investment grade"" rating for its legacy business.The company also said that as of Dec. 31 2014, its pension was underfunded by about $3.3 billion. Executives said Alcoa will allocate debt and pension liabilities ""in a manner that is prudent for the two businesses to have the balance sheet"" the company is targeting. HIGH-STRENGTH ALUMINUM A 25 percent drop since last September has pushed aluminum prices to six-year lows. An unprecedented plunge this year in premiums – surcharges paid for physical delivery - to their lowest in 3-1/2 years have posed the biggest threat to producers' margins since the 2008 financial crisis.As a result, more than 10 percent of smelting capacity outside of China, or 3.5 million tons of production, is running in the red. Alcoa Inc has closed or curtailed 170,000 tons of annual output this year, part of a review of 500,000 tons of smelting capacity announced in March.Aluminum output in China, the world's biggest producer, climbed 12 percent during the first seven months of the year. At the same time, the company has bet on growth from higher-margin titanium and high-strength aluminum sales to the aerospace industry, as its order book swells for airplane production and amid renewed global spending on automobiles. About 40 percent of revenue for the new value-added business was generated by the aerospace sector.Recent purchases include aerospace and defense industry-focused titanium supplier, RTI International Metals Inc, for $1.3 billion and privately-held TITAL, which makes titanium and aluminum structural castings for aircraft engines and airframes.The company has also been working to improve in-house technology. Last December, Alcoa unveiled a process it calls Micromill to produce high-strength aluminum alloy, targeting automakers who are seeking an alternative to heavier steel. In mid-September Alcoa announced a deal with Ford Motor Co (F.N) to provide components for the 2016 model F-150 pickup, the best-selling U.S. vehicle since 1982, using Micromill.""They have been acquiring more businesses away from what they founded the company on,"" said Phil Gibbs, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.    The company did not provide a timeline for choosing a CEO for Alcoa after the split. The division of the company does not need shareholder approval, sources familiar with the matter said.The company's financial advisors are Morgan Stanley and Greenhill & Co.

852,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON, Sept 29  WASHINGTON, Sept 29 The U.S. Department of Justice, which is suing to stop Sweden's AB Electrolux  from buying General Electric Co's appliance business, said on Tuesday that it had received no settlement offer from the companies that might allow the deal to go ahead.Judge Emmet Sullivan, who is hearing the Justice Department's challenge to Electrolux's proposed acquisition - on the grounds that it would concentrate market share among too few rivals - asked at a pre-trial hearing whether there was a chance that the dispute would settle out of court.""We fully expect to talk about a potential resolution,"" responded John Majoras, who represents Electrolux and who said there was ""some movement"" toward settlement. A Justice Department lawyer, Ethan Glass, did not rule out an eventual settlement but said: ""We haven't received any proposals so for now there is nothing to talk about.""The United States asked a federal court in July to stop Electrolux, which makes Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan appliances, from buying GE's appliance business for $3.3 billion. The Justice Department argued that Electrolux and GE, along with Whirlpool Corp, make 90 percent of the stoves and ovens sold in the United States to big builders and property managers. The Department said that violates U.S. antitrust law, which is designed to stop mergers that make a market less competitive, effectively preventing the formation of unfair monopolies.Electrolux maintains that companies such as Samsung and LG Electronics are moving into the U.S. market for appliances, diluting its market power. The Justice Department has settled other major deal challenges recently, notably the merger of American Airlines and US Airways, and brewers Anheuser-Busch InBev and Grupo Modelo,  which went ahead only after major asset sales to satisfy the Justice Department's concerns.Recent proposed deals where no settlement has been reached have not gone ahead, such as tax preparer H&R Block's attempt to buy a rival company in 2011 and online customer review service Bazaarvoice's deal for PowerReviews last year.The case is United States v AB Electrolux and General Electric Co, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 15-1039.

853,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Alcoa Inc (AA.N) said Monday it will break itself in two, separating a faster growing plane and car parts business from traditional aluminum smelting operations as shareholders seek higher returns amid a commodity slump.  Pressured by a 42 percent drop in its share price this year and a surge in Chinese aluminum exports, Alcoa is joining a wave of major corporations which recently have sought to break up to add shareholder value, such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N).Alcoa shares rose 2.4 percent to $9.29 as analysts applauded its intensified focus on products for expanding businesses like aerospace and auto. The 127-year-old company was the biggest percentage gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 index, as U.S. stocks slumped broadly on Monday.A global glut of aluminum, which has depressed prices, has battered Alcoa stock, driving the company's market value this year down to about $12 billion. ""Alcoa has faced this problem for decades: No matter what they have done to enhance their product line, their stock has traded based on metal prices,"" said analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research.In another stark example of such a link, Glencore (GLEN.L) shares tumbled almost 30 percent to close at an all-time low on Monday, on fears that the mining and trading company was not doing enough to rein in its debt to withstand a prolonged fall in global metals prices.Alcoa's traditional business, which also includes better-performing bauxite and alumina, will retain the Alcoa name. The newer company is still unnamed. The split is expected to be completed in the second half of next year. ""We are interested in creating value for our customers, for our shareholders, for our employees, and at this point this is the option we see that creates the biggest value,"" Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld told Reuters.  Kleinfeld will become CEO of the new company, and remain Alcoa chairman during a transition period. ""We believe both entities have gotten into a shape that they are competitive and sizeable and they can stand on their own,""  Kleinfeld said.Alcoa had already been in the process of a transition, including acquisitions to beef up its business for such sectors such as aerospace and autos, said Josh Sullivan, an analyst with Sterne Agee CRT.  ""The commodity business was a significant drag, not only on valuation but on the resources of the company,"" Sullivan said.Alcoa did not provide details on the cost of carrying out the split, which it said should be tax free for shareholders. It is targeting an investment grade credit rating for its ""value-added"" business and ""strong non-investment grade"" rating for its legacy business.The company also said that as of Dec. 31 2014, its pension was underfunded by about $3.3 billion. Executives said Alcoa will allocate debt and pension liabilities ""in a manner that is prudent for the two businesses to have the balance sheet"" the company is targeting. HIGH-STRENGTH ALUMINUM A 25 percent drop since last September has pushed aluminum prices to six-year lows. An unprecedented plunge this year in premiums – surcharges paid for physical delivery - to their lowest in 3-1/2 years have posed the biggest threat to producers' margins since the 2008 financial crisis.As a result, more than 10 percent of smelting capacity outside of China, or 3.5 million tons of production, is running in the red. Alcoa Inc has closed or curtailed 170,000 tons of annual output this year, part of a review of 500,000 tons of smelting capacity announced in March.Aluminum output in China, the world's biggest producer, climbed 12 percent during the first seven months of the year. At the same time, the company has bet on growth from higher-margin titanium and high-strength aluminum sales to the aerospace industry, as its order book swells for airplane production and amid renewed global spending on automobiles. About 40 percent of revenue for the new value-added business was generated by the aerospace sector.Recent purchases include aerospace and defense industry-focused titanium supplier, RTI International Metals Inc, for $1.3 billion and privately-held TITAL, which makes titanium and aluminum structural castings for aircraft engines and airframes.The company has also been working to improve in-house technology. Last December, Alcoa unveiled a process it calls Micromill to produce high-strength aluminum alloy, targeting automakers who are seeking an alternative to heavier steel. In mid-September Alcoa announced a deal with Ford Motor Co (F.N) to provide components for the 2016 model F-150 pickup, the best-selling U.S. vehicle since 1982, using Micromill.""They have been acquiring more businesses away from what they founded the company on,"" said Phil Gibbs, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.    The company did not provide a timeline for choosing a CEO for Alcoa after the split. The division of the company does not need shareholder approval, sources familiar with the matter said.The company's financial advisors are Morgan Stanley and Greenhill & Co. The legal advisor for the split is Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.

856,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  Activist investor Nelson Peltz's fund has bought a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric Co, adding fresh pressure on the U.S. conglomerate to pull off its plan to shift away from finance operations toward its industrial roots.Shares of Dow industrials component GE rose 4.5 percent to $26.60 on Monday after Peltz's Trian Fund Management disclosed its roughly 1-percent stake, and said the stock could be worth $40 to $45 per share by the end of 2017.Trian, which said its biggest-ever investment also makes it a top-10 GE shareholder, said it wanted GE to cut costs to expand operating margins, explore more share buybacks including by taking on new debt, be disciplined in its acquisitions and consider ways to further scale back GE Capital.But Trian said it would not seek a board seat, backing the ""transformation"" already under way at GE. Peltz said Chief Executive Jeff Immelt and GE ""share much common ground with Trian."" Immelt, in a statement, welcomed Trian's investment.""All it does is act as a further catalyst to make sure GE stays on track with the plans they have in place,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns about 1.2 million GE shares. Peltz, Smith said, is a ""sharp operator. We’re glad to see him in the picture.""With Monday's jump, GE's market capitalization rose to about $268 billion, trailing only a few companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil and Wells Fargo & Co. In recent years, Peltz has targeted DuPont and PepsiCo Inc, among others, demanding board seats and asking for separation of fast-growing businesses from stagnating ones. He is also known to work closely with management teams, showing more patience than some activist peers.Peltz, who launched Trian in 2005, is one of the largest U.S. activist investors, with $12 billion in assets under management and callable commitments.Activist investors typically buy shares of an undervalued company and push for management or structural improvements, stock buybacks or divestitures, among other things. Last year, activists targeted 347 U.S. companies, a 58-percent increase from 2010, according to FactSet, with this year on pace to eclipse that total.In an 81-page report on GE entitled ""Transformation Underway ... But Nobody Cares,"" Trian pointed to GE's ""stagnant"" share price, with total shareholder returns climbing only 10 percent in the past decade, trailing industrial peers, with the stock hurt by the company's dependence on its finance arm.  GE stunned Wall Street on April 10 when it said it would seek to unload some $200 billion of GE Capital's assets, so it generates 90 percent of profits from industrial operations by 2018, from 55 percent in 2013. GE shares popped nearly 11 percent that day, but gave up much of those gains in recent months.Trian began accumulating its GE stake in mid-May, Trian spokeswoman Anne Tarbell said.Trian chief investment officer Ed Garden told CNBC television, ""there's a ton of investor skepticism in GE,"" but Trian sees ""eye-to-eye with management on the plan.""""I think they’ll execute,"" Garden said. ""If they don’t, then all options are on the table."" While GE plans to return $90 billion to shareholders, Garden said that could rise to $110 billion or $120 billion, ""depending on how you capitalize the industrial business going forward.""Trian's cost-cutting emphasis also comes as GE has already set targets for improving gross margins and lowering selling and overhead costs.""It is not clear that Trian is suggesting a whole lot that is different to the plan being executed by GE management,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe said in a research note.Peltz addressed roughly 100 GE executives in August 2013 and since then Trian has had several discussions with GE management about its corporate structure and improving shareholder returns, Trian said.GE said Monday it was on track to complete $100 billion in GE Capital asset sales this year and achieve its raised industrial operating earnings forecast for 2015. ""Trian has a strong track record of working with companies to build long-term shareholder value and has been an engaged shareholder,"" Immelt said in a statement.

857,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Billionaire fund manager Nelson Peltz on Monday added a big new client when he took in $150 million in cash from the Arkansas Teachers Retirement System, part of a trio of welcome victories for the activist, whose portfolio has faced a bumpy ride lately.The $14.5 billion pension fund's decision to invest with Peltz' Trian Fund Management rounded off a sweet day for the 73-year old veteran investor, who also unveiled a $2.5 billion stake in General Electric and saw his investment in chemicals maker DuPont jump 5.64 percent after CEO Ellen Kullman said she was retiring.""The Trian team are like mechanics who can tell you what's wrong with your old car by hearing you drive up to the garage,"" said George Hopkins, executive director of the fund, which pays out $80 million in monthly benefits to 42,000 retirees.Arkansas teachers first put money with an activist fund in 2008 when they bet on rival activist William Ackman's $16.5 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, in which they now invest $258 million.Now they are adding Peltz at a time the hedge fund industry is facing its worst year since the 2008 financial crisis and both Peltz and Ackman are posting losses this year.Despite the current red ink at Trian, Hopkins, who guided the Arkansas fund to a 5.2 percent gain in fiscal 2015, beating the average pension fund's 3.2 percent return, chose Trian for its strong, long term record. Trian posted a 9.7 percent annualized return which topped its 7.4 percent benchmark. Hopkins said he also likes the Trian pushing companies including Bank of New York Mellon and DuPont to perform better on an operational level.  Trian has won a handful of board seats without noisy proxy battles and suffered just one costly loss this year when it fell short of winning seats on DuPont's board. But with news that Kullman will be replaced, for now, by Edward Breen, investors in DuPont said Peltz' influence over the board is clear and that improvements should be in the offing.Pershing Square, which has returned 15.4 percent on average for the teachers since 2008, sometimes pursues a noisier path of trying to shake up management and the board room at companies like Canadian Pacific Raliway Ltd, Air Products and Chemicals Inc and Zoetis Inc.This year, Ackman and Peltz are both making a big push to get snack-food maker Mondelez International Inc to improve its margins. Ackman is pushing for a merger with Kraft Heinz Co while Peltz, who has a seat on the company's board, has been more guarded in his views. For Arkansas this overlap could become a highly concentrated position in a company that makes Oreos cookies and Milka chocolate, enjoyed by students and teachers around the world.""With activist investors there is likely to be some overlap because there is only a finite group of companies that managers can pick from,"" said Damien Park, managing partner at consulting firm Hedge Fund Solution. ""But from a risk management perspective this is certainly something to watch carefully.""Hopkins said he usually aims for diversity among his managers but that Trian's ability to get companies to perform better was a selling point during investment discussions. To be sure, the Arkansas teachers are putting only 5 percent of assets into opportunistic funds which include hedge funds, making them a much smaller player in hedge funds than the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, New Jersey State Investment Council and Maryland State Retirement and Pension System.Those funds put a higher percentage of their portfolios in alternative investments and oversee significantly more assets.Still even big name hedge funds like Trian, which already invests for the state of New York and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, and Pershing Square, which manages money for Massachusetts and New Jersey, want more pension fund money. Such assets typically stick around for longer and are seen as a vote of confidence.

872,"   By Mike Stone  General Electric Co is in advanced talks to sell a specialty finance portfolio, worth more than $30 billion, to Wells Fargo & Co, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the industrial conglomerate returns to its roots.Wells Fargo has so far outbid other parties for General Electric's vendor financing, commercial distribution finance and direct lending assets, the person with direct knowledge of the situation said on Friday.A deal could be announced by the time Wells Fargo publishes its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the person added, cautioning that the negotiations were ongoing and could still fall apart.The source asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. GE and Wells Fargo representatives declined to comment. The sale of the loans would leapfrog GE well past its target of shedding about $100 billion worth of finance assets by the end of this year.The company unveiled its latest divestment agreement on Monday - for its North American corporate aircraft financing portfolio - bringing its total deals to date related GE Capital to $97 billion.

880,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  General Electric Co (GE.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, helped by cost cuts and higher sales of its jet engines business that offset struggles in its oil and gas segment.The U.S. conglomerate, which is pulling back from financial services, also said third-quarter industrial revenue grew 4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency swings and acquisitions. The company maintained its profit forecast for its core industrials segment of $1.13 to $1.20 per share for the full year.Connecticut-based GE's orders dropped 26 percent, with a big decline in oil-related orders, but Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said GE ""had some big orders last year so the comparison was pretty tough.""Shares, up about 10 percent since activist investor Nelson Peltz unveiled a $2.5 billion stake in the company earlier this month, surged 2.7 percent to $28.80 in afternoon trading. It was the biggest percentage gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  On another positive note for shareholders, GE said it expects to retire as much as 7 percent of its outstanding floated shares by mid-November, as it completes the spinoff of its former retail finance business, Synchrony Financial (SYF.N). The Federal Reserve earlier this week said Synchrony could function as a standalone company.The Synchrony split is part of GE's massive retreat from financial services, which began in earnest in April when it said it would divest some $200 billion worth of its GE Capital financing assets to focus on industrial manufacturing. Including the Synchrony split, GE said on Friday it expects to return about $30 billion in cash to shareholders this year through GE Capital divestitures.

Aviation revenue increased 5 percent, while revenue in its power and water division, its biggest segment, grew 1 percent.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt expressed confidence its $3.3 billion sale of its appliances unit to Sweden's Electrolux (ELUXb.ST) would close this quarter, despite a challenge from U.S. regulators.Profit may come in at the higher end of the 2015 industrial forecast if the appliances sale closes during this quarter, as it expects, GE said.

GE shares were up 3.7 percent in afternoon trading after the company reported better than expected quarterly profit, while Honeywell was off 2.1 percent.""We have seen this across the board where oil and gas has been this tremendous headwind,"" Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said.

885,"  (Adds links to graphics on GE earnings and share price and on U.S. manufacturer stocks, updates trading)By Lewis KrauskopfOct 16 General Electric Co reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, helped by cost cuts and higher sales of its jet engines business that offset struggles in its oil and gas segment.The U.S. conglomerate, which is pulling back from financial services, also said third-quarter industrial revenue grew 4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency swings and acquisitions.The company maintained its profit forecast for its core industrials segment of $1.13 to $1.20 per share for the full year.Connecticut-based GE's orders dropped 26 percent, with a big decline in oil-related orders, but Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said GE ""had some big orders last year so the comparison was pretty tough."" Shares, up about 10 percent since activist investor Nelson Peltz unveiled a $2.5 billion stake in the company earlier this month, surged 2.7 percent to $28.80 in afternoon trading. It was the biggest percentage gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.On another positive note for shareholders, GE said it expects to retire as much as 7 percent of its outstanding floated shares by mid-November, as it completes the spinoff of its former retail finance business, Synchrony Financial. The Federal Reserve earlier this week said Synchrony could function as a standalone company.The Synchrony split is part of GE's massive retreat from financial services, which began in earnest in April when it said it would divest some $200 billion worth of its GE Capital financing assets to focus on industrial manufacturing. Including the Synchrony split, GE said on Friday it expects to return about $30 billion in cash to shareholders this year through GE Capital divestitures.For the quarter, net earnings fell 29 percent from a year earlier to $2.51 billion, or 25 cents per share.Excluding items, earnings of 29 cents a share exceeded the average estimate of analysts by three cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

894,"  WARSAW Oct 26 Poland's financial regulator KNF has raised the capital requirements for Bank BPH to levels already met by the lender, suggesting no immediate need to tap shareholders for fresh funds to cover possible losses on its Swiss franc loans.KNF said the Polish unit of General Electric (GE)  should have a Tier 1 ratio of no less than 11.08 percent and a total capital ratio (TCR) of no less than 14.77 percent.Bank BPH said that it had a Tier 1 ratio of 14.29 percent and a TCR of 16.74 percent at the end of June 2015, comfortably above the new limits. However, the new requirement is higher than the 10.25 percent Tier 1 target set for the Polish banking sector as of Jan. 2016. GE, which owns nearly 90 percent of the bank's shares through three subsidiaries, put Bank BPH up for sale at the end of last year as part of a global plan to spin off financial assets. But the sale has so far failed to reach a conclusion, partly due to politicians' plans to introduce a bank tax and convert Swiss franc loans into zlotys. Polish insurer PZU has suspended talks with GE over the purchase of Bank BPH, PZU said earlier this month.

895,"   By Alwyn Scott  General Electric Co said on Wednesday it will spend more than $200 million to build two factories in Alabama to expand its capacity to make high strength materials for jet engines and power plant turbines.The plants in Huntsville will produce silicon-carbon ceramic materials for LEAP engines on thousands of single-aisle Boeing and Airbus jetliners sold for delivery over the next decade. The LEAP engine was developed by CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France's Snecma (Safran) .The ultra-light materials also will be used in military engines, GE9X engines for Boeing's 777X jetliner and gas-fired power turbines, GE said.With $21.9 million in U.S. Air Force funding, one of the factories will make silicon carbon fibers under license from NGS Advanced Fibers, a joint venture of Nippon Carbon Co Ltd, Safran and GE. The adjacent plant will make ceramic matrix composite (CMC) tape, a long, stiff material that will be used by GE's recently finished plant in Asheville, North Carolina, to make jet engine parts.Construction on a 100-acre site is scheduled to start in mid-2016. Production is due to start in 2018. The factories will eventually employ 300 workers.The factories will supply more CMC materials as GE and CFM ramp up engine production. CFM expects to turn out 1,800 LEAP engines a year by the end of the decade, GE said.  CMC parts resist higher temperatures and have about one-third the weight of current metal alloys, so their use in the engine's high-pressure turbine would make it more fuel-efficient, GE said.CMC is a significant shift in engine materials away from heavier metal alloys, GE said, noting it has been developing CMC for more than two decades. ""We pretty much got to the point where you run out of the capability of metal,"" said Sanjay Correa, vice president of the CMC program at GE Aviation.

897,"  (Corrects name of CEO in para 13 to Philippe Petitcolin from Jean-Paul Herteman)By Emiliano  Mellino, Matthieu Protard and Freya BerryLONDON/PARIS Oct 29 French aerospace and defence group Safran is considering a potential sale of its Morpho Detection unit, four sources told Reuters on Thursday, triggered by an unsolicited approach from an industrial player.Safran has been working with Goldman Sachs on options for the business and is reviewing potential buyers, two of the sources said. They added no decision had been taken on whether to sell, but one would be reached by the end of the year.Safran and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.While Safran had not originally considered putting Morpho Detection on the block, discussions at board level were sparked following an unsolicited approach at the end of the summer, two of the sources said.Safran bought 81 percent of Morpho Detection, previously called Homeland Protection, for $580 million in 2009. Its previous owner, U.S. conglomerate General Electric , sold its remaining 19 percent in Morpho Detection for 90 million euros ($99 million) in 2012.The unit was integrated into Safran's subsidiary Morpho which specializes in security solutions and reported revenues of over 1.5 billion euros in 2014.Morpho Detection accounts for around one third of Morpho's revenues, an analyst said.It uses technology such as X-rays to help identify explosives and narcotics in places including airports. The unit could draw interest from industry rivals and private equity funds, industry bankers said.Its peers include U.S. firm OSI Systems and Britain's Smiths Group, they added.The bankers also mentioned Raytheon and L-3  in the United States, as well as Ultra Electronics in Britain, as relevant industry players. Some bankers questioned whether Safran Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin would be happy to break up Morpho, a division he headed prior to his appointment as group CEO in April.Morpho Detection counts airports in Germany, Britain and China among its customers. Its contracts include an agreement to research and develop explosives detection products for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.But the detection sector's dependence on government budgets means it has suffered in the recent past, an analyst said.""The detection market has only recovered recently. The budgets of governments are financing those machines. Their use in airports depends on the federal budget,"" he said.Besides detection, Morpho also develops biometric products including e-passports through subsidiaries MorphoTrust USA and Aleat Shpk.($1 = 0.9125 euros)   (Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze; Editing by Mark Potter)",2015-10-29,GE,"Thu Oct 29, 2015 | 2:54pm EDT",CORRECTED-Safran exploring sale of security unit Morpho Detection - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/safran-ma-morphodetection-idUSL8N12T4T920151029?type=companyNews
898,"  PARIS Alstom (ALSO.PA) said it had completed the 12.35 billion euro ($13.6 billion) sale of its energy business to General Electric Co (GE.N), helping the French group refocus on its transport business.GE said the final purchase price was 9.7 billion euros, adjusted for proceeds Alstom is reinvesting in joint ventures with the company and changes in the deal structure, among other things.Alstom, which was aiming to complete the sale in the fourth quarter, said on Monday it planned to return between 3.2 and 3.7 billion euros of the sale proceeds to shareholders.GE said Alstom's energy business was combined with its power and water unit, and was renamed as GE Power.Headquartered in Schenectady, New York, the business will be led by Steve Bolze, chief executive of the power and water unit. GE Power would have an estimated annual revenue of about $30 billion, and employ more than 65,000 globally, GE said.The industrial conglomerate's power and water unit, which makes heavy-duty gas turbines and machines for utilities and independent power producers, had revenue of $27.56 billion in 2014, with about 38,000 employees. There have been no final decisions made on any actions that would impact jobs at GE's Power business as a result of the Alstom integration, GE spokesman Seth Martin said. The company said it expects the deal to add 5-8 cents to earnings per share in 2016 and 15-20 cents by 2018. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost synergies in the fifth year. Alstom, which among other transport sector activities builds trains, has scheduled a board meeting for Wednesday to propose the launch of a public share buyback offer.GE's shares were up about 1 percent at $29.17 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The contract is also one of first and largest to be awarded to a foreign firm since India last year allowed 100 percent foreign direct investment in some parts of its railways, and comes as New Delhi embarks on a huge modernisation programme to overhaul its vast but dilapidated network.Under the deal, the largest ever for the U.S. company in India, GE will build a manufacturing facility in the eastern state of Bihar, and two maintenance sheds elsewhere in the country, to service the locomotives over an 11-year period. GE won against competition from rival manufacturers such as Canada's Bombardier and Germany's Siemens. India is also set to announce the winner of another multi-billion dollar contract to supply electric locomotives.Keen to upgrade the country's creaking infrastructure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has said it will invest $137 billion on its railways by 2020. It has also opened up limited parts of the state-owned network to private and foreign investment, luring manufacturers hungry for contracts from the world's fourth largest train network. ""It will bring this technology to a market that needs it. For them, this is really aligned with 'Make in India,' "" GE's Miller said.India's railways is a lifeline for the more than 23 million people who use it every day. It also offers some of the world's cheapest fares to help poor people travel across the country.  But the system largely dates back to the British colonial era and India has struggled to generate money to invest and modernise, leaving an ageing and congested network where trains run at an average speed of just 50 kilometres per hour.  GE said the company had received a letter of award from India, and it would now sign a formal agreement before beginning construction of the new factory.

915,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The government argued Monday that U.S. consumers would pay 5 percent more for ranges and wall ovens if AB Electrolux (ELUXb.ST) was allowed to buy General Electric's (GE.N) appliance business but the companies accused antitrust enforcers of failing to acknowledge powerful and growing competition from overseas manufacturers.The Department of Justice asked a federal court in July to stop Sweden's Electrolux, which makes Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan appliances, from buying GE's appliance business for $3.3 billion. Trial in the case began Monday, with the government asking the judge for an injunction to stop the deal.Justice Department lawyer Ethan Glass said that in one main channel - contract sales to developers and other professional buyers - GE had 28 percent of sales for ranges, Whirlpool had 26 percent, Electrolux 23 percent, Kenmore (which is made by Electrolux) 11 percent, Samsung 6 percent and LG 3 percent.""If this merger isn't stopped, two-thirds of the ranges sold in the United States will be made by Electrolux,"" Glass told Judge Emmet Sullivan, who will decide the case. ""If this merger isn't stopped, the daily competition between GE and Electrolux will end."" The Justice Department is focusing on lower end kitchen appliances, the type that home builders put in new houses and apartments or that consumers buy at big box stores.But Electrolux lawyer John Majoras argued that Samsung and LG had started selling appliances in a small way recently but were growing fast. ""This is a highly competitive marketplace and will continue to be so if this deal goes forward,"" Majoras said.Speaking for GE, Paul Denis argued that the government approved a similar deal, Whirlpool's purchase of Maytag, in 2006 without triggering higher prices. In that case, the Justice Department cited competition from Samsung and LG as a rationale to approve the deal, Denis said.  Denis argued that market concentration in washers and dryers was actually higher in that deal. ""The government got it right in the Whirlpool/Maytag merger, approving that transaction,"" he said. The two sides have held settlement talks but failed to find agreement on which assets Electrolux could sell in order to make its deal for GE’s appliance business palatable to the Justice Department.    The case is United States v AB Electrolux and General Electric Co, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 15-1039.

GE, which owns about 85 percent of Synchrony and spun off the consumer-finance company as part of its broader retreat from financial services, recently commenced a tender offer where GE investors can turn in shares in exchange for Synchrony shares at a discount.    The exchange offer, scheduled to end at midnight on November 16, 2015, has spurred a flurry of trading in GE's shares, with weekly trading volume on track to hit a six-year high. GE shares hit a 7-year high of $30.89 on Thursday.There has been a record surge in GE’s options trading volume as investors look to hedge their risk of holding GE. The point of the trade is to be able to take advantage of the tender without worrying about taking losses in GE while holding the shares.Traders are employing a strategy that provides a nearly risk-free way of extracting a small profit from the exchange offer and hinges on their being able swap their GE shares for Synchrony shares at a discount to the market price.The trade, called a conversion, involves opening a ""three-legged"" complex options strategy by taking a long position in the stock, selling call options, and buying put options. Traders sell calls and buy put options at the same strike price and with identical expirations. This creates a synthetic short position that offsets the long position in the actual stock. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, while puts convey the right to sell the shares.On Thursday, the company said each share of GE that is validly tendered will fetch 1.0505 shares of Synchrony.

""This is the one this year,"" he said. Under questioning from the Justice Department's Steven Kramer, Electrolux Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin acknowledged that the company's annual reports and other documents had repeatedly described the U.S. market for appliances as relatively consolidated compared to the more fragmented European market.Pushed by Kramer to acknowledge that fewer players in a market would lead to less price competition, McLoughlin said: ""Oh, my word, I haven't said that at all."" He also acknowledged price increases in the United States but argued some, particularly a 2005 increase, was prompted by increases in major inputs like steel, nickel and petrochemicals.""I was there. I was running the business,"" said McLoughlin, a former head of Electrolux's Major Appliances North America.The point of buying GE's appliance business was partially to negotiate more effectively with big input suppliers like steelmakers, said McLoughlin. ""Our assumption is that we would not have increase pricing power (if the GE deal goes forward),"" he said because of competition from LG, Samsung, Haier and others who began entering the market several years ago.McLoughlin described LG and Samsung as companies that made premium appliances but sold them for moderate prices. Samsung sold ranges for $399 and $499 retail, he said. No range on the Samsung or Home Depot website was priced under $599 on Thursday.The Justice Department is focusing on lower end kitchen appliances, the type that home builders put in new houses and apartments or consumers buy at big box stores. Electrolux, GE and Whirlpool make 90 percent of the stoves and ovens sold to big builders and property managers, it said.The case is United States v AB Electrolux and General Electric Co, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 15-1039.

936,"   By Scott Malone and Richard Weizel | BOSTON/FAIRFIELD, Conn.  BOSTON/FAIRFIELD, Conn. Jan 13 General Electric Co's decision to move its corporate headquarters from Connecticut to Boston will boost the city's efforts to revitalize a run-down district where mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger carried out some his most notorious murders.But in Fairfield, Connecticut, high-end shopowners and restauranteurs said they were worried about a loss of business after GE, the town's largest property taxpayer, moves out.The maker of products ranging from jet engines to high-tech medical devices said on Wednesday it would be moving 800 headquarters staffers out of Fairfield, over two years beginning this summer, in a blow to the wealthy town.Its new home will be Boston's fast-growing Seaport District. Once filled with parking lots and aging warehouse buildings not far from where Bulger killed his rivals, the neighborhood is now a hive of construction.Tech startups including car-sharing company Zipcar Inc and software company LogMeIn have already moved into the area, across the Fort Point Channel from the city's financial district that is home to fund giants including Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp.""We're talking about an area that was once just parking lots. GE is going to have an opportunity to reshape Boston in a really positive way,"" said John Gallaugher, an associate professor at Boston College's Carroll School of Management.GE began mulling leaving its headquarters of four decades in suburban Fairfield, about 60 miles (100 km) northeast of New York City, last year. Officials cited high taxes as a main concern. The company looked at cities including New York, Atlanta and Providence, Rhode Island, according to media reports.""General Electric's choice to move to Boston is the result of the city's willingness and excitement to work creatively and collaboratively to bring positive activity to our local economy and continue to grow our industries,"" said Boston Mayor Martin Walsh on Wednesday. Together the state and city offered up to $145 million in financial incentives including property tax breaks to help seal the deal, officials said.After decades of seeing some of its biggest corporate residents bought up by out of state companies, such as the former Fleet Bank, now owned by Bank of America Corp and Gillette's purchase by Procter & Gamble Co, Boston business leaders said they were glad to see one of the world's largest companies move its headquarters in.""This could be a harbinger for the future with other blue chip companies taking a hard look at moving here,"" said John Fish, chief executive officer of Suffolk Construction Company, New England's largest building company. ""The city has always punched above its weight and this is a further indication of that."" 'HIT IN THE GUT' GE has long been the largest company located in Fairfield County, home to some 945,000 people, which stands out as wealthy even in one of the more affluent U.S. states, according to U.S. Census data.Median income in the county stands at about $82,283, above the state median of $69,461, and the median owner-occupied home was worth about $432,100 last year, more than double the $176,600 nationwide median.""This move by GE will change Fairfield dramatically. I don't know how the town will recover,"" said Michael Sussman, 58, part of the family that owns Fairfield Center Jewelers. A block away, Patrick Tennaro, owner of the Old Post Tavern,  said he was shocked at the move, but not surprised.""The taxes are far too high,"" said Tennaro, 40. ""For the town of Fairfield, this is a disaster.""GE's move could have a wider effect if it inspires other large companies to move out of the largely suburban state, experts said.""This is a real hit in the gut for Connecticut,"" said Don Gibson, dean of the Dolan School of Business at Fairfield University.Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, whose office had been aggressively lobbying GE to stay, admitted disappointment, though he noted some GE units will remain behind.""We are disappointed, and we know that many in Connecticut share that frustration,"" Malloy said, a day after basking in the national spotlight when he was invited to sit next to First Lady Michelle Obama at the State of the Union address.The loss should drive Connecticut officials to rethink the state's tax rates, which are by and large above those of its neighbors, residents and experts said.""This is bad for Malloy and it doesn't reflect well on the state,"" said Richard Grossman, a professor of economics at Connecticut's Wesleyan University.

937,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co said on Wednesday it will move its global headquarters to Boston, tapping the city's technology talent and likely lowering its tax bill as the industrial conglomerate seeks to lift profit and emphasize digital capabilities.The maker of aircraft engines, locomotives, power turbines and household appliances will move to temporary quarters by next summer, and permanently settle about 800 workers in the Seaport district by 2018, GE said.""We want to be at the center of an ecosystem that shares our aspirations"" as a leader in digital-industrial activities, GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said in a statement.""Greater Boston is home to 55 colleges and universities. Massachusetts spends more on research and development than any other region in the world, and Boston attracts a diverse, technologically-fluent workforce focused on solving challenges for the world,"" he added. ""We are excited to bring our headquarters to this dynamic and creative city.""GE said the move would have no material financial impact, with costs offset by state and city incentives and the sale of its current headquarters offices in Fairfield, Connecticut, and its offices at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. Massachusetts will provide up to $120 million in grants and other incentives and the city will provide property tax savings of up to $25 million. The state funds must be spent on public infrastructure, including site preparation, building acquisition costs and road and building improvements, GE said.GE also is eligible for $1 million in workforce training grants, and up to $5 million to foster relations between the company, research institutions and universities.Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said GE's decision resulted from ""the city's willingness and excitement to work creatively"" to attract the company, bringing 800 high-paying jobs to the city.The move also will lower GE's tax bill. Even though Massachusetts is often called ""Taxachusetts,"" it ranked 25th in a 2016 Tax Foundation survey of positive business tax climates among U.S. states. Connecticut ranked 44th, near the bottom. Connecticut's corporate income tax rate is nominally 7.5 percent, but GE likely pays an effective rate of 9 percent due to surcharges on growth income, versus 8 percent in Massachusetts, said Jared Walczak, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.Connecticut also has many corporate tax structures that are less favorable than other states', such as rules that could put more of GE's global sales within Connecticut's grasp, and those probably also tipped the decision, Walczak said.""Given the cost of corporate relocation, I suspect that GE anticipates substantial tax savings from the move,"" he said.LONG SEARCH  GE's decision caps a search that intensified last summer as Connecticut lawmakers passed a budget that increased taxes by $1.2 billion over two years, drawing protests from some of the state's biggest corporations. The same month, Immelt said in an email to employees that he asked a team to examine the company's options to relocate the headquarters to a state with a ""more pro-business environment.""But talent also was a draw. GE said on Wednesday it had been thinking about a new location for more than three years and considered 40 potential sites this year. Those included Atlanta; Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, according to people familiar with the matter. ""This wasn’t only about dollars and cents but what Boston and New England brings to the table,"" said John Fish, chief executive officer of Suffolk Construction Company, New England’s largest building company. The 124-year-old company is undergoing a major restructuring to emphasize digital and industrial capabilities. Earlier on Wednesday, GE said it would cut up to 6,500 jobs in Europe over the next two years, including 765 in France and 1,300 in Switzerland, as it restructures and integrates its acquisition of Alstom's energy business. With 800 employees, the Boston headquarters will be the same size as Fairfield, but its makeup will change, GE said. The new office will employ about 200 administrators and 600 ""digital industrial product managers, designs and developers,"" GE said.Those workers, spread among the company's GE Digital, Current, robotics and life sciences divisions, will share technology developments across business units, GE said, helping develop software to run the machinery the company manufacturers.GE had been based in Fairfield since 1974. The planned move is a blow to Connecticut, which in December reduced corporate taxes to thwart criticism that the state is unfriendly to business. Fairfield's 2013-2014 annual report listed GE's headquarters with an assessed value $74.7 million and ranked it the city's largest property tax payer.GE has about 5,700 employees in Connecticut, including about 800 people employed at the Fairfield headquarters. It was not immediately clear how many employees will remain in Connecticut.""Of course we are disappointed, and we know that many in Connecticut share that frustration,"" Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy said. ""While GE’s headquarters may be leaving, I have been assured that the company will continue to have many employees working here in Connecticut.""GE's presence in the state had been shrinking because much of it was related to its finance arm, GE Capital. The company is selling off the bulk of GE Capital as part of its restructuring.

946,"   By Scott Malone and Richard Weizel | BOSTON/FAIRFIELD, Conn.  BOSTON/FAIRFIELD, Conn. General Electric Co's decision to move its corporate headquarters from Connecticut to Boston will boost the city's efforts to revitalize a once run-down district where mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger carried out some of his most notorious murders.But in Fairfield, Connecticut, high-end shopowners and restaurateurs said they were worried about a loss of business after GE, the town's largest property taxpayer, moves out.The maker of products ranging from jet engines to high-tech medical devices said on Wednesday it would be moving 800 headquarters staffers out of Fairfield, over two years beginning this summer, in a blow to the wealthy town.    Its new home will be Boston's fast-growing Seaport District. Once filled with parking lots and aging warehouse buildings not far from where Bulger killed his rivals, the neighborhood is now a hive of construction.Tech startups including car-sharing company Zipcar Inc and software company LogMeIn have already moved into the area, across the Fort Point Channel from the city's financial district that is home to fund giants including Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp.""We're talking about an area that was once just parking lots. GE is going to have an opportunity to reshape Boston in a really positive way,"" said John Gallaugher, an associate professor at Boston College's Carroll School of Management.GE began mulling leaving its headquarters of four decades in suburban Fairfield, about 60 miles (100 km) northeast of New York City, last year. Officials cited high taxes as a main concern. The company looked at cities including New York, Atlanta and Providence, Rhode Island, according to media reports.""General Electric's choice to move to Boston is the result of the city's willingness and excitement to work creatively and collaboratively,"" said Boston Mayor Martin Walsh on Wednesday.Together the state and city offered up to $145 million in financial incentives including property tax breaks to help seal the deal, officials said.After decades of seeing some of its biggest corporate residents bought up by out-of-state companies, such as the former Fleet Bank, now owned by Bank of America Corp and Gillette's purchase by Procter & Gamble Co, Boston business leaders said they were glad to see one of the world's largest companies move its headquarters in.  ""This could be a harbinger for the future with other blue chip companies taking a hard look at moving here,"" said John Fish, chief executive officer of Suffolk Construction Company, New England's largest building company.'HIT IN THE GUT' GE has long been the largest company located in Fairfield County, home to some 945,000 people, which stands out as wealthy even in one of the more affluent U.S. states, according to U.S. Census data.Median income in the county stands at about $82,283, above the state median of $69,461, and the median owner-occupied home was worth about $432,100 last year, more than double the $176,600 nationwide median. The company currently pays $1.6 million in annual property taxes to the town, said Fairfield First Selectman Mike Tetreau, the town's top elected official. If GE sells its campus, with an assessed value of $74.7 million, the new owner would be responsible for the same bill unless it is a charitable entity.""Where it's less quantifiable is all the other areas - the volunteer hours from GE employees, the shopping they do in Fairfield, the dining out,"" said Tetreau. ""That's harder to quantify but has a real impact.""Small business owners in Fairfield expressed concern.     ""This move by GE will change Fairfield dramatically. I don't know how the town will recover,"" said Michael Sussman, 58, part of the family that owns Fairfield Center Jewelers. A block away, Patrick Tennaro, owner of the Old Post Tavern,  said he was shocked at the move, but not surprised. “The taxes are far too high,"" said Tennaro, 40. ""For the town of Fairfield, this is a disaster.” GE's move could have a wider effect if it inspires other large companies to move out of Connecticut, experts said.""This is a real hit in the gut for Connecticut,"" said Don Gibson, dean of the Dolan School of Business at Fairfield University.  Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, whose office had been aggressively lobbying GE to stay, admitted disappointment, though he noted some GE units will remain behind.""We are disappointed, and we know that many in Connecticut share that frustration,"" Malloy said, a day after basking in the national spotlight when he was invited to sit next to First Lady Michelle Obama at the State of the Union address.The loss should drive Connecticut officials to rethink the state's tax rates, which are by and large above those of its neighbors, residents and experts said.""This is bad for Malloy and it doesn't reflect well on the state,"" said Richard Grossman, a professor of economics at Connecticut's Wesleyan University. ""They have to have a tax environment that is at least as good as Massachusetts.""

948,"   By Ankit Ajmera  Haier Group said it would buy General Electric Co's appliance business for $5.4 billion, the Chinese company's latest attempt to boost its presence in the lucrative United States market.Haier, which made an abortive attempt in 2008 to buy the business, has a negligible presence in the U.S. white goods  market, dominated by Whirlpool Corp, Sweden's Electrolux AB and GE.The news comes weeks after GE walked away from a deal to sell the business to Electrolux for $3.3 billion, following months of opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators.The deal with Haier is unlikely to draw intense antitrust scrutiny, according to some antitrust experts, but may get a hard look from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).""Given the number of industry participants, a merger which combines a 5-percent market share participant doesn't seem to me to raise significant antitrust concerns,"" said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department who now heads Bloom Strategic Counsel, a firm specializing in public policy, government relations, and antitrust analysis.GE said the deal values the appliance business at 10 times last 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Whirlpool Corp is valued at 7.7 times.""This is the chance of a life-time for Haier to become big outside China and specifically US, hence they are willing to pay this very high price tag,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Johan Eliason told Reuters.

955,"   By Alwyn Scott  General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Friday that it would double its 2016 budget for restructuring spending to fight the effects of low oil prices and slow global growth that pummeled its earnings last year.The U.S. conglomerate plans to spend $3.4 billion on restructuring measures this year, double the $1.7 billion it targeted just last month, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview just hours after GE reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. The company's shares were down 1.3 percent at $28.24 in afternoon trading after falling as much as 3.1 percent earlier in the session.Bornstein said the restructuring would affect all of GE's diverse industrial units, ""with an emphasis on oil and gas"" operations, whose profit had tumbled 19 percent in the fourth quarter. GE also plans to double cost reductions in the oil and gas business, which supplies equipment to energy prospecting and production companies. It is targeting as much $800 million in cuts in 2016, compared with an earlier goal of $400 million, Bornstein said. It cut $600 million in the business in 2015.The restructuring measures include consolidating factory and service-center real estate, improving supplier relationships, making plants more efficient and reducing overhead and product  costs. The emphasis on restructuring comes as GE transforms itself into a digital-industrial company, making complex machines and the software to run and monitor them. It plans to move its global headquarters from Connecticut to Boston, which it said attracts a ""technologically-fluent"" workforce. The company plans to fund the increased restructuring actions with proceeds from the $5.4 billion sale of its appliance business to China's Haier Group, a deal announced last week.STUNG BY OIL PRICES  Oil and gas results released on Friday showed the powerful effect of falling energy prices.  The drop in earnings at the unit pulled GE's overall industrial profit down 8 percent to $5.52 billion, the company said.GE expects oil and gas revenue to fall a further 10 percent to 15 percent in 2016 because of weak oil prices, Bornstein and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt told investors on a conference call. But restructuring and cost-cutting should cushion the blow, Bornstein said.  Excluding special items, GE's total fourth-quarter earnings of 52 cents a share beat the analysts' average estimate of 49 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1.4 percent to $33.89 billion, below analysts' expectations of $35.7 billion. Within the oil and gas business, GE plans to speed up integrating the power business it bought from Alstom SA of France (ALSO.PA), a deal that closed in November. It aims to accomplish in 2016 moves it had planned for 2017 and 2018.GE also wants to increase industrial operating profit in 2016 by 3 percent to just above $19 billion, excluding the effects of the Alstom acquisition, Bornstein said. It is especially focused on services sales and improving margins.The company recently said it planned to cut as many as 6,500 jobs associated with the Alstom purchase.In 2015, GE said it cut overhead costs by $800 million and realized about $1 billion in savings from prior restructuring spending.

With little scope for other big-ticket acquisitions, Electrolux will need to explore alternative avenues to growth,  with many analysts pointing to growing the highly profitable professional business as a potentially lucrative option.""I think they should, and will, buy more companies within Professional Products,"" said DNB analyst Christer Magnergard.""If they succeed with that, it will generate higher profitability, more stable profits, better organic growth and less price pressure.""The professionals business posted a 14.8 percent operating margin in the quarter, the only unit to reach double digits though it only accounts for just over 5 percent of group sales.

973,"   By Mike Stone  State Street Corp (STT.N) is nearing a deal to acquire General Electric Co's (GE.N) $115 billion asset management business, according to people familiar with the matter, as the U.S. industrial conglomerate continues to shed unloved assets. State Street, a Boston-based asset manager, has prevailed over other bidders, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), for the business, and is now in the final stages of negotiating a deal with GE, the people said this week.An agreement could come as early as this month and value GE's asset management business at as much as $500 million, the people added, cautioning that the negotiations could still fall through.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. ""We have had a very high level of interest from potential acquirers of GE Asset Management (GEAM) in the market and the deal is progressing well. At this time, there is no public announcement about a buyer. Our original deal timeline remains on track, and we still expect to conclude our strategic evaluation this quarter,"" GE said in statement. State Street did not respond to a request for comment, while Goldman Sachs declined to comment.GE's asset management arm managed $115 billion in assets as of June 30. It manages retirement plans for the vast majority of the company's 130,000 U.S. employees, as well as assets for outside institutional investors including third-party retirement plans. GE has said that proceeds from the transaction would be deposited into its pension trust, increasing assets used to pay GE pension plan benefits. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said in its latest annual report that the GE pension plan was underfunded by $15.8 billion at the end of last year, compared to $4.7 billion as of the end of 2013.Assets in GE's principal pension plans earned 5.9 percent in 2014, according to the report. The average return for the top 100 U.S. corporate pension plans was 10.9 percent in 2014, according to benefit consulting firm Milliman.A deal for the asset management business would follow moves by GE to sell the vast majority of GE Capital, a separate $200 billion financing business, as it seeks to return to its industrial roots. The acquisition would also provide a boost to State Steet, which has suffered from fund outflows. Net withdrawals among its long-term institutional clients totaled $100 billion in 2015. Meanwhile, total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $2.54 billion, a 3.3 percent decline from the year-earlier period.State Street had $28 trillion in assets under custody and administration and $2 trillion in assets under management as of the end of December. It has a market capitalization of about $22 billion.

982,"   By Andrea Shalal and Michael Flaherty  Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) Chief Executive David Cote was sporting the casual jeans and sweater he often likes to wear in the office when he was visited by his then-counterpart at United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) in 2012, Louis Chenevert.With Honeywell's stock trading at around $55, Chenevert had come to discuss offering $65 per share to merge the two U.S. aerospace and automation giants.The idea was not new. The two companies had flirted with it for years, even before General Electric Co's (GE.N) failed bid to acquire Honeywell in 2000. But the talks never advanced beyond initial approaches.That time was no different. Cote responded negatively, telling Chenevert he believed Honeywell's stock would be worth $100 in a few years. He was proven right.While Honeywell's stock has risen more than 80 percent since then, and is near all-time highs, UTC's stock has risen only by a third, and is down a third from its 2015 peak.Cote, 63, sensed an opportunity to turn the tables by unveiling a $90.7 billion bid this week. Even after running Honeywell for 14 years, Cote's appetite for the top job is undiminished. He proposed a deal in which Honeywell would be the buyer and lead the merger, with Cote holding both CEO and chairman titles of the combined company.  This account, based on two sources briefed on the meeting and public filings, shows why Honeywell, which had previously shied away from a deal, was happy to confirm its interest in UTC this week from a position of strength. It also illustrates the challenges UTC now faces in resisting a deal.""It is very opportunistic of Dave. I don't blame him, but it's not going to happen,"" Greg Hayes, UTC's CEO since 2014, said on CNBC this week.UTC argues that a merger with Honeywell would face insurmountable antitrust obstacles and strong customer opposition, citing concerns expressed by Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N). Honeywell says antitrust issues are limited and can be addressed through asset sales. Honeywell has also argued that the combined company, which would have a market capitalization of more than $160 billion, would be able to offer a more comprehensive suite of products and services to customers, with the annualized cost synergies reaching $3.5 billion. UTC disputes that figure, and points out that the asset sales required to receive antitrust approval and customer concessions would destroy a lot of value.""If Honeywell wants to buy at a full and fair price, then yes, I would want to sell,"" said Daniel O'Keefe, portfolio manager at mutual fund manager Artisan Partners, which owns a $212 million stake in United Technologies.INVESTOR DAYS     Honeywell, which has a scheduled investor day on March 2,  has no plans to go hostile with its bid, according to the sources. However, UTC's stock has been rising every day since Honeywell's approach was disclosed on Tuesday, and is now up 10 percent since then, as investors bet on a deal happening. As a result, UTC will have to present a compelling standalone plan at its annual investor day on March 10 to keep its shareholders on board. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company has already been going out of its way to maintain investor support.UTC removed Chenevert in late 2014 after he refused to consider a sale of storied helicopter maker Sikorsky, according to the sources. Chenevert, who now works at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), did not respond to requests for comment.Chenevert was succeeded by Hayes, whose first act was to announce a strategic review of all options. He reached out to Honeywell again in April 2015 to explore a merger, but cooled on the idea after he saw the antitrust environment become more stringent and UTC's stock lost value on disappointing earnings.UTC later sold Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) for $9 billion and agreed to use the proceeds to fund additional share repurchases.   BREAKING UP At a time when peers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) have been slimming down to focus on core businesses, UTC has retained its diversity. It makes everything from air conditioners to elevators and fire equipment, to a broad range of aerospace equipment, including tires, cockpits and engines.But UTC's businesses are not all faring equally. Its underperforming Otis elevator division, for example, is facing steep engineering and development costs as the company tries to refresh its product line.In light of UTC's latest snub of Honeywell, it will also have to explain why separating its aerospace from its buildings divisions does not make sense. Hayes has no intention of breaking up the company, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Instead, it will focus on initiatives such as its investment in its Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines.""In terms of capital allocation and portfolio management, UTC has done a pretty good job of looking after shareholders and its assets. But you could argue that the company could be broken up,"" Artisan Partners' O'Keefe said.The fact that UTC and Honeywell have the same top six shareholders - Vanguard Group, BlackRock, MFS Investment, Wellington Management, JPMorgan Asset Management and State Street - means that both companies are largely playing to the same audience.Vanguard, BlackRock, JPMorgan and Wellington declined to comment. MFS and State Street did not respond to requests for comment.    The advanced notice period to propose board members at UTC's annual meeting expired on Jan. 28, so any activist investor would have to wait a year to submit a slate of board directors. As of Dec. 31, no major activist hedge fund was invested in the company's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

988,"   By Marcin Goclowski and Pawel Sobczak | WARSAW  WARSAW Poland's mid-tier lender Alior Bank ALRR.WA, owned by state-run insurer PZU, is in talks to buy its rival Bank BPH BPHP.WA from General Electric (GE.N) and hopes to complete a deal around mid-2016, three banking sources told Reuters.If the purchase from the U.S. group is successful, it would bolster the broader agenda of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which aims to regain more control over a banking sector that is 60 percent foreign-owned. Government officials have signaled that PZU PZU.WA, central Europe's biggest insurance company, should buy more banks as part of this plan.""Alior plans the bank acquisition transaction during the second or third quarter. The plan assumes that Alior will conduct a rights issue to raise money both for the bank and to strengthen its own capital position,"" a source familiar with the matter said.GE's 87 percent stake in Bank BPH has a market value of 2.2 billion zlotys ($550 million). The bank's assets are worth roughly 32 billion zlotys, or 2 percent of the sector's total. GE has said it is selling BPH as part of a strategic shift away from the financial sector but declined to comment on Monday. Alior also declined comment. Another source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the talks. ""Alior is interested in taking over BPH. The transaction could be done in the second part of the year. It is not possible now to talk about the price, because there are still some things that are unknown,"" the source said, without elaborating. A further source said a rights issue was being considered, but there was also an alternative. ""A rights issue is one of the two options that are on the table,"" the source said.The other was that PZU purchases BPH shares directly from GE, after which Alior would buy them back from PZU, the source said, adding: ""There is no decision yet.""PZU said last year it would be able to raise roughly 8 billion zlotys, enough for further purchases as well. A fourth source, an investment banker, said that Alior was in talks aimed at taking over BPH. A sale of BPH would mean GE leaving Polish banking entirely.After years of robust growth, Poland's banking sector faces increasing pressure from record low interest rates and government plans to raise welfare spending at the expense of big corporations, including banks. This pressure has led banks to planning job cuts.Austria's Raiffeisen bank is also seeking buyers for its Polish unit. Two years ago, Nordic banking group Nordea sold its local subsidiary to Poland's largest bank, state-owned PKO BP.The conservative government led by PiS has already imposed a 0.44 percent tax on banking assets and is planning legislation to force banks to re-denominate Swiss franc mortgages for borrowers who want zloty loans. Listed Polish banks lost almost a quarter of their total market value last year, largely because of economic policy concerns.Rising costs mean that mid-tier lenders are hoping to bolster their position through purchases of smaller firms.PZU had been in talks over BPH last year but the deal fell through over the cost. However, analysts say the government's blessing for the insurer to buy more banks may mean it would be willing to pay a higher price for BPH.

What do we want the company to look like, how do we want the company to be challenged?"" said Immelt. He has substantially restructured the company over his almost 15 years at the top, selling off businesses, including plastics and much of its finance operations, and refocusing its core manufacturing businesses on higher-tech products.GE said on Thursday it had selected a 2.5 acre (1 hectare) plot of land along the Fort Point Channel, in Boston's Seaport District, to serve as its new headquarters. It will initially house some 1,000 white-collar staff. ""I want them to be completely paranoid about the world that we're in. Are we moving fast enough, can we do better, who's smarter than we are?""

998,"  General Electric Co (GE.N) said it had agreed to sell GE Capital's U.S. hotel franchise loan portfolio to a unit of Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL.N).The business, which includes outstanding loans of about $1.4 billion, provides real estate financing to owners of limited service hotels.GE said it would also sell to an unnamed buyer its business that provides financing to Canada's hospitality and restaurant industries. The unit has about $300 million of loans. GE said it would gain about $200 million from the deals, which are expected to close in the second quarter.Both the businesses represent a large part of GE Capital's franchise finance unit, which is the last North American business to be sold as part of a plan to cut down the size of GE Capital, GE said.

GE said proceeds from the transaction would be deposited into its pension trust.Reuters reported in early February that Boston-based State Street has prevailed over other bidders, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, for the business.

1004,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Allen | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Former President Bill Clinton on Thursday faced down protesters angry at the impact his 1994 crime reforms have had on black Americans and defended the record of his wife, Hillary Clinton, who is relying on the support of black voters in her quest for the presidency.The former president spent more than 10 minutes confronting the protesters at a campaign rally in Philadelphia for his wife over criticisms that the crime bill he approved while president led to a surge in the imprisonment of black people. The Democratic race for the Nov. 8 election has become increasingly heated as Hillary Clinton, stung by a string of losses in state contests, has traded barbs with her rival for the party's nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, over who is better prepared for the White House. In Philadelphia, several protesters heckled the former president mid-speech and held up signs, including one that read: ""CLINTON Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities.""Video footage of Hillary Clinton defending the reforms in 1994 has been widely circulated during the campaign by activists in the Black Lives Matter protest movement. In the footage, she calls young people in gangs ""super-predators"" who need to ""be brought to heel."" Hillary Clinton, 68, who also has faced protesters upset by her remarks, said in February she regretted her language.Bill Clinton, 69, who was president from 1993 to 2001, defended her 1994 remarks, which protesters say were racially insensitive, and suggested the protesters' anger was misplaced. ""I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children,"" he said, shaking his finger at a heckler as Clinton supporters cheered, according to video of the event. ""Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She (Hillary Clinton) didn't."" ""You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,"" he told a protester. ""Tell the truth.""Hillary Clinton promised to end ""mass incarceration"" in the first major speech of her campaign last year. She has won the support of the majority of black voters in every state nominating contest so far, often by a landslide.Spokesmen for the campaign and Bill Clinton did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment. A SURGE IN PRISONERS The United States has more people in prison than any other country. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1.05 million prisoners were held in federal or state facilities in 1994. By 2014, it was 1.56 million. That year, 6 percent of all black men in their 30s were in prison, a rate six times higher than that of white men of the same age.Bill Clinton said last year that he regretted signing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law because it contributed to the high incarceration rate of black people for nonviolent crimes. On Thursday, he did not explicitly recant those regrets, but appeared to be angry at any suggestion the bill was wholly bad.The legislation imposed tougher sentences, put thousands more police on the streets and helped fund the building of extra prisons. It was known for its federal ""three strikes"" provision that sent violent offenders to prison for life. The bill was backed by congressional Republicans and hailed at the time as a success for Clinton. Although Clinton is popular among Democrats who view him as a gifted orator and crowd pleaser, he has in the past veered from the carefully calibrated message put out by his wife's campaign, causing problems for her representatives.During Hillary Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential bid, civil rights leaders and high-ranking Democrats in Congress criticized the former president for statements he made during a heated campaign against then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama. Bill Clinton said Obama's campaign had “played the race card.” Obama became the first U.S. black president in November that year.Bill Clinton's remarks on Thursday drew criticism online. Some saw him as dismissive of the Black Lives Matter movement, a national outgrowth of anger over a string of encounters in which police officers killed unarmed black people.Johnetta Elzie, a civil rights activist, wrote online that Clinton ""can't handle being confronted by his own record.""""This is like watching a robot malfunction,"" she wrote. Earlier in Philadelphia, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, assailed Clinton as unqualified to be president as the two campaigns became increasingly testy less than two weeks before New York's nominating contest.""Are you qualified to be president of the United States when you're raising millions of dollars from Wall Street, an entity whose greed, recklessness and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy?"" Sanders said at a news conference.Clinton this week sharply questioned Sanders' credentials and ability to carry out a campaign pledge to break up the big banks.Spokesmen for Clinton noted she never said the word ""unqualified"" when she questioned his preparedness for the presidency, but they declined to say whether she believed in that characterization.Clinton aimed for a more magnanimous tone than her aides when speaking to reporters during a subway ride in New York City.""I don't know why he's saying that,"" she said of Sanders calling her unqualified. ""But I will take Bernie Sanders over Ted Cruz or Donald Trump any time,"" she said of the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.Sanders returned the sentiment in an interview with the ""CBS Evening News"" later on Thursday.""I think the idea of a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz presidency would be an unmitigated disaster for this country. I will do everything in my power and work as hard as I can to make sure that that does not happen, and if Secretary Clinton is the nominee, I will certainly support her,"" he said.

1006,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co (GE.N) reported lower first-quarter underlying revenue, citing weak sales of oil and gas drilling equipment, but it forecast a second-half upturn for power generation products that should help it meet its full-year target.Shares of the industrial conglomerate were down 1.5 percent after it said organic revenue, a closely watched figure that excludes foreign exchange and discontinued operations, fell 1 percent. Still, GE affirmed its forecast of 2 percent to 4 percent growth for 2016. Some analysts had said the top end of that range appeared difficult to achieve due to sluggish demand for oil and gas equipment and a weak industrial economy.The company cut its full-year outlook for oil and gas equipment sales, saying it now expects a 30 percent drop. It had previously forecast a 10 percent to 15 percent decline. ""Given the negative revision in the oil and gas outlook, we believe investors will be viewing this growth forecast with skepticism,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said in a research note.GE said power generation equipment shipments were low in the first quarter, but it expects a pickup in the second half of the year. As a result, second-half organic revenue should be up 5 percent, helping the company hit its target, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said on a conference call. ""I feel good about how we're executing on the power business,"" Immelt said, noting anticipated sales of gas turbines and other power generation equipment would be largely responsible for GE hitting its companywide revenue outlook. The company said first-quarter earnings per share, excluding items, rose 5 percent to 21 cents from a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 19 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Foreign exchange costs decreased the figure by 2 cents a share. GE reported a net loss of $98 million, or 1 cent a share, mainly due to non-cash charges from the sale of financial businesses, part of an ongoing divestiture of the GE Capital unit.The company said it still expected a full-year profit of $1.45 to $1.55 a share, excluding items.

1007,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co's healthcare equipment sales are picking up in China as a crackdown on corruption that had slowed new orders tapers off, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said on Friday.    Power equipment sales to China also are strong, reflecting the country's need to build infrastructure, particularly with natural gas, hydro and wind generators, to meet strategic development plans, Bornstein said in an interview.    The uptick in two major GE business lines comes as the company reported higher-than-expected earnings even though a key revenue measure fell 1 percent, raising questions about the company's ability to meet its full year target.    Weak sales of oil and gas equipment caused much of the decline, a factor GE flagged last year. Now, however, the industry may be close to turning up as oil prices recover.     ""We anticipate that the industry is going to bottom mid-year, this summer maybe,"" Bornstein said, noting that the turn may come later in 2016 or in 2017.     It may take longer for customers to react. Most are still deferring decisions on major exploration and production projects, and several big contracts GE expected to land in the quarter did not get signed, Bornstein said.    ""There's definitely a confidence issue in the industry,"" he said.    Meanwhile, China's slowing economic growth, coupled with anti-corruption measures, had curbed sales of products ranging from large medical devices to business jets and luxury goods.      But Chinese demand was improving in several of GE's major businesses, Bornstein said.  Sales of power equipment were up 44 percent in China in the first quarter, while healthcare equipment sales rose 15 percent, he said.    ""That was partly offset by aviation,"" whose sales fell 25 percent because a large order last year skewed the comparison, he added. ""Saying China is weak is missing the point,"" he said. ""In the businesses we are in in China, we really like the Chinese market.""Power generation equipment sales are expected to help GE meet its target of 2 percent to 4 percent growth in overall sales this year, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and divestitures, the company said during a quarterly earnings conference call earlier on Friday.     The company's H-class power turbines, for example, now have 40 market share, up from a single-digit percentage last year.

1017,"   By Geert De Clercq | PARIS  PARIS General Electric (GE.N) wants to become a major player in the offshore wind industry and is interested in buying the Areva-Gamesa (AREVA.PA) (GAM.MC) offshore joint venture Adwen, GE's new head of renewables said on Tuesday.Following its takeover of the energy assets of French Alstom (ALSO.PA), GE in November 2015 created a global renewable energy business unit with sales of 9 billion euros  ($10.42 billion), staff of 13,000, and its headquarters in France. The resulting enlarged unit has built about 25 percent of the world's installed base of hydropower and more than 20 percent of global onshore wind capacity, but has virtually no presence in the capital-intensive offshore business, which GE had always steered clear of.""We have the ambition to become one of the three major players in the offshore wind market,"" GE renewables head Jerome Pecresse told reporters in Paris on Tuesday. He added it was too soon to discuss a market share target. Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE) is European market leader for offshore wind with 63.5 percent of installed capacity end 2015, followed by MHI Vestas (VWS.CO) (7011.T) with 18.5 pct.  With the acquisition of Alstom, GE also acquired contracts to build 1,500 megawatts of offshore wind on the French coast for utility EDF (EDF.PA), which are set to be built by 2019. Areva-Gamesa joint venture Adwen also has contracts to build 1,500 MW of offshore wind on the French coast for utilities Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Iberdrola (IBE.MC).But Germany's Siemens is negotiating a takeover of Gamesa and has no interest in acquiring Adwen, which is blocking the Siemens-Gamesa talks, sources have told Reuters. Pecresse said that GE may be interested in buying Adwen, but that no talks had been held with the companies involved.""We are in favour of a strong French offshore industry and a consolidation of the French players would contribute to that. We look at the evolution of Adwen's capital with interest,"" he said, adding that one big French offshore wind player would make more sense than two smaller ones. Adwen accounted for 5.7 pct of the installed offshore wind base in Europe at the end of 2015, but came second in terms of installations with an 18.2 percent share of newbuild. Industry specialists say that from a competition perspective, it would be difficult for Siemens to buy Adwen and that a third big player in offshore wind would boost competition and help lower prices in the industry.($1 = 0.8639 euros) (Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Andrew Callus and Louise Heavens)",2016-05-03,GE,"Tue May 3, 2016 | 8:22am EDT","GE wants become big player in offshore wind, eyes Adwen takeover",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ge-renewables-france-idUSKCN0XU112?type=companyNews

1020,"   By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE  SEATTLE General Electric Co (GE.N) has agreed to buy a unit of South Korea's Doosan Engineering and Construction Co (011160.KS) that produces key components of combined-cycle power plants, the head of the U.S. company's power division said on Tuesday. The $250 million acquisition, which is subject to approval by regulators and Doosan shareholders, builds on GE's $13.9 billion purchase of Alstom's energy business last year, adding capacity for engineering and manufacturing of heat recovery steam generators used to boost the efficiency of commercial power plants, Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE's power business, said in an interview.While not large in size - the Doosan unit has about $200 million in annual revenue, compared with $29 billion for GE's power unit - GE expects Doosan will increase the amount of equipment it sells with new power plants. It also will help lower costs, increase service revenue and allow GE to use engineering and software to raise plant efficiency, Bolze said.Demand for HRSG systems as part of GE's power plant sales ""is more than doubling ... so we need more capacity,"" Bolze said. The lower costs were expected to flow from expanding in a relatively low-cost region.  ""This will be a double-digit return for GE,"" Bolze said.Doosan's HRSG business, started in 1977, includes a factory in Korea and two in Vietnam, and employs more than 1,400 people, including engineers and production workers, GE said. No significant job reductions were expected at either company as a result of the transaction, Bolze said. Doosan HRSG was already a supplier to GE and the assets would be folded into GE Power, along with Alstom's HRSG business.""We're bringing that into GE to expand our capacity and capability,"" Bolze said. As GE shifts from selling gas-powered turbines to full gas-powered plants, ""we're almost doubling the size of dollars that come into GE from an existing plant in  terms of content."" GE expects high-efficiency gas plants to play the biggest role in meeting global power demands that are expected to grow by 50 percent in the next 20 years.Heat recovery steam generators are large systems, typically 10 stories tall, that take exhaust heat from the gas generator and use it to generate additional power, increasing efficiency. The transaction is expected to close in the second half.

1024,"  DUBAI Saudi Arabia won support for its economic reform plan from one of the world's biggest companies on Monday as General Electric Co (GE) (GE.N) said it would double its workforce in the kingdom to 4,000 people by 2020.GE will cooperate with the government's Saudi Arabian Industrial Investments Co (SAIIC) to develop joint ventures that boost Saudi industrial capacity, chief executive Jeffrey Immelt said in a statement during a visit to the kingdom.SAIIC was established in 2014 with capital of 2 billion riyals ($533 million) as a venture between some of the country's most powerful institutions: the Public Investment Fund (PIF), national oil firm Saudi Aramco and government-controlled Saudi Basic Industries Corp (2010.SE).Under reforms announced by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last month, the PIF is to be developed into a $2 trillion sovereign fund that creates jobs and jump-starts new industries with strategic investments that reduce Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil exports. Immelt said GE was working on several new projects in Saudi Arabia as part of the reform drive, including a $400 million forging and casting venture with Aramco that would supply materials to the marine and energy industries. The facility will be operating by 2020, creating over 2,000 jobs, he said. GE is also developing a maintenance facility for military aviation engines and a manufacturing facility for light-emitting diode (LED) lighting products, as well as training, biotechnology and radiology operations, he added.The projects will help increase the number of Saudi suppliers to GE to 300 from 150, as the company aims eventually to export more than $100 million of products and services annually from Saudi Arabia, it said.

1025,"   By Meng Meng and Florence Tan | BEIJING/SINGAPORE  BEIJING/SINGAPORE Russia was China's largest crude oil supplier for a second month this year, customs data showed on Monday, with shipments in April surpassing imports from Saudi Arabia and hitting a record high as demand from independent refiners remained strong. Crude imports from Russia surged 52.4 percent in April from a year ago to reach 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd), topping the previous record of 1.13 million bpd in December.April imports from Saudi Arabia fell 21.8 percent from a year ago to 1.0 million bpd, the official data also showed, but were still up from 936,500 bpd in the previous month. The record high import volumes from Russia were likely fueled by independent refiners, who are storing oil that they had earlier purchased at lower flat prices, a trader with a Chinese company said.  Unipec, the trading arm of state-controlled oil refiner Sinopec, had also purchased large volumes of Russian ESPO crude for April delivery, a second trader said.  The demand for Russian supplies is expected to fall in June as a rebound in oil prices is set to squeeze processing margins for refiners. ""China's Russia imports will remain stable in May, but are likely to drop in June as independent refineries reduce purchases after oil prices jumped in April,"" said another Beijing-based crude oil trader. Independent refineries nicknamed ""teapots"" have been a big client for the Russian ESPO grade due to low transportation costs and small cargo sizes. The teapots have also been a major contributor to China's total crude imports of 7.46 million bpd for the first four months of this year.  In April, Saudi Aramco sold its first spot cargo to a teapot refinery, a sign the world's biggest exporter is trying to expand its client base in China beyond the state-owned companies.     China's shipments from Iran fell 5.13 percent in April from the same month last year to 671,176 bpd, highest since June 2015. That compared with March's volume of 590,830 bpd. Iran's oil exports are set to surge by nearly 60 percent in May from a year ago, with European shipments recovering to about half of pre-sanction levels.  Iraqi shipments to China rose 11.25 percent in April on year to about 764,837 bpd. For the first four months of the year versus a year ago, imports from Iraq were up 10.24 percent.

1030,"  SEOUL South Korea has picked General Electric Co (GE.N) to supply engines for its homegrown KF-X fighter jet project, preferring the U.S. giant over a European consortium in a deal that could be worth an estimated $3.5 billion.The decision, announced on Thursday by the country's arms procurement agency marks the latest step in Seoul's multi-billion dollar plans to develop its own fighter jets to reduce its heavy reliance on the U.S. military for air defense.The move gives GE preferred bidder status, with a contract expected to be finalised and signed in June. Financial details weren't disclosed, but South Korean media have estimated the deal could be worth about 4.08 trillion won.         Last year, South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration picked Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd (KAI) (047810.KS), which partners with Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), to develop the 8.7 trillion won ($7.4 billion) KF-X jet project.North and South Korea, in a technical state of war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, are separated by the world's most heavily militarized border. KAI plans to develop and produce 170 twin-engined jets initially, with 50 destined for export to Indonesia, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because the situation was confidential. More engines are expected to be sold if KAI successfully exports the KF-X to other countries seeking a relatively cheaper replacement for their U.S.-supplied jets.To power the aircraft, KAI has opted for F414-GE-400 engines, produced by GE Aviation, over a rival bid to supply Eurojet EJ200 engines, made by a consortium that includes Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (RR.L) and MTU Aero Engines AG (MTXGn.DE). GE Aviation scored better results than Eurojet in all four main criteria for the contract, the DAPA said in a statement:  technology, costs, localization and management. South Korea plans to localize production of parts of the KF-X engines by 2022, according to the DAPA.    (Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in SEOUL and Siva Govindasamy in SINGAPORE; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath and Kenneth Maxwell)",2016-05-26,GE,"Thu May 26, 2016 | 4:02am EDT",South Korea picks GE to supply engines for homegrown fighter jets,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-s-korea-ge-jets-idUSKCN0YH0G4?type=companyNews

1032,"  * Boeing mulls putting engine like LEAP-1A on largest 737 MAX* Boeing looking at pair of mid-market jets with 220-260 seats* Decision could usher in technology for next generation of jets* Boeing declines comment, has said mid-market case remains toughBy Tim Hepher and Alwyn ScottPARIS/NEW YORK, May 29 Boeing is considering a plan to put a larger engine on its biggest narrowbody airliner in an effort to blunt the runaway success of a rival Airbus jet that outsells it by four to one, industry sources said.The U.S. planemaker would substitute a modified version of the larger and more powerful LEAP-1A engine used on Airbus's  A321neo rather than the LEAP-1B used on the 737 MAX 9, they said.That would enable Boeing to add range while lengthening the 178-seat jet to fit 12 or more extra passengers and gain a capacity advantage over the 185-seat A321neo, the sources said.Boeing disputes its rival's claims about the strength of demand in this particular section of the market where Airbus has the most advantage. But leapfrogging Airbus's A321neo offering with more seats would hedge Boeing's position as many airlines opt for bigger planes.However, the new plane, nicknamed 737 MAX 10 by some in the  industry, would bring significant headaches.Adding the larger engine would mean raising and possibly repositioning the landing gear and recertifying parts, costing an estimated $1-2 billion, according to industry experts.Boeing's 737 MAX family uses the smaller LEAP engine because the plane's fuselage sits lower to the ground and must therefore have a smaller engine fan. Having a different engine on the largest 737 could weaken the advantage of commonality with the smaller LEAP engine used on the rest of the 737 MAX fleet, but reflects a growing pragmatism in the face of lost sales.""It doesn't matter if they are not consistent,"" said Adam Pilarski, senior vice president at U.S. consultancy Avitas. ""They are getting killed.""The maker of the LEAP engines, CFM, which is co-owned by  General Electric and France's Safran, declined to comment. A GE spokesman said there was no contractual impediment to using a larger engine for Boeing planes.""The LEAP engine was designed to have growth capability,"" he said.BRUTAL COMPETITION  Recent orders by Vietnam start-up airline VietJet illustrate the Airbus-Boeing fight for narrowbody sales. At last November's Dubai Airshow, Airbus celebrated the sale of 30 A321s to VietJet, while Boeing officials watched from the sidelines.But last week Boeing pulled off what industry observers saw as a coup by signing an $11 billion order for 100 737 MAXs with the same airline in the presence of President Barack Obama.Boeing's plans to boost the size of the largest MAX are one option being considered to defend its 737 franchise as it also tries to carve out a space in the middle of the market between the workhorse narrowbody 737 and big wide-body jets like the 787 Dreamliner.Stung by Airbus's gains in orders, Boeing is pondering a mixed bag of tactical and strategic moves that, if fully made, could give it a head start in the development of the next generation of jets for production from about 2030.Narrowbody medium-haul jets like the 737 and A320 family dominate the market by volume, with Airbus forecasting 22,900 deliveries worth $2.2 trillion over the next 20 years.While both have sold thousands of the jets to airlines eager to cut fuel costs, Boeing's share of the market for such jets has fallen to 40 percent compared with a usual 50-50 split. Market sources say Boeing has shown increasing willingness to compete aggressively for Airbus customers in order to claw back market share, as was evident in the VietJet deal.""We expect to see lower pricing from Boeing on the MAX,"" Stuart Hatcher of valuation firm IBA told a briefing.Boeing's tactical tinkering with the 737 also includes tweaking a smaller model to suit two key buyers. And the company's aim extends to a strategic 'middle of the market' jet, partly to replace its popular 757.Industry sources say that project involves not one jet but two. They would have twin aisles and carry 220 and 260 people respectively, equating to what analysts see as two distinct slices of potential demand.The smaller base model would have a range of about 4,500 nautical miles, dropping to about 3,500 for the larger variant.Airbus has dismissed the idea, which would partially overlap with its A321neo. It argues that the history of the market is littered with small twin-aisle jets that sold poorly, including its own A310.But it is holding in reserve a plan to retaliate with another A321 makeover, using new wings to boost performance.Boeing declined comment on either tactical plans to defend the 737 or the longer-term mid-market studies. At $15 billion or more, it has said the latter is a difficult business case.""We're in continuous discussions with our customers about the market. We'll make the right decisions at the right time,"" a spokesman said.While Boeing's mid-market study is grabbing most industry attention, behind it lies a longer-term bid to turn the tables on Airbus in the broader market for smaller jets where both make most cash, according to industry analysts.Although differing in size and appearance, a mid-market jet would spawn new technology and production methods that could be transferred to whatever comes after the 737, they said.

1037,"   By Luciano Costa | SAO PAULO, June 9  SAO PAULO, June 9 General Electric Co has started producing solar power inverters at its plant in Betim, Brazil, looking to supply the country's nascent solar power industry and possibly export the equipment to countries in the region, a GE executive said on Thursday.Despite the unfavorable business environment in Brazil, which is on track for its worst recession ever, GE's marketing director for the Latin America Power Conversion unit, Sérgio Zuquim, said the company was positive about prospects for solar power growth.""That's inevitable, there is no turning back,"" Zuquim said in an interview. ""There is political commitment, following international agreements, for investments on renewables,"" he said.Inverters are a key component on solar power systems. They convert power generated by photovoltaic plates to alternating current, or AC, so it can be fed into a commercial power grid.With the local production, GE consumers would be able to access more favorable credit lines from Brazil's development bank, BNDES, which gives better financing terms on deals for locally produced equipment. The director said the company had already closed four contracts with companies awarded operating licenses for new solar parks in Brazil. The government is promoting solar power generation in an effort to diversify its energy mix.Initial investment to add the production line to the plant in Minas Gerais state was around $20 million, Zuquim said. The initial steps on solar power development in Brazil have not been smooth.Many companies that won licenses in the first licensing round in 2014 have yet to start construction. They are seeking to prolong the deadline to complete the projects, saying Brazil's recent devaluation of the local currency made the projects financially unfeasible, since they still require sizeable imports.There are no PV plate producers operating in Brazil to date. Among companies requesting extension of construction periods are Canadian Solar, Grupo Cobra, Fotowatio and Renova Energia SA.""We will probably have delays on some projects, but others will go ahead and new licensing rounds will happen,"" Zuquim said.Brazil's government has already granted licenses for 3.2 gigawatts of solar projects estimated to require about 13 billion reais ($3.83 billion) of investment.There are two additional licensing rounds scheduled for this year, in July and October.

1038,"   By Nichola Groom  In February of 2001, then California Governor Gray Davis stood at the site of Calpine Corp's new Sutter natural gas power plant and unveiled his plan to fast-track construction of similar stations to add 20,000 megawatts of modern, efficient generation to the state in three years.    Natural gas, Davis said, was ""the most environmentally friendly, clean, appropriate fuel"" to help the state move beyond the energy crisis it had just endured and enable its 34 million residents ""to enjoy the good life that California represents.""     Today, the plants inaugurated that day are among the casualties of a monumental shift in the U.S. energy landscape.    An unexpected combination of oversupply of natural gas and a boom in solar and other renewable energy has depressed power prices and threatened the viability of natural gas plants that sell power into the Golden State's electricity market. These developments are good for consumers and the environment, but tough on power producers who placed huge bets on natural gas.   ""The world is really changing for these independent power producers,"" said Michael Picker, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, in an interview. ""We don't need a lot of gas.""    Calpine, in fact, shut down its Sutter plant earlier this year because of ""poor economics."" And rival Dynegy has said it plans to leave the California market, citing the state's focus on renewables.    To offset losses, Rockland Capital, Calpine and other plant owners, including General Electric and the Carlyle Group's Cogentrix, are asking the state for help. They argue that it is in the state's interest to support the natural gas plants because they provide stability and reliability -- attributes that are important to the state's power grid and something weather-dependent wind and solar can't offer.    If the plants don't get needed support, their owners have warned, a critical safety net for the grid could disappear. GE, which owns the Inland Empire Energy Center in Southern California, said in a statement that state policies ""rank reliability and cost as low priorities,"" adding that generators may be forced to shut down prematurely.    And in a letter to California officials in April, Rockland Capital called its 13-year-old La Paloma plant in Kern County ""one of the victims"" of the rise of large amounts of renewable power, and warned the plant could shut down later this year.      Power producers want more long-term contracts that will compensate them for being there when wind and solar power are unavailable or when demand is particularly high.     ""You do need natural gas generation as a backup for solar,""said Andrew Bischof, an analyst who tracks the power industry for Morningstar.Nuclear power plant owners have made similar arguments in Illinois and New York, where they are competing with renewables and cheaper gas-fired power. But last week, nuclear power plant operator Exelon said it would close two Illinois plants due to a lack of progress on state legislation to support them.   Texas faces similar challenges due to an abundance of wind energy, but the Lone Star state has far more nuclear and coal-fired power than California, which would see shakeouts first.         SOLAR'S RISE Built largely after California's 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the state's new fleet of natural gas plants were meant to address a shortfall in power supplies and fuel population and economic growth for decades to come.     Some plants had 10-year contracts that have now lapsed, while others were built to support the state's spot power market. But power prices in California fell to their lowest level since at least 2001 last year, and in 2016 so far are trading even lower. The low price of natural gas, thanks to the fracking boom, is largely responsible. But renewables also depress spot prices because those prices are determined by the cost of the fuel source, which for wind and solar is zero.    California's big push for renewable power began in earnest with Davis' successor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a decade ago. He set a goal for the state to obtain 33 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2020, an ambitious target that the state's top three utilities are on track to exceed because of government support for wind and solar power and a dramatic drop in the price of those technologies.  Graphic on growth of renewable energy in California: tmsnrt.rs/1U7HvVXAt the same time, rooftop solar capacity has soared faster than expected while older gas-fired power plants have not retired as quickly as state energy officials had projected.    On a recent Thursday, solar was able to provide more than 40 percent of the state's power in the middle of the day -- making  the state's new goal of sourcing 50 percent of its power from renewables by 2030 seem in reach.    With eight times the solar capacity online than there was just three years ago, gas-fired units built to satisfy mid-day demands are increasingly being asked to kick in quickly as the sun goes down. Last month, California's grid operator, the Independent System Operator, said in a report that revenue estimates for many natural gas power plants are substantially below their fixed costs, adding that new gas-fired capacity ""does not appear to be needed at this time.""        Relief is not expected soon. A Moody's report last year forecast that margins for gas power generators selling into California would fall an additional 30 percent by 2019.

1042,"  PARIS, June 16 General Electric is in talks with the French state and several companies about acquiring Areva-Gamesa's  offshore wind joint venture Adwen, GE chief Jeff Immelt told French daily Le Figaro.GE has contracts to build 1,500 megawatts of offshore wind on the French coast for utility EDF following the U.S. company's purchase of energy assets from Alstom last year. These are due to be built by 2019.Asked whether GE was interested in acquiring Adwen, Immelt said France deserved a strong offshore wind industry.""Being bigger would be useful for us. Talks are underway with different parties: Siemens, Areva, Gamesa, us and the French state,"" he said. Adwen also has contracts to build 1,500 MW of offshore wind on the French coast for utilities Engie and Iberdrola .Siemens is negotiating a tie-up with Spanish renewable energy group Gamesa and has not made clear whether it wants to buy out Areva's stake in Adwen. The German company is already the dominant player in EU offshore wind and buying Adwen would push its market share close to 70 percent.GE is a small player in offshore wind in Europe and buying Adwen would make it a third biggest group in that market. But in France, GE would become the only major player in offshore wind. At the end of 2015, Siemens had 63.5 percent of Europe's installed offshore wind capacity, followed by MHI Vestas   with 18.5 pct. Adwen accounted for just 5.7 pct of installed capacity.Last month, French-based GE renewables head Jerome Pecresse said GE wanted to become a major player in the offshore wind industry and was interested in buying Adwen.(Reporting by Geert De Clercq.

1056,"   By Brenda Goh | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI General Electric Co (GE.N) on Wednesday said it would partner with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] to develop smart machines designed to boost productivity, part of a drive to promote its ""industrial internet"" business in China.The U.S. industrial giant announced the partnership as it launched an $11 million digital space in Shanghai, where it plans to incubate start-ups and have developers work on new software applications to make machines more intelligent.The move is part of GE's ambitious plans to lead a productivity revolution in global industry by combining machinery with analytics, after selling off its financial assets and embarking on a major restructuring.Chief Digital Officer Bill Ruh said the world's biggest maker of jet engines and diesel locomotives had already made $500 million in productivity savings for itself this year by using smarter machines, and he expected this to grow to $1 billion in total by 2020.""Once we got it right for ourselves we take it to our customers ... We're bringing this to China, we're open for business in China today to be able to do this,"" he said at a company event in Shanghai.GE is investing $500 million annually in software as part of the digital drive, and Ruh said the company expected the products to bring in about $6 billion in revenue this year.  In September, it said its portfolio of software-related products would yield more than $5 billion in revenue in 2015, swelling to more than $15 billion by 2020. The company posted about $150 billion in revenue in 2014.INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION  GE says it is crucial for industrial firms to digitise their production lines to remain competitive at a time when productivity has fallen from 4 percent to 1 percent globally. The technology promises to connect machines and produce data that can be analysed, for example, to reduce carbon emissions,  lower maintenance costs or improve safety.  GE Vice Chairman John Rice said it was difficult to calculate the potential size of the ""industrial internet"" market.  ""It's potentially bigger than any estimates I've seen, because these capabilities are all going to be developed,"" he told Reuters in an interview. The tie-up with Huawei would see the Chinese communications technology firm adopt GE's Predix operating system, which is already used by China Eastern Airlines Corp (600115.SS), China Telecom (0728.HK) and on Tianjin city's street lamps grid.GE would in turn ""leverage"" Huawei's product portfolio and ""co-create end-to-end applications for customers"", the companies said in a statement.

1060,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co (GE.N) on Friday reported weak demand for new oil, gas and transportation equipment, raising concerns about its full-year performance and sending its shares down as much as 2.8 percent.Still GE, long considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, posted adjusted second-quarter earnings of 51 cents a share that topped analysts' estimates of 46 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE also affirmed its 2016 operating outlook and forecast that strong growth would continue in the second half.    But investors focused on a 16 percent decline in new orders from continuing businesses amid weakness in oil and gas prices and commodity markets that undercut demand, raising questions about its forecast. ""You're counting on the second half being pretty strong, especially in the power business,"" said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, referring to power plant sales. ""Those are capital intensive purchases and if those get pushed out even just a little bit"" it could weaken GE's performance.GE expects sales for the year to grow at the low end of its 2 percent to 4 percent target range. But it said reduced orders, which represent bookings for future sales, would not affect revenue, which comes as deliveries of actual products and is on course. ""We have an enormous backlog (of orders),"" Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview. ""We don't view it as a concern for future revenue.""About 70 percent of the sales that GE expects this year already are in the backlog, he said.Investors also reacted to GE being about $1 billion short of estimates on free cash flow for the quarter, said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""That was attributed to slower accounts receivable collection,"" he said. ""You don't typically hear GE talk about that."" With the stock having had a strong run, he added, ""a little bit of profit-taking is understandable.""GE shares fell 2.2 percent at $31.87 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Other parts of the business did well. GE's revenue rose 15 percent to $33.49 billion, helped by a 31 percent rise in the power business, but that reflected the acquisition of the Alstom (ALSO.PA) power business last year.Sales from continuing industrial operations, known as organic segment revenue, fell 1 percent to $24.4 billion, less than some analysts expected. Power sales without Alstom were up 2 percent. Net profit was $2.73 billion, or 30 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.36 billion, or 13 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.GE's order backlog rose 1.3 percent to $320 billion, reflecting a 2 percent rise in services orders to $233 billion, while equipment orders fell 2.2 percent to $86 billion.During the quarter, GE returned $18 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks. The company shed its designation as a non-bank systemically important financial institution after divesting most of its GE Capital business. The change is expected to free about $18 billion in capital, which GE had pledged to return to shareholders through buybacks.

1068,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published 'AA-/F1+' Long- and  Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for General Electric Company (GE) and  GE Capital Global Holdings, LLC (GE Capital). Fitch has also published debt  ratings for GE and GE Capital, including those of certain GE Capital  subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately $156 billion of GE's  consolidated debt is covered by the ratings. Fitch's ratings and financial measures for GE's industrial businesses (GE  Industrial) consider GE Capital on an equity basis, including approximately $65  billion of GE Capital debt as of June 30, 2016 maintained as intercompany debt  with GE. The ratings for GE Capital incorporate support from GE. A full rating list appears at the end of this release.  STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that GE will maintain a strong  balance sheet and that after completing the divestiture of GE Capital's non-core  businesses the company's priority for cash deployment will be acquisitions,  which would be expected to generate incremental earnings and cash flow. A  smaller GE Capital provides GE with incremental financial flexibility to  leverage its balance sheet over the next several years, but Fitch expects GE  will maintain a disciplined financial strategy that supports its ability to  invest in its long-cycle power and aviation businesses, focus on markets with  high technology content, and maintain strong competitive positions.  The ratings incorporate expectations for potentially substantial capital  deployment for acquisitions over the next several years, as well as continued  high dividend payouts. Industrial debt issuance could be significant depending  on acquisition opportunities. Fitch expects leverage metrics will rise modestly  compared to current levels. The capacity for incremental debt would be supported  by lower absolute risk related to GE Capital, expected growth in earnings and  cash flow over the next several years, and additional earnings and cash flow  from potential acquisitions. Fitch expects credit metrics such as leverage will  remain appropriate for GE's overall enterprise risk level, which Fitch considers  to be relatively low as a result of GE's diversification, strong market  positions, strong services earnings, scale, and technology portfolio.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - GE Industrial The ratings for GE incorporate the company's global presence, broad product  portfolio, large market shares in its core infrastructure and healthcare  markets, and strong technological capabilities. Substantial services revenue  generates more than 80% of GE's industrial operating profit and dampens the  impact on financial results from volatility in the company's energy and capital  goods end-markets. Some credit protection measures are weak for the rating, but  Fitch believes GE's strong operating profile and financial resources give it a  low overall enterprise risk. GE's large scale and market position give it a  broad perspective on industry developments, the capacity to invest in new  technologies, and adjust market trends. When the divestiture of GE Capital's  non-core businesses is completed GE's industrial businesses will represent at  least 90% of consolidated earnings compared with less than 50% several years ago  when GE Capital was larger.  A key rating consideration is the 'GE Capital Exit Plan,' launched in 2015 and  expected to be largely completed by the end of 2016. After its non-core  businesses have been divested, GE Capital will be concentrated in its vertical  businesses that serve the aviation, energy and industrial (working capital  solutions, healthcare equipment finance, and trade payables services) markets.  GE Capital's smaller size reduces the company's exposure to funding, credit  quality, regulatory and other risks inherent to finance companies.  GE Capital will still be large, with assets in excess of $100 billion, and will  make a meaningful contribution to GE's overall financial results. Although the  majority of GE Capital's volume is not directly related to financing sales by  GE's industrial business, GE benefits from the combined domain expertise and  market presence offered by synergies between the finance and industrial  platforms. GE Capital will also contribute to the diversification of GE's  overall business profile, and the strong market position of the GECAS segment  contributes to the quality of the rest of GE's portfolio.  An important aspect of the GE Capital Exit Plan is the significant reduction in  dividends to GE from GE Capital, which Fitch estimates will directionally mirror  the decline in ending net investment (ENI) from $363 billion at the end of 2014  to below $100 billion upon completion of the exit. However, GE's dividend  payments to shareholders will also decline, reflecting share repurchases and a  lower share count targeted by GE associated with the GE Capital Exit Plan.  GE's industrial business portfolio is now largely aligned with the company's  focus on infrastructure markets, reflecting a series of acquisitions and  divestitures. The evolution of GE's business mix should complement the company's  increasingly important digital strategy. Integration and restructuring costs  will pressure profitability this year following the acquisition of Alstom in  late 2015, although GE also will recognize large gains including the divestiture  of its non-core appliance business in June 2016. Fitch expects margins will  recover after 2016 as GE realizes operating synergies and further reduces  corporate costs.  Rating concerns include potential support required for GE Capital albeit much  lower than in the past, large net pension liabilities, the risk that future  larger-than-expected share repurchases or acquisitions could weaken GE's  currently strong financial profile, and cyclicality in GE's infrastructure  markets. However, Fitch believes future acquisitions will be targeted toward  adjacent industrial markets and that GE will be disciplined in its cash  deployment for acquisitions or share repurchases. Other concerns include the  typical large intra-quarter use of commercial paper and the high dividend payout  which affects free cash flow as defined by Fitch. Rating concerns are offset by  GE's diversification, significant financial resources, and steady operating  performance through business cycles compared to its industrial peers.  GE's financial leverage at March 31, 2016 included total adjusted debt/EBITDAR  of 1.7x (2.5x including an adjustment to include customer receivables factored  through GE Capital that totaled $13 billion at Dec. 31, 2015). Fitch estimates  total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will remain near the current range as acquired  earnings at Alstom offset weaker results in the Oil & Gas segment and the loss  of earnings from GE's appliance business. Fitch's calculation of leverage would  be lower when including earnings from GE Capital which Fitch excludes from  EBITDA in order to focus on industrial credit metrics.  Leverage would be higher if GE's intra-quarter use of commercial paper were  included. The company repays most commercial paper at quarter-ends as part of  its working capital management. A portion of the repayment is funded temporarily  from cash located outside the U.S., which Fitch does not typically include as  available cash due to tax liabilities that could be incurred if the cash is  repatriated. GE's industrial business maintained total cash balances of $10.4  billion at the end of 2015 compared to $500 million of commercial paper  balances. GE typically generates strong cash flow from operations. Fitch estimates  operating cash flow in 2016 could be approximately $12 billion-$13 billion,  excluding dividends from GE Capital, compared to more than $10 billion in 2015  which included nearly $2 billion usage for working capital. Fitch estimates FCF  after dividends in 2016 could be slightly positive. Fitch's calculation of FCF  is after pension contributions and excludes dividends from GE Capital. It also  excludes changes in receivables sold to GE Capital. Corporate dividends to  shareholders represent a large use of operating cash flow and contribute to GE's  low FCF compared to some other large industrial companies.  Fitch also considers GE's cash flow metrics adjusted to include dividends from  GE Capital as GE Capital is a significant contributor to GE's consolidated  financial results and valuation. Fitch estimates these dividends, excluding  one-time large dividends in the near term, could be approximately $1 billion  annually after the GE Capital exit is completed.  Over the next two to three years, Fitch expects FCF will be reduced by large  pension contributions to the GE Pension Plan, including approximately $2.1  billion required in 2017. At the end of 2015, GE's pension plans were  approximately 75% funded on a PBO basis, excluding the unfunded GE Supplemental  plan. No contributions to the GE Pension Plan were required in 2014 or 2015 and  are not required in 2016. GE expects to contribute $250 million to the GE  Supplementary Pension Plan and for administrative expenses on its principal  plans in 2016. It expects to contribute $930 million to its other pension plans.  GE Capital plans to pay $35 billion of dividends to GE under the GE Capital Exit  Plan, including $18 billion in 2016. The large dividends will fund $35 billion  of share repurchases. Other returns to GE shareholders include regular dividends  and the $20 billion split-off of Synchrony Financial in 2015. GE's $10 billion acquisition of Alstom's thermal, renewables and grid businesses  is consistent with GE's strategy to focus on its strengths in industrial  infrastructure. Alstom's substantial installed base boosted GE's services  revenue, particularly in the Power business where GE's services backlog  increased by approximately 23% to $63 billion following the acquisition.  Alstom's project portfolio included a $29 billion equipment and services  backlog, and its electrical grid businesses expanded GE's global scale in  utility and industrial markets. Some of Alstom's businesses were contributed to  three joint ventures (grid technology, renewable energy, and global nuclear and  French steam power) to which GE contributed its Digital Energy business. Fitch  believes GE should achieve its targeted annual cost synergies associated with  the acquired Alstom businesses of $3 billion over five years, including $1.1  billion in 2016, partly offset by $1.9 billion of total implementation costs.  The Oil and Gas segment has been especially affected by lower oil prices and the  resulting decline in demand for oilfield equipment and services, with orders  down approximately 39% in the first half of 2016, GE is implementing $800  million of cost reductions to achieve its targeted 30% organic decline in  segment operating profit for the year. Revenue in the Transportation segment is  likely to fall by in 2016 due to rising industry levels of parked locomotives  associated lower commodity-driven freight shipments, and the sale of the  signaling business to Alstom in late 2015.  Most of GE's other businesses should see higher sales in 2016, particularly the  Power, Renewables and Aviation segments, which are benefiting from shifts  associated with environment concerns (Power and Renewables) and high backlogs in  commercial aerospace (Aviation). Sales in the Transportation segment likely will  decline due to lower freight volumes at its rail customers and by comparison  with a solid year in 2015. Concerns about cyclicality are mitigated by GE's low  earnings volatility, considerable financial flexibility, large installed base of  equipment, high-margin services business, and a substantial backlog which can be  expected to contribute to GE's future earnings, cash flow and financial  flexibility.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - GE Capital  The IDRs for GE Capital and its rated subsidiaries are linked to and equalized  with those of GE, reflecting Fitch's view that GE Capital is a core subsidiary  of GE, as defined under Fitch's 'Global Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating  Criteria.'  This view is supported by the fact that GE Capital remains a key and integral  part of certain of GE's industry verticals, shares its branding with the broader  GE organization and benefits from explicit guarantees of its existing financial  obligations. GE has made strong legal commitments to support GE Capital under  the second global supplemental bond indenture dated Dec. 2, 2015, under which GE  Capital's existing obligations are fully, irrevocably and unconditionally  guaranteed by GE. In addition, GE Capital operates in the same jurisdictions as  GE and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE. Lastly, the reduced size of GE  Capital's assets to $219.4 billion as of June 30, 2016 from $500.6 billion as of  Dec. 31, 2014, increases GE's financial ability to support GE Capital. Credit strengths of GE Capital on a standalone basis include its strong  franchise and global brand, market leading position in aircraft lending and  leasing, established positions in energy finance and industrial finance, strong  and experienced management team, adequate liquidity, reduced commercial paper  utilization, and high unsecured debt levels.  Credit constraints on a standalone basis include reliance on wholesale funding  sources, cyclicality and residual value risk inherent in certain of GE Capital's  activities, particularly aircraft leasing, and less regulatory oversight of GE  Capital going forward.  Fitch views GE Capital's execution on the exit plan as strong, with signed  agreements with buyers for $181 billion of ENI excluding liquidity, of which  $158 billion was completed as of June 30, 2016. In 2015, GE Capital also  finalized the split-off of Synchrony Financial, merged legacy General Electric  Capital Corporation into GE, and exchanged $36 billion of legacy General  Electric Capital Corporation debt for new GE guaranteed notes. GE Capital  returned $25 billion to GE in 2015 including dividends and paid $15 billion in  dividends to GE year-to-date through July 2016, with $18 billion expected for  full-year 2016.  GE announced that the Financial Stability Oversight Council had rescinded GE  Capital's designation as a Domestic Systemically Important Financial Institution  (D-SIFI) effective June 28, 2016. However, GE Capital remains indirectly  regulated, as its foreign subsidiary, GE Capital International Holdings Limited,  remains supervised by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority until its banking  interests in the European Union are exited.  GE Capital has strong underwriting standards and risk controls. In 2012, it  enhanced its economic capital (E-Cap) framework based on regulatory guidance and  industry practice. The E-Cap model utilizes various tools that are driven by  simulations and Value-at-Risk across various asset classes. These include  aircraft operating leases and aircraft loans in GE Capital Aviation Services  (GECAS), debt, tax equity and equity investments in structured and project  finance in GE Energy Financial Services (EFS), and working capital solutions and  trade payables services in GE Industrial Finance (IF). The company also performs  ongoing stress testing. GE Capital's overall control framework consists of  limits, product standards, monitoring and reporting to governing bodies  including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and GE Board of Directors,  which ensures compliance and regular monitoring. Asset quality metrics have been largely stable despite the shift in portfolio  mix as a result of the exit plan that has weakened overall lessee and borrower  credit quality. Allowance for losses on financing receivables totaled $74  million in 2Q'16, representing 0.31% of financing receivables, down from $81  million in 2015 (0.32% of financing receivables) and $93 million in 2014 (0.36%  of financing receivables). However, GE management recently stated that the oil  and gas environment remains tough, and therefore Fitch expects that energy  equity investments could face further asset quality challenges in the near to  medium term. GE Capital's leverage ratio, defined by Fitch as gross debt to tangible equity  (total shareowners' equity plus preferred equity less goodwill and other  intangible assets) was 4.5x as of June 30, 2016, compared to 5.2x as of Dec. 31,  2015 and 4.1x as of Dec. 31, 2014. Company-reported gross debt to equity (gross  debt less liquidity divided by shareowners' equity) was 4.1x as of June 30,  2016, down from 4.6x as of Dec. 31, 2015 and 4.0x as of Dec. 31, 2014. Fitch  expects this leverage ratio to remain within the 4.5x-5.0x range over the next  two years, now that the D-SIFI designation has been rescinded. Fitch tends to  focus on gross debt leverage ratios; however, company-reported net debt to  equity was 2.5x as of June 30, 2016, down from 2.6x as of Dec. 31, 2015 and 3.1x  as of Dec. 31, 2014. While current and future leverage ratios are viewed as higher than Fitch's  quantitative benchmarks for a standalone finance and leasing company rated  'AA-', the GE guarantee on GE Capital's debt and GE's ability to provide support  to GE Capital offset the standalone leverage ratio. GE Capital's earnings and profitability ratios in 2015 and the year-to-date  period ended June 30, 2016 were negatively impacted by one-time financial  charges associated with the GE Capital exit plan, as well as losses from  discontinued operations. Net loss from GE Capital attributable to GE common  shareowners was $2.3 billion in the first half of 2016 and a $15.8 billion net  loss in 2015, compared to net earnings of $6.9 billion in 2014 and net earnings  of $5.9 billion in 2013. Fitch expects financial charges and earnings from  discontinued operations to become less meaningful as the company completes the  GE Capital Exit Plan throughout the remainder of 2016.  On a core basis, Fitch views GE Capital's earnings as strong, supported in part  by the benefit of lower funding costs relative to most standalone finance and  leasing companies. Return on average assets (ROAA), defined as GE Capital's net  earnings attributable to GE common shareholders excluding after-tax charges  related to the GE Capital Exit Plan divided by average assets, was 1.5% in 2015,  though negative 1.4% in the first half of 2016 due to the timing of charges  prior to dispositions. ROAA was 1.4% in 2014, 1.1% in 2013 and also 1.1% in  2012.  The 'AA-' IDR for GE Capital EFS Financing Inc. reflects the credit support  provided by GE Capital, and thus GE, to GE Capital EFS Financing Inc. The 'F1+'  rating for GE Capital Treasury Services LLC follows the formation of this entity  as an issuer of commercial paper, guaranteed by GE, which is used to fund  short-term working capital needs of GE Capital's operations.  The 'AA-' senior secured debt rating of GE Capital and the 'AA-' senior  unsecured debt ratings of GE Capital International Funding Co. and other GE  Capital subsidiaries are equalized with the IDRs of these entities and reflect  Fitch's expectation of average recoveries. The 'A+' subordinated debt rating and  the 'A' preferred stock rating reflect incremental risk relative to the IDR;  these notches are a function of increased loss severity due to subordination and  heightened risk of non-performance relative to senior obligations.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for GE Industrial include: --Organic revenue grows by low single digits in 2016 as higher sales in the  Power, Aviation and Renewables segments more than offsets lower sales of  locomotives and a large decline in the oil and gas segment. --EBITDA margins in 2016 decline due to the negative impact of the Alstom  acquisition. Margins improve after 2016 due to benefits from the integration of  Alstom, lower restructuring costs, and ongoing cost improvements. --The GE Capital Exit Plan is completed as planned.  --Large dividends from GE Capital are used to fund share repurchases in the next  two to three years as part of the GE Capital Exit Plan. --Alstom integration contributes to cost synergies, including $1 billion in  2016.  --GE generates positive FCF. --Cash deployment prioritizes acquisitions over share repurchases. Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for GE Capital include: --GE Capital's outstanding debt will remain explicitly guaranteed by GE. --GE Capital will pay $18 billion in dividends to GE in 2016. --GE Capital's gross debt to tangible equity calculated by Fitch and GE  Capital's company-reported gross debt to equity (gross debt less liquidity  divided by shareowners' equity) will remain around 4.5x-5.0x over the Outlook  horizon. --The company will complete the exit plan by year-end 2016 with ENI remaining  around $80 billion. RATING SENSITIVITIES GE Industrial  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --GE directs its operating strategy away from its industrial businesses; --Market shares decline materially; --Services generate a consistently lower proportion of revenue and profit; --EBITDA margins fail to recover following an expected decline in 2016; --GE Capital's asset quality and liquidity are weaker than expected, resulting  in lower dividends to, or requiring support from, GE.  --GE's financial strategy becomes more aggressive than expected, including  debt-funded acquisitions or share repurchases that lead to consistently higher  leverage, including total adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 2.0x (above 3.0x  including Fitch's adjustments for factored receivables), or funds from  operations (FFO) adjusted leverage sustained above 2.2x (above 3.2x including  Fitch's adjustments for factored receivables). Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --Segment margins increase toward 20% on a sustained basis.  --FCF and liquidity are sufficient to reduce GE's average commercial paper usage  well below $10 billion. GE Capital As long as GE Capital's outstanding debt remains explicitly guaranteed by GE,  Fitch cannot envision a scenario where GE Capital's ratings would not be  equalized with those of GE. If in the future, GE Capital or its subsidiaries  were to issue (or signal their intention to issue) debt that did not benefit  from an explicit guarantee from GE, Fitch would consider the degree of strategic  importance of GE Capital to GE and the willingness and ability of GE to extend  financial support to GE Capital in determining the ratings of GE Capital and its  debt obligations. Since the ratings of GE Capital and its rated subsidiaries are  linked to those of GE, the rating sensitivities for GE Capital are the same as  those listed above for GE Industrial. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE GE Industrial's liquidity at June 30, 2016 included cash of $10 billion. Most of  GE's cash is held outside the U.S. and is subject to income taxes if  repatriated. Average cash and debt balances are higher than reported at  quarter-ends due to GE's use of commercial paper. Commercial paper typically is  highest during intra-quarter periods and is substantially repaid before  quarter-ends using overseas cash. Liquidity also included $20 billion of credit  lines exceeding one year. GE Capital has indirect access to the lines through  intercompany loans from GE Industrial.  At March 31, 2016, GE Industrial's liquidity was offset by nearly $3.4 billion  of debt due within one year, excluding amounts assumed from GE Capital. GE's  industrial debt totaled $19.4 billion and included approximately $15 billion of  notes due between 2017 and 2044. GE Capital has strong liquidity and financial flexibility. GE Capital had $56  billion of liquidity as of June 30, 2016 and its next 24 months liquidity  coverage ratio, defined as cash, bank line availability and readily available  investment securities divided by debt maturities is 171%. Additionally, 96.8% of  GE Capital's debt funding was unsecured as of June 30, 2016. GE Capital's  commercial paper outstanding as of June 30, 2016 totaled $5 billion or 4.9% of  total funding.

1074,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co's (GE.N) recent purchase of part of Doosan Engineering & Construction Co Ltd (011160.KS) of Korea will sharply boost the U.S. manufacturer's revenues from energy assets acquired last year from France's Alstom SA (ALSO.PA), a senior GE executive said on Tuesday.GE's purchase of Doosan's heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) unit for $250 million provides critical engineering and manufacturing capacity that GE needs as sales increase in the businesses it acquired from Alstom, Joe Mastrangelo, Chief Executive Officer of GE's gas power systems business, said in an interview.New equipment orders in GE's power division, excluding Alstom, fell 11 percent in the second quarter. But since the Alstom deal closed last November, GE has added 30 orders for heat recovery steam generators to its backlog, Mastrangelo said, noting that the company typically sold 14 per year before the acquisition. GE acquired the Alstom energy business for $9.5 billion last year. Alstom SA is now focused on its transport business, such as building trains.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told investors in July he expects those energy assets acquired from Alstom to deliver 5 cents a share in profits for the year. GE's Alstom business had $7.5 billion in orders during the first half of the year, he said. An HRSG is part of a combined cycle plant and provides about one third of its power.The purchase of Doosan's HRSG business, which closed Tuesday, will help GE fill those new orders while also gaining after-sale service revenue and project management capability, Mastrangelo said.  ""This allows us to double the output of the product into our business,"" he said.The Alstom deal increased revenue from each massive gas power plant GE sells. Before the purchase, GE's sales totaled about $175 per kilowatt of capacity in a typical large plant. Now, the figure is more than $300 per kilowatt.  ""Even if you had a flat market, we'll still grow because of the Alstom capability,"" Mastrangelo said.

1075,"   By Diane Bartz  Praxair Inc's contemplated merger with Linde AG would cut the number of global industrial gas suppliers to three from four, posing antitrust challenges and drawing scrutiny from regulators wary of more mega deals.Antitrust experts said the companies, which announced they were in early-stage talks on Tuesday, would likely have to agree to divestitures to create the world's largest industrial gas company with a market value of more than $60 billion.""It does strike me as a deal that will prompt serious antitrust scrutiny. Antitrust enforcers will want to look at submarkets,"" said Seth Bloom, formerly of the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and now in private practice.Antitrust authorities have been flexing muscle regarding  transformative mergers. Deals they have challenged include Anthem’s $45 billion purchase of Cigna, Aetna’s $33 billion acquisition of Humana, and U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Co's $34.6 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes Inc. Consolidation in industrial gases, including Air Liquide SA's $13 billion acquisition of Airgas in May, has left Air Liquide, Linde, Praxair and Air Products and Chemicals Inc providing most of the oxygen, nitrogen, argon and other gases to industries ranging from oil companies to drugmakers. Air Liquide has 29 percent of the U.S. industrial gas market, Praxair has 21 percent, Linde has 15 percent and Air Products has 14 percent, according to the most recent annual data from industry news provider gasworld Business Intelligence. A merger of Praxair and Linde would create a sector leader with 36 percent of the U.S. market.The story is similar in Europe, where Air Liquide has 32 percent of the market, Linde has 30 percent, Air Products has 13 percent and Praxair has 7 percent, according to gasworld.Such market shares would give regulators on both sides of the Atlantic pause, antitrust experts said. Praxair and Linde will likely have to review their business with regulators market by market, in regions as small as one metropolitan area, experts said. ""There will be a settlement offer, and the question will be whether the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) thinks it's enough,"" said Ethan Glass of the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan LLP, who argued for the U.S. Department of Justice as it sought to stop Electrolux AB from buying General Electric Co's appliance business. Air Liquide's acquisition of Airgas offers some insight into the scrutiny to be expected. When the U.S. Federal Trade Commission reviewed the deal, it required a divestiture of assets to preserve competition for dry ice in the San Francisco Bay area. Adding to the uncertainty are questions over the FTC's composition next year. The final decision on antitrust clearance will likely be made by the next administration, since a new U.S. president will take office in January and a major antitrust review can last a year. The FTC, which normally has five commissioners, currently has three: two Democrats and a Republican.

""General Electric has made an offer for (Adwen's) assets, which is impossible to accept,"" one source said.Another source said GE had made an informal approach but had not submitted a formal offer. GE has until Sept 17 to sweeten its bid and make a binding offer.Officials at Areva, Adwen and GE all declined to comment. Spain's Gamesa is being merged with German industrial group Siemen's (SIEGn.DE) wind power division to create the world's biggest builder of wind farms in a 10 billion-euro ($11 billion) deal, but Adwen has been a sticking point.Adwen has contracts to build 1,500 megawatts of offshore wind power generating capacity on the French coast for utilities Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Iberdrola (IBE.MC). These were awarded at above-market prices, but come with obligations to build factories and create jobs in France.When Siemens and Gamesa agreed their merger in June, they  specified that Areva had three months to decide whether it wanted to buy out Gamesa's 50 percent Adwen stake, or sell it to them.    This opened the door for an offer from GE, which wants to become a major player in offshore wind and has expressed an interest in buying Adwen.

These contracts too come with obligations for factories and jobs, and while an Adwen takeover would make GE the dominant player in the French offshore wind power market, that market is seen as too small to support the number of factories the government had envisaged.A spokeswoman for Gamesa said the Adwen sale process was on track and there was no final decision made about it.

1100,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co (GE.N) said it will receive $1.9 billion for a contract to supply steam turbines, generators and other equipment to the Hinkley Point C project, the United Kingdom's first new nuclear power plant in decades.By approving Hinkley Point on Thursday, the UK government cleared the way for GE to begin building two 1,770-megawatt Arabelle steam turbines and generators capable of powering six million homes and supplying about 7 percent of the UK's power generation needs for 60 years, GE said. They will replace older coal-fired plants, GE said.The government of British Prime Minister Theresa May approved the controversial 24 billion (18.17 billion pounds)project on Thursday, after putting it on hold in July.GE had already been doing early engineering work on the project to build one of the largest nuclear plants in the world. The U.S. industrial company acquired the contract and capability when it purchased the power assets of France's Alstom (ALSO.PA) last year. Alstom won the competition a few years ago, GE said. The UK decision ""confirms our technology leadership and it also confirms that it was not such a bad decision to buy Alstom,"" Andreas Lusch, chief executive officer of steam power systems at GE Power, said in an interview on Thursday.New nuclear projects are slowly recovering after a steep drop following the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan. GE is also bidding on nuclear competitions in Finland, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, India and China, Lusch said. ""We are involved in all of those projects in the tendering phase,"" he said.The UK government's agreement to move ahead with Hinkley Point also established a new UK investment policy aimed at giving the country greater control when foreign states are involved in buying stakes in ""critical infrastructure"" in the future.The project, being built by French state-controlled utility company EDF (EDF.PA), includes an $8 billion investment from Chinese state-backed firm China General Nuclear Power Corporation (IPO-CGNP.HK). EDF said it had agreed with the UK government that it would not sell its controlling stake in the project, raising concern among some analysts about EDF's risk profile.

1101,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON, Sept 19  LONDON, Sept 19 General Electric is digging deeper into biotechnology with plans to build four prefabricated drug factories in Ireland, bringing to Europe a low-cost manufacturing concept it first pioneered in China.The U.S. conglomerate, better known for making jet engines and turbines, said on Monday it would invest 150 million euros  ($167 mln) in a biopharmaceutical campus in county Cork. The new factories on the site will be owned and run by GE customers.The GE BioPark Cork site is expected to create 500 jobs by the time it is fully operational, in a boost for Ireland, whose low tax rates have helped it attract top drug companies. GE reckons its off-the-shelf modules are 25 to 50 percent cheaper than the traditional plants needed for making complex biological medicines. They can also be constructed in just 18 months rather than the typical three years.The first such GE prefab factory was built for JHL Biotech  in China, where it recently started operations. Pfizer has also a so-called KUBio unit going up in China. Both these factories are designed to produce cut-price biosimilars, or copies of expensive biotech drugs. Demand for such biosimilars is set to increase as patents expire on top-selling injectable medicines like AbbVie's  Humira for rheumatoid arthritis and Roche's  breast cancer treatment Herceptin.KUBio factories offer GE a way to build up its presence in biotech medicine, which it sees as a central plank of its life sciences business. GE life sciences sales reached $4 billion in 2015, out of total GE Healthcare revenue of $18 billion. GE technology is already used to make leading antibody drugs and the company also aims to become a big supplier in the emerging field of cell therapy.GE is expected to start building the factories in Cork next year. The investment is a boost for Ireland whose low tax regime has come under scrutiny. The Irish government is set to appeal against a 13-billion-euro back tax demand imposed by the European Commission on technology giant Apple, fearing it could undermine the country's long-established policy of attracting multinationals with low taxes.Ireland has been attracting drugmakers since the 1970s, helped more recently by its 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. Nine of the top 10 global drug companies today have an international base in Ireland.

1105,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON General Electric (GE.N) is digging deeper into biotechnology with plans to build four prefabricated drug factories in Ireland, bringing to Europe a low-cost manufacturing concept it first pioneered in China.The U.S. conglomerate, better known for making jet engines and turbines, said on Monday it would invest 150 million euros  ($167 mln) in a biopharmaceutical campus in county Cork. The new factories on the site will be owned and run by GE customers.The GE BioPark Cork site is expected to create 500 jobs when fully operational, in a boost for Ireland, whose low tax rates have helped it attract hi-tech companies - also sparking an angry row with Brussels in the case of Apple (AAPL.O). Ireland has long been a major base for drug companies such as Pfizer (PFE.N) and it has recently seen a wave of new investments by firms making biotech medicines.""Ireland is a real hub for biopharmaceuticals, so it's logical to do it there,"" Kieran Murphy, chief executive for life sciences at GE Healthcare, told Reuters. ""It's one of the key places people are going in the world, along with Singapore, Korea and China."" GE reckons its off-the-shelf modular factories are 25 to 50 percent cheaper than the traditional plants needed for making complex biological medicines. They can also be constructed in just 18 months rather than the typical three years.The first such GE prefab factory was built for JHL Biotech (6540.TWO) in China, where it recently started operations. Pfizer has also a so-called KUBio unit going up in China. Both these factories are designed to produce cut-price biosimilars, or copies of expensive biotech drugs.Demand for such biosimilars is set to increase as patents expire on top-selling injectable medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV.N) Humira for rheumatoid arthritis and Roche's (ROG.S) breast cancer treatment Herceptin. KUBio factories offer GE a way to build up its presence in biotech medicine, which it sees as a central plank of its life sciences business. GE life sciences sales reached $4 billion in 2015, out of total GE Healthcare revenue of $18 billion.GE technology is already used to make leading antibody drugs and the company also aims to become a big supplier in the emerging field of cell therapy.GE is expected to start building the factories in Cork next year. The U.S. conglomerate has yet to line up buyers for the units but Murphy said: ""I don't think it will take us very long to snag the first customer."" The investment is a fillip for Ireland whose low tax regime has come under scrutiny. The Irish government is set to appeal against a 13-billion-euro back tax demand imposed by the European Commission on technology giant Apple, fearing it could undermine the country's long-established policy of attracting multinationals with low taxes.Ireland has been attracting drugmakers since the 1970s, helped more recently by its 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. Nine of the top 10 global drug companies today have an international base in Ireland.

1107,"  * Relatives of Sept. 11 victims can sue Saudi* Legal action could take years, have little impact* But reminder of political, financial pressures on Saudi* Riyadh preparing for big international bond issue* Investment policy in U.S. may be reviewed   (Updates with analysis, context, implications for bond issue)By Andrew Torchia and Tom ArnoldDUBAI, Sept 29 The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the U.S. Congress voted to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia.Any legal action could take years to wind through the U.S. court system, and analysts said there might be little if any impact on the Saudi economy or state finances. But the decision by Congress was an unwelcome reminder of political and financial pressures on Riyadh as low oil prices strain its budget.Saudi Arabia has been preparing to make its first international issue of sovereign bonds next month to raise $10 billion or more, but some Gulf bankers said the issue might now be delayed to give investors time to digest the news. Similarly, the legal threat could make Riyadh less likely to choose New York for a listing of shares in national oil giant Saudi Aramco. An offer of Aramco shares is expected as soon as 2017, possibly raising tens of billions of dollars, and Saudi officials have said they are considering several foreign bourses.The Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to override President Barack Obama's veto of legislation granting an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil.This clears the way for attempts to seek damages from the Saudi government. Riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.One-year dollar/riyal forwards, which are trades scheduled to take place 12 months from now, were at 550 points early on Thursday, up from Wednesday's close of 330 points. They rose as far as an eight-week high of 625 points. The Saudi riyal is pegged at 3.75 to the dollar in the spot market, so banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks.""In the short term you might have volatility but the legislation will take a decade to have a result, so markets will calm down,"" predicted a banker involved in Gulf currency trade, adding the main impact might be to saddle the Saudi government with tens of millions of dollars in annual legal fees.Five-year Saudi credit default swaps, used to insure against the risk of a sovereign debt default, rose slightly to 157 points from 152, and the Saudi stock market  fell slightly.But the price of state-run Saudi Electricity Co's  April 2023 dollar Islamic bond, one of the few outstanding international bonds from Saudi Arabia, did not move significantly. Some analysts speculated that trade and investment ties between Saudi Arabia and the United States could be hurt. The kingdom owns $96.5 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds, according to the latest official U.S. data, and is believed to hold at least that sum in other U.S. assets and bank accounts.""From a Saudi foreign ministry perspective, there will be a review of investment policy and that could move the kingdom down a different path, which could include diversification away from U.S. Treasuries,"" the Gulf banker said.In May, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said the proposed U.S. law ""would cause an erosion of investor confidence"" in the United States, though he added that Riyadh was not threatening to pull its money out of the country.Riyadh has been selling several billion dollars in U.S. bonds each month to cover its budget deficit, and bankers think it is unlikely to step this up as a result of the Congress vote. That is because few other markets or currencies provide the combination of liquidity and security of the $13 trillion U.S. Treasury market.Saudi Arabia has also been eagerly courting investment by top U.S. companies such as General Electric Co to help diversify its economy beyond oil, and a trade or investment war with the United States could damage its economic reform drive.""The U.S. is a market where the Saudis will continue to invest. I don't think they'll adopt a knee-jerk reaction to their investments,"" said John Sfakianakis, economist with the Jeddah-based Gulf Research Centre.""If it makes sense, they will continue to keep their assets in the United States.""

Varian Medical Systems and General Electric declined to comment on the story.Roughly 2,100 Varian Medical Systems call contracts betting on the shares rising above $100 by Friday changed hands by 12 p.m. ET (1600 GMT), with volume over three hours exceeding the past month's total volume. Call options give the right to buy shares at a fixed price at a future date and provide a relatively cheap way to profit from a rally in shares. The options, which traded in small lots of a few contracts each, had an average price of 47 cents. The contracts rose as high as $6.50 and last changed hands for $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters data.The timing of the trades, just hours before the report, and the unusual trading volume, makes the trades appear suspicious, Fred Ruffy, analyst at options analytics firm Trade Alert said. The use of very short-term calls that expire on Friday with a strike price just above the share price also makes the trades suspicious he said.Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of deals, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in the past announced enforcement action for alleged insider trading involving options.

1121,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co (GE.N) scaled back expectations for its full-year revenue and profit on Friday, overshadowing third-quarter profit that beat analyst forecasts and sending its shares lower.    Weak global economies and low oil prices hit the industrial giant's sales of oil and gas infrastructure equipment especially hard. This limited GE's organic revenue growth, which excludes acquisitions, to just 1 percent in the quarter.The company's shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.81 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier the stock fell 2 percent, the biggest decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.On the plus side, GE's adjusted quarterly profit jumped 10 percent to 32 cents a share, exceeding the 30 cents that analysts had estimated on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts said the beat was not a complete surprise since they had recently trimmed estimates by two or three cents.GE also raised its full-year target for cash returned to shareholders to $30 billion from $26 billion and noted it had returned $25 billion in the first three quarters. The company lifted its cash flow outlook to at least $32 billion, up from a range of $29 billion to $32 billion it forecast at the end of the second quarter. FORECASTS ADJUSTED But GE trimmed its full-year revenue forecast to flat to 2 percent growth, down from 2 percent to 4 percent growth. It also narrowed its adjusted profit forecast to between $1.48 and $1.52 a share, compared with the $1.45 to $1.55 a share forecast at the end of the second quarter.      GE's weak revenue largely reflected the continuing reluctance of oil and gas companies to make new long-term investments, despite signs that the market is picking up, GE officials said. GE's oil and gas segment revenue slumped 25 percent in the quarter, disappointing analysts, who had been hoping GE would report stronger revenue growth after a weak first half.Three big international oil and gas deals that GE had expected to close in the second half have been delayed or suspended, so GE cut them from its projections for the year, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein told Reuters. Bornstein said he thought the oil and gas market had bottomed during the summer and there were clear signs of growth in rig counts and other measures in North America. But sales of GE's large equipment would take longer to improve. ""We believe it'll begin to turn in 2017,"" he said. ""The speed with which that happens I don't exactly know.""Investors had been skeptical that GE's organic revenue growth could hit analysts' estimates of about 5 percent in the fourth quarter, Sanford C Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote in a note. Now, the anemic third-quarter growth ""again calls into question the company's ability to hit the 5 percent"" target, he said.While strength in GE's healthcare, aviation and renewable energy businesses helped, ""there is not going be the significant turnaround in the second half that was originally anticipated,"" said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis.Still, cost-cutting in oil and gas and other businesses and a diminishing drag from foreign exchange translation should allow GE to deliver $2 a share in adjusted earnings in 2018, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said on a conference call.

Analysts said the beat was not a complete surprise since they had recently trimmed estimates by two or three cents.GE also raised its full-year target for cash returned to shareholders to $30 billion from $26 billion and noted it had returned $25 billion in the first three quarters. The company lifted its cash flow outlook to at least $32 billion, up from a range of $29 billion to $32 billion it forecast at the end of the second quarter. FORECASTS ADJUSTED But GE trimmed its full-year revenue forecast to flat to 2 percent growth, down from 2 percent to 4 percent growth. It also narrowed its adjusted profit forecast to between $1.48 and $1.52 a share, compared with the $1.45 to $1.55 a share forecast at the end of the second quarter.      GE's weak revenue largely reflected the continuing reluctance of oil and gas companies to make new long-term investments, despite signs that the market is picking up, GE officials said. GE's oil and gas segment revenue slumped 25 percent in the quarter, disappointing analysts, who had been hoping GE would report stronger revenue growth after a weak first half.Three big international oil and gas deals that GE had expected to close in the second half have been delayed or suspended, so GE cut them from its projections for the year, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein told Reuters. Bornstein said he thought the oil and gas market had bottomed during the summer and there were clear signs of growth in rig counts and other measures in North America. But sales of GE's large equipment would take longer to improve. ""We believe it'll begin to turn in 2017,"" he said. ""The speed with which that happens I don't exactly know.""Investors had been skeptical that GE's organic revenue growth could hit analysts' estimates of about 5 percent in the fourth quarter, Sanford C Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote in a note. Now, the anemic third-quarter growth ""again calls into question the company's ability to hit the 5 percent"" target, he said.While strength in GE's healthcare, aviation and renewable energy businesses helped, ""there is not going be the significant turnaround in the second half that was originally anticipated,"" said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis.Still, cost-cutting in oil and gas and other businesses and a diminishing drag from foreign exchange translation should allow GE to deliver $2 a share in adjusted earnings in 2018, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said on a conference call.

1123,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co (GE.N) can build its 3D printing capability without buying Germany's SLM Solutions (AM3D.DE) and does not need to increase its takeover offer in light of opposition from a major shareholder, GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said on Friday.GE refused on Friday to extend or change its 38-euro-a-share offer for SLM after activist investor Elliott Advisors, which owns 20 percent of SLM, said it would reject GE's offer. The offer expires on Monday.""We have options and alternatives,"" Bornstein told Reuters in an interview. ""We don't have to do SLM. We'd like to. We like the company, we like the technology, we like the people.""He noted that SLM's share price had fallen below GE's 38 euro offer price, which values the company at 683 million euros ($742.49 million). SLM ended trading Friday down 8 percent at 36.33 euros.  Shareholders representing 31.5 percent have already pledged to back GE's bid. The offer requires a minimum 75 percent acceptance to succeed, so Elliott's reported holdings alone would not be enough to block the deal.GE also has alternatives to purchasing Sweden's Arcam AB (ARCM.ST). GE bid has bid 285 crowns per share, or 5.86 billion crowns ($685 million) for Arcam.Both companies make industrial-scale 3D printers used in aerospace, healthcare and other industries and which both count GE as their biggest customer. GE is using 3D printing to make fuel nozzles for new CFM LEAP aircraft engines that power the latest Airbus and Boeing single-aisle airplanes. CFM is a joint venture of GE and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. GE said on Friday that the LEAP engine, now flying on a handful of Airbus A320neo jets, was performing well, with 100 percent reliability in allowing aircraft to depart on time. Bornstein declined to say whether the LEAP engine performance had led to more orders but noted the recent decision by Qatar Airways to sign a letter of intent to buy up to 60 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which might be used to supplant orders for A320neos equipped with Pratt & Whitney engines (UTX.N).

1129,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 26 (Fitch) State Street Corporation's (STT) third quarter 2016  (3Q16) earnings were satisfactory, and adversely impacted by the closing of the  company's acquisition of General Electric's asset management (GEAM) business,  according to Fitch Ratings. STT's overall return on average equity (ROE) was 10.6% in 3Q16, down 12.4% in  the sequential quarter and down from 11.3% in the year-ago quarter. The decline  was due to higher costs associated with the closing of the GEAM transaction  noted above. STT's overall revenue was up 1.8% relative to the sequential quarter and  essentially flat from the year ago quarter. Despite $65 million of incremental  fee revenue from the GEAM transaction, overall fee revenue was up only 1.3%  relative to the sequential quarter, and down 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.  The year-over-year decline was due to lower trading revenue, including lower  foreign exchange (fx) trading revenue relative to the prior year period. Higher  asset management fees largely due to the closing GEAM transaction were offset by  lower fx trading revenue and lower securities finance revenue relative to the  sequential quarter, which was particularly strong for fx trading given the  market volatility surrounding the BREXIT vote. Higher net interest revenue (NIR) offset some of the comparatively lower serving  fee revenue and declines in fx trading and securities finance revenue. NIR was  up 3.1% sequentially and 4.7% year-over-year. This was due to continued deposit  growth as well as a modestly higher net interest margin relative to the year-ago  period. Total deposits grew 2.9% sequentially and 6.7% year-over-year, despite  management's continued efforts at optimizing its overall deposit base in light  of Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (ESLR) requirements. STT's NIM on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 1.14% at 3Q16, unchanged from  the sequential quarter, but up 14 basis points from the year-ago quarter.  Sequentially the higher deposit growth was offset by lower yields on residential  mortgage backed securities given higher levels of mortgage pre-payments during  the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, NIM benefited from the Federal Reserve's  rate hike late last year. Overall expenses on a stated basis were up 6.7% sequentially, and 1.1%  year-over-year. 3Q16 expenses included $57 million of run-rate expenses related  to GEAM and $29 million of one-time acquisition related costs related to this  transaction. Additionally, STT incurred a modest $10 million restructuring  charge in 3Q16 related to its cost savings initiative, Project Beacon. Taken together, on a stated (or GAAP) basis and therefore inclusive of all costs  related to GEAM, STT did not achieve positive operating leverage in 3Q16  relative to the prior or year-ago quarter. However, STT remains focused on  Project Beacon, which over the life of the program is expected to achieve $550  million of expense savings by the end of 2020.  In 2016, Beacon is estimated to generate $165 million in expense savings, and in  2017 it is expected to generate an additional $125 million of savings. This has  the potential to create positive operating leverage in the future to the extent  that it continues to digitize more and more of STT's back and middle office  operations.  Given the muted revenue growth noted previously, this initiative remains a key  lever management can use to at least maintain, if not improve, overall earnings  on a go-forward basis. STT continues to maintain a very liquid balance sheet. The $99.8 billion  investment portfolio represents 38.9% of total assets, with 92.5% of its bonds  rated 'AAA'/'AA' and a modest duration of 2.1 years. In addition to the  investment portfolio, STT has cash on balance sheet which amounted to $82.5  billion at 3Q16, or 32.2% of total assets. Given the large cash component of the balance sheet as well as the modest  duration of the investment portfolio, STT remains very asset sensitive. At the  same time, the company estimates that a 100 basis point upwards shock to  interest rates would cause a mark-to-market loss of $0.8 billion, or .80%  impact, to the investment portfolio. Fitch considers this manageable. STT's estimated fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio on a  standardized basis was 12.0% at 3Q16 up from 11.5% at 2Q16 and on an advanced  approach basis was 11.8% in 3Q16 up from 11.6% in 2Q16. Fitch continues to  expect convergence between the standardized and advanced approach CET1 ratios,  but the lower of the two in any one quarter is STT's binding constraint. More binding than the CET1 ratios noted above, however, is the ESLR for STT and  its peer large processing banks. As of 3Q16, STT's SLR at the holding company  was 6.0%, 100 basis points above the requirement, and at the main bank  subsidiary was 6.3%, 30 basis points above the requirement.

""We are delighted to achieve the strategic cornerstone in our additive strategy by announcing today our acquisition of Concept Laser.""Arcam, Concept Laser and SLM, are three of the world's top makers of machines for metals-based 3D printing. GE and its competitors have begun to invest seriously in 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, which produces parts with less work than traditional production methods, generates less scrap material and expands design possibilities. Use of the technology has become more widespread for industrial mass production in recent years, with uses ranging from the production of dental crowns and  medical implants to aircraft parts.GE raised its recommended bid for Arcam to 300 crowns per share from 285 crowns, valuing the Swedish 3D printer maker at 6.2 billion crowns ($696 million). It also lowered the minimum acceptance threshold for the offer to 75 percent. GE, one of Arcam's largest customers, said it controlled 46 percent of Arcam shares. Elliott owns around 10 percent of Arcam according to a disclosure notice issued this month.The U.S. industrial conglomerate is buying a 75 percent stake in Concept Laser for 549 million euro ($599 million) in a deal that will allow GE to take full ownership in a number of years.Concept Laser's customer base is focused on the aerospace, medical and dental industries, while Arcam's primary focus is on aerospace and medical implants.

""We are delighted to achieve the strategic cornerstone in our additive strategy by announcing today our acquisition of Concept Laser.""Arcam, Concept Laser and SLM, are three of the world's top makers of machines for metals-based 3D printing. GE and its competitors have begun to invest seriously in 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, which produces parts with less work than traditional production methods, generates less scrap material and expands design possibilities. Use of the technology has become more widespread for industrial mass production in recent years, with uses ranging from the production of dental crowns and  medical implants to aircraft parts.GE raised its recommended bid for Arcam to 300 crowns per share from 285 crowns, valuing the Swedish 3D printer maker at 6.2 billion crowns ($696 million). It also lowered the minimum acceptance threshold for the offer to 75 percent. GE, one of Arcam's largest customers, said it controlled 46 percent of Arcam shares.

1141,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Industrial giant General Electric Co and oilfield services company Baker Hughes, both beset by difficulties during oil's two-year price rout, may have a clear path out of the doldrums: join forces.GE (GE.N) said Thursday it was in discussions with Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) but not to acquire the company outright. Baker Hughes said Friday talks were ongoing. Both companies declined to comment on the talks beyond official statements. GE's oil and gas division has fought to get the scale the conglomerate enjoys in other industries. Despite efforts to grow through a series of acquisitions, the division has faced weaker revenues during oil's downturn than other units of GE. Organic growth in oil and gas has lagged other sectors. Baker Hughes had its own growth difficulties, spending a year and a half stuck in limbo amid a $28-billion merger with Halliburton that was ultimately scrapped after opposition from antitrust regulators. Following the termination of the Halliburton merger, Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead has said the company is well positioned to focus on developing products that lower costs and maximize production for operators in the oil and gas industry. Baker Hughes shares gained 8.4 percent Friday to $59.12, valuing the company at about $25 billion.  With oil prices rebounding to $50 a barrel, M&A activity could tick up as investors see the two-year rout in crude ending. A partnership with Baker Hughes could allow GE's oil and gas division to transform itself into a larger player in the sector to better compete with oilfield services leader Schlumberger Inc (SLB.N), and could give Baker Hughes a chance to redefine itself following the failed merger.  “If there’s a time to double down on the sector, now is the time given the prices we’ve seen,” said Jonathan Garrett, principal analyst for U.S. upstream research at Wood Mackenzie. The partnership would be formed at a time GE has been shrinking its capital markets division and is returning to its industrial roots, he said.For GE, which strives to be in the top of each industrial sector, oil and gas has been a harder area to develop, said Ed Hirs, energy fellow at the University of Houston. Baker Hughes offers good capitalization and scale for the smaller GE unit. ""This is a pretty good, intelligent bet on the future,"" he said, noting that it comes as the oil market's downturn appears to be ending. The downturn led oilfield service companies to cut their prices, curtailing profits. Baker Hughes is ""a much-emasculated industrial enterprise relative to its pre-HAL dalliance days,"" Bill Hebert, senior research analyst at Piper, Jaffray & Co, said in a note to clients. Both companies have faced pressure from activist investors. ValueAct Capital is the largest shareholder of Baker Hughes, investing after the merger with Halliburton was announced and betting upon its success.

1146,"   By Rob Cox | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric is taking its motto ""imagination at work"" to heart. The deal it has just cooked up with Baker Hughes, an oilfield-services rival, sets an intriguing precedent for the $267 billion industrial behemoth. The finances of the arrangement may stack up for shareholders, too. But what could set this transaction apart is GE's implicit recognition that the sum of its many parts may be more valuable than the whole.In merging its oil and gas unit with $27 billion Baker Hughes, GE accomplishes a few worthy objectives. It expands its footprint in an industry still coping with the ructions of the oil-patch bust and the prospect of relatively low energy prices for years to come. The new Baker Hughes should rank as one of the top three providers of services to wildcatters. By crunching the division led by Lorenzo Simonelli into Baker Hughes, GE ring-fences its exposure to this volatile business while nabbing a 62.5 percent interest in the public rump. By GE's own arithmetic, the deal's $1.6 billion of promised synergies - a quarter of them from enhanced revenue - are worth $14 billion today. GE's share would come to $8.75 billion, covering the $7.4 billion it's paying as a dividend to Baker Hughes owners. Maintaining its oil and gas business as a publicly traded company also provides an acquisition currency to pursue other transactions in the sector, though executives said reaping synergies remains the first order of business. GE also has the option of spinning out the entire business to its own shareholders. The deal also creates a transparent mechanism for valuing a key part of GE's portfolio. That represents a break from the existing GE order. The conglomerate run by Jeff Immelt was swift to enumerate the benefits that will accrue from the new Baker Hughes' association with the parent - including what it calls the GE Store and its industrial internet platform, Predix. If the oil and gas business can be more efficiently separated, though, why not other businesses like power, renewable energy, aviation, healthcare or transportation?There may be specific reasons why Baker Hughes makes more sense as a controlled subsidiary, such as tax issues or the volatility of the business. But it creates a precedent that imaginative shareholders will industriously apply to other parts of the GE empire.",2016-10-31,GE,"Mon Oct 31, 2016 | 5:20pm EDT",GE suggests bold new thinking with Baker Hughes,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-baker-hughes-m-a-breakingviews-idUSKBN12V1WE?type=companyNews
1147,"   By Rob Cox | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric says it's not planning to acquire Baker Hughes, contrary to news reports. But shareholders shouldn't be shocked by the idea that the industrial conglomerate might take a look at the $23 billion oil-services firm. Since the panic of 2008 sparked an existential crisis at GE, the $258 billion GE has been on a massive diet plan. Today the company led by Jeff Immelt is fit for an offensive. Since the crisis, GE has offloaded some $200 billion of financial assets, in the process shedding its designation as a systemically important financial institution, subject to intense regulatory and capital requirements. It also sold its appliances unit to Haier of China and NBC Universal to Comcast. In eyeing up Baker Hughes, GE says it's only considering possible partnerships, but it isn't a crazy acquisition target. The oilfield specialist agreed to sell itself to rival Halliburton before U.S. antitrust watchdogs scuttled the combination earlier this year. Though that left Baker Hughes in the lurch – and worth less than the $35 billion Halliburton had offered – it pocketed a huge $3.5 billion break fee. And since then, energy prices have mostly stabilized.  Investing in the oil and gas industry now would make sense if GE really is positive on the long-term outlook for the sector, as it indicated in its third-quarter earnings discussion last week. What it called a ""challenging environment"" in the short term is equally an opportunity to get in early before an upturn. GE's energy unit, led by Lorenzo Simonelli, accounted for just $3 billion of revenue in the quarter, less than half the top line of GE's power division. It's the power arm, under Steve Bolze, that is showing GE's board and its investors that the company is ready to return more fully to the M&A game with its handling of last year's $13 billion acquisition of Alstom. GE has more than doubled its expectations for cost savings to $3 billion a year.No wonder other divisions might see the chance to get involved. GE is bidding for Swedish 3D-printer maker Arcam and snapped up Germany's Concept Laser. These are relatively small deals, but it’s only a matter of time before GE's oil and gas business joins the action in a bigger way.",2016-10-31,GE,"Mon Oct 31, 2016 | 5:13pm EDT",GE joining M&A frenzy would be no shocker,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-baker-hughes-m-a-ge-breakingviews-idUSKBN12V2F5?type=companyNews

GE will argue to antitrust enforcers - who stopped the deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes just months ago - that their deal is complementary, and that they are committed to any remedy needed to win approval, the source said.A small part of GE's business is selling equipment to Baker Hughes' competitors and it will continue those sales, the source said.All of GE's oil and gas business, which generated roughly 14 percent of GE's revenue last year, will go into the new company, leaving no energy units behind in its former parent, Simonelli said. The ""best performers"" from the existing GE and Baker Hughes will form new management teams, he added, declining to comment on potential layoffs. Analysts said there was little overlap between the businesses that would worry regulators.""I don't see any overlaps, significant overlaps,"" said Tom Seng, a veteran of the energy business who teaches at the University of Tulsa. OIL NEAR $50 The deal comes at a time when North American oil and gas producers are putting rigs back to work after a near-freeze in activity caused by a slump in oil prices that began mid-2014.But the deal is predicated on a forecast for oil prices to rise to $60 per barrel by 2019, GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told investors Monday. ""This is a very compelling time for the deal,"" Immelt said, noting he expects $1.6 billion in annual cost savings by 2020.Global oil prices LCOc1 have risen by a third this year to near $50 a barrel.Craighead, who will become vice chairman of the new company, echoed Immelt's confidence.""We see growth under any market environment,"" Craighead said in an interview. ""Our customers continue to spend massive amounts of money.""The industrywide push for pumping more oil and natural gas at cheaper costs should only accelerate that trend, he said. Activist investor Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management owns about 0.8 percent of GE as of June 30, told CNBC the new company would be able to go ""nose-to-nose"" with Schlumberger.Shareholders of Baker Hughes, which had a market value of about $26 billion as of Friday, will get a special one-time cash dividend from GE of $17.50 per share - or $7.4 billion - after the deal closes. The new company, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will have dual headquarters in Houston and London. Baker Hughes shares rose as much as 5 percent in morning trade before reversing course to trade down nearly 8 percent at $54.60. Shares of GE slipped 0.1 percent to $29.18.Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley are advising GE, while Shearman & Sterling is its legal adviser.

1150,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 31 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AA-/F1+' Long- and  Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for General Electric Company (GE) and  GE Capital Global Holdings, LLC (GE Capital) following the announcement earlier  today of its agreement to combine GE Oil & Gas (O&G) with Baker Hughes,  Incorporated (BHI). The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A full rating list appears at the end of this release.  The combination of (O&G) with BHI is within Fitch's expectation that GE could  deploy substantial capital for acquisitions over the next several years, much of  which could be funded with debt. The transaction will create the second largest  global oilfield services business. GE will have a 62% interest in the combined  business ('New' Baker Hughes), which is being structured as a tax-advantaged  partnership between GE and the existing shareholders of BHI.  The combined business should compete more effectively and offer a path toward  improved efficiency for customers. GE will pay $7.4 billion of cash to BHI which  will be used to fund a dividend to BHI shareholders. The transaction is expected  to close in mid-2017. Fitch estimates the enterprise value of the combined  business at approximately $50 billion. BHI is more cyclical than GE O&G, but both parts of the combined business will  benefit from increased diversification and a larger customer base. BHI will have  access to GE's research and development resources (GE Store) and GE's digital  technology which could improve BHI's long-term competitiveness. Fitch expects  global exploration and production spending and activity to increase moderately  in 2017 with a more robust growth profile in 2018. These considerations should  support 'New' Baker Hughes' operational and financial results, particularly  given BHI's strong drilling & completions businesses with a focus on the North  American (N.A.) market. Annual synergies by 2020 are projected by GE to reach  $1.2 billion, primarily from costs.  Fitch expects GE's leverage metrics will rise modestly when considering the BHI  transaction and possible future acquisitions. GE's capacity for incremental debt  is supported by the recent reduction in absolute risk related to the GE Capital  exit, expected growth in earnings and cash flow over the next several years, and  additional earnings and cash flow from acquisitions. The impact of the  transaction on GE's financial results and credit metrics should not exceed  Fitch's negative rating sensitivities but does leave the company with less  financial flexibility. However, Fitch expects credit metrics such as leverage  will remain appropriate for GE's overall enterprise risk level, which Fitch  considers to be relatively low as a result of GE's diversification, strong  market positions, strong services earnings, scale, and technology portfolio.  Risks related to the agreement with BHI include integration risk, the  realization of anticipated synergies, higher debt at GE's industrial business  following completion of the transaction, the negative cash impact from any  breakup fee if the transaction is not completed, and the risk that the oil and  gas industry remains weak for an extended period. KEY RATING DRIVERS - GE Industrial Fitch's ratings and financial measures for GE's industrial businesses (GE  Industrial) consider GE Capital on an equity basis, including approximately $60  billion of GE Capital debt as of Sept. 30, 2016 maintained as intercompany debt  with GE. The ratings for GE Capital incorporate support from GE. The ratings for GE incorporate the company's global presence, broad product  portfolio, large market shares in its core infrastructure and healthcare  markets, and strong technological capabilities. Substantial services revenue  generates more than 80% of GE's industrial operating profit and dampens the  impact on financial results from volatility in the company's energy and capital  goods end-markets. Some credit protection measures are weak for the rating, but  Fitch believes GE's strong operating profile and financial resources give it a  low overall enterprise risk.  GE's large scale and market position give it a broad perspective on industry  developments, the capacity to invest in new technologies, and adjust market  trends. When the divestiture of GE Capital's non-core businesses is completed  GE's industrial businesses will represent at least 90% of consolidated earnings  compared with less than 50% several years ago when GE Capital was larger.  Fitch expects GE will maintain a strong balance sheet and that the company's  priority for cash deployment will be acquisitions. A smaller GE Capital provides  GE with incremental financial flexibility to leverage its balance sheet over the  next several years, but Fitch expects GE will maintain a disciplined financial  strategy that supports its ability to invest in its long-cycle power and  aviation businesses, focus on markets with high technology content, and maintain  strong competitive positions.  A key rating consideration is the 'GE Capital Exit Plan,' launched in 2015 and  expected to be largely completed by the end of 2016. After its non-core  businesses have been divested, GE Capital will be concentrated in its vertical  businesses that serve the aviation, energy and industrial (working capital  solutions, healthcare equipment finance, and trade payables services) markets.  GE Capital's smaller size reduces the company's exposure to funding, credit  quality, regulatory and other risks inherent to finance companies.  Rating concerns include potential support required for GE Capital albeit much  lower than in the past, large net pension liabilities, the risk that future  larger-than-expected share repurchases or acquisitions could weaken GE's  currently strong financial profile, and cyclicality in GE's infrastructure  markets. However, Fitch believes future acquisitions will be targeted toward  adjacent industrial markets, of which the pending 'New' Baker Hughes partnership  is an example, and that GE will be disciplined in its cash deployment for  acquisitions or share repurchases.  Other concerns include the typical large intra-quarter use of commercial paper  and the high dividend payout which affects free cash flow as defined by Fitch.  Rating concerns are offset by GE's diversification, significant financial  resources, and steady operating performance through business cycles compared to  its industrial peers.  GE's financial leverage included total adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 2.7x at Sept.  30, 2016 on a preliminary basis as estimated by Fitch, defined to include  customer receivables factored through GE Capital that totaled $13 billion at  Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch's calculation of leverage would be lower when including  earnings from GE Capital which Fitch excludes from EBITDA in order to focus on  industrial credit metrics.  Leverage would be higher if GE's intra-quarter use of commercial paper were  included. The company repays most commercial paper at quarter-ends as part of  its working capital management. A portion of the repayment is funded temporarily  from cash located outside the U.S., which Fitch does not typically include as  available cash due to tax liabilities that could be incurred if the cash is  repatriated. GE's industrial business maintained total cash balances of $10.4  billion at the end of 2015 compared to $500 million of commercial paper  balances. GE typically generates strong cash flow from operations. Fitch estimates  operating cash flow in 2016 could be approximately $12 billion-$13 billion,  excluding dividends from GE Capital, compared to more than $10 billion in 2015  which included nearly $2 billion usage for working capital. Fitch estimates FCF  after dividends in 2016 could be slightly positive. Fitch's calculation of FCF  is after pension contributions and excludes dividends from GE Capital. It also  excludes changes in receivables sold to GE Capital. Corporate dividends to  shareholders represent a large use of operating cash flow and contribute to GE's  low FCF compared to some other large industrial companies.  Fitch also considers GE's cash flow metrics adjusted to include dividends from  GE Capital as GE Capital is a significant contributor to GE's consolidated  financial results and valuation. Fitch estimates these dividends, excluding  one-time large dividends in the near term, could be approximately $1 billion  annually after the GE Capital exit is completed.  Under Fitch's criteria for rating non-financial corporates, Fitch calculates an  appropriate debt/equity ratio of 6x at Financial Services based on solid asset  quality, sufficient liquidity and strong funding profile. As actual debt/equity  as measured by Fitch was below this level, there would be no need to make an  equity injection to maintain leverage at or below the 6x level.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - GE Capital  The IDRs for GE Capital and its rated subsidiaries are linked to and equalized  with those of GE, reflecting Fitch's view that GE Capital is a core subsidiary  of GE, as defined under Fitch's 'Global Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating  Criteria.'  This view is supported by the fact that GE Capital remains a key and integral  part of certain of GE's industry verticals, shares its branding with the broader  GE organization and benefits from explicit guarantees of its existing financial  obligations. GE has made strong legal commitments to support GE Capital under  the second global supplemental bond indenture dated Dec. 2, 2015, under which GE  Capital's existing obligations are fully, irrevocably and unconditionally  guaranteed by GE. In addition, GE Capital operates in the same jurisdictions as  GE and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE. Lastly, the reduced size of GE  Capital's assets to $202.7 billion as of Sept. 30, 2016 from $500.6 billion as  of Dec. 31, 2014, increases GE's financial ability to support GE Capital. Credit strengths of GE Capital on a standalone basis include its strong  franchise and global brand, market leading position in aircraft lending and  leasing, established positions in energy finance and industrial finance, strong  and experienced management team, adequate liquidity, reduced commercial paper  utilization, and high unsecured debt levels.  Credit constraints on a standalone basis include reliance on wholesale funding  sources, cyclicality and residual value risk inherent in certain of GE Capital's  activities, particularly aircraft leasing, and less current and expected  regulatory oversight of GE Capital. Fitch views GE Capital's execution on the exit plan as strong, with signed  agreements with buyers for $193 billion of ending net investment (ENI) excluding  liquidity, of which $170 billion was completed as of Sept. 30, 2016. In 2015, GE  Capital also finalized the split-off of Synchrony Financial, merged legacy  General Electric Capital Corporation into GE, and exchanged $36 billion of  legacy General Electric Capital Corporation debt for new GE guaranteed notes,  each of which skewed interim financial performance but support an improved risk  profile.  GE Capital has strong underwriting standards and risk controls. Since 2012, GE  Capital has enhanced its economic capital (E-Cap) framework based on regulatory  guidance and industry practice. The E-Cap model utilizes various tools that are  driven by simulations and value-at-risk across various asset classes. These  include aircraft operating leases and aircraft loans in GE Capital Aviation  Services (GECAS), debt, tax equity and equity investments in structured and  project finance in GE Energy Financial Services (EFS), and working capital  solutions and trade payables services in GE Industrial Finance (IF). The company  also performs ongoing stress testing. GE Capital's overall control framework  consists of limits, product standards, monitoring and reporting to governing  bodies including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and GE Board of  Directors, which ensures compliance and regular monitoring. Asset quality metrics have been largely stable despite the shift in portfolio  mix as a result of the exit plan that has weakened overall lessee and borrower  credit quality. GE Capital's main industry verticals (GECAS, EFS, IF and other)  funded $2.8 billion of investments and enabled $4.2 billion of GE Industrial  orders in 3Q'16, while incurring lower impairments in EFS when compared to  3Q'15.  GE Capital's leverage ratio, defined by Fitch as gross debt to tangible equity  (total shareowners' equity including preferred equity less goodwill and other  intangible assets) was 5.0x as of Sept. 30, 2016, compared to 5.2x as of Dec.  31, 2015 and 4.1x as of Dec. 31, 2014. Company-reported gross debt to equity was  4.6x as of Sept. 30, 2016, compared to 4.6x as of Dec. 31, 2015 and 4.0x as of  Dec. 31, 2014. Fitch expects this leverage ratio to remain within the 4.5x-5.0x  range over the next two years, now that the D-SIFI designation has been  rescinded. Fitch tends to focus on gross debt leverage ratios; however,  company-reported net debt to equity was 2.6x as of Sept. 30, 2016, compared to  2.6x as of Dec. 31, 2015 and 3.1x as of Dec. 31, 2014. While current and future leverage ratios are viewed as higher than Fitch's  quantitative benchmarks for a standalone finance and leasing company rated  'AA-', the GE guarantee on GE Capital's debt and GE's ability to provide support  to GE Capital offset the standalone leverage ratio. GE Capital's earnings and profitability ratios in 2015 and the year-to-date  period ended Sept. 30, 2016 were negatively impacted by one-time financial  charges associated with the GE Capital exit plan, as well as losses from  discontinued operations. Net loss from GE Capital attributable to GE common  shareowners was $2.4 billion for the year-to-date period ended Sept. 30, 2016  and a $15.8 billion net loss in 2015, compared to net earnings of $6.9 billion  in 2014. Fitch expects financial charges and earnings from discontinued  operations to become less meaningful as the company completes the GE Capital  Exit Plan throughout the remainder of 2016. On a core basis, Fitch views GE Capital's earnings as strong, supported in part  by the benefit of lower funding costs relative to most standalone finance and  leasing companies. Return on average assets (ROAA), defined as GE Capital's net  earnings attributable to GE common shareholders excluding after-tax charges  related to the GE Capital Exit Plan divided by average assets, was 1.5% in 2015,  and although negative the first half of 2016 due to the timing of charges prior  to dispositions, turned slightly positive in 3Q'16. ROAA was 1.4% in 2014.  The 'AA-' IDR for GE Capital EFS Financing Inc. reflects the credit support  provided by GE Capital, and thus GE, to GE Capital EFS Financing Inc. The 'F1+'  rating for GE Capital Treasury Services LLC reflects that this entity is an  issuer of commercial paper, guaranteed by GE, which is used to fund GE Capital's  short-Term working capital needs.  The 'AA-' senior secured debt rating of GE Capital and the 'AA-' senior  unsecured debt ratings of GE Capital International Funding Co. and other GE  Capital subsidiaries are equalized with the IDRs of these entities and reflect  Fitch's expectation of average recoveries. The 'A+' subordinated debt rating and  the 'A' preferred stock rating reflect incremental risk relative to the IDR;  these notches are a function of increased loss severity due to subordination and  heightened risk of non-performance relative to senior obligations. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for GE Industrial include: --Organic revenue grows by low single digits in 2016 as higher sales in the  Power, Aviation and Renewables segments more than offsets lower sales of  locomotives and a large decline in the oil and gas segment. --The combination of GE Oil & Gas with BHI is completed in mid- 2017; --EBITDA margins in 2016 decline due to the negative impact of the Alstom  acquisition. Margins improve after 2016 due to benefits from the integration of  Alstom, lower restructuring costs, and ongoing cost improvements. --The GE Capital Exit Plan is completed as planned.  --Large dividends from GE Capital are used to fund share repurchases in the next  two to three years as part of the GE Capital Exit Plan. --Alstom integration contributes to cost synergies, including $1 billion in  2016.  --GE generates positive FCF. --Cash deployment prioritizes acquisitions over share repurchases. Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for GE Capital include: --GE Capital's outstanding debt will remain explicitly guaranteed by GE. --GE Capital will pay $20 billion in dividends to GE in 2016. --GE Capital's gross debt to tangible equity calculated by Fitch and GE  Capital's company-reported gross debt to equity will remain around 4.5x-5.0x  over the Outlook horizon. --The company will complete the exit plan by year-end 2016 with ENI remaining  around $80 billion. RATING SENSITIVITIES GE Industrial  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --GE directs its operating strategy away from its industrial businesses; --Market shares decline materially; --Services generate a consistently lower proportion of revenue and profit; --EBITDA margins fail to recover following an expected decline in 2016; --GE Capital's asset quality and liquidity are weaker than expected, resulting  in lower dividends to, or requiring support from, GE.  --GE's financial strategy becomes more aggressive than expected, including  debt-funded acquisitions or share repurchases that lead to consistently higher  leverage, including total adjusted debt/EBITDAR sustained above 2.0x (above 3.0x  including Fitch's adjustments for factored receivables), or funds from  operations (FFO) adjusted leverage sustained above 2.2x (above 3.2x including  Fitch's adjustments for factored receivables). Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --Segment margins increase toward 20% on a sustained basis.  --FCF and liquidity are sufficient to reduce GE's average commercial paper usage  well below $10 billion. GE Capital As long as GE Capital's outstanding debt remains explicitly guaranteed by GE,  Fitch cannot envision a scenario where GE Capital's ratings would not be  equalized with those of GE. If in the future, GE Capital or its subsidiaries  were to issue (or signal their intention to issue) debt that did not benefit  from an explicit guarantee from GE, Fitch would consider the degree of strategic  importance of GE Capital to GE and the willingness and ability of GE to extend  financial support to GE Capital in determining the ratings of GE Capital and its  debt obligations. Since the ratings of GE Capital and its rated subsidiaries are  linked to those of GE, the rating sensitivities for GE Capital are the same as  those listed for GE Industrial. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE GE Industrial's liquidity at Sept. 30, 2016 included cash of $11 billion. Most  of GE's cash is held outside the U.S. and is subject to income taxes if  repatriated. Average cash and debt balances are higher than reported at  quarter-ends due to GE's use of commercial paper. Commercial paper typically is  highest during intra-quarter periods and is substantially repaid before  quarter-ends using overseas cash. Liquidity also included $20 billion of credit  lines exceeding one year. GE Capital has indirect access to the lines through  intercompany loans from GE Industrial.  At June 30, 2016, GE Industrial's liquidity was offset by nearly $8.3 billion of  debt due within one year, excluding amounts assumed from GE Capital. GE's  industrial debt totaled $24.3 billion and included approximately $15 billion of  notes due between 2017 and 2044 and a $ 5 billion short-term note payable to GE  Capital. GE Capital has strong liquidity and financial flexibility. This entity had $57  billion of liquidity as of Sept. 30, 2016, comfortably exceeding short-Term  borrowings of $24 billion. Additionally, approximately 96.7% of GE Capital's  debt funding was unsecured as of Sept. 30, 2016. GE Capital completed  approximately $2 billion of asset-liability management actions in 3Q'16  including calling certain hybrid securities and completing make whole calls.  Commercial paper outstanding as of Sept. 30, 2016 totaled $5 billion or 3.8% of  total funding. Approximately $162 billion of GE's consolidated debt, including approximately  $13 billion of GE receivables factored through GE Capital, is covered by the  ratings.

1155,"  (Repeats Oct. 31 story for wider distribution.)By Jessica Resnick-AultNEW YORK Oct 31 General Electric Co's  deal with Baker Hughes Inc to create the world's No. 2 oilfield services business is the clearest signal yet that consolidation is picking up in the energy sector as companies face long-term lower oil prices.GE said on Monday it would merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, creating a company with $32 billion in annual revenue and leapfrogging Halliburton Co to be second globally behind Schlumberger AG.""The transaction assumes a slow recovery (in oil prices), really $45 to $60 per barrel through 2019, and this seems reasonable,"" GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said on a call with investors and analysts on Monday.Since crude oil prices plunged in 2014 in the face of oversupply, deals have been fitful, with large players such as Schlumberger and Technip buying smaller rivals.But size of the GE-Baker Hughes tie-up and its timing amid a recent spate of deals have led advisers and industry analysts to think companies have readjusted to lower oil prices in their strategies and the tide is turning. U.S. producers have also found ways to sustain output even at lower prices.""Industry protagonists are much more cautious about the slope and length of runway for the industry recovery going forward, so you've seen a series of combinations which have sought scale,"" said William Herbert, head of global energy research at Simmons & Co International, a unit of Piper Jaffray. Halliburton, which tried to buy Baker Hughes over a year ago but was blocked by regulators, has embarked on steep cost cuts as it expects price pressures to continue. It said earlier this month that oil prices would have to stabilize above current levels of $50 per barrel for producers to make any meaningful boost to oilfield plans.BACKLOG OF POSSIBLE DEALS Halliburton is unlikely to try another big acquisition despite being relegated to third place by Monday's deal, people familiar with the company said. It lacks vertical integration in subsea drilling but otherwise has the global scale needed to compete, industry analysts said. Doug Getten, a Houston-based partner in the corporate practice at law firm Paul Hastings, said the recent flurry of deals shows parties are able to reach consensus on the outlook for prices.""Part of this consensus on pricing is not everybody sitting around the table smoking cigars saying oil is going back to $80, $90, $100,"" said Getten.Companies striking deals recently have included pipeline operators American Midstream Partners, which announced plans to buy JP Energy Partners last week, and refiners like HollyFrontier Corp, which agreed to buy a Suncor Inc division on Monday. In the exploration and production segment, buyers have been targeting companies with premium acreage in the Delaware and Permian basins in Texas. ""There is a material backlog of transactions that people have been looking to do on the M&A side, and it seems like we are primed to see a return to normalcy in the energy M&A transactions,"" Getten said.In addition, the solidification of the three global giants in oilfield services poses a question of how smaller companies will compete.Weatherford, for example, long a speculated takeover  target, will be a distant No. 4 to Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger.The drag on deal-making could come from the banks that help finance and advise on transactions, however.""The time is right for firms to consider mergers and acquisitions. The banks may be more conservative until there's more long-term visibility of where the commodity prices go,"" said David Otte, a special adviser to Spears and Associates, a Dallas-based consultancy.(Additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder in Houston and Lauren Hirsch in New York; Editing by Jo Winterbottom and Matthew Lewis)",2016-11-01,GE,"Tue Nov 1, 2016 | 7:05am EDT",RPT-Oilfield services shakeup in cards after GE-Baker Hughes deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/baker-hughes-ma-ge-deals-idUSL1N1D121M?type=companyNews

""People feel that there's not as much value in these stocks as there might have been.""The deals also lack a common or new motivation that would inspire investors to gobble up stocks in anticipation of more mergers, bankers said.While there is some ambition to get transactions done before the U.S. Federal Reserve makes financing more expensive by raising interest rates, people involved with M&A say that was not a primary factor in October. The presidential election, just over a week away, also did not appear to be a driver.But the autumn merger boom does reflect a less alluring reality: the summer was uncertain as CEOs put off deals they might have done sooner.Third-quarter M&A in the U.S. accounted for just 24 percent of total year-to-date M&A, the lowest percentage since 2007.

1158,"   By David Shepardson and Alwyn Scott | WASHINGTON/SEATTLE  WASHINGTON/SEATTLE A fire on an American Airlines passenger plane as it was taking off from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport last week was sparked when the right engine broke apart, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Friday.    The investigative update shed new light on a rare ""uncontained"" engine failure, in which pieces escaped the engine housing, that has been the talk of aviation circles since the incident on Oct. 28.Pilots applied brakes to the Boeing 767-300 jetliner bound for Miami and aborted the takeoff of Flight 383. The engine failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire under the right wing. The incident led to emergency evacuation of 161 passengers and nine crew, but no serious injuries.The plane, built in 2003, experienced the failure about 6,550 feet (2,000 meters) after beginning its take-off and came to a full stop at 9,225 feet (2,800 meters), about 27 seconds after the engine failure, the NTSB said in an interim report.Investigators looking for what caused the General Electric CF6-80 engine to fail are focusing on a high pressure turbine disk that broke apart. One piece hit a UPS warehouse facility, about 3,000 feet (900 meters) from the runway, after slicing through a portion of the wing and traveling over the fuselage. The majority of the disk was recovered, and during laboratory inspection showed features consistent with fatigue cracking, the NTSB said. The disk had gone through 10,984 cycles, or take-offs and landings, and had a life limit of 15,000 cycles. Review of the engine maintenance and manufacturing records and processes was continuing, the NTSB said, adding that additional examinations of the disk would focus on the cracking.GE said the engine was manufactured in 1998. The failed disk was made of Inconel 718, an alloy used in aviation for decades, GE said. The CF6 engine is used on current Boeing 767 freighters and the KC-46 tanker used to refuel military planes in flight. Uncontained aircraft engine failures are rare. GE said it had not suffered an engine failure caused by a problem with the Inconel 718 disk in more than 30 years. The CF6-80C2 has been in service for more than 30 years and has an in-flight shutdown rate of 0.004 percent over 400 million hours of flight.The rotating disk ""operates in one of the most harsh environments of a jet engine, especially at aircraft take-off,"" GE said in a statement.  American Airlines declined to comment.The fire prompted 130 delays of departing flights and 170 inbound flights within two hours, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com.

1159,"   By Karen Schwartz | NEW YORK, November 4  NEW YORK, November 4U.S. investment grade volume could get a healthy boost before year-end with nearly US$60bn of acquisition loans announced in the last two weeks in advance of the looming Nov 8 U.S. presidential election, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.Telecom company AT&T's US$40bn loan backing its US$85.4bn acquisition of media company Time Warner has been joined by a US$13.6bn loan that finances smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm's US$38bn acquisition of NXP Semiconductor, and aircraft electronics supplier Rockwell Collins is borrowing US$6bn to finance its purchase of B/E Aerospace.This US$59.6bn flurry of M&A lending is expected to lift US investment-grade M&A loan volume, which at US$100bn was 26% lower at the end of the third quarter than the same period last year and is far off the full-year total of US$181bn in 2015, the data shows.The acquisitions were announced in late October during a surge of optimism about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's prospects. Wall Street is favoring a Democratic victory as Clinton's views towards the financial industry have been perceived as more consistent to date.""The markets have been favoring a victory for Hillary Clinton because there's less uncertainty if she wins. With Hillary you could say it's just more of the same, and nothing's really going to change,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, an independent equity and fund research firm.The race narrowed after the FBI said that it was looking further into Clinton's emails on October 28, but deals are still being announced despite considerable uncertainty about how markets will react if Republican candidate Donald Trump emerges victorious as companies start to look past the election. Power producer NextEra Energy Inc said on Monday it would buy the remaining stake in Oncor Electric Delivery Co for about US$2.4bn in cash, and General Electric Co said it would merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc.U.S. oil refiner HollyFrontier Corp also announced on Monday that it would buy Suncor Energy Inc's Petro-Canada lubricants unit for C$1.13bn (US$844m), while chipmaker Broadcom said on Wednesday it would buy network gear maker Brocade Communications Systems for US$5.5bn.""The devil you know is better than the devil you don't in terms of the interest rate environment, the deal-making environment, the deal you've negotiated versus putting it off and having some unpredicted catalyst such as the outcome of election adversely impact all of those environments and potentially slow down your ability in another month or two from consummating what would otherwise be a good deal,"" said Shannon Zollo, a corporate partner with Morse, Barnes-Brown & Pendleton, P.C. Some loan bankers and analysts are discounting the U.S. election result as a factor governing the flow of new deals to the market, saying that the investment-grade loan market and capital markets are open and eager for M&A loans.""There are a host of other factors that companies consider when they are negotiating a merger and there will continue to be political and regulatory risks for the approval of some of the deals regardless of the outcome of the election,"" said Brian Gardner, a managing director at KBW, a boutique investment bank.MORE M&A  Acquisition loans have been in short supply this year as many companies opted to tap the bond market directly, which helped depress M&A loan volume. This situation reversed in late October with AT&T's announcement of a jumbo US$40bn loan, which consists of a US$30bn bridge loan and US$10bn of term loans.Rockwell Collins followed AT&T on October 23 with US$4.5bn of bridge loans and a US$1.5bn term loan and Qualcomm's purchase of Netherlands-based semiconductor company NXP Semiconductors on October 27 is backed by a US$9.6bn bridge loan and a US$4bn, three-year term loan that is currently in syndication.This total of US$44.1bn of bridge loans and US$15.5bn of term loans is likely to be boosted further by the string of deals announced this week. NextEra Energy Inc and HollyFrontier Corp have already said that their acquisitions will include debt.With earnings season well underway and companies emerging from blackout periods, more announcements could be coming in the next few weeks to beat the year-end deadline. Current M&A deals are expected to spark new tie-ups among industry peers eager not to be left behind, bankers said.""M&A seems to beget M&A,"" a second banker said.

The POA gathers data from various pieces of equipment on offshore platforms and processes it through GE's proprietary Predix software to inform BP engineers when a part may be near breaking down.Terms of the BP-GE deal were not disclosed.

1176,"   By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE  SEATTLE General Electric Co (GE.N) has signed up U.S. energy utility Exelon Corp (EXC.N) to use its full software set to analyze and manage power plants in 48 states, the largest GE deployment in the power sector so far, the companies said on Tuesday.The Exelon deal, aimed at wringing greater efficiency from the business of generating electricity, marks another advance in GE's effort to lift annual digital technology revenue to $14 billion in 2020 from $5 billion in 2015, across its many industrial products. It also is one of the three largest sales of GE's Predix industrial operating system so far. Exelon has nuclear, wind and fossil fuel-powered plants. The companies did not disclose the value of Exelon's five-year contract with GE. In initial uses, GE's technology has increased power plant efficiency by 3 percent and reliability by 5 percent, while cutting operating and maintenance costs 25 percent, said Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE Power. Exelon's deployment is nearly six times larger than the previous largest GE deal, signed last month with the New York Power Authority and covering 16 power plants in New York state that generate about 5,600 megawatts.Chicago-based Exelon will use GE's Predix software and applications across its 91 power plants, which produce 32,700 megawatts and supply more than 10 million customers, the companies said. Exelon will also use GE software that analyzes the company's business performance and profitability, something NYPA didn't choose, GE said. GE and Exelon also agreed to work together on new Predix-based software applications. GE's power business accounts for 40 percent of GE's digital revenue, said Bolze. About $400 million a year is produced by GE Power's software business, and that revenue is growing by 50 percent a year, he added. Exelon's agreement follows four pilot projects over the past year and is GE's ""first and largest IoT (internet of things) enterprise-wide deployment of Predix full-suite offerings anywhere in the world,"" Bolze said.

1185,"   By Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman   (Corrects Nov. 29 story to clarify that Shenmao Technology did not say it bought tin from the Wa mine)By Yimou Lee and Joel SchectmanYANGON/WASHINGTON From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.More than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.The mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.This potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid ""direct or indirect"" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement. Several sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.A Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions ""generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities"" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.The situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.Following a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.But the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.Apple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).A CFSI program director said the group was ""aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar"". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include ""a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas"". Tin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.""Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,"" she said.CIVIL WAR Most of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.The Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.The mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so.Interviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies. Tin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process.    ""There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,"" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. ""Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.""While Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence. ""The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,"" Kucik said.The world's No. 1 tin producer, Yunnan Tin Co Ltd, told Reuters that some tin it bought was from the Wa mine, the source of almost all Myanmar's tin exports.Mandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.Sanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.Still, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.SUPPLY CHAIN The chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. ((For a GRAPHIC, click on: tmsnrt.rs/2giJmcq)) One key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys ""a long-term, stable strategic partnership"" with the UWSA statelet.YCII declined several interview requests. YCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.Yunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, whose clients include Pegatron Corp, another large contract manufacturer. Both Pegatron and Foxconn count Apple among their clients.Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. While it was possible Yunnan Tin bought tin from Myanmar, sourcing from the country was not regarded as problematic by the audit program Shenmao follows, he said.""Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,"" said Lin.In the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.More than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Two members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a ""portion"" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine.    ""We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,"" Pan told Reuters. ""We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from."" Yunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.That means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.Apple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, ""and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain"".""While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,"" it said.    Foxconn said it ""enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers"".It added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a ""single, non-U.S.-based customer"".        Pegatron Corp said it carried out ""annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains"".""Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,"" the company added.        FROM JEWELRY TO APPLIANCES Companies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.Among the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a ""very small amount of tin"" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware.The company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, ""use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy"".Starbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops.     The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures.    A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had ""noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners"".    A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was ""committed to responsible business conduct"".    ""We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,"" the statement said.

1188,"   By Alwyn Scott   (Story corrects to 1 billion tonnes from 1 million in sixth paragraph.)By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK General Electric Co's (GE.N) sales of power plant upgrades would not suffer much if the United States bailed out of climate change treaties under a Trump administration as utilities still want the economic benefits that come with modernizations, GE's power services chief said on Monday.President-elect Donald Trump has called global warming a hoax and threatened to quit climate accords, though he recently said he is keeping an ""open mind.""But even if Trump took the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate deal, that would not necessarily cut demand for plant improvements, GE said.""We see the demand being very robust for products that can lower emissions and increase efficiency,"" Paul McElhinney, chief executive of GE's $15 billion power services business, said in a TV interview with Reuters.""I don't actually see anything happening domestically in the U.S. as having a dramatic impact."" GE supports the climate agreements, which it says can help drive utilities to upgrade plants. It released a study on Monday that shows global CO2 emissions could be cut by 10 percent, or 1.1 billion tonnes a year, if current technology to boost the efficiency of coal and gas-fired power plants were installed in every plant now operating. The reduction would be equivalent to taking 95 percent of U.S. cars off the road, GE said.Such upgrades cost about $55 million for a coal plant and $10 million for a natural gas plant, GE said.GE expects to land contracts worth about $500 million in coming weeks, including a $300 million deal to upgrade two British power plants operated by Uniper SE of Germany (UN01.DE), McElhinney said.  Hardware upgrades combined with new software can increase efficiency at coal plants about 4 percentage points and around 3.3 percentage points at gas plants, GE said.GE expects more coal plants to be built over the next 25 years. Demand is particularly strong in China, India, South Africa, Southeast Asia and North Asia. Power utilities there face rising power demands and want improvements to wring more electricity from existing turbines and generators, while also helping comply with climate rules, McElhinney said. Demand for renewable energy such as wind and solar is increasing and now accounts for half of all new electric capacity, said Deb Frodl, executive director of GE's Ecomagination business, which focuses on environmental strategy.GE's potential market for power plant equipment sales more than doubled to $53 billion a year with the 2015 acquisition of power assets from Alstom SA (ALSO.PA), McElhinney said. GE is ahead of projections on cost savings and sales growth it forecast from the Alstom deal, but he declined to provide figures.
