0,"   By Aditi Shrivastava and Lisa Baertlein  Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, on Tuesday added activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board in a compromise agreement that ends his campaign to have PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) take over the company.Analysts now expect the influential investor to separately lobby each company to improve their results.Last year, Peltz urged Mondelez to sell itself to the beverage and snacks giant, but PepsiCo balked at such a deal.Trian is Mondelez's fourth-largest shareholder, with a 2.3 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. Trian also owns 0.8 percent of PepsiCo.Peltz last summer said PepsiCo was at a ""strategic crossroads"" due to changing consumer tastes and the rising importance of emerging markets, and outlined two scenarios for improving results.Plan A was to merge PepsiCo with Mondelez to create a larger company with one of the most valuable brand portfolios in the world. Plan B called for Pepsi to split its snacks and beverages businesses - which would allow each to focus on operational improvements. ""Given that Pepsi's not interested in Plan A, we are encouraging them to pursue Plan B,"" Anne Tarbell, a spokeswoman for Peltz's Trian Fund Management, told Reuters.Peltz, 71, also has pushed Mondelez - whose performance has fallen short of investor expectations since it was split from Kraft in October 2012 - to manage its costs better, saying it could double earnings per share by doing so.Peltz has been instrumental in numerous food and beverages mergers and divestitures at companies he believed were underperforming - including a series of deals that led to the creation of Mondelez. Mondelez shares fell as much as 3.7 percent in morning trade on Tuesday as hopes for a deal with PepsiCo evaporated.The shares were down 0.8 percent at $34.42 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq, while PepsiCo shares were up 0.8 percent at $82.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.""While this may have been disappointing for some investors, we see this as a very amicable outcome that now allows the management team and board (at Mondelez) to focus on running the business,"" Bernstein Research analyst Alexia Howard wrote in a note. Adding Peltz to the Mondelez board increased its size to 12, with 11 directors independent.The move also eliminated the risk of an expensive and lengthy proxy battle, J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a note.Peltz helped orchestrate the 2008 spinoff of Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS.N) from Cadbury, Kraft's purchase of Cadbury, and the subsequent breakup of Kraft into Mondelez and Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O.In addition to Mondelez and PepsiCo, Peltz's New York-based hedge fund's top five holdings include Wendy's Co (WEN.O), Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N and Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR.N).(Reporting by Aditi Shrivastava, Martinne Geller and Lisa Baertlein; Editing by Joyjeet Das, Ted Kerr and Bernard Orr)",2014-01-21,MDLZ,"Tue Jan 21, 2014 | 4:13pm EST","Peltz to join Mondelez board, ends push for PepsiCo deal",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mondelez-peltz-idUSBREA0K18E20140121?type=companyNews

4,"  (Corrects identity of mill owner to Mondelez International Inc, not Kraft Foods Group)Feb 5 Mondelez International Inc on Wednesday temporarily shut its wheat flour mill in Toledo, Ohio - the second-biggest in the United States - due to road restrictions following heavy snowfall in the area, grain industry sources said.

5,"  Cadbury chocolate seller Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) on Wednesday reported quarterly profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates amid weak global demand for packaged food and vowed to do better in 2014.Shares in Mondelez, which also makes Oreo cookies and Trident gum, fell 3 percent to $32.20 in extended trading after the company noted significant softness in its cookie business in China.Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez said fourth-quarter net earnings totaled $1.7 billion, or $1 per share, including a 91-cent gain from the resolution of arbitration over Kraft's grocery coffee sales battle with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).Adjusted earnings for the latest quarter were 42 cents per share, including a two-cent-per-share hit from currency translation. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of 44 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue was down 0.1 percent to $9.49 billion, but organic net revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions and other items, rose 2.5 percent.Its gum business performed well, but its China business took a hit as distributors there reduced biscuit, or cookie, inventory Mondelez on Wednesday said its organic revenue growth rate would be ""at or above our category growth rate,"" which it forecast at about 4 percent in 2014. ""We're disappointed that our results were below what we and our shareholders originally expected,"" Mondelez Chairwoman and Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said in a statement. ""We're committed to improving results in 2014 and beyond.""Mondelez, which was spun off from Kraft in 2012, has estimated full-year earnings of $1.78 to $1.78 per share.

7,"  May 2 Kraft Foods Group Inc said in a filing on Friday that U.S. regulators were probing wheat futures trading by businesses now owned and operated by Mondelez International Inc, which it spun off in 2012.Kraft said the probe by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was centered on activities related to the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts.Kraft said both companies were cooperating with CFTC staff in its investigation. ""While the staff has advised us that they are prepared to recommend that the Commission consider commencing a formal action, we and Mondelz International are seeking to resolve this matter prior to any formal action being taken,"" Kraft said in the filing. ""We do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations,"" Kraft said. Representatives from CFTC and Mondelez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

8,"  Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and competitor D.E Master Blenders 1753 are merging their coffee businesses in a deal aimed at taking on market leader Nestle SANESN.VX. The merger announced on Wednesday will marry Mondelez's grocery coffee brands such as Carte Noire and Gevalia with D.E Master Blenders' L'OR, Pilao and Senseo brands. The new company will be a joint venture controlled by D.E Master Blenders' parent JAB Holding Co.Mondelez, whose shares were up nearly 8 percent in midday trading, said it would receive about $5 billion and a 49 percent stake in the new combined company.The company, to be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts, will be run by the current management of D.E Master Blenders, and will be based in the Netherlands.The deal clears the way for Mondelez to focus on its snacks business, best known for Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, and is the latest move by JAB to raise its profile in the global coffee market.With annual revenue of more than $7 billion, the new company will be the world's No. 1 pure-play coffee company, though still significantly smaller than the coffee business owned by Nestle.The new company will focus on the grocery and home-brewing side of the global coffee business, D.E Master Blenders Chairman Bart Becht told Reuters. Becht, who is also JAB's chief executive, will be chairman of the new company. Pierre Laubies, chief executive of D.E Master Blenders, will become CEO of the combined company""It's a story of cross-fertilization,"" said Becht, adding that the merger opens opportunities to introduce the Senseo home coffee brewer to new markets and allows the new company to expand in the instant coffee arena.JAB, a holding company controlled by Germany's billionaire Reimann family, bought the owner of Douwe Egberts coffee last year in a 7.5 billion euro ($10.4 billion) deal. It also bought U.S. coffee chains Caribou Coffee and Peet's Coffee & Tea in 2012 for $340 million and $1 billion, respectively. Caribou and Peet's, which compete with Starbucks (SBUX.O) and Dunkin Brands Group (DNKN.O), are not part of the new company. Neither is Mondelez's coffee business in France, though JAB has made a binding offer for that business.Mondelez, which also reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit on Wednesday, separately announced a $3.5 billion restructuring program designed to cut costs, boost margins and address the main complaint of activist investor Nelson Peltz, who was recently named to the company's board.Wall Street analysts who cover Mondelez called the coffee merger ""strategic"" and ""elegant"" in client notes. They said it should remove Mondelez's coffee business, which accounts for about 11 percent of its global sales and which has had to grapple with volatile green coffee prices, from its operating results in a way that bolsters earnings.Mondelez said it would use a majority of the $5 billion proceeds to expand its $2 billion share buyback program, and the remainder to pay down debt. The deal is expected to close in 2015, subject to regulatory approvals.After that, Mondelez expects snacks to account for about 85 percent of net revenue, compared with 75 percent currently, Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said on a conference call.The deal is expected to add to adjusted earnings in the first year after completion, Mondelez said.D.E Master Blenders was advised by Lazard, BDT, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, while JAB was advised by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.

11,"  * Fed chair says U.S. economy still needs help* Mondelez climbs after earnings, coffee deal* Internet-related shares drop for second day* Whole Foods tumbles after earnings, outlook* Dow up 0.6 pct; S&P 500 up 0.2 pct; Nasdaq off 1.1 pct   (Updates to early afternoon)By Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK, May 7 U.S. stocks mostly rose on Wednesday, bouncing off earlier lows after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen offered no surprises, but the Nasdaq fell for a second straight day, weighed down by declines in Internet-related shares. The Dow and the S&P 500 moved into positive territory after Yellen said the U.S. economy was still in need of lots of support, given the ""considerable slack"" in the labor market in remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee.Yellen's comments enabled investors to shift attention to what may be an easing of the tensions in Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin called on pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine to postpone a vote on secession just five days before it was to be held.But the Nasdaq remained under pressure as stocks such as Amazon.com Inc, down 2.6 percent at $289.55; Facebook Inc, down 2.8 percent at $56.91; and Google Inc , down 1.6 percent at $514.31, all weighed heavily on the index. The Nasdaq has dropped more than 2 percent over the past two sessions. ""Janet Yellen didn't say anything new in her testimony. She continues to talk about how they are data dependent, how they can change on a dime, but she didn't say rates are going up any time soon, which is exactly what people expected,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.""Coupled with the fact that technically the market found some support, then (investors) started concentrating on what Putin said,"" Polcari added.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.48 points or 0.56 percent, to 16,493.50. The S&P 500 gained 3.53 points or 0.19 percent, to 1,871.25. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 42.892 points or 1.05 percent, to 4,037.867. Whole Foods Market Inc also contributed to the Nasdaq's decline as the organic grocer's stock tumbled 19 percent to $38.82. The stock was the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes a day after Whole Foods posted second-quarter results and cut its 2014 outlook. Rivals such as Sprouts Farmers Market, down 13.7 percent at $26.83, and The Fresh Market, down 8.9 percent at $32.64, also slumped.Of 422 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 68.2 percent beat expectations, above the 63 percent average since 1994, and exceeding the 66 percent beat rate for the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.Profits are expected to rise 5 percent this quarter, down from 6.5 percent estimated at the start of the year, but above the low of 0.6 percent in mid-April, according to Thomson Reuters data.Shares of Mondelez International Inc jumped 7.4 percent to $37.83 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after the company posted first-quarter earnings and said it reached a deal with Dutch coffee and tea company D.E Master Blenders 1753 BV.Electronic Arts shares surged 16.8 percent to $32.75 after the video game publisher posted quarterly profit and revenue that beat expectations.In the latest snapshot of the U.S. economy, the Labor Department said that U.S. nonfarm productivity fell at its fastest pace in a year in the first quarter because of severe weather. That led to the largest gain in unit labor costs in more than a year. Productivity fell at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the quarter, the Labor Department said.

The new loan is also expected to include around 500 million euros of undrawn facilities.JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are leading the financing, which is expected to launch for syndication to other banks and institutional investors in the coming weeks.ALL LOANS  The borrower is opting for an all-loan deal, shunning the bond market to take advantage of the more flexible, private and cheaper loan product.""A loan can be prepaid at par as there aren't any non-call features. It is also a private instrument which means the borrower doesn't have to blast information about the company across the world,"" a second investor said.A bond would require financial statements that reflect the combined businesses so the company would need to take out an expensive bridge loan before it could be in the position to issue bonds. Bonds also go into escrow and require the borrower to pay a full margin straight away, whereas loans are cheaper as they allow a borrower to pay a ticking fee.The loan market has the capacity for such a large financing but the deal will need to be priced correctly in terms of interest margins and ticking fees if it is to tap all the liquidity needed during primary syndication and maintain a good level in secondary. Loans in Dutch cable company Ziggo traded lower on the secondary markets as it paid a margin of 300bp, tighter than the other deals by the same owner Liberty Global. It is also still paying a ticking fee.""Bankers need to be cognisant of pricing as a lot of investors will earmark a substantial amount of cash for the Master Blenders deal which will not fund for quite a long time. Lenders need to be compensated,"" the first investor said.A third investor added: ""Ziggo was a delayed process where the deal got done but the loan traded off because it wasn't funding and people were not being compensated. In Europe, a lack of attractive ticking fees is a problem especially in Master Blenders' case if investors have to wait until 2015."" KEEPING COVENANTS In order to keep a large number of existing banks in the deal and attract new banks, the deal is expected to be covenant-loose and retain leveraged and interest covenants, as opposed to being covenant-lite.French cable company Numericable lost a lot of liquidity when a number of banks couldn't cashless roll into its new covenant-lite loans that backed its acquisition of Vivendi's telecom unit SFR and refinanced existing debt.Only a limited number of CLOs that invested in Master Blenders' 3.3 billion euro loan last year will be past reinvestment period but the company is still considering allowing lenders to cashless roll into the refinanced loans via an amendment.If a cashless roll were to occur, there could be different pricing for the refinanced money and new money.""The US market has softened in recent weeks and pricing has widened by 50bp-75bp as a result. Master Blenders could pay around 350bp with a 75bp floor,"" a banker said.The 2013 3.3 billion euro leveraged loan comprised a 1.25 billion euro TLA, a 300 million euro revolver; a 1 billion euro institutional TLB2, all paying initial margins of 350bp over Euribor, along with a 750 million TLB1 paying 375bp.

19,"   By Claire Ruckin | LONDON, June 11  LONDON, June 11 A 7.6 billion euro-equivalent ($10.35 billion) loan that finances Dutch coffee and tea company DE Master Blenders' merger with the coffee business of Mondelez International and refinances existing debt was priced on Wednesday, bankers said.The deal is the largest leveraged loan to be issued by a European company since the 9 billion pounds ($15.11 billion) buyout financing which backed the buyout of Alliance Boots by private equity firm KKR in 2008.Banks and funds are lining up to back Master Blenders' deal, which is led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, and is expected to boost Europe's leveraged loan market which has seen thin M&A activity in 2014.Mondelez and Master Blenders announced in May that they would combine their coffee businesses into a new company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE), based in the Netherlands. The financing includes a 500 million euro, five-year revolving credit and a 2.9 billion euro, five-year term loan A, both of which pay 300 basis points (bps) over Euribor.These tranches, which are known as 'pro-rata tranches' are among the largest seen in Europe, sources said. They will refinance a 3.3 billion euro leveraged loan, which backed Joh A Benckiser's (JAB) 7.5 billion euro acquisition of Master Blenders in 2013.Banks were asked to commit 225 million euros to the revolving credit and term loan A, which are both already oversubscribed. ""JAB has a lot of relationship banks. The fund community is less known to them, which is why they wanted such a large pro-rata piece. It has gone extremely well,"" a banker said.A 3 billion euro, seven-year term loan B, and a 1.2 billion euro, seven-year dollar-denominated term loan B are also included which both pay 325 bps with a 75 bps Euribor/Libor floor, which guarantees minimum returns for investors. The term loan B is being raised from fund investors that will be offered a 'ticking fee' until the acquisition closes in 2015, which will give some income before the M&A deal completes.As part of the merger, Mondelez will receive around $5 billion in cash, as well as a 49 percent equity stake in JDE.The financing was shown to investors in London on Wednesday and will be shown to US investors on Friday, sources said.Master Blenders was not immediately available to comment.

20,"   By Stuart Grudgings and Trinna Leong | KUALA LUMPUR, June 16  KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 The storm of bad publicity that hit confectioner Cadbury in Malaysia after its chocolates tested positive for traces of pork highlights the costly, religious minefield food companies must navigate as they rush to tap the surging $1 trillion global halal market.One of the biggest headaches for corporations like Mondelez International, Nestle and Unilever PLC  is the lack of a unified standard for what exactly is halal, or permissible under Islamic law, despite years of efforts by Muslim authorities to come up with a global benchmark.As a result, global food firms face higher production costs as they must comply with a mix of national processing standards that can vary widely even within the same country.Failing to navigate these differences leaves companies exposed to the risk of using ingredients permissible under one standard but not another.""Obviously it's not good to have so many standards. It's confusing,"" said Jamil Bidin, the chief executive of Halal Industry Development Corporation, an agency linked to Malaysia's government. Muslim-majority Malaysia is regarded by many Muslim countries as a global leader in halal food processing due to its established certification experience and developed industry.Islam requires practicing Muslims to consume halal products, and, at its most basic, that means foods and drinks that do not contain any alcohol or pork. To be deemed halal, livestock must be slaughtered as the name of Allah is invoked.Big food firms have been ramping up their investment and expertise in halal, eyeing a fast-growing Muslim population that is forecast to add a billion people by 2050 with rising education and income levels.The market to process, produce and distribute halal food and drinks will grow into a $1.6 trillion industry by 2018 from about $1 trillion in 2012, according to DinarStandard, a research firm specialising in Muslim markets.But industry executives say the lack of global or regional benchmarks is stunting the industry's potential at a time when countries such as Japan and Australia are jumping on the halal bandwagon to cater to a rising number of Muslim travellers.""We welcome efforts to ensure consistency in halal certification and would support a global standard, or perhaps wider regional standards, to help simplify the landscape,"" a spokesman for Cadbury's parent firm Mondelez said. SENSITIVITIES Halal standards are emotive topics in Muslim countries, as Cadbury's recent problems in Malaysia showed.Several Muslim consumer groups called for a boycott of all Cadbury and Mondelez products after the health ministry said it had detected traces of pig DNA in Dairy Milk chocolates.The news generated an online furore and prompted several rounds of testing by authorities from neighbouring Indonesia, home to the world's biggest Muslim population, to Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam.Further testing by Malaysia's Islamic affairs agency, the country's sole official halal certifier, however, showed that the initial tests had not been definitive and the chocolate was actually halal. But the incident has sparked a heated debate among Islamic scholars in Malaysia over whether substances derived from pork such as gelatin can be considered halal.""We expect there wouldn't be a repeat of such an incident as this could ruin the halal industry, in Malaysia especially,"" said Othman Yusoff, chairman of the halal committee of the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers.Domestic politics and vested interests have also proved to be a stumbling block so far.The 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which calls itself the collective voice of the Muslim world, is trying to draft global halal guidelines with the backing of Dubai, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.But that movement, the Standards and Metrology Institute for the Islamic Countries (SMIIC), does not include Malaysia and Indonesia - home to large halal-certification centres.""What is critical is that there is interoperability among standards, and transparency,"" said Rafi-uddin Shikoh, chief executive of New York-based consultants DinarStandard. ""An exporter intending to export food from Sudan should know and deliver easily the halal certification requirements from almost any market they feel they can grow in.""RIVALRIES Defining what exactly constitutes halal is an issue of hot debate among Islamic scholars, which makes agreeing on a global standard difficult.For example, more conservative interpretations hold that each animal must be slaughtered by a hand-held knife. Britain has two main halal certification boards with conflicting stances on whether animals can be stunned before slaughter.The kingdom of Brunei, which has a strict interpretation of Islamic rules, sends auditors to neighbouring Malaysian factories to check imports for halal-worthiness.Another factor complicating the search for a single standard is the intense rivalry between countries for a slice of the industry. U.S. cereal maker Kellogg Co. and chocolate maker Hershey Co., for example, are building halal-compliant plants in Malaysia, with investments of $130 million and $250 million respectively.Dubai is setting up testing and certification centres to profit from the halal business. Malaysia has been pushing its own standards, as has Turkey.""It's silos,"" said Darhim Hashim, the director of the International Halal Integrity Alliance, which is working with the OIC to create common standards. He said one way forward would be for the Gulf countries, Malaysia and Indonesia to agree minimum standards.""I think naturally the rest would follow - those are the key markets, the most regulated import markets.""

21,"   By Claire Ruckin | LONDON, June 19  LONDON, June 19 Lenders have asked to change the terms of a 7.6 billion euro ($10.36 billion)-equivalent loan that finances Dutch coffee and tea company DE Master Blenders'  merger with the coffee business of Mondelez International and refinances existing debt, banking sources said on Thursday.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are leading the financing and are in discussions with institutional investors, which are concerned over the prospect of not earning any fees for the first year and inability to remain invested in the existing loan, under the new deal's structure.The deal includes a 2.9 billion euro term loan A (TLA) and 500 million euro revolving credit, both paying 300 basis points (bps) and a 4.2 billion euro-equivalent dual-currency term loan B (TLB), paying 325bps with a 75bps floor.The pro rata tranches will refinance a 3.3 billion euro leveraged loan, which backed Joh A Benckiser's 7.5 billion euro acquisition of Master Blenders in 2013.Institutional investors are pushing back as they have not been offered a cashless roll on the TLB, as it will be made up of new money to fund the merger.  A refinancing usually triggers a repayment and reinvestment of money but a cashless roll allows investors to go into a refinanced deal without being repaid first.Since a number of CLOs that invested in last year's financing are now past their reinvestment period, they will not be able to reinvest the cash in any new deals once repaid. ""For CLOs past reinvestment period, the loan is getting repaid which means managers lose assets under management, fees and equity investors lose yield,"" a banking source said.Some lenders want an institutional carve out on the TLA to enable a cashless roll. One of the sources said a 200 million euro TLA institutional carve out would be large enough to satisfy demand.An advantage to the TLA is that it is due to fund in the next couple of weeks whereas the TLB is not due to fund until the acquisition closes in 2015. ""Banks find it far easier to sit on an unfunded commitment than a fund. It is perplexing they have chosen to do it this way round, especially as the company needs to tap a lot of liquidity"" a second banking source said.TICKED OFF  Other lenders want an improvement to a ticking fee. As the TLB will not fund until the acquisition closes in 2015 a ticking fee has been offered and is expected to pay nothing for the first 60 days, 50 percent of the margin between 61 and 90 days, the full margin during 91-330 days, and the full margin plus the floor after 330 days.As it stands the ticking fee will not pay anything out for a year and will accrue instead. It could also be put into escrow. Some investors feel it is too long to be committed to a deal without receiving cash. Investors also worry that if the M&A does not go ahead, they will be left with nothing.""The funds are being asked to buy something that does not fund for a year, which isn't good for equity distributions for the first year of a CLO.  If the M&A does not happen, the investors will not be in a good position after being repaid by the TLA and earning nothing on the ticking fee. What has been proposed is leaving funds too exposed and it is risky,"" the first banking source said.A decision and any changes to the deal are likely to emerge in the coming days once US investors have also had time to digest the information. The original issue discount is expected to be around 99-99.5.Mondelez and Master Blenders announced in May that they would combine their coffee businesses into a new company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE), based in the Netherlands. As part of the merger, Mondelez will receive around $5 billion in cash, as well as a 49 percent equity stake in JDE. [ID: nL3N0NT3UP]Master Blenders declined to comment.

22,"  * Nine-month sales volumes rise 2.4 pct on stand-alone basis* Barry blames low cocoa price, profitability focus on slowdown* Confirms mid-term targets   (Adds CFO quotes, details)By Caroline CopleyZURICH, July 3 Barry Callebaut, the world's biggest chocolate maker, said on Thursday sales volumes growth slowed to 2.4 percent in the nine months to the end of May.The Zurich-based company, which makes chocolate for Nestle , Unilever  and Mondelez  among others, is benefiting from a trend among big food groups to outsource chocolate production. But a lull in outsourcing deals in recent months and a focus on profitability in Western Europe has kept volume growth at Barry Callebaut below that of levels seen in earlier years.Low cocoa powder prices also discouraged aggressive expansion of production.""As we continue to focus on increasing our product margins, we concentrated on selective growth in developed markets,"" Chief Executive Juergen Steinemann said in a statement. On a stand-alone basis, nine-month sales volumes rose 2.4 percent. This was below the group's mid-term target of 6-8 percent per year, and slower than the 3.1 percent achieved in the first half of the year.Including the cocoa business acquired from Petra Foods  at the end of 2012 and consolidated since July 2013, sales volumes grew 15.8 percent. Chief Financial Officer Victor Balli attributed the slower stand-alone volume growth to the company's reluctance to push cocoa powder volumes given the relatively low price levels and a focus on profitability in Western Europe.""Another reason why we slowed down a bit was also because we didn't implement larger outsourcing deals in the last months, but we have a few upcoming which we will now implement,"" Balli said in an interview, adding the outsourcing pipelines look ""very attractive"".On top of industrial production, Barry Callebaut also supplies restaurants, bakeries and catering services with 'gourmet' chocolate products, a high-margin business that grew 6.9 percent in the first nine months of the financial year.Balli said the gourmet business and emerging markets, where volumes surged 63 percent, would continue to drive growth. In Western Europe, volumes slipped 0.2 percent as the company focused on improving product margins.Barry Callebaut confirmed its mid-term targets for 6-8 percent average volume growth per year and to restore profitability to pre-acquisition levels by 2015/16.

30,"   By Anjali Athavaley  Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, cut its 2014 sales target on Wednesday after price hikes to cover commodity costs sparked a backlash by consumers and retailers in some European markets. Mondelez also reported higher net income in the second quarter, topping Wall Street estimates.Mondelez said higher cocoa and dairy prices this year prompted the price increases to customers, especially in places like Venezuela and Argentina with high inflation. Since competitors have been slow to follow, the company said, some retailers have stopped selling Mondelez products altogether.""While we anticipated that this would be disruptive in the short term, it has been even more challenging than we expected,"" Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer, said on the quarterly earnings conference call. She added that she expected the impact to be temporary as competitors catch up with price hikes and the gap closes.The company said it was reducing its 2014 net organic revenue growth target to a range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent. In May, it forecast growth of about 3 percent. Organic revenue excludes changes in foreign currency, takeovers and acquisitions.  ""In Europe, some large retailers reacted badly to the price increases, and temporarily removed products from the shelves,"" Alexia Howard, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note. ""It sounds as though this is now behind them and so we believe this was a temporary hit to sales this quarter.""Mondelez shares were down 0.7 percent at $35.71.  Organic revenue in emerging markets rose 4.7 percent, below company forecasts. Sales in developed markets, like Europe, were down 1.2 percent.""Some customers, especially in Europe, most notably in France, have reacted quite severely to our price increases,"" Rosenfeld said. Mondelez isn't the only company to feel the pain from raising prices. Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, spun off from Mondelez in 2012, said in July its second-quarter revenue barely rose as price hikes hurt customer demand.  PROFIT TOPS ESTIMATES Other chocolate makers like Hershey Co (HSY.N) and Mars Chocolate North America, the maker of M&M’s and Snickers and a subsidiary of Mars Inc, have raised prices for the first time in three years due to the higher costs of cocoa and in particular cocoa butter.Cocoa futures prices have soared more than 30 percent in the past year and hit three-year highs this week. Higher dairy costs have also played a role in the increase in chocolate prices. Net income at Mondelez increased to $622 million, or 36 cents per share, from $601 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue declined 1.8 percent to $8.4 billion. Organic revenue was up 1.2 percent. Bernstein's Howard said organic sales growth was ""particularly disappointing,"" given that the Easter holiday, which typically boosts growth, came out in the second quarter this year. Organic sales in North America rose 2.7 percent on share gains in biscuits and candy.Excluding the effects from recalculating assets in Venezuela and other items, earnings were 40 cents per share.

33,"  * Butter ratios hold near strongest level since December* Powder prices unchanged, may fall to attract buyersBy Lewa PardomuanSINGAPORE, Aug 20 Chocolate makers stayed away from the physical market this week as Asian cocoa butter ratios held near their highest since December, dealers said on Wednesday, while grinders could cut powder prices to lure buyers.Cocoa processing in Asia has risen in the past two years as more companies set up grinding facilities in Indonesia to secure bean supply. Although demand for butter has generally been steady, grinders are struggling to sell cocoa powder.About 40 percent of cocoa that is ground ends up as powder, another 40 percent as butter and the rest as paste and cocoa liquor. Butter gives chocolate its melt-in-the-mouth texture, while powder is used in cakes, ice cream, biscuits and drinks. Cocoa butter ratios, an indicator of demand, were unchanged from last week at 2.40 to 2.45 times London futures <0#LCC:>.  Butter prices are calculated by multiplying London and New York bean futures by the ratio, with the values currently at between $8,000 and $8,200 a tonne.Butter prices stood at about $6,800 a tonne in January.""Trading has frozen and nothing has moved. It's about time that Asia slowed down. Grinders with old cake stocks will probably be selling their powder cheaply,"" said a dealer in Indonesia. ""It's better for you to do it, rather than not moving the product at all.""When processing beans, grinders initially get cocoa cakes, which they press into powder. Grinders often refrain from turning cakes into powder when demand is weak. Powder prices were unchanged at between $1,500 and $2,100 a tonne, but dealers said it was unlikely buyers would chase powder at prices above $2,000 because of ample stocks.Grinders do not reveal the size of their powder stocks.London cocoa futures <0#LCC:> have gained more than 17 percent this year on expectations demand will outstrip supply in the current 2013/14 crop year.

But despite owning factories in four countries and making $1.2 billion in annual sales, Ukraine's ""chocolate king"" may have a hard time finding a buyer for his company, now that its founder is the leader of a country at war.""It’s all academic given the political situation at the moment,"" said a financial source closely following the situation. ""But at its core it makes your mouth water.""After years of combining his career as a billionaire candy boss with posts in successive governments, Poroshenko promised when he was elected in May to sell Roshen, the confectionary empire named for the middle two syllables of his surname. He has since hired advisors Rothschild and local firm Investment Capital Ukraine to drum up investor interest.On paper, there is a lot to tempt investors. Eastern Europe is a region with a sweet tooth, accounting for 12.8 percent of global candy sales despite a much smaller share of the world's population. Roshen is the region's second biggest locally-owned producer, ranked 18 in the world by net sales according to the Candy Industry Top 100.Apart from its main factories in Ukraine, it has plants in EU members Lithuania and Hungary as well as in Russia. In a region where tastes are still dominated by local habits, its decorative assortment boxes with names like ""Kiev Evening"" and ""Royal Dessert"" hold their own against global chocolate brands. Although it could be broken up into parts, an asking price that insiders say is likely to be around $1.5 billion means the company is probably too big to be swallowed whole by domestic players in Ukraine.That would seem to make it a perfect target for firms like Switzerland's Nestle or Mondelez, the U.S. snack and confectionary business split off from Kraft that includes Britain's Cadbury. Both are investing in the region and not shy about acquiring local brands.Nestle has looked at buying other confectionary businesses in Ukraine, the sources said, while Mondelez announced in April it is spending $110 million to open its fifth factory in Russia next year.But finding a buyer for a company associated with a war-time leader is no simple matter. Until last year, Russia accounted for about a fifth of Roshen's sales. But Moscow banned imports of Roshen's Ukrainian chocolates to Russia last year, officially on health and safety grounds, and shut its Russian factories in March in a criminal case that Kiev says is politically motivated. Since July, Russia has banned all Ukrainian chocolates.Kiev says Russian forces have supported pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine in a conflict which has killed more than 3,000 people, although a ceasefire has been in place for a week. Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March and President Vladimir Putin now calls eastern Ukraine ""New Russia"", although he denies involvement in the war.Those close to the effort to sell Roshen say the company's prospectus is being shopped despite the conflict. ""Contact has been made with prospective buyers but it's very preliminary,"" said one of the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private. ""This is a big and complex situation and any sale is not going to happen in a few weeks. Don't expect anything imminent."" Financial sources closely following the deal said that given the tense political situation, any sales process is likely going to be complicated because commercial or strategic logic won't apply. Large international players are unlikely to table bids before the conflict is clearly over, they said.Roshen did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. ICU could not be reached. Rothschild declined to comment beyond confirming that it had been hired. Roshen would be attractive to confectionary companies in the low-to-mid-market chocolate range who are keen on expanding in emerging markets and willing to navigate political interference. Mars, the world's biggest chocolatier, is unlikely to be interested because it only markets its own brands. But in addition to Nestle and Mondelez, interested parties could include Korean firm Lotte which entered the region in 2010 with the purchase of Poland's Wedel from Kraft Foods, and Turkish food manufacturer Ulker.

Apart from its main factories in Ukraine, it has plants in EU members Lithuania and Hungary as well as in Russia. In a region where tastes are still dominated by local habits, its decorative assortment boxes with names like ""Kiev Evening"" and ""Royal Dessert"" hold their own against global chocolate brands.Although it could be broken up into parts, an asking price that insiders say is likely to be around $1.5 billion means the company is probably too big to be swallowed whole by domestic players in Ukraine.That would seem to make it a perfect target for firms like Switzerland's Nestle or Mondelez, the U.S. snack and confectionary business split off from Kraft that includes Britain's Cadbury. Both are investing in the region and not shy about acquiring local brands. Nestle has looked at buying other confectionary businesses in Ukraine, the sources said, while Mondelez announced in April it is spending $110 million to open its fifth factory in Russia next year.But finding a buyer for a company associated with a war-time leader is no simple matter.Until last year, Russia accounted for about a fifth of Roshen's sales. But Moscow banned imports of Roshen's Ukrainian chocolates to Russia last year, officially on health and safety grounds, and shut its Russian factories in March in a criminal case that Kiev says is politically motivated. Since July, Russia has banned all Ukrainian chocolates.Kiev says Russian forces have supported pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine in a conflict which has killed more than 3,000 people, although a ceasefire has been in place for a week. Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March and President Vladimir Putin now calls eastern Ukraine ""New Russia"", although he denies involvement in the war. Those close to the effort to sell Roshen say the company's prospectus is being shopped despite the conflict.""Contact has been made with prospective buyers but it's very preliminary,"" said one of the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private. ""This is a big and complex situation and any sale is not going to happen in a few weeks. Don't expect anything imminent.""Financial sources closely following the deal said that given the tense political situation, any sales process is likely going to be complicated because commercial or strategic logic won't apply. Large international players are unlikely to table bids before the conflict is clearly over, they said.Roshen did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. ICU could not be reached. Rothschild declined to comment beyond confirming that it had been hired.Roshen would be attractive to confectionary companies in the low-to-mid-market chocolate range who are keen on expanding in emerging markets and willing to navigate political interference.Mars, the world's biggest chocolatier, is unlikely to be interested because it only markets its own brands. But in addition to Nestle and Mondelez, interested parties could include Korean firm Lotte which entered the region in 2010 with the purchase of Poland's Wedel from Kraft Foods, and Turkish food manufacturer Ulker.

37,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON Offering an array of hot and cold single-serve drinks is central to the growth strategy of Mondelez International Inc's (MDLZ.O) European coffee business, which will soon merge with D.E Master Blenders 1753.With regulatory approval expected in coming months, the merged business, to be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts, will continue to invest heavily in a single-serve coffee business able to compete better with Nestle's NESN.VX market-leading brands Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, said Roland Weening, president of coffee for Mondelez Europe.""We already have over 90 drinks and we believe there is a market for more. Watch this space,"" Weening told Reuters.Mondelez's Tassimo system sells portions of Jacobs coffee, Milka hot chocolate and Twinings tea that can be served hot or cold, while D.E Master Blenders' Senseo system sells L'Or Espresso cups compatible with Nespresso machines. Coffee in single-serve packs for use with at-home brewing machines is a global retail market worth $10.8 billion, according to Euromonitor International. About 61 percent of that market is in western Europe, where Nestle has a 41-percent share. The merged businesses of Mondelez and D.E Master Blenders would have a near 25-percent share in western Europe.Worldwide, the retail market grew 22 percent last year, much faster than traditional coffee or bottled drinks, as it appeals to well-heeled consumers who like the convenience of fast, barista-style espressos and lattes at home.Weening is bullish on machines that serve hot and cold drinks, but is not yet convinced of the opportunity for carbonated soft drinks, which is being pursued by rival Keurig Green Mountain GMCR.O with Coca-Cola (KO.N).  It is ""something that others are looking at but we don't see that yet as a significant development,"" he said, declining to say whether the company would engage in a similar partnership. ""I'm not speculating on any of the potential things we might do in the future, but of course it is a growing market with a lot of opportunities ... so we clearly want to continue to take advantage of all opportunities out there,"" he said. ""Who knows what the future may bring?""To have a multi-beverage system as we have with Tassimo, that is able to do different drinks -- hot, cold, etc -- is where I think in the future, the game will be,"" he said.  Mondelez, which also sells Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, increased spending on Tassimo by 40 percent last year, in marketing, research and development, and production capacity. Spending is on track for a similar rise this year, Weening said, and the brand should remain ""a top priority"" next year. While the Tassimo machine and its compatible packs are positioned at the higher end of the market, with some drinks costing as much as $0.50 per cup, Weening said Senseo was cheaper, and therefore did not overlap too much. Jacobs Douwe Egberts, which will be the world's biggest pure-play coffee company with annual revenue of more than $7 billion, will be controlled by JAB Holding Co, the investment arm of Germany's billionaire Reimann family. Mondelez will own a 49 percent stake and Weening will stay on as a member of its executive committee.

39,"   By Chris Prentice | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 23 Food manufacturers such as Mondelez International and J.M. Smucker Co.  will face billions of dollars of additional costs this year due to soaring sugar prices, according to estimates from a sugar buyers group.U.S. sugar prices have surged 40 percent since the U.S. sugar industry initiated a trade case with Mexico. That will cost food manufacturers an additional $2.4 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, according to a Thursday report from the Sweetener Users Association.The U.S. Commerce Department in August made a preliminary decision to impose countervailing, or anti-subsidy, duties on sugar from Mexico in response to allegations from the U.S. sugar industry that Mexican mills were dumping cheap, subsidized sugar into the U.S. market.Domestic prices for refined sugar have jumped about 7.6 cents a lb since the cases were filed, translated to an additional $837 million in sugar costs for food manufacturers, said Tom Earley, a food policy consultant at Agralytica in Virginia and author of the report. Industry pressure and tensions have mounted ahead of the Friday deadline for the Department's initial determination on potential dumping duties, which would be added to anti-subsidy duties of up to 17.01 percent.The costs could grow from there, depending on the size of any the antidumping duties, Earley said on a conference call regarding the report. ""We have the decision coming up on dumping duties. Those would clearly push up prices,"" he said.Domestic sugar prices hit multi-year lows last year on surging output in Mexico and the United States. Mexico's sugar mills have had unfettered access to the U.S. market since the 2008 implementation of NAFTA in the sugar market. While the Sweetener Users Association does not identify its members, the trade case has meant a jump in prices and supply uncertainty for sugar buyers that include candy makers like Hershey Co. and Mars Inc.Though data is not yet publicly available, the U.S. Agriculture Department has estimated that Mexican sugar imports plunged to about 28,300 tons in September after the U.S. government began collecting the first round of duties.That was down by two-thirds from the previous month and by more than 80 percent from September 2013.

41,"  Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O said quarterly profit fell nearly 11 percent as price hikes, designed to offset higher commodity costs, hit demand for its popular products such as Velveeta cheese and Jell-O desserts.Kraft's shares were down 1.8 percent at $55.87 in after-hours trading.The company, which also makes Oscar Mayer meats and Kool-Aid beverages, said gross margin fell to 29.3 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 27, from 33.8 percent a year earlier. The company said sales growth at its cheese foods business, which makes up 21 percent of total revenue, was slower than that of the U.S. cheese market as it raised prices to counter ""an unrelenting dairy cost environment"".Kraft has been raising prices on more than half its products. At the same time, it has been offering discounts to boost sales at its meals and desserts business, where revenue fell 6.7 percent as consumers increasingly reach for healthier, organic food over desserts and processed items. Rival General Mills Inc (GIS.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit last month on weak demand for its packaged foods and beverages such as Green Giant canned and frozen vegetables and Progresso soup.General Mills CEO Ken Powell told Reuters at the time that sales of non-durable goods, which include food and beverage items, have been flat to down for the industry.  Kraft's net income fell to $446 million, or 74 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $500 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue edged up 0.1 percent to $4.40 billion.

42,"  (Updates share price, adds background, CEO comments)By Anjali AthavaleyNov 5 Snacks maker Mondelez International Inc  raised its full-year forecast on Wednesday and topped analysts' expectations even as it reported an 11 percent drop in quarterly profit on weak sales in Europe.Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate, raised its full-year 2014 earnings outlook to $1.82 to $1.87 per share, adjusted for items like currency. Previously, the company forecast $1.73 to $1.78 per share.Shares rose 6 percent to $37.10 in midday trading on Wednesday. Like other companies in the food industry, Mondelez has faced sluggish markets in some of its key categories. The company reported a string of disappointing quarterly results since it split from Kraft Foods Group in 2012, and investors have called on Mondelez to respond to tepid demand and changing consumer tastes by cutting costs.""The biggest impact we're seeing on our business is our consumer remains very value conscious around the world,"" said Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld in an interview. She added that ""in this challenging market, we have been quite focused on what we can control, and that has been to drive productivity and cost reduction."" Earlier this year, Rosenfeld said Mondelez had retained the consulting firm Accenture to implement a zero-based budgeting system, where business units need to justify all costs each year.She said in the interview that the new system is ""helping folks to plan budgets at a more granular level,"" thereby reducing overhead costs and boosting margins. Net income totaled $899 million, or 53 cents a share, for the third quarter, down from $1.01 billion, or 56 cents a share. Earnings per share, when adjusted for items like acquisitions, was 50 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting 39 cents a share.Overall revenue during the quarter declined 2 percent to $8.3 billion. Adjusted for the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 3 percent during the period but were down 2 percent in Europe as some retailers in France stopped carrying Mondelez's products. In August, Mondelez said that price hikes that it had implemented to cover commodity costs had sparked a backlash from retailers in some European markets.Rosenfeld said on the company's third-quarter earnings call that by the end of the quarter, most of the disputes with retailers had been resolved.

Kinh Do is Vietnam's biggest confectionary producer and makes products such as Cosy biscuits and Solite soft cakes. Vietnam has a growing middle class, and 60 percent of the population is under 30 years old, presenting an opportunity to attract younger generations to Mondelez products.""It's a perfect fit for our Asian growth strategy,"" Tim Cofer, president of the Asia Pacific business, said in an interview. Mondelez has an option to buy the remaining shares of Kinh Do's snack business a year after the completion of the initial deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015.Mondelez split from Kraft Foods Group Inc in 2012 and stumbled out of the gate as an independent company with a string of disappointing quarterly results that led the company to undertake several cost-cutting initiatives. ""The opportunity to continue to invest in high growth emerging markets in the core categories where we compete is fundamental to our growth strategy,"" Cofer said.Mondelez has struggled in the Asia Pacific region. Sales there when adjusted for currency are down 3 percent year-to-date, mainly because of weakness in demand for biscuits in China and the company's own missteps in that market.Cofer expects business in China to turn around.

48,"   By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 13 Procter & Gamble Co., one of Warren Buffett's top portfolio holdings, is about to lose the billionaire's influential backing at a time when it appears the company's own fortunes have peaked.Thursday's agreement by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  to turn over the $4.7 billion in shares it owns in the world's largest consumer products company in exchange for P&G's Duracell battery business comes one day after P&G shares hit a life-time high.""He is basically cashing in at a 52-week high,"" said Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida. ""He is stating in transaction that Duracell is inexpensive and P&G stock is expensive. And accomplishing this all in tax-efficient transaction.""Buffett's transaction provides an exit from an investment he began making a quarter century ago, and on which he had already been dialing back. Under the deal, P&G will infuse about $1.8 billion of cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.Berkshire became one of P&G's biggest shareholders as a result of Buffett's investment in Gillette Co. P&G bought Gillette in 2005 in a $57 billion deal that Buffett supported. Berkshire held more than 101 million P&G shares in 2007 and cut the stake several times since then as the consumer-goods company faltered under previous Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald. Berkshire had fewer than 53 million shares as of June 30. Although P&G shares hit a life-time high of $89.88 on Wednesday, they have underperformed the market. Since its market bottom in March 2009, P&G has doubled in price. That pales next to the 147 percent gain in P&G's peer sector, the S&P consumer staples index, and the tripling in value of the wider S&P 500.And P&G shares are expensive. They are trading at roughly 20 times forward earnings compared with a peer median of 18.7 times, and 16.5 times cash flow versus a peer median of 14.2. That means P&G is more expensive than half its peers in arguably one of the market's priciest sectors. The forward price-to-earnings multiple for the entire S&P 500 is about 16, according to Thomson Reuters data. To be sure, P&G's 3.7 price-to-book ratio is cheap relative to the 5.3 median for its peers. Buffett favors measuring Berkshire's own worth using growth in book value per share, instead of the stock price.In recent years, Berkshire has shed most of its multi-billion-dollar stakes in oil company ConocoPhillips  and Kraft Foods Inc, the latter of which has since split into two companies.Buffett was unhappy with Kraft's decision in 2010 to buy the British confectionery company Cadbury.

51,"  (Adds milestone to paragraph 1, details, background)NEW YORK Dec 3 Kraft Foods Inc, the maker of Maxwell House coffee, said on Wednesday it will raise prices on most of its U.S. single-serve coffees for the first time, extending its price increases to a more lucrative market.Kraft will raise the price of its Maxwell House, Gevalia, McCafe and Yuban K-Cup portion packs by about 9 percent, effective Dec. 28, due to sustained price increases in associated raw material markets, a company spokeswoman said in an email. This comes after the large U.S. roaster raised prices on its Maxwell House and Yuban roast and ground coffee brands by about 10 percent in June, its first increase in three years, and its premium Gevalia brand by around 7 percent the following month.Other major U.S. roasters also raised their roast and ground prices around that time, but single-serve was excluded. On Nov. 3, Keurig Green Mountain Inc, the maker of single-serve K-Cups, raised its portion pack prices. Single-serve coffee pods carry significantly larger profit margins than roast and ground coffee sold in traditional canisters.Arabica coffee futures prices have been extremely volatile in 2014 and reached the highest level in more than 2-1/2 years in October at $2.29 per lb, after a drought in top grower Brazil was followed by a dry period during the critical flowering period.

60,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Anielle Troyan, a call center worker in New York, shops at discount retailers such as Family Dollar for items like soap and detergent as well as groceries like Kraft macaroni and cheese and small-sized condiments.It's ""expensive to cook for one,"" she said. ""I'm 25, I'm poor, I'm usually going to buy what's cheapest."" Customers like Troyan are one reason why Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O reversed course after considering stopping the sale of single-serve packages of Velveeta cheese sauce, which wasn't moving in traditional grocery stores. After another look at the numbers, Kraft found that shoppers on tight budgets at dollar stores were gobbling up Velveeta sauce in the affordable small size, and the food got a new lease on life.The fall and rise of Velveeta shows how companies such as Kraft, General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) are following shoppers into dollar stores, which carry a host of private label and brand name products, typically priced between $1 and $10. As an improving U.S. economy still leaves some middle class customers tumbling towards the poverty line, food companies are searching for growth where lower income consumers shop. ""We're in the business of feeding all American families, and that's where consumers are going,"" said Tom Lopez, vice president of growth channels at Kraft.Packaged food sales were flat in 2014 as people increasingly avoided the brands typically found in the center aisles of grocery stores in favor of the fresher food found on the perimeter. But in other types of stores, such as dollar, drug and club, sales are growing faster than grocery store sales, prompting companies to expand distribution.Dollar stores flourished during the recession and remain in the spotlight: Family Dollar shareholders in January approved the sale of the company to Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) for about $8.5 billion in cash and stock and rejected a $9.1 billion all-cash offer from Dollar General, citing antitrust concerns. An aging population is also driving the push by packaged food companies into dollar stores. General Mills says it’s seeing more baby boomers at dollar stores looking for smaller quantities, so it expanded its snack offerings there to include the Fiber One brand. Sales in dollar and drug stores rose 8 percent last year, company officials said.  At Kraft, sales at club, dollar and drug stores also rose 8 percent in the first three quarters of 2014, four to five times faster than sales in all channels. Improving distribution to dollar stores could help Kraft reinvigorate sales in the United States, where it has struggled with flat sales growth and higher commodity costs. Since its split with Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) in 2012, the majority of Kraft’s business comes from sales of North America grocery items. ""They have been for a very long period of time this kind of staple of the middle class,"" said Robert Passikoff, president at Brand Keys, a brand consultancy in New York. ""That doesn't really seem to be the case anymore. If people are not flocking to those brands, you need to be able to look for other audiences and other distribution points.""Since its spin-off from Mondelez, Kraft has appointed a 13-person team to focus on untraditional sales channels. Sales to dollar stores saw double digit percentage growth in 2014 from the prior year.CAUTIOUS SPENDERS   The strategy faces some challenges. Even with an improving economy and low gas prices, low income consumers remain cautious about their spending.""While on paper, it appears that the economy is improving, the low to middle income consumer who is our core customer continues to look for ways to manage her budget as she works to prioritize her spending and she trusts that we are on her side to help her stretch her budget,"" said Dollar General's chief executive Rick Dreiling on the company's earnings conference call in December.Kraft operates an in-house kitchen, where it tests recipes that it hopes will appeal to budget conscious consumers and tries to figure out how families stock their pantries, said Robin Ross, director of Kraft Kitchens. ""There is no room for waste,"" she said. ""There is no room to choose products and recipes that won't go over well in our families. We know that in some of these households there might be higher propensity to buy canned foods or vegetables because there is more of a guarantee that those products won't go bad before it's time for use.""  Shrinking package sizes allows Kraft to reach higher profit margins on products, though it won't sell as many as it would in a larger store. For instance, a 12-ounce package of Velveeta Shells & Cheese cost $2.50 at the a Dollar Tree store in New York City. Meanwhile, a 2.4 ounce cup cost $1.25. That's 21 cents an ounce versus 52 cents an ounce. Not all brands work well in dollar stores, company officials said. Many health and wellness brands can't compete on price in the channel, and food makers point out other limitations for more premium products.A Campbell Soup spokeswoman says, for instance, that most stores have limited refrigeration space, which is needed for many of its Bolthouse Farms products. Industry watchers expect more fresh products to eventually be available at dollar stores. ""When you look at natural, organic, gluten-free foods, these are products that are demanded across all income classes,"" said Peter Keith, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""It is important for the dollar stores to shift some of the mix to those items. That's where the broader population in the U.S. is moving.""

61,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Shailaja Sharma  Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and said it expects cost cuts to boost its full-year adjusted operating margin in 2015. The company on Wednesday said it expects the margin to be about 14 percent in the year ending Dec. 31, up from 12.9 percent in 2014. ""This should be good enough, we think,"" said JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman in a note. ""2015 guidance (including EPS, organic sales and margins) came in roughly as we anticipated.""Since its split from Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O in 2012, Mondelez has focused on margin expansion as the company, like others in the food industry, faces sluggish growth in developed markets and volatility in emerging ones. It has cut costs and implemented zero-based budgeting, which requires managers to justify every cost for each new period.    The company's shares were up 1.7 percent to $36.42 in early afternoon trading. Still, Mondelez faced questions about weakness in key markets. Net revenue in Europe, Mondelez's biggest market by sales, fell 6.7 pct. The company said on its earnings conference call that competitors have still been slow to catch up to the price increases it implemented to cover higher commodity costs in the region. ""The reality is a number of our multinational competitors have just lagged a little bit in pricing response, and that has put some pressure on the business,"" Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said. Mondelez said it expects organic net revenue to grow at least 2 percent in 2015, helped by a decision to focus on its snacks business, which it has done by hiving off its coffee and other businesses.The company, which gets over 80 percent of its revenue outside the United States, said a strengthening dollar would hit revenue growth by about 11 percentage points and adjusted profit by about 30 cents per share. Net revenue fell about 7 percent to $8.83 billion in the fourth quarter and missed analysts' average estimate of $8.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

65,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Ramkumar Iyer  Kraft Foods Group Inc said on Thursday that its chief financial officer would leave her role and two other senior executives would depart from the company, marking the first major changes at the maker of Velveeta cheese and Oscar Mayer meats since its board chairman took over as chief executive in December. Kraft said the shakeup, which includes the creation of a ""vice president of growth initiatives"", was aimed at accelerating the pace of change at the company. In December, the company announced that its chairman John Cahill would replace  Chief Executive Tony Vernon who stepped down.In his first earnings conference call since he took over as CEO, Cahill said, ""It's clear that our world has changed and our consumers have changed, but our company has not changed enough.""Cahill declined to give specifics on his strategy until the second quarter of the year but said the company would focus on developing products based on consumer insights and spend on more efficient advertising. The company has been battling sluggish demand for its older brands in the United States, where many consumers want fresher foods with higher quality ingredients.As part of the change, Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll will be leaving her role effective Feb. 28. Chief Marketing Officer Deanie Elsner and Chuck Davis, executive vice president of research and development and quality and innovation, will leave the company. Jane Hilk, president of the enhancers and snack nuts division, has been appointed interim chief marketing officer.Kraft said the finance division would report to Cahill until a CFO was appointed.List-Stoll, who joined Kraft in September 2013, will stay on as a senior adviser to ensure a smooth transition.

""But I think his whole point is they're not innovating fast enough, and they're not coming out with the right type of marketing.""Analysts said investors also will be watching Cahill's approach to Kraft's portfolio regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures. ""We have wonderful brands but they are not all created equal,"" Cahill said. ""At the end of the day our brands are phenomenal brands as they are, and so, our first and foremost focus will be on making them work.""  When asked about his approach on cost-cutting, Cahill said, ""As I see it today, there remains plenty of opportunity to take costs out without jeopardizing in any way our top line.""Kraft's shares were down 1.9 percent at $64.90 in extended trading on Thursday.Chris Kempczinski, who currently leads the company's Canada unit, will assume an expanded role as executive vice president of growth initiatives and president of international operations.He will work on innovation and strategy that will include mergers and acquisitions, Kraft said.

66,"  (Recasts with Mondelez and DE Master Blender statement, adds Lavazza comment)BRUSSELS/MILAN Feb 23 Mondelez International  and DE Master Blenders 1753 proposed on Monday selling the Carte Noir coffee brand instead of two smaller marques to soothe European competition concerns about their merger.Combining Mondelez International's coffee business with its Netherlands-based rival would create the world's second-biggest coffee company after Nestle.European Union antitrust regulators said earlier on Monday they had extended their review of the proposed tie-up until June 1 because they were unhappy with the solutions offered so far by the two companies. The merger would significantly reduce competition for roast and ground coffee in France, Denmark and Latvia, as well as for filter pads in France and Austria, EU antitrust regulators have said.""We are proposing a new remedy package,"" Mondelez and D.E. Master Blenders 1753 said in a joint statement in response to the competition enforcer's concerns. The new option was the sale of the ""Carte Noir brand for all coffee formats across the European economic area, including the divestment of the brand in-home Roast & Ground, filter pads and Nespresso compatible capsules businesses"", the companies said, adding that it replaced a previous offer to sell the L'Or and Grande Mere brands. Italy's Lavazza had offered more than 600 million euros  ($680 million) for L'Or and Grande Mere together and was raising cash for the acquisition, hoping for a positive response from the EU antitrust body.The Italian coffee maker will evaluate ""any future opportunity as the transaction (between Mondelez International and D.E. Master Blender) develops"", Lavazza said in a statement without elaborating.Carte Noir, owned by Mondelez International, is one of France's best-selling premium coffee brands.

69,"  (Corrects name of the brand put on sale to say Carte Noire, not Carte Noir, in headline and paragraph one)BRUSSELS/MILAN Feb 23 Mondelez International  and D.E. Master Blenders 1753 proposed on Monday selling the Carte Noire coffee brand instead of two smaller marques to soothe European competition concerns about their merger.Combining Mondelez International's coffee business with its Netherlands-based rival would create the world's second-biggest coffee company after Nestle.European Union antitrust regulators said earlier on Monday they had extended their review of the proposed tie-up until June 1 because they were unhappy with the solutions offered so far by the two companies. The merger would significantly reduce competition for roast and ground coffee in France, Denmark and Latvia, as well as for filter pads in France and Austria, EU antitrust regulators have said.""We are proposing a new remedy package,"" Mondelez and D.E. Master Blenders 1753 said in a joint statement in response to the competition enforcer's concerns. The new option was the sale of the ""Carte Noire brand for all coffee formats across the European economic area, including the divestment of the brand in-home Roast & Ground, filter pads and Nespresso compatible capsules businesses"", the companies said, adding that it replaced a previous offer to sell the L'Or and Grand Mere brands. Italy's Lavazza had offered more than 600 million euros  ($680 million) for L'Or and Grand Mere together and was raising cash for the acquisition, hoping for a positive response from the EU antitrust body.The Italian coffee maker will evaluate ""any future opportunity as the transaction (between Mondelez International and D.E. Master Blenders) develops"", Lavazza said in a statement without elaborating.Carte Noire, owned by Mondelez International, is one of France's best-selling premium coffee brands.

70,"   By Luc Cohen | NEW YORK, March 2  NEW YORK, March 2 Scott Amoye, who ran Mondelez International Inc's cocoa business, has left after five year years with one of the world's largest chocolate companies and the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, he confirmed to Reuters on Monday.His last day was Friday and has been replaced by Udo Kagerbauer, who is based in Switzerland and was named director for global cocoa commodity price risk management at Mondelez, he said.""I expect to continue in commodities,"" said Amoye, who was based in New Jersey. He declined to say what his plans are or which company he may be joining.A Mondelez spokesman declined to comment on the moves, citing the Illinois-based company's policy not to discuss personnel changes. Amoye joined British chocolate maker Cadbury in 2009 as vice president of global commodities. Cadbury would later be bought by Kraft Foods Group Inc, Mondelez's former parent.Almost 18 months later, he became senior director of global commodities for coffee and cocoa when Cadbury was bought by Kraft in 2010. Following Kraft's decision to spin off its snacks and chocolate business, creating Mondelez in September 2012, he became senior director for global commodities sourcing and risk, managing the global cocoa and cocoa products teams.Earlier in his career, he had been a cocoa trader for 20 years at London-based commodities trader ED&F Man. Mondelez was the second-largest chocolate company in the world in 2014, according to data from the International Cocoa Organization, with sales of $14.4 billion, trailing Mars at $18.5 billion.His departure comes at a critical time for the cocoa industry as chocolate makers such as Hershey Co hiked retail prices due to the soaring cost of cocoa beans and dairy, hurting sales.Competition among merchants and bean processors is also intensifying after a series of deal making.Last year, Archer Daniels Midland Co sold its cocoa and chocolate operations to Olam International Limited  and Cargill Inc, respectively, and in January, Noble Group Ltd decided to wind down its cocoa operations.

73,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Emails between former senior executives at Kraft Foods, including its chief financial officer and a top procurement director, are among the evidence in a U.S. lawsuit accusing the company and Mondelez International of manipulating wheat prices.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Wednesday accused Kraft Foods Group and Mondelez of making massive bets in Chicago's futures markets in late 2011 as part of a plot to drive down the physical price for wheat they used to make products ranging from Oreos to Ritz crackers.Kraft, which spun off its snacks business into Mondelez in 2012, said Mondelez would bear most of the costs of the case. Mondelez declined to comment.The CFTC filed the manipulation charges partly using power derived from the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. The agency in 2013 used the provision in obtaining a $100 million settlement against JPMorgan Chase & Co for its ""London Whale"" trades.Dry weather around the world was pushing up wheat prices when the U.S. regulator alleges Kraft and Mondelez devised a plan to manipulate markets to save millions of dollars buying the grain. At the time, Kraft was one the country's top users of a type of ""soft"" wheat used to make cookies and crackers and consumed about 30 million bushels a year, which represents about 7 percent of last year's crop, the CFTC said.The company was not eager to pay up for physical wheat, according to the lawsuit. Instead, Kraft made a dramatic change to its buying practices by entering contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade for $90 million of wheat futures representing a six-month supply, the regulator said.  Company executives wanted to ""induce sellers to believe"" Kraft planned to take delivery of loads of wheat, when the company never intended to take delivery, according to the CFTC.An October 2011 email to Kraft's former CFO and other senior executives from the company's senior director of global procurement laid out the plan to depress prices, according to the agency, which included a snippet in the lawsuit.Another email from the procurement officer six weeks later confirmed the strategy was working, the CFTC said. The lawsuit did not name the executives. Kraft was in line to save $7 million on the commercial cost of wheat and make up to $3 million from moves in the futures market ""if all goes according to plan"", the second email said, according to a portion contained in the lawsuit. IMPACT ON PRICE Typically, Kraft had bought most of its wheat directly from farmers or dealers on the physical market, and aimed to keep a two month's supply in its inventory, the lawsuit said. The company had never before owned 15 million bushels, which was three times its storage capacity, according to the CFTC. Kraft, as a hedger, is supposed to use futures to offset the risk of a position in the physical market and to enter trades in ways that are not disruptive to the marketplace. But U.S. regulators say Kraft impacted the futures market and caused physical prices in Toledo, Ohio, where the company grinds 90 percent of the wheat it buys into flour, to drop 5 percent during the first week of December 2011. Kraft earned more than $5.4 million by manipulating the markets, according to the CFTC.CME Group Inc, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade, declined to comment.Scott Irwin, an economist at the University of Illinois, said the relatively small profit for Kraft made the regulator's manipulation charges seem strange.""If you're going to manipulate the market, I would think that they would do it in a bigger way than that,"" he said.The case is U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v.

81,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelēz International Inc are being sued in a proposed class action on behalf of wheat futures and options traders for allegedly manipulating the grain's price.    The lawsuit was filed on Thursday by futures trader Richard Dennis in the federal court in Chicago, eight days after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued both companies.In that case, the CFTC alleged that the former Kraft Foods Inc in late 2011 bought $90 million of wheat futures despite never intending to take possession of the grain.The regulator said it did this to depress prices in the cash wheat market, where sellers might believe the companies needed less wheat, and inflate futures prices. Kraft's strategy led to more than $5.4 million of illegal gains, the CFTC said.In Thursday's complaint, Dennis raised similar claims, and accused Kraft and Mondelēz of manipulating prices of cash wheat and wheat futures contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade from 2003 to January 2014, boosting revenue and trading profit. ""While these illicit profits benefited defendants' bottom line, they caused harm to class members who transacted in CBOT wheat futures contracts at artificial prices,"" Dennis said.Kraft had no immediate comment. Mondelēz spokeswoman Valérie Moens declined to comment. Both companies have indicated that Mondelēz would bear most costs of the CFTC case, and that the outcome would not be material to either's results. A lawyer for Dennis did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.The companies are defendants in both lawsuits because the alleged suspicious trades occurred before Kraft Foods Inc in 2012 split in two.Mondelēz now houses snack foods such as Oreos, Wheat Thins and Ritz crackers, while Kraft sells its namesake cheese products, Oscar Mayer deli meats and Maxwell House coffee.

In Thursday's complaint, Dennis raised similar claims, and accused Kraft and Mondelz of manipulating prices of cash wheat and wheat futures contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade from 2003 to January 2014, boosting revenue and trading profit.""While these illicit profits benefited defendants' bottom line, they caused harm to class members who transacted in CBOT wheat futures contracts at artificial prices,"" Dennis said. Kraft had no immediate comment. Mondelz spokeswoman Valérie Moens declined to comment. Both companies have indicated that Mondelz would bear most costs of the CFTC case, and that the outcome would not be material to either's results.A lawyer for Dennis did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. The companies are defendants in both lawsuits because the alleged suspicious trades occurred before Kraft Foods Inc in 2012 split in two.Mondelz now houses snack foods such as Oreos, Wheat Thins and Ritz crackers, while Kraft sells its namesake cheese products, Oscar Mayer deli meats and Maxwell House coffee.Last month, Kraft agreed to sell itself to H.J. Heinz Co, which is owned by Brazilian firm 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.The case is Dennis v.

83,"  (Adds ampersand to law firm name)By Mike KentzNEW YORK, April 13 (IFR) - Allegations of fraud and manipulative trading by Kraft Foods in derivatives markets are garnering attention beyond the fact that a household food and beverage-maker has been thrust into a regulatory doghouse normally reserved for the world's largest banks.The case could also affect the rest of the US corporate market as the CFTC seeks to expand the definition of manipulation in derivatives markets by using a new enforcement tool provided by Dodd-Frank regulations for the first time since the law's passage.""If Kraft is found guilty it will significantly expand the ability of the CFTC to prosecute firms transacting in large size in derivatives markets,"" said Robert Zwirb, former CFTC lawyer and consulting attorney at Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft. ""The CFTC's use of Rule 180.1 has yet to be tested, and with Kraft's apparent intention to litigate this matter, we may soon find out just how powerful a tool the provision will be.""CFTC Rule 180.1 allows the agency to allege and prosecute fraud and manipulation in derivatives markets without having to prove that the firm in question intended to be fraudulent or manipulative. The agency only has to prove the firm acted in a reckless manner.Kraft is being pursued for breaches of a number of rules, including 180.2 - a well-worn anti-manipulation provision - and others. But it is the first test of the new 180.1 rule that makes this case stand out.At issue in the case is a set of large orders placed by Kraft in the wheat futures market in November 2011 that were later stopped just prior to delivery. The firm bought US$93.5m of futures contracts set to deliver wheat in December, well over the firm's storage capacity of US$50m of wheat, which was 80% full at the time, according to the CFTC complaint.Kraft later stopped the order prior to delivery and bought wheat in the cash market. During that time, cash prices declined and the spread between December and March futures narrowed, netting the company a US$5.4m profit, according to the CFTC.The play could be construed as a basic arbitrage strategy - futures and cash prices were dislocated at the initiation of the strategy but upon convergence the firm adjusted its position in the interest of good business. But lawyers say the firm has some explaining to do based on the sheer size of the position. The futures order would have delivered 15m bushels of wheat and constituted 87% of open interest in the wheat futures market at one point.""Kraft has some difficult facts to contend with  in 35 years of practicing in this area, including at the CFTC, I have never seen a situation in which a trader held 87% of the open interest in the spot month contract,"" said one commodity derivatives lawyer. Kraft is yet to respond, so lawyers can only guess what the defense will be. Kraft and Mondelez International, a spin-off entity included in the complaint, have said in reports they plan to ""vigorously litigate this matter"".The Kraft case will be the first time use of the provision reaches court. The CFTC cited Rule 180.1 in its enforcement action against JPMorgan for its London Whale transgressions, but the bank settled out of court.The widened standard is a product of agency complaints that former enforcement standards around manipulation were too weak, since proving intent is a difficult standard to meet. ""In my opinion Kraft/Mondelez may be guilty of something, but I don't think the transgressions fit under the new provisions,"" said another former CFTC lawyer.CORPORATE THOUGHTS The finding in the case will be key for US corporates that use futures markets in large size for hedging product sales or feedstock purchases - as was the case for Kraft in connection with wheat.US corporates have fought against being roped into a proposed tightening of limits on the size of speculative positions a firm can take in commodity derivatives markets - another rule Kraft is alleged to have violated. As such, the case is likely to take on increasing importance for US corporates as they continue to deal with Dodd-Frank-driven changes to derivatives markets.""The case has implications for all end-users that hedge risks in futures markets because it underscores that the requirements of the commodities laws, and the need for strong compliance procedures, are not limited to the likes of banks and trading firms who we typically view as being regulated by the CFTC,"" said Melvin Brosterman, partner in the litigation practice at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.""If Kraft can be charged, so can any end-user.""A version of this story will appear in the April 11 edition of IFR Magazine.

84,"   By Carey Gillam  Kraft Foods Group Inc on Monday said it is revamping its family-friendly macaroni and cheese meal, removing synthetic colors and preservatives from the popular boxed dinner.The move comes at a time when Kraft is battling sluggish demand as consumers shift to brands that are perceived as healthier, including foods that are organic or less processed. The company has also been targeted by consumer advocacy groups. The groups have pressured Kraft to remove artificial food dyes from its products, complaining that the additives are not used, and in some cases, banned in other countries.Kraft spokeswoman Lynne Galia said the changes were being made to address concerns expressed by consumers, including demands for improved nutrition and ""simpler ingredients.""""We know parents want to feel good about the foods they eat and serve their families,"" Galia said in an emailed statement about the changes to its macaroni and cheese product. Galia said the changes will be effective by January 2016 for ""Original Kraft Macaroni & Cheese"" in the United States. The company is also removing synthetic colors by the end of 2016 in Canada for its Kraft Dinner Original.    In 2014, Kraft launched its Mac & Cheese Boxed Shapes with no synthetic colors, and in January of this year, the Northfield, Illinois-based company moved to no artificial preservatives for the Boxed Shapes product in the United States, the company said.Kraft also said it is replacing synthetic colors with those derived from natural sources, like paprika, annatto and turmeric. Heather White, executive director of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization for health and environmental issues, applauded Kraft's move and said it should be an example for other companies.""The announcement from Kraft should be a wake-up call for other food manufacturers to take notice, go back to the drawing board, reformulate and get rid of these synthetic ingredients of concern, especially in food that is marketed to children,"" White said. Kraft Foods is one of North America's largest consumer packaged food and beverage companies, with annual revenues of more than $18 billion. Its brands include Capri Sun, Jell-O, Kool-Aid, Lunchables, Maxwell House and Oscar Mayer.Kraft shares were up about 1 percent at $87.58 on Monday.

85,"   By Anjali Athavaley  Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, which is merging with ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co [HJHC.UL], on Tuesday reported profit that topped analyst estimates, driven by reduced advertising spending and overhead. But the company missed revenue expectations amid sluggish demand for its meals and desserts. Kraft, whose brands include Velveeta and Oscar Mayer, is struggling to grow as consumers shift to brands that are perceived as healthier, including foods that are organic or less processed.Shares fell 16 cents to $85.72 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. ""It may not matter to the stock, but the quarter wasn’t great,"" said JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman in a note. ""We did not see much ... that we think will send the shares higher tomorrow.""  Kraft's net income fell 16 percent to $429 million, or 72 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 28, from $513 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. When adjusted for items such as cost cuts and a loss related to the company's pension obligations and other retirement benefits, Kraft earned 86 cents a share.Revenue fell slightly to $4.35 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 81 cents and revenue of $4.43 billion.  Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, will combine with Kraft to create the third-largest North American food company, the companies said in late March.Both companies said at the time that the deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2015, would provide an opportunity to expand Kraft's brands overseas. Kraft says its brands are currently in 98 percent of North American households.  In the first quarter, the company said its cheese business, which rose 1.3 percent, benefited from price hikes in the past year and changes the company made to its Philadelphia brand soft cream cheese. Meanwhile, beverage sales were up 4.2 percent, helped by the launch of McCafe branded coffee that Kraft is selling in partnership with McDonald's Corp (MCD.N).

In the first quarter, Mondelez's operating margin and gross profit margin rose to 10.4 percent and 37.9 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier period.The company's shares were up 5 percent at $38.69 in midday trading.""The stock is indicating up, and we think this is the correct reaction,"" said JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman in a note. ""The company's plan to drive margin growth via supply chain and overhead savings seems to be on track."" Still, the company has grappled in recent quarters with volatility in some markets. Sales in Europe, where it raised prices to cover higher cocoa costs and faced weak demand, fell for the third straight quarter, down 16.4 percent to $2.98 billion.The company's sales in North America were weak, rising just 0.9 percent to $1.68 billion, as a result of a strategy by Wal-Mart Stores Inc to reduce in-store displays and give store managers more control over merchandise space. Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said on a conference call with investors that she expected ""the opportunity to revisit some of those decisions, and particularly in our categories, which are highly impulse driven.""Net income rose to $312 million, or 19 cents per share, from $150 million, or 9 cents per share. Excluding items, the company earned 41 cents per share, beating the average analyst forecast of 37 cents.Total revenue fell 10.2 percent to $7.76 billion in the three months ended March 31, the sharpest drop in six quarters. That still beat the average analyst estimate of $7.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Selling and general expenses fell 15 percent to $1.9 billion.Mondelez said it expected the strong dollar to reduce 2015 net revenue growth by about 12 percentage points and adjusted earnings by about 34 cents per share.The company previously said the effects of foreign exchange translation would reduce net revenue growth by about 11 percentage points and adjusted earnings by about 30 cents per share.

91,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) for Mondelez International, Inc. (Mondelez) at 'BBB' and removed it  from Rating Watch Negative.  Fitch has also affirmed the short-term IDR at 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Negative. A full list of ratings affirmed follows at the  end of this release. The removal from Rating Watch indicates Fitch's view that Mondelez's coffee  joint venture with D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (DEMB) to form Jacobs Douwe  Egberts (JDE) is likely to close in the next few months, subject to remaining  closing conditions. The deal has been approved by the European Commission,  conditional on Mondelez and DEMB selling certain brands in order to address  concerns about higher pricing. Fitch anticipates that the JDE JV will sell  Mondelez's Carte Noire business in the European Economic Area, so Mondelez's  total anticipated JV proceeds of approximately EUR4 billion (with a locked-in  dollar rate of $1.37 for a total value of $5.5 billion) will remain unchanged.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Potentially Heightened Leverage through 2016: The ratings affirmation factors in  Fitch's expectations that Mondelez is likely to operate at a gross leverage  (total debt-to-EBITDA) range around 3.4x to 3.5x through 2016 as the company  exits its coffee business, executes share repurchases, and incurs peak cash  restructuring charges. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 3.3x, EBITDA-to-interest expense  was 7.7x and FFO adjusted leverage was 4.9x for the latest 12 months ended March  31, 2015.   The Negative Outlook reflects the risk that Mondelez deploys most of the JV  proceeds towards share repurchases, which, combined with the potential that  operating improvement is lower than Fitch's expectations for about 100bps  adjusted operating margin improvement in 2015, could lead to leverage in the  high 3x range. Mondelez already completed $1.5 billion in debt-financed share  repurchases in the first quarter of 2015 (1Q15) which contributed to a $2  billion increase in debt to $18.7 billion from $16.7 billion at the end of 2014.  Fitch is currently contemplating approximately $4.5 billion to $5 billion in  total share buybacks in 2015 within its 3.4x-3.5x leverage projection.   While Fitch anticipates that Mondelez can achieve the bulk of its $1.5 billion  annualized cost savings targeted by 2018 which should help replace the coffee  EBITDA over time, savings are likely to be skewed to the outer years and may be  reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders. Cash restructuring costs  over this period are expected to total $2.5 billion. Fitch assumes around $1  billion cash restructuring costs in 2015 and $800 million in 2016.  Fitch  expects heightened cash costs combined with elevated capex (projected at $1.8  billion in 2015 and 5% of sales thereafter) to result in negative free cash flow  (FCF) in 2015 and modestly positive FCF in 2016.   Fitch estimates Mondelez's coffee business generates EBITDA of approximately  $600 million to $700 million annually based on margins in the high teens.  Mondelez will hold a 49% equity interest in JDE, which will be the world's  leading pure-play coffee company with annual revenues exceeding EUR5 billion  (USD5.7 billion). Per the Shareholders' Agreement JDE will distribute the  following dividends to Mondelez and Acorn Holdings B.V., parent of DEMB: At  least EUR175 million (pro-rated for the first year), at least EUR200 million for  the second year, at least EUR225 million for the third year and 40% of operating  profit thereafter.  Scale and Diverse Geographies: Mondelez's ratings incorporate its scale as one  of the largest global packaged food companies with approximately $30 billion pro  forma 2014 net revenue after $3.8 billion estimated revenue contribution to JDE.  The company is well balanced geographically with 38% of 2014 net revenue in  higher growth potential emerging markets and 62% in mature developed markets.  Mondelez has substantial scale with No. 1 global market share in biscuits,  chocolate and candy as well as No. 2 global share in gum. After the coffee  business moves to the JV, the company's revenue from snacks will increase from  75% to 84%, leaving the portfolio slightly better positioned.   Near-Term Top Line Weakness: Mondelez is experiencing a broad-based global  macroeconomic slowdown in its categories.  In 2014, the company's organic  (price/volume/mix) top line in core snacks was only 1.6% and total organic net  revenue growth was 2.4%. Global growth in snacks (biscuits, chocolate, gum and  candy) per Nielsen Global Data fell below 4% in 2014 from approximately 6% in  2011 and 2012. Fitch believes near-term total organic top line growth will be in  the low single digits, and reported top line currently has a significant  currency headwind in 2015 of roughly 12%. If Mondelez continues to lead on  higher pricing, volumes could be negatively impacted and put even more pressure  on organic growth. Over the long term, Mondelez targets organic net revenue  growth at or above industry category growth, and adjusted operating income  growth in the high single digits. Fitch estimates top line growth could be  slower than this through the intermediate term, or about 3% annually in Fitch's  base case, in 2016 onward.  Strong Liquidity: Mondelez's liquidity at March 31, 2015, includes $1.8 billion  cash and equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion five-year senior unsecured  revolving credit facility expiring in October 2018. Mondelez had $3.5 billion CP  borrowings at quarter end. Upcoming long-term debt maturities are significant  and include EUR400 million (almost $500 million) due in June 2015, as well as  $1.8 billion due in 2016 and $1.5 billion due in 2017. Fitch believes the  company is likely to refinance 2016 and 2017 maturities.     KEY ASSUMPTIONS --2015 organic top line grows about 1.5%, which reflects about a 1% reduction  due to strategic decisions to improve revenue mix and exit low-margin  businesses; reported top line heavily affected by negative currency impact  currently estimated at about 12%; This year (2015) excludes a half year of the  coffee business, or about $1.9 billion revenue; top line organic growth of 2% to  3% thereafter.   --2015 EBITDA excludes a half year of coffee business, or about $325 million. --Total share buybacks of $4.5 billion to $5 billion in 2015.  --Cash restructuring charges of $1 billion in 2015 and $800 million in 2016.  --Capex at $1.8 billion in 2015 and 5% of revenue thereafter. --FCF negative in 2015 and modestly positive in 2016. --Total year-end debt estimated at $17 billion in 2015 and $18 billion in 2016.  --Total debt-to-EBITDA in the 3.4x to 3.5x range in 2015 and 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: -- If EBITDA tracks below expectation  due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or further deceleration in organic top line growth, or  financial policies are aggressive, such as not reducing debt materially from  $18.7 billion at March 31, 2015 after receiving proceeds from the coffee JV, or  the company engages in a large debt-financed acquisition, such that leverage is  likely to be consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: -- The Outlook is likely to be revised to Stable if Mondelez sustains organic  growth in the low single-digit range; makes substantial progress toward its  stated margin improvement which would take EBITDA to or above 2014 levels (with  coffee) of $5.6 billion and EBITDA margin in the 19% to 20% range, with the  company comfortably maintaining leverage in the 3.0-3.5x range by balancing  shareholder and debtholder interests.   --Over the long term, leverage consistently in the mid- to high-2x range and FCF  above $1 billion annually could support a positive rating action; however, this  is not anticipated in the near- to intermediate-term.   Fitch affirms Mondelez's ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Credit facility at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.  Contact: Primary Analyst Judi M. Rossetti, CPA/CFA  Senior Director +1-312-368-2077  Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

92,"  NEW YORK, June 1 Scott Amoye, who ran Mondelez International Inc's cocoa business for five years, has joined Ecom in London, where the Switzerland-based commodity trader houses its cocoa and sugar trading operations, a spokesman confirmed to Reuters on Monday.Amoye left Mondelez, one of the world's largest chocolate companies and the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, at the end of February, and joined Ecom Agrotrade Ltd as global trading director on April 7.The move comes a year after Ecom, the 160-year-old family-owned commodity merchant, scooped up the loss-making physical trading arm of Armajaro Trading Ltd, expanding its footprint in the global high-risk coffee and cocoa markets. Ecom says it is one of the world's top five cocoa merchants and says it handles 250,000 tonnes of cocoa in 2011, or roughly 6 percent of total world production of 4.2 million tonnes in the 2010/11 crop year, according to data from the World Cocoa Foundation. Amoye declined to comment and the spokesman did not immediately provide additional details on his responsibilities at Ecom. The move comes as competition among merchants and bean processors is intensifying after a series of deal making.

95,"   By Francesca Landini | MILAN, June 12  MILAN, June 12 Italy's Lavazza has reached agreement to buy a Danish coffee brand from D.E. Master Blenders, the Dutch group which is seeking to comply with conditions set by the European competition authorities for approving its merger with Mondelez's coffee business.For the merger to be cleared Mondelez must also sell French brand Carte Noire. Lavazza in April said it was in contention to buy Carte Noire. It declined to say whether that was still the case after the Danish acquisition ""Lavazza has agreed in terms with D.E. Master Blenders 1753 BV to meet the conditions of the European Commission regarding divestment of the Merrild brand,"" the Italian coffee group said on Friday in a statement sent to Reuters.Closing of the deal is subject to the Commission's approval, it said. Lavazza did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Denmark's Merrild, which generates more than 90 percent of its revenues through its roast and ground businesses, recorded net sales of around 35 million euros ($39 million) last year.Last month, the EC approved the merger of Mondelez's coffee business with D.E.

96,"   By Laura Benitez  LONDON, June 19 (IFR) - HJ Heinz and Kraft Foods could be forced to rethink the currency composition of a jumbo bond financing as a combination of time pressure, rates and Greek volatility narrows its options.The companies, which will be rebranded Kraft Heinz Foods Company once they complete a US$46bn merger in early July, conclude European investor meetings on Monday June 22 for a potential US$11bn bond financing.However, plans to access a wide range of currencies from euros to sterling could be scuppered if the market backdrop - which has deteriorated over the last week as a result of the Greek deadlock - does not improve.""Kraft Heinz will happen next week; the question mark is on the composition of the currency mix,"" said a source familiar with the deal.""The dollar market is in great shape and they could do the whole lot there although if there is some stability, the company will want to have some debt in euros and sterling given that it is global. They will use flexibility to their advantage.""Cheese giant Kraft and ketchup maker Heinz have only weeks before they seal the merger.While the US market looks to be restarting, after a US$5bn six-tranche benchmark for new pharma spin-off Baxalta attracted a book of around US$20bn this week, Europe only saw a 1.1bn dual-tranche investment grade corporate deal price. According to the investor presentation, the companies are planning to refinance the majority of the existing Heinz secured high yield debt and replace Kraft's June 2015 maturities with new investment grade debt before the deal closes.Kraft Heinz is expected to be rated Baa3/BBB- by Moody's/S&P.Barclays and JP Morgan are global coordinators for the investor meetings. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also involved in the European meetings, and Citigroup and Wells Fargo in the US part.TRICKY EURO CROWD  Torrid European market conditions have stalled potential new supply from around 20 corporate borrowers in recent weeks, and issuers have either had to accept the chunky premiums required or choose to wait it out until the summer-end.""There's a lot of planes circling the runway, but everyone is holding off because they don't want to be the ones paying a 30bp concession,"" one European DCM official said.Only Gecina and Archer Daniels-Midlands have braved the euro market in the last two weeks, paying concessions of around 25bp and 30bp respectively. ""Someone needs to get it going again and maybe Kraft could be the one, especially as it's a bigger deal. If they do this well it could be the deal to kick-start the market,"" the DCM official said.However, not all investors are sold on the prospect of new Kraft Heinz debt.""They are replacing senior secured notes with unsecured notes on the back of a credit watch for possible downgrade, and an increase in overall debt levels. But no doubt the market will focus on the impressive underlying cash flow and less on the deal structure,"" one hedge fund manager said.Meanwhile, investors hope that the build-up of cash in the coming months will get put to work.""There are around 170bn of bonds, based on the Barclays European Corporate bond market index, that should mature this year,"" Andreas Michalitsianos, portfolio manager for JPM Sterling Corporate Bond Fund said.However, supply has been historically high this year in the corporate market, and inflows from retail funds in particular have turned to outflows, investors say.""It will take some stability in the markets for participants to want to put their cash to work given a fear of further volatility and the risk that retail outflows will accelerate.

97,"  * Thorntons board to back 112 mln stg Ferrero offer* Ferrero to examine cost savings once deal completed* Thorntons shares jump over 40 percent to bid price   (Adds analysts, details, background, shares)By Esha Vaish and Giancarlo NavachJune 22 The Italian firm behind Ferrero Rocher chocolates and Nutella spread has agreed to buy British chocolate retailer Thorntons for 112 million pounds ($177 million), striking a rare deal to expand in Europe's biggest confectionery market.The deal is the first by family-owned Ferrero International since the death earlier this year of patriarch Michele Ferrero, who was Italy's wealthiest man and largely shied away from acquisitions as he built up a business that also spans Kinder Surprise eggs and Tic Tac mints.Ferrero said on Monday it would pay 145 pence a share in cash for the 104-year-old Thorntons, a 43 percent premium to the British firm's closing stock price on Friday. Thorntons' management said it backed the deal. Thorntons has been hit in recent years by the rise of newer and upmarket brands such as Green & Black's and Hotel Chocolate. It has had some success by shifting to sell more of its chocolates through third parties while closing some of its own stores, but after a profit warning in December its chief executive of four years, Jonathan Hart, is stepping down.""It's good timing,"" said N+1 Singer Capital Markets analyst Matthew McEachran of Ferrero's offer, adding it appeared to be pitched at a fair value for shareholders.Thorntons shares, which had lost around 40 percent since March 2014, jumped to touch the offer price. Analysts said Thorntons was a good fit for Ferrero, which has strong, premium brands but no retail platform to showcase them.""The Thorntons store network will provide the company the opportunity to add a more directly experiential approach to its strategy,"" said Euromonitor International's Lamine Lahouasnia. ""If all goes well with absorption of Thorntons stores in the UK, we could see similar happenings around the world in years to come.""According to Euromonitor, Britain is the world's third-biggest confectionery market behind China and industry leader, the United States. Ferrero, which traces its roots back almost 60 years, said it would review Thorntons to identify potential cost savings, but ruled out closing the British firm's Alfreton factory in central England. It will also keep the Thorntons brand.The death of its patriarch had sparked speculation Ferrero might be a takeover target for rivals such as Mars, Mondelez International, Nestle or Hershey.Michele Ferrero had stayed out of the dealmaking that has gripped the consumer goods industry in recent years.He vetoed the idea of a bid for Cadbury in 2009, another British chocolate maker which was ultimately taken over by Mondelez, according to sources familiar with the company. His only acquisition was a Turkish hazelnut factory in 2014, aimed at securing supply of the ingredient precious to his Nutella.Ferrero said it owned, or had agreements to own, 34 percent of Thorntons after buying stakes from top shareholder Crystal Amber and from others.($1 = 0.6292 pounds)   (Writing by Kate Holton; Additional reporting by Martinne Geller and Agnieszka Flak; Editing by Mark Potter)",2015-06-22,MDLZ,"Mon Jun 22, 2015 | 8:42am EDT",UPDATE 2-Ferrero to buy UK chocolate maker Thorntons for $178 mln,http://www.reuters.com//article/thorntons-ma-ferrero-idUSL3N0Z82E120150622?type=companyNews

The S&P 500 has bounced about 2 percent higher in the past two days following a near-3 percent drop over the preceding week that had been caused in part by a rout in China's stock markets.At 13:15 p.m. ET (1715 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 3.37 points, or 0.02 percent, at 17,754.76, the S&P 500 was down 0.09 points, or -0 percent, at 2,108.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 19.57 points, or 0.38 percent, at 5,131.31.

109,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lauren Hirsch | BOSTON/NEW YORK  BOSTON/NEW YORK Billionaire investor William Ackman's success at Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) may depend largely on a calculation that nimbler rival Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) will soon snap up the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, sources familiar with Ackman's approach said.Ackman's $20 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed late Wednesday it spent $5.5 billion for a 7.5 percent stake in snack company Mondelez, making this the firm's biggest-ever bet.It is the second time around for the activist investor and Mondelez. Pershing Square briefly owned the company in 2013 after its split from Kraft in 2012. Investors and analysts agree there are several routes to higher returns.Costs could be cut further or the board may want to find a new chief executive to replace Irene Rosenfeld, 62.But the most likely path could be a scenario where Kraft Heinz, created earlier this year, reunites with its former unit, the sources familiar with matter said. The foods sector has already seen a raft of takeovers but a bid for Mondelez, with a market capitalization of $74.6 billion, could be another megadeal in the space.Analysts and investors familiar with Ackman's approach agree that the hedge fund mogul may have his sights on a merger strategy and Wall Street has been rife with speculation that Kraft Heinz would be a logical choice. But analysts also note there is work to be done integrating Kraft and Heinz still and that Kraft Heinz would be preoccupied for now. Mondelez's shares - which initially jumped on news that Ackman's Pershing Square Capital would become the company's biggest shareholder - closed up just over 1 percent on Thursday at $46.81 amid doubts about whether a buyer could be found.  ""We do not think a possible KHC/MDLZ merger is out of the question entirely, especially a couple of years from now,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. ""But near term we have questions about such a deal."" While Ackman prides himself on being a long-term investor who has been called patient, some people have said there are signs that he might be pushing for a quicker pace on making changes with this investment.Kraft Heinz and Mondelez were once the same company and already know each other well, suggesting that due diligence for a possible acquisition may not take as long. Plus interest rates are still low, meaning that a suitor could finance a takeover more cheaply now than later when the Federal Reserve prepares for a hike probably later this year. It would also mean that Mondelez' stock price might still be lower, making for a cheaper bid, than two years down the line when the price would presumably be higher.Much of the speculation of who may put in a bid for Mondelez revolves around 3G Capital, the Brazilian private investment group that teamed up with Warren Buffett to create Kraft Heinz. Ackman has worked with 3G on a deal to take Burger King public and Buffett, the octogenarian investor, has suggested that he wants to do a few more deals during his career.This might suggest there is an opportunity to join forces sooner rather than later, the sources said.

Investors and analysts agree there are several routes to higher returns.Costs could be cut further or the board may want to find a new chief executive to replace Irene Rosenfeld, 62.But the most likely path could be a scenario where Kraft Heinz, created earlier this year, reunites with its former unit, the sources familiar with matter said. The foods sector has already seen a raft of takeovers but a bid for Mondelez, with a market capitalization of $74.6 billion, could be another megadeal in the space.Analysts and investors familiar with Ackman's approach agree that the hedge fund mogul may have his sights on a merger strategy and Wall Street has been rife with speculation that Kraft Heinz would be a logical choice. But analysts also note there is work to be done integrating Kraft and Heinz still and that Kraft Heinz would be preoccupied for now.Mondelez's shares - which initially jumped on news that Ackman's Pershing Square Capital would become the company's biggest shareholder - closed up just over 1 percent on Thursday at $46.81 amid doubts about whether a buyer could be found. ""We do not think a possible KHC/MDLZ merger is out of the question entirely, especially a couple of years from now,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a research note. ""But near term we have questions about such a deal.""While Ackman prides himself on being a long-term investor who has been called patient, some people have said there are signs that he might be pushing for a quicker pace on making changes with this investment. Kraft Heinz and Mondelez were once the same company and already know each other well, suggesting that due diligence for a possible acquisition may not take as long.Plus interest rates are still low, meaning that a suitor could finance a takeover more cheaply now than later when the Federal Reserve prepares for a hike probably later this year. It would also mean that Mondelez' stock price might still be lower, making for a cheaper bid, than two years down the line when the price would presumably be higher.Much of the speculation of who may put in a bid for Mondelez revolves around 3G Capital, the Brazilian private investment group that teamed up with Warren Buffett to create Kraft Heinz. Ackman has worked with 3G on a deal to take Burger King public and Buffett, the octogenarian investor, has suggested that he wants to do a few more deals during his career.This might suggest there is an opportunity to join forces sooner rather than later, the sources said.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lauren Hirsch; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Lisa Shumaker)",2015-08-07,MDLZ,"Thu Aug 6, 2015 | 9:32pm EDT",Billionaire Ackman eyeing Mondelez reunion with Kraft -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/mondelez-intl-sale-idUSL1N10H42620150807?type=companyNews

Heinz with Kraft Foods.Of the total job cuts, 700 will be in Kraft Heinz's Northfield, Illnois headquarters, spokesman Michael Mullen in an emailed statement to Reuters. Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, combined with Kraft earlier this year to create the third-largest North American food company.  The combined company expects to save about $1.5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017.

112,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Snack maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) will spend more on advertising its brands, increase healthier offerings and expand its e-commerce business to boost sales as consumers eat less processed food, an executive overseeing the company's growth strategy said. Mark Clouse, Mondelez's chief growth officer, said in an interview that the company plans to increase its advertising spending to 10 percent of revenue by 2018, up from 8 percent last year. The maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Triscuit crackers also aims for its e-commerce business to grow to $1 billion in 2020 from $100 million today. Additionally, Clouse said that in the next five years, Mondelez hopes to generate half of its revenue from snacks perceived as healthier, up from a third currently. This includes individually wrapped snacks that are 200 calories or less and products that have nutritional attributes, such as fewer ingredients and no artificial flavors. ""If you look at where consumers are going, we have to better position the portfolio to fully unlock the potential for growth,"" Clouse said.Since it became a stand-alone company in 2012, Mondelez has mostly focused on improving its profit margins through reducing its expenses. The company is in the midst of a plan to cut about $3 billion in costs by the end of 2018 through measures such as opening more efficient manufacturing plants and zero-based budgeting, which requires expenses to be justified for each new period.Until now, it hasn't given many details on how it plans to invest those savings to achieve higher sales growth. Clouse said the approach involves changing existing products to suit consumer needs and moving into new markets and categories that offer growth potential. In February, Mondelez said it was buying Enjoy Life Foods, the maker of allergen free snacks, for an undisclosed amount.  The efforts come at a time when packaged food companies, faced with sluggish growth, are increasingly under pressure from investors to change their offerings and slash costs.In August, billionaire investor William Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed that it spent $5.5 billion for a 7.5 percent stake in Mondelez in what was seen by Wall Street as an attempt to push the company to increase its margins further or potentially sell itself. Investors and analysts have speculated that the company could combine with Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O). Kraft and Mondelez used to be the same company until their split in 2012. Last March, Kraft said it was merging with ketchup-maker H.J. Heinz Co in a deal backed by 3G Capital, a Brazilian private equity firm known for cutting costs. Clouse said of 3G's abilities that ""there's no doubt that those are our fundamental capabilities and skill sets that are really important in today's world.""He added, ""The key is, can you bring the same operational discipline and clarity to a growth agenda that allows you to sustain it over time. I think that's really what we're shooting for.""

AB InBev's were up 6.4 percent. Rivals Heineken, Carlsberg and Diageo also rose on speculation SAB might seek another merger as a defence strategy, as it did last year when it offered to buy Heineken, but was rebuffed.Since then it has combined its African soft drink bottler with that of Coca-Cola, and in recent weeks there has been speculation about it combining with Diageo or Australian drinks firm Coca-Cola Amatil.

Heineken is the No. 3.ROOM FOR FUNDING AB InBev's target for its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio is 2 times, from around 2.5 currently. It is likely to reach that by 2016, the earliest any deal could realistically be completed, and so has room to borrow to fund any takeover.When it bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion, the largest cash takeover in history at the time, it let the ratio rise to beyond 5 times. Going that high again might allow it to raise as much as $100 billion in debt.AB InBev's controlling families own just over half of the company, while SABMiller's two top shareholders are cigarette maker Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. Altria on Wednesday declined comment on the AB InBev approach, but on Sept. 9, its CFO Billy Gifford said at an analyst conference that it regularly evaluates its SABMiller investment ""and at this time we believe maintaining the asset is in our shareholders' best interests.""The Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached for comment.Neil Dwane, European chief investment officer, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, said AB InBev had faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.""ABI is paying a high price but accretion to earnings from low debt costs would be something in the region of 15 percent.

118,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Mondelez International, Inc.'s (Mondelez) issuance of CHF400 million in senior  unsecured fixed-rate notes in two tranches: a 98.5- month  CHF265 million note  with a 1.125% coupon maturing on Dec. 21, 2023, and a 60-month CHF135 million  note with a 0.625% coupon maturing on Oct. 6, 2020. Closing is expected in  October and proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including  refinancing upcoming maturities.  The notes will not be registered with the SEC; instead, they will be registered  for sale only in Switzerland and may be redeemed early at par and in full if  changes in tax laws or regulations result in additional payments such as  withholdings, duties or assessments. The customary change of control provision  at 101% of face value is in place. The Outlook is Negative.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Potentially Heightened Leverage through 2016: The affirmation factors in Fitch's  expectations that Mondelez is likely to operate at a gross leverage (total  debt-to-EBITDA) range around 3.4x to 3.5x through 2016 as the company exits its  coffee business, executes share repurchases, and incurs peak cash restructuring  charges. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 3.4x, EBITDA-to-interest expense was 8.7x and  FFO adjusted leverage was 5x for the latest 12 months ended June 30, 2015.  The Negative Outlook reflects the risk that heavy restructuring related cash  payments combined with share repurchases partially funded by debt could lead to  leverage in the high 3x range. Mondelez already completed more than $2.1 billion  in share repurchases in the first half of 2015 which contributed to a $2.6  billion increase in debt to $19.3 billion from $16.7 billion at the end of 2014.  While Fitch anticipates that Mondelez can achieve the bulk of its $1.5 billion  annualized cost savings targeted by 2018, which should help replace the coffee  EBITDA over time, savings are likely to be skewed to the outer years and may be  reinvested in the business or returned to shareholders. Cash restructuring costs  over this period are expected to total $2.5 billion. Fitch assumes around $1  billion cash restructuring costs in 2015 and $800 million in 2016. Fitch expects  heightened cash costs combined with elevated capex (projected at $1.8 billion in  2015 and 5% of sales thereafter) to result in negative free cash flow (FCF) in  2015 and modestly positive FCF in 2016.  Mondelez's coffee business, which is now reported on the balance sheet as assets  held for sale, generates EBITDA of approximately $600 million to $700 million  annually with margins in the high teens. Mondelez will hold a 43.5% equity  interest in JDE, which will be the world's leading pure-play coffee company,  with annual revenues exceeding EUR5 billion (USD5.7 billion). Per the  Shareholders' Agreement JDE will distribute the following dividends to Mondelez  and Acorn Holdings B.V., parent of DEMB: At least EUR175 million (pro-rated for  the first year), at least EUR200 million for the second year, at least EUR225  million for the third year, and 40% of operating profit thereafter.  Scale and Diverse Geographies: Mondelez's ratings incorporate its scale as one  of the largest global packaged food companies with approximately $30 billion pro  forma 2014 net revenue after $3.8 billion estimated revenue contribution to JDE.  The company is well-balanced geographically with 38% of 2014 net revenue in  higher-growth-potential emerging markets and 62% in mature developed markets.  Mondelez has substantial scale with No. 1 global market share in biscuits,  chocolate and candy as well as No. 2 global share in gum. After the coffee  business moves to the JV, the company's revenue from snacks will increase from  75% to 84%, leaving the portfolio slightly better positioned.  Near-Term Top-Line Weakness: Mondelez is experiencing a broad-based global  macroeconomic slowdown in its categories which is exacerbated by the currency  effects of a strong dollar. In 2014, the company's organic (price/volume/mix)  top line in core snacks was only 1.6% and total organic net revenue growth was  2.4%. Global growth in snacks (biscuits, chocolate, gum and candy) per Nielsen  Global Data fell below 4% in 2014 from approximately 6% in 2011 and 2012. Fitch  believes near-term total organic top-line growth will be in the low single  digits, and reported top line currently has a significant currency headwind in  2015 of roughly 12%. If Mondelez continues to lead on higher pricing, volumes  could be negatively impacted and put even more pressure on organic growth. Over  the long term, Mondelez targets organic net revenue growth at or above industry  category growth, and adjusted operating income growth in the high single digits.  Fitch estimates top-line growth could be slower than this through the  intermediate term, or about 3% annually in Fitch's base case, in 2016 onward.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --2015 organic top line grows about 1.5%, which reflects about a 1% reduction  due to strategic decisions to improve revenue mix and exit low-margin  businesses; reported top line heavily affected by negative currency impact  currently estimated at about 12%. This year (2015) excludes a half year of the  coffee business, or about $1.9 billion revenue; top-line organic growth of 2% to  3% thereafter.  --2015 EBITDA excludes a half year of coffee business, or about $325 million. --Cash restructuring charges of $1 billion in 2015 and $800 million in 2016.  --Capex at $1.8 billion in 2015 and 5% of revenue thereafter. --FCF negative in 2015 and modestly positive in 2016. --Total year-end debt estimated at $17 billion in 2015 and $18 billion in 2016.  --Total debt-to-EBITDA in the 3.4x to 3.5x range in 2015 and 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: -- If EBITDA tracks below expectation due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or further deceleration in organic top-line growth, or  financial policies are aggressive, such as not reducing debt materially from  $19.3 billion at June 30, 2015 after receiving proceeds from the coffee JV, or  the company engages in a large debt-financed acquisition, such that leverage is  likely to be consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --The Outlook is likely to be revised to Stable if Mondelez sustains organic  growth in the low single-digit range; makes substantial progress toward its  stated margin improvement which would take EBITDA to or above 2014 levels (with  coffee) of $5.6 billion and EBITDA margin in the 19% to 20% range, with the  company comfortably maintaining leverage in the 3.0-3.5x range by balancing  shareholder and debtholder interests.  --Over the long term, leverage consistently in the mid- to high-2x range and FCF  above $1 billion annually could support a positive rating action; however, this  is not anticipated in the near- to intermediate-term. LIQUIDITY Mondelez's liquidity at June 30, 2015, includes almost $2 billion in cash and  equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving  credit facility expiring in October 2018. Mondelez had $3.1 billion commercial  paper borrowings at quarter end. Upcoming long-term debt maturities are  significant with $1.8 billion due in 2016 and $1.5 billion due in 2017. Fitch  believes the company is likely to refinance 2016 and 2017 maturities and today's  actions at very low CHF rates are within expectations.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has the following ratings on Mondelez: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Credit facility at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

119,"   By Martinne Geller and Lauren Hirsch | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) is exploring a sale of its European cheese and grocery business, which could be valued at around $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, as it sharpens its focus on snack foods and refreshments. Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to seek buyers for the assets, the people said, cautioning that the divestment was not certain.The assets could appeal to companies such as Kraft Heinz, as well as private equity firms, the people added, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Kraft Heinz has right of first refusal for the assets as a result of its spinning off of Mondelez in 2012. Mondelez, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Kraft Heinz declined to comment. Mondelez has separated its European cheese and grocery business from its coffee business, which was combined last year with that owned by D.E Master Blenders 1753. The European cheese and grocery operations brought in net revenues of $1.44 billion in 2014, according to Mondelez's latest annual report. In August, William Ackman revealed his activist hedge fund Pershing Square had built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in Mondelez International, in what is seen as an attempt to push the company to boost earnings or sell itself.Ackman joined fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez, which reported its seventh straight drop in quarterly revenue on July 30. Largely at Peltz's urging, Mondelez is in the midst of a plan to cut about $3.5 billion in costs by the end of 2018 and has set a target of an adjusted operating margin of 15 percent to 16 percent in 2016.Mondelez has taken several measures to cut costs, including shutting factories and ""zero-based budgeting,"" which requires managers to justify every expense in each new budgeting period.

131,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Mondelez International, Inc.'s (Mondelez) issuance of EUR700 million 1.625%  senior unsecured notes due 2023. Proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes, including refinancing a $1.75 billion 4.125% note due on Feb. 9, 2016.  The customary change of control provision at 101% of face value is in place. The  Rating Outlook is Negative. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations for pressure on free cash  flow (FCF) in the near term from heavy restructuring-related cash payments,  particularly in 2016, and low core growth as reflected in negative volumes and  lower-than-category growth rates in biscuits and chocolate year to date.  Biscuits and chocolate represent approximately 70% of Mondelez's post-coffee  profile. The company reported that volume trends have recently begun to improve.  Near-Term Top-Line Weakness: Mondelez is experiencing a broad-based global  macroeconomic slowdown in its categories exacerbated by the currency effects of  a strong dollar. Organic revenue growth has been in the 2% - 4% range over the  past three years. It rose to the top end in 2015 as the company took higher than  expected levels of pricing of around 6% - 7% with negative volume in the 2% - 3%  range as consumers reacted to sticker shock in weak emerging markets. FX had a  large negative impact on the top line, as with all multinational companies, with  -13% expected this year. High Medium-Term Leverage  Fitch expects that Mondelez will likely operate with gross leverage (total  debt-to-EBITDA) of around 3.4x to 3.5x through 2016 as it executes share  repurchases, and incurs peak cash restructuring charges. Total reported LTM  debt-to-EBITDA was 3x at the end of third quarter 2015 but that includes the  operating income of the more profitable coffee operations over the past several  quarters. The coffee operations were contributed to a new joint venture (Jacobs  Douwe Egberts; JDE) on July 2, 2015.  High Cash Outlays/Negative FCF in 2016 In 2014 the company announced a $3.5 billion restructuring program to be  executed from 2014 through 2018 with $2.5 billion in cash costs. The purpose is  to reduce supply chain and overhead costs by $1.5 billion by the end of 2018.  Fitch anticipates that Mondelez can achieve the bulk of its $1.5 billion in  annualized cost savings targeted by 2018, which should offset the loss of $600  million to $700 million in coffee EBITDA over time; however, savings are likely  to be skewed to the outer years.  The majority of program charges were expected to occur in 2015 and 2016 with  completion by year-end 2018. In addition, as with most restructurings there are  other implementation costs which are directly attributable to those programs but  do not qualify for special accounting treatment which can be meaningful. Since  inception the company has incurred $1 billion in charges including $710 million  in restructuring charges and $290 million in implementation expenses.  Fitch had previously assumed around $1 billion in cash restructuring costs in  2015 and $800 million in 2016 which would result in modest negative FCF in 2015  and modestly positive FCF in 2016. Year to date, cash paid towards the 2014 -  2018 program is $156 million. Given the current trajectory it appears that the  bulk of cash outlays related to the 2014 - 2018 program will occur in 2016.  Mondelez generates a significant portion of FCF in the fourth quarter, and with  muted spends thus far, FCF should be positive this year but moderately negative  in 2016.  Scale and Diverse Geographies: Mondelez's ratings incorporate its scale as one  of the largest global packaged food companies with approximately $30 billion pro  forma 2015 net revenue after $3.8 billion estimated revenue contribution to JDE.  The company is well-balanced geographically with 39% of 2014 net revenue in  higher-growth-potential emerging markets and 61% in mature developed markets.  Mondelez has substantial scale with No. 1 global market share in biscuits,  chocolate and candy as well as No. 2 global share in gum. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --2015 organic top line grows about 3% up from Fitch's expectations of 1.5%  earlier in the year. Higher than expected pricing has boosted organic growth to  the 3% range YTD. Growth rates of 2% to 3% are expected thereafter. --Capex at $1.7 billion for 2015 and 5% of revenue in the medium term. --FCF positive in 2015 and moderately negative in 2016 with higher cash  restructuring next year than originally anticipated. --Total debt-to-EBITDA in the 3.4x to 3.5x range in 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --EBITDA tracks below expectation due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or further deceleration in organic top-line growth,  aggressive financial policies or engaging in a large debt-financed acquisition,  such that leverage is likely to be consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --The Outlook is likely to be revised to Stable if Mondelez sustains organic  growth, including flat-to-positive volumes in the low single-digit range; makes  substantial progress toward its stated margin improvement which would take  EBITDA to or above 2014 levels (with coffee) of $5.6 billion and EBITDA margin  in the 19% to 20% range (relative to LTM EBITDA margin of 17.8%), with the  company comfortably maintaining leverage in the 3.0x - 3.5x range by balancing  shareholder and debtholder interests.  --Over the long term, leverage consistently in the mid- to high-2x range and FCF  above $1 billion annually could support a positive rating action; however, this  is not anticipated in the near- to intermediate-term. LIQUIDITY Mondelez's liquidity at Sept. 30, 2015, includes more than $2 billion in cash  and equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit  facility expiring in October 2018. Mondelez had $1.3 billion in commercial paper  outstanding at quarter end. Upcoming long-term debt maturities are significant  with $1.8 billion due in 2016 and $1.5 billion due in 2017. Fitch believes the  company is likely to refinance 2016 and 2017 maturities and that today's actions  at very low EUR rates are within expectations.  Fitch currently rates Mondelez as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB'; --Credit facility 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

138,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) forecast 2016 revenue growth below analysts' expectations, raising concerns about the company's ability to reverse a two-year slide in sales in a tough economic environment. The company's shares fell as much as 9 percent on Wednesday after Mondelez also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hurt by a strong dollar and weak demand in Europe, its biggest market.Mondelez, which makes Cadbury and Milka chocolates, is struggling due to a shift in consumer taste to less processed foods that has prompted retailers to provide less shelf space for its sugary snacks. The company has also been battling a strong dollar by raising prices in markets such as Europe and Latin America, but this has taken a toll on volumes. Sales in Europe fell 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, after stripping off the impact of certain items such as divestitures and integration costs.While Mondelez raised prices by 0.2 percent in the region, volumes fell 1.3 percent.  Mondelez does not expect the overall impact of pricing on volume to be as significant this year as it was in 2015, Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld said on a post-earnings call. But the outlook for the year indicates for ""somewhat less volume growth than what the Street had expected,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said.Mondelez forecast 2016 organic revenue to grow by at least 2 percent - the slowest growth since the company was separated from Kraft Foods Inc in 2012.          Analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group called the forecast ""disappointing"", adding that they see little chances for the stock to outperform given worsening macro-economic conditions this year. The brokerage said it expected sales to rise 4 percent. Revenue fell 16.6 percent to $7.36 billion in the latest quarter, due partly to the sale of its coffee business.The company reported a loss of $729 million, or 46 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with net income of $500 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. Mondelez took a charge of $778 million, or 48 cents per share, due to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan operations.Excluding items, the company earned 46 cents per share.

146,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan  Warren Buffett on Saturday used his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders to launch vigorous defenses of an aggressive private equity partner and a maligned mobile home unit, as his conglomerate recorded robust profits.The world's third-richest person and a revered investor, Buffett also injected himself into the contentious 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, lambasting candidates who talk down the nation's economic future as ""dead wrong"" - an apparent jab at Republicans and frontrunner Donald Trump.Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, also raised a political issue dear to Democrats in his widely-read letter by calling climate change a ""major problem for the planet,"" although not one for Berkshire's future. Buffett, 85, also made no mention of who might succeed him at Berkshire, which he has run for a half-century, and in passing said he expects to be around at age 100.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion.Fourth quarter profit was up 32 percent, and operating profit rose a larger-than-expected 18 percent.Berkshire owns roughly 90 businesses in areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.

147,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan  Warren Buffett on Saturday used his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders to launch vigorous defenses of an aggressive private equity partner and a maligned mobile home unit, as his conglomerate recorded robust profits.The world's third-richest person and a revered investor, Buffett also injected himself into the contentious 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, lambasting candidates who talk down the nation's economic future as ""dead wrong"" - an apparent jab at Republicans and frontrunner Donald Trump.Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, also raised a political issue dear to Democrats in his widely-read letter by calling climate change a ""major problem for the planet,"" although not one for Berkshire's future. Buffett, 85, also made no mention of who might succeed him at Berkshire, which he has run for a half-century, and in passing said he expects to be around at age 100.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion.Fourth quarter profit was up 32 percent, and operating profit rose a larger-than-expected 18 percent.Berkshire owns roughly 90 businesses in areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.

148,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan  Feb 27 Warren Buffett on Saturday launched vigorous defenses of a private equity firm and a mobile home unit that critics say employ controversial business practices antithetical to Buffett's own at Berkshire Hathaway Inc .In his widely-read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he would do more deals with 3G Capital, a Brazilian firm with which Berkshire owns a majority of Kraft Heinz Co , but which, unlike Berkshire, is known as a ruthless cost-cutter.Buffett also devoted more than 1,200 words in his roughly 18,000-word letter to defending Berkshire's Clayton Homes unit,  after articles in the Seattle Times accused the nation's largest mobile home builder of predatory lending and exploiting black and Latino borrowers.Berkshire reported a record full-year profit of $24.08 billion, up 21 percent from a year earlier, while operating profit rose 5 percent to a record $17.36 billion.In the fourth quarter, profit rose 32 percent to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share. Operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, topping the average analyst forecast of $2,814 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Buffett, 85, has in nearly 51 years running Berkshire transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate.His work has also made him an investing legend and the world's third-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.But his tie-up with 3G, led by the Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, has attracted criticism. Last year, at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, many shareholders wanted to know if Berkshire's business principles were compatible with 3G, which has made its name as an aggressive cost-cutter that appoints its own executives and eliminates thousands of jobs at the companies it acquires.Berkshire and 3G in 2013 bought the former H.J. Heinz, and two years later merged it with the former Kraft Foods. Buffett has also helped finance 3G's merger of Burger King with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons.In his letter, Buffett acknowledged that while he and 3G ""follow different paths"" toward buying and running businesses, 3G's method has been ""extraordinarily successful"", and that more deals are possible. ""Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners,"" Buffett wrote. ""We share with them a passion to buy, build and hold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires.""Buffett also praised Clayton, saying that it made home ownership possible for many even during the financial crisis, and that it has to be a careful lender because it keeps the mortgage loans it makes on its books.Yet he said that in the last two years, regulators from the federal government and 25 U.S. states examined Clayton and its mortgages a total of 65 times, yet this scrutiny has led to just $38,200 of fines and $704,678 of refunds to customers.Clayton's management still delivers ""industry-leading performance,"" Buffett said.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2016-02-27,MDLZ,"Sat Feb 27, 2016 | 10:56am EST","Warren Buffett defends 3G, Clayton Homes as Berkshire profit grows",http://www.reuters.com//article/berkshire-buffett-idUSL2N1660D9?type=companyNews
149,"  BOSTON, March 16 Billionaire investor William Ackman told clients on Wednesday that his Pershing Square Capital Management has sold 20 million shares of Mondelez , a key holding, but has no plans to sell any other investments at this time, an investor in the fund said.Mondelez had been the firm's second largest position with 43 million shares. The sale, which was executed for portfolio management purposes, cut the firm's ownership stake to 5.6 percent from 7.5 percent.  The firm now has a substantial portion of uninvested cash, the investor said.

150,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Billionaire investor William Ackman adjusted his battered hedge fund portfolio on Wednesday when he sold 20 million shares of snack maker Mondelez International (MDLZ.O), one day after another key holding, Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO), lost half of its value.In a three paragraph letter sent to investors after the close of trading on Wednesday and seen by Reuters, Ackman said his firm, Pershing Square, has no plans to sell other investments right now and has ""substantial uninvested cash."" The letter came one day after Pershing Square lost about $800 million when Valeant was pummeled after raising the possibility that it may default on its debt and posting a worse-than-expected financial outlook.Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings has now lost 26.4 percent since January, marking one of the worst performances in the hedge fund industry this year.Before today's sale, Pershing Square owned 43 million shares, or 7.5 percent,  of Mondelez, which makes Oreo cookies, Trident gum and Milka chocolate. It now owns 5.6 percent of the company. The hedge fund unveiled its position in Mondelez in August 2015 and has since been pushing for a sale. ""We continue to believe in the potential for operating improvements and margin expansion that we expect will lead to substantial further increases in value,"" Ackman wrote in the letter. On Tuesday, Ackman barely contained his frustration with Valeant in an earlier note, warning the company and assuring his investors that Pershing Square was ""going to take a more proactive role at the company to protect and maximize the value of our investment.""  Last week, Pershing Square's vice chairman, Steve Fraidin, a veteran mergers and acquisitions lawyer, joined Valeant's board.It was roughly a year ago that Ackman unveiled his investment in Valeant, coming not quite a year after working with the fast-growing company on a deal in 2014 to buy Allergan, in which Pershing Square owned shares. The bet on Allergan helped Pershing Square earn a 40 percent gain in 2014.The size of Ackman's fund has shrunk dramatically to roughly $12 billion at the end of February from about $19 billion in early 2015. But because he listed shares on the Amsterdam stock exchange in 2014, he has a cushion of permanent capital. Still, investors have expressed concern about the fund's performance and Ackman urged them in Tuesday's and Wednesday's letters to call the investor relations team or him personally with any questions.

164,"   By Melissa Fares  Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International Inc's ""Twist, Lick, Dunk"" mobile application has been such a success that the snack company plans to roll out similar games in a move away from traditional advertising to create its own content.The free game launched in November 2012 has helped Mondelez make twice as much money through in-app purchases and ads as it had invested in it, Laura Henderson, global head of content and media monetization, said in an interview ahead of the company's announcement on Tuesday about the plans.Players have downloaded the game, created by mobile game development studio PikPok, about 7 million times and virtually dunked over 5 billion cookies into a glass of milk, she said.Mondelez said it was developing a Sour Patch Kids mobile app, and would change its product advertising by partnering with companies like Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and online publisher Buzzfeed to produce content including video and a live televised event.Mondelez hopes that up to 10 percent of its global media investments will break even or make a profit by 2020, Henderson said. She declined to provide financial details. A growing number of consumer goods makers are sidestepping conventional ad agencies to get their message directly to consumers who are increasingly skipping or blocking ads.PepsiCo Inc opened an in-house Creators League content studio in Manhattan in May. Energy drink maker Red Bull, a leader in creating sponsored content, this week announced a partnership with action camera maker GoPro Inc. Massive disruption in the ad industry prompted Mondelez to switch gears as audiences have become more difficult and expensive to reach, Henderson said.

BuzzFeed will help Mondelez create branded content and, for the first time, unbranded content centered around health as the East Hanover, New Jersey-based snack maker pushes to make its products more appealing to health-conscious consumers.FOX will live-broadcast a sky-diving stunt to support the July 30 launch of Mondelez's ""Mad Intense"" flavor Stride gum.

A growing number of consumer goods makers are sidestepping conventional ad agencies to get their message directly to consumers who are increasingly skipping or blocking ads.PepsiCo Inc opened an in-house Creators League content studio in Manhattan in May. Energy drink maker Red Bull, a leader in creating sponsored content, this week announced a partnership with action camera maker GoPro Inc. Massive disruption in the ad industry prompted Mondelez to switch gears as audiences have become more difficult and expensive to reach, Henderson said. ""Advertising is no longer a huge part of the content consumption experience."" BuzzFeed will help Mondelez create branded content and, for the first time, unbranded content centered around health as the East Hanover, New Jersey-based snack maker pushes to make its products more appealing to health-conscious consumers.FOX will live-broadcast a sky-diving stunt to support the July 30 launch of Mondelez's ""Mad Intense"" flavor Stride gum. Dave Morgan, chief executive of Simulmedia, a New York-based ad tech firm, said he expected all major consumer marketers to start producing more content in-house.""In the digital world, it is essential to have a direct to consumer relationship,"" he said.

167,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge in Chicago on Monday refused to dismiss a lawsuit in which wheat futures and options traders accused Kraft Heinz Co and Mondelez International Inc  of illegally manipulating the grain's price at their expense.U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang said traders may pursue claims that a large and, in their view, unnecessary late 2011 purchase by Kraft Foods Inc of wheat futures contracts violated the Sherman antitrust law and the Commodity Exchange Act.In a 66-page decision, Chang also dismissed claims that the defendants conducted offsetting ""wash trades"" over roughly a decade to create an illusion of greater market activity. He said the traders can try to bring those claims again.Kraft and Mondelez were named as defendants because most of the alleged suspicious activity occurred before Kraft Foods Inc split in two in 2012. Mondelez brands now include snack foods such as Oreos, Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins.Many of the allegations were similar to those raised by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in an April 2015 lawsuit against Kraft and Mondelez.

It said Kraft Foods did so to depress prices in the cash wheat market, because sellers might believe the company needed less wheat, and inflate futures prices. It said the strategy led to more than $5.4 million of illegal profit.Last December, another judge rejected a defense motion to  dismiss the CFTC lawsuit.

175,"  (Repeats for wider distribution.)* Mondelez-Hershey merger would be world's largest cocoa consumer* Barry Callebaut is key supplier of cocoa, chocolate products to both* Market concentration could squeeze middlemen's margins furtherBy Luc CohenNEW YORK, July 1 When Olam International  agreed to buy rival Archer Daniels Midland Co's  cocoa processing business in December 2014, catapulting it into the top echelon of bean buyers, confectioners worried about its outsized power over prices.Now, Mondelez International Inc's audacious bid on Thursday for Hershey Co, to create by far the world's largest cocoa buyer, could hand the bargaining chips in the volatile niche market back to the candy makers. With more buying power, candy makers could demand lower prices from traders already operating on thin margins.Hershey's board of directors unanimously rejected Mondelez's $23 billion takeover bid on Thursday. Even so, the combined company would cushion Mondelez from wild swings in prices of key ingredients. Soaring cocoa, dairy and nut prices forced some in recent years to raise prices, but the sticker shock for sweet-toothed shoppers hurt sales.But the bid also raised the specter of consolidation among chocolate makers, which could create larger buyers of commodities including cocoa and sugar, worrying middlemen who have already seen their margins squeezed.The additional pricing power of the new entity would be ""concerning,"" a veteran cocoa buyer said.Mondelez is already the world's largest cocoa consumer, and after a tie-up with Hershey it would consume 650,000 tonnes per year, 50 percent more than the No. 2 consumer, Nestle SA , according to the Cocoa Barometer publication by nonprofit industry watchdog VOICE Network. Global cocoa demand totals around 4 million tonnes annually.""You create a huge giant as far as cocoa consumption is concerned,"" said Antonie Fountain, VOICE managing director.The most immediate questions raised by the potential deal concern the companies' relationships with Swiss processor Barry Callebaut AG, which became the world's largest manufacturer of chocolate and cocoa products after a 2013 purchase of Petra Foods' cocoa business. In 2007, Barry Callebaut reached a deal to supply Hershey with chocolate through 2022. Three years later, it agreed to supply Kraft Foods - which spun off Mondelez in 2012 - with the majority of its cocoa products and industrial chocolate globally. It remains a top supplier after the spinoff, sources said.The fact that Barry Callebaut supplies both companies reduces its risk of being squeezed out, but a combined company would likely look for alternatives and exert some leverage on prices, four industry experts each with decades of experience said.""If it were me, I would look to diversify away from Barry,"" said one of the sources.

176,"   By Lauren Hirsch  Hershey Co (HSY.N) said on Thursday it had rejected a $23 billion takeover bid by Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) that would seek to expand the latter's limited U.S. footprint and create the world's largest confectioner.The snub underscores the challenges Mondelez Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld faces in wooing Hershey's controlling shareholder, the Hershey Trust, a $12 billion charity created by the eponymous company's founder a century ago. The maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups saw its shares trade above Mondelez's bid of $107 per share in cash and stock, indicating investors expected a new offer.A merger of two of the world's top five candy makers would add Hershey's strong U.S. business to Mondelez's global footprint.     Earlier, a source said that Mondelez had sought to provide assurances to Hershey that it would keep its name and preserve jobs. Mondelez sees little antitrust risk given the limited geographic overlap of the two companies' businesses, the source added.""The board of directors of the company unanimously rejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondelez and the company,"" Hershey said in a statement.    Hershey shares ended trading on Thursday up 16.8 percent at $113.49, while Mondelez rose 5.9 percent to $45.51.    Mondelez, the maker of Oreos cookies, is the second-largest confectionary company globally, while Hershey ranks number five. Their merger would put them in the top place at 18 percent of the market, according to market research firm Euromonitor International Ltd. The combined company would leapfrog Mars Inc, which has 13.3 percent of the global market.A fusion of the two would give Mondelez control over the production and distribution of Cadbury brand chocolates in the United States, which Hershey currently holds the license to produce, paying royalties to Mondelez.  It would also give Mondelez the U.S. production and distribution rights for Kit Kat, one of the most popular chocolate brands in the world, which industry sources said would be a significant boost to Mondelez.Nestle SA (NESN.S) manufactures Kit Kat worldwide, but Hershey has the rights in the United States, paying Nestle royalties from sales. Mondelez's bid could put pressure on Nestle to consider its own bid for Hershey. Upon change of control at Hershey, the license would revert back to Nestle for free, depriving value for a potential acquirer.HERSHEY TRUST TROUBLE  The bid pits Deerfield, Illinois-based Mondelez against the Hershey Trust, one of Pennsylvania's wealthiest charities. The trust has about 81 percent of Hershey's voting rights and in 2002 prevented the Hershey, Pennsylvania-based company from being acquired by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co for $12 billion.Pennsylvania's attorney general also sued to block the Wrigley deal, arguing it would hurt the local community.Created by Hershey founder Milton Hershey to provide for the Milton Hershey School, a private school for children from low-income families, the trust has been the subject of an investigation recently by Pennsylvania's attorney general over conflicts of interest and mismanagement. The trust's chief compliance officer was put on leave last month after a leaked memo showed the board had spent nearly $4 million investigating conflicts of interest and insider-trading accusations against board members. A top trust official was also sacked in May and pled guilty to wire fraud. STARTING POINT Tigress Financial Partners LLC analyst Philip Van Deusen said he expected the offer price to increase, given the rise in Hershey's shares.""I think ($107) is a good starting place,"" he said.Analysts have been skeptical of takeover bids for Hershey in the past.    ""The Trust ... is outwardly very committed to keeping the company independent,"" Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said in June last year. ""So it's pretty much impossible for an activist to get involved or for the company to be bought."" Last year, William Ackman revealed his activist hedge fund Pershing Square had built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in Mondelez, in what was seen as an attempt to push the company to boost earnings or sell itself.Ackman joined fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez.

198,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates, said it was no longer pursuing the acquisition of Hershey Co (HSY.N), two months after the U.S. chocolate company turned down its $23 billion cash-and-stock bid.The abandoned deal, which would have created the world's largest confectioner, underscores the grip that a charitable trust has on the maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. The trust which controls Hershey was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. Hershey rejected a $107 per share acquisition offer from Mondelez at the end of June. An unrelated row between the trust and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office ensued over the trust's governance, which resulted in a reform agreement being announced at the end of July.The agreement calls for the trust's board to be expanded from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign in order for 10-year terms to be enforced. One trustee resigned last month, leaving a total of nine openings.Mondelez's Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld approached Hershey Chief Executive John Bilbrey again last week, and indicated that Mondelez would be willing to offer up to $115 per share for Hershey, according to a source familiar with the discussions who asked not to be identified because they were confidential. Hershey responded that the trust would not be able to consider an offer until it is reconstituted next year, the source said. Even then, Hershey would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, the source added.Hershey did not respond to a request for comment. Its shares fell 11.4 percent in after hours trading in New York on Monday to $99.00.""Following additional discussions, and taking into account recent shareholder developments at Hershey, we determined that there is no actionable path forward toward an agreement,"" Rosenfeld said in a statement. The Hershey trust holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Mondelez's offer was half in cash and half in stock, sources have said. This means new board members of the trust, which must approve any sale of Hershey, could use such a transaction to substantially reduce its exposure in Hershey by partially cashing out on its stake.""While we are disappointed in this outcome, we remain disciplined in our approach to creating value, including through acquisitions,"" Rosenfeld said on Monday.ATTORNEY GENERAL UP FOR ELECTION  Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, it can still be overruled. In 2002, the trust put Hershey up for sale, citing a need to diversify its holdings. At the last minute, it pulled the plug on a sale to chewing gum maker Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co for $12.5 billion, after the attorney general's office successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid local community protests.Pennsylvania's attorney general Kathleen Kane stepped down earlier this month after she was convicted of leaking secret criminal files to discredit a political adversary, and then lying about it. She was succeeded by her deputy Bruce Castor, and the post is up for election in November. Pennsylvania state senator John Rafferty, the Republican candidate for attorney general, has said he does not think diversification for a charitable trust is always necessary, and has expressed ""serious reservations"" about a potential sale to Mondelez. Democrat candidate Josh Shapiro has said he will ""vigorously protect Hershey's continued success in Pennsylvania"" and protect it from ""multi-national corporations and Wall Street investors willing to destroy Pennsylvania jobs for their own profit.""Hershey's growth has slowed in the last two years as competitors such as Mars Inc expand their offerings, and premium players such as Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Spruengli AG (LISN.S) entered the U.S. market.Mondelez, which has more of a global footprint than Hershey, is the second-largest confectionary company in the world, while Hershey ranks number five. Their merger would put them in the top place at 18 percent of the market, according to market research firm Euromonitor International Ltd. The combined company would leapfrog Mars, which has 13.3 percent of the global market.Last year, William Ackman revealed his activist hedge fund Pershing Square had built a stake worth about $5.5 billion in Mondelez, in what was seen as an attempt to push the company to boost earnings or sell itself.Ackman had joined fellow activist Nelson Peltz as an investor in Mondelez. In a letter to his investors earlier this month, Ackman wrote that Mondelez shares are currently undervalued, and that the issuance of Mondelez stock to fund the acquisition of Hershey would likely be costly for Mondelez shareholders.

206,"   By Simon Jessop | LONDON  LONDON A group of 40 investors managing $1.25 trillion in assets have launched a campaign to encourage 16 global food companies to change the way they source protein for their products to help to reduce environmental and health risks.The investors, which include the fund arm of insurer Aviva and several Swedish state pension funds, wrote to the food companies on Sept. 23 urging them to respond to the ""material"" risks of industrial farming and to diversify into plant-based sources of protein.Among the companies targeted were Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Walmart, a statement by the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative, which organized the investor group, said on Monday. ""The world's over reliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis,"" said Jeremy Coller, founder of the FAIRR initiative and chief investment officer at private equity company Coller Capital.Pollution from intensive livestock production is already at too high a level, while safety and welfare standards are too low and the industry cannot cope with the projected increase in global protein demand, Coller said.""Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4 percent annually over the next five years,"" Coller said. The campaign follows an Oxford University study which said $1.5 trillion in healthcare and climate change-related costs could be saved by 2050 if people reduced their reliance on meat in their diet.The study also pointed to growing political pressure on companies to change, citing a consultation in Denmark on the introduction of a red meat tax and a Chinese government plan to reduce its citizens' meat consumption by 50 percent, FAIRR said.Ella McKinley, ethics analyst at Australian Ethical Investment, which is taking part in the campaign, said the need to change food production models was essential to help to limit climate change.""Forward-looking companies can move now to encourage more sustainable diets by reducing reliance on meat and growing the market for plant-based protein alternatives. In the process, companies make their own protein supply chains more resilient to future shocks,"" she said. The other companies written to by FAIRR were General Mills, Mondelez International, Ahold-Delhaize, The Co-operative Group, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Kroger Company, Marks & Spencer, Wm Morrison Supermarkets, Ocado, Sainsbury's and Whole Foods Market.A Nestle spokeswoman said the company did not use much meat, ""so our main strategy is not to focus on replacing the meat that we do use as its impact would be minimal. Our main opportunities lie in innovating new products using alternate proteins"".""In terms of timetables and targets, this is still a relatively new area, where in many countries the consumers are not fully prepared to replace or reduce meat in their diets. Our focus is to innovate great tasting solutions to encourage consumers to try them and over time make small, sustainable shifts towards a higher plant-based, more balanced diet."" Kraft Heinz declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The Co-Op said it had yet to receive the letter. Mondelez also declined to comment because it had not yet seen the letter, while a Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: ""We're aware of the issue and are looking forward to receiving a copy of the letter.""A Walmart spokesman said the company was not familiar with the campaign and so could not provide comment, while a Kroger spokesman said the firm had not received the letter but was happy to talk with the investor group.The remaining companies were not immediately available to comment.Among the other investors to join the campaign were Nordea Asset Management, the fund arm of Norwegian lender Nordea, Boston Common Asset Management, and Impax Asset Management, as well as a number of charities and other ethical investors.

207,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) for Mondelez International, Inc. (Mondelez) at 'BBB'. The  Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. A full list of ratings  follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Increased Confidence in 2018 EBIT Margin Target of 17%-18%: The revision of the Outlook to Stable reflects Fitch's increased confidence in  Mondelez's ability to improve EBIT margins to the targeted 17%-18% range in 2018  from 14.7% in 2015 on 2%-3% annual organic revenue growth. The improvement will  primarily be driven by the large restructuring program the company put in place  in 2014 to realize $1.5 billion in annualized savings by 2018 in the areas of  supply chain, overhead costs, and other organizational efficiencies. Free cash  flow (FCF; after dividends, cash restructuring charges, and pension  contribution) is expected to improve from $200 million-$300 million in 2016 to  over $1.5 billion in 2018, as the company cycles heavy restructuring-related  cash payments and capex over the next 2-3 years. Debt/EBITDA is expected to  trend toward 3.0x by 2018 from an expected 3.5x in 2016 on EBITDA growth.  Risks to the ratings include prolonged weakness in organic sales growth with  Mondelez growing below industry-category sales growth and higher than expected  investments needed to drive sales which would preclude the company from  achieving the targeted EBIT margins. Debt financed share buybacks and M&A  activity that keeps leverage elevated in the mid-to-high 3x are also rating  concerns. Fitch expects M&A activity to continue in the packaged food sector as  companies optimize product portfolio, geographic exposure, and seek cost  reduction opportunities. Mondelez's attempted takeover of Hershey would have  been a transformative event for the company. While Mondelez's rating does not  factor a major M&A event, the company could be acquisitive or even the target of  a larger multinational food company over the rating horizon. Favorable Portfolio Mix Fitch views Mondelez as having a favorable product mix relative to its  packaged-food peers given that 80% of its sales are geared towards snacks, which  Fitch expects should grow in the 2%-3% range going forward (versus 6%  historically) against flat to 1% for overall packaged foods. The snacking  category is well-aligned with consumer trends of eating more frequent, smaller  meals, and convenience. In addition, 40% of its sales come from emerging markets  which have near-term headwinds but strong growth prospects longer term. This  supports long-term organic growth of 2%-3%, which Fitch expects will be driven  equally from volume growth and pricing over the medium term.  Mondelez is one of the world's largest snack companies, with 2016 projected  revenues of approximately $26 billion and an attractive portfolio of sweet snack  brands. The company operates in approximately 165 countries and has #1 global  market shares in biscuits and candy, as well as #2 global shares in chocolate  and gum. Oreo, Cadbury, Nabisco, Dairy Milk, LU, Milka, and Trident each  generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. Power Brands, which make up 68%  of sales, are the company's fastest growing and highest-margin global and  regional brands. These brands have grown at about twice the pace of overall  sales during the past few years and have margins 100bps to 200bps higher than  the company's other brands. Power Brands also receive about 80% of advertising  and consumer (A&C) expenditures. Restructuring Program to Yield Industry Level Margins Management has been focused on improving efficiency as Mondelez was created  through a series of acquisitions made by legacy Kraft that were never properly  optimized or integrated. In 2014, the company announced a $3.5 billion  restructuring program to be executed from 2014 through 2018 with $2.5 billion in  cash costs. The purpose is to reduce supply chain and overhead costs by $1.5  billion by the end of 2018. This would be supported by an incremental $1.6  billion in capex to upgrade its manufacturing facilities and the company expects  70% of its Power Brand sales will move to upgraded facilities by 2018 versus 25%  in 2015.  EBIT margin has improved steadily to 15% for the LTM period ending June 30, 2016  versus 12.1% in 2013 and Fitch views Mondelez's margin targets of 17%-18% in  2018 as achievable, and would bring Mondelez more in line with industry  averages.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's assumptions in its base case projections are as follows: --Organic growth of about 2% in 2016, with 2%-3% growth expected thereafter.  Currency impact is assumed to be neutral beginning 2017. --EBIT margin is expected to be 15.1% in 2016, versus 14.2% in 2015, and expand  to 17%-18% in 2018. --EBITDA margin is expected to be 18%-19% in 2016, versus 17.7% in 2015, and  expand to the 21% range in 2018. --Capex is expected to peak at $1.4 billion in 2016 and decline by $100 million  thereafter to $1.2 billion by 2018 as restructuring-related capex declines over  time.  --FCF (after dividends, cash restructuring charges, and pension contribution) of  over $200 million in 2016, improving to over $1.5 billion in 2018. --Total debt-to-EBITDA of around 3.5x in 2016, assuming $2 billion in additional  debt (in the form of commercial paper borrowings) to fund around $2 billion  in share buybacks. Leverage is expected to trend towards 3x in 2018, driven  primarily by EBITDA growth.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --EBITDA tracks below expectation due to a shortfall in expected operating  margin improvement or deceleration in organic top-line growth, aggressive  financial policies or engaging in a large debt-financed acquisition, such that  leverage is consistently above 3.5x.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --Organic growth in line with or better than category growth --EBITDA margins in line with or better than industry average --Leverage consistently below 3x. LIQUIDITY Mondelez's liquidity at June 30, 2016 includes more than $1.8 billion in cash  and equivalents and an undrawn $4.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit  facility expiring in October 2018. Mondelez had $2.4 billion in CP outstanding  at June 30, 2016. Upcoming long-term debt maturities are significant with $1.5  billion due in 2017, which Fitch believes the company is likely to refinance.  FCF (after dividends, cash restructuring charges, and pension contribution) is  expected to improve from $200 million-$300 million in 2016 to over $1.5 billion  in 2018, as the company cycles heavy restructuring-related cash payments and  capex over the next 2-3 years. Debt/EBITDA is expected to trend towards 3.0x by  2018 from an expected 3.5x in 2016 on EBITDA growth.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Mondelez's ratings as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; --Credit facility at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

211,"   By Gayathree Ganesan  Mondelez International Inc's (MDLZ.O) quarterly profit handily beat estimates, helped by cost cuts, and the Cadbury chocolate maker raised its profit forecast for the year, sending its shares up as much as 4.6 percent on Wednesday.Since separating from Kraft in 2012, Mondelez has concentrated on increasing its profit margins by reducing costs through internal controls, divestitures and asset sales.The company is in the midst of a $3 billion cost saving program, which runs till the end of 2018, opening more efficient manufacturing plants and using zero-based budgeting (ZBB), which requires expenses to be justified for each new period.Mondelez has targeted cost savings of 30-50 percent in 12 areas including travel, sales support services and business events. ZBB efforts in travel have cut costs by 30 percent, Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens told Reuters.Overall selling, general and administrative expenses fell 13.3 percent to $1.6 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Net sales fell 6.6 percent to $6.40 billion, hurt by a  strong dollar and the deconsolidation of its Venezuela operations.Organic net revenue grew 1.1 percent in the quarter, driven by sales of Oreos and Trident gum.""We were pleased to see overall volumes were positive along with solid organic revenue growth especially considering many other competitors are struggling to grow sales,"" Brittany Weisman, consumer staples analyst with Edward Jones said.

218,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Hershey Co (HSY.N), the maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as demand strengthened in the United States and the company spent less on advertising and marketing.Hershey's shares rose almost 7 percent to $101.91 on Friday morning, their biggest intraday percentage gain since June, when Mondelez's offer to buy the company became public.Hershey's North America sales, which account for about 85 percent of total sales, rose 1.8 percent to $1.76 billion in the third quarter ended Oct. 2.Consumers are visiting stores more frequently and are ""beginning to spend a little bit more confidently than before,"" Chief Executive John Bilbrey said on a conference call.Hershey is introducing new products to overcome weak demand in North America due to changing consumer tastes and growing competition.The launch of Reese's Pieces Cups, which combine the Peanut Butter Cups with Reese's Pieces, increased sales of the brand by about 8 percent in the quarter, Bilbrey said. Hershey also plans to launch Cookie Layer Crunch, a chocolate bar with layers of cookie bits, during the holidays and said it has ""good visibility"" into product's holiday sales.""While sales growth has been weak for the business, any improvement in category growth rates in the U.S. in particular, but also in China, could move shares higher,"" Stifel analyst Christopher Growe wrote in a note, referring to his $94 price target.Hershey, since rejecting the $23 billion offer from Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), is working to cut costs by consolidating its supply chain and some factories in China and North America, and spending less on advertising. The company said it expects 2016 capital expenditure at the lower end of its reduced range of $265 million-$275 million.Hershey is set to undergo a management overhaul, with Bilbrey retiring next year. The charitable trust which controls the company reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, following a months-long investigation.The company's net income rose 47 percent to $227.4 million, or $1.06 per share, in the quarter, helped by lower costs. Excluding items, Hershey earned $1.29 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.18 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales rose 2.2 percent to $2 billion, in line with analysts' average estimate.Hershey raised its 2016 adjusted earnings forecast to $4.28-$4.32 per share from $4.24-$4.28, citing cost savings and a slightly more favorable tax rate than expected.

220,"   By Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Bruno Federowski | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO 3G Capital Inc, the buyout firm controlled by Brazilian billionaire financier Jorge Paulo Lemann, is raising between $8 billion and $10 billion to finance an acquisition of a global consumer goods firm, a Brazil-based blog said on Tuesday.According to the Brazil Journal blog, which cited people close to 3G, at least 10 wealthy Brazilian investors had already committed a minimum $100 million each to the new fund. Alexandre Behring, the 3G partner who is in charge of the firm's day-to-day operations, has remained closely involved in the fundraising effort, the blog said.Calls to 3G's office in Rio de Janeiro went unanswered.Investors have long speculated what the next target for Lemann, who is worth $28 billion according to Forbes Magazine, and 3G could be Oreo cookies maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) or General Mills Inc (GIS.N), which owns Pillsbury and Betty Crocker.  The blog said an acquisition would be done through Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), in which 3G has a 24 percent stake.Shares in Mondelez gained 3.7 percent to $45.87, while General Mills added 2.4 percent to $63.32 in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday. According to the blog, Lemann's camp has declined politely checks between $20 million and $50 million for the new fund, on the grounds that larger money commitments could optimize any fundraising efforts. Tennis player Roger Federer and supermodel Gisele Bündchen are among investors in the new vehicle, Brazil Journal said.Lemann, a globe-trotting financier with Swiss roots, rose to prominence over the past decade following a series of mega deals that drew praise and funding from U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett. Both tycoons have teamed up several times in the past, the most recent being a joint effort to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co for $23.2 billion three years ago. Harvard University-educated Lemann and longtime partners Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles are 3G Capital's main partners. They are one of the largest investors in Anheuser Busch InBev SA (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer maker.Buffett also helped finance the 3G-engineered merger of Burger King Corp with Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons, creating Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO).
