0,"  IBM (IBM.N) said it will invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson, as the tech giant hopes to get more revenue from the supercomputer system that beat humans on the television quiz show ""Jeopardy"".The world's largest technology service provider said the IBM Watson Group will be headed by Michael Rhodin, who was previously senior vice president of IBM's software solutions group.IBM said the investment includes a $100 million equity fund to boost innovation at its Watson Developers Cloud, which it opened up to external application developers last year.The unit will have about 2,000 employees and will be based in New York City.Watson, which beat expert ""Jeopardy"" quiz show contestants in 2011, is an artificial intelligence super computer system named after legendary International Business Machines President Thomas Watson.Using natural language capabilities and analytics, Watson processes information akin to how people think, allowing it to quickly analyze and interpret large amounts of data. IBM said it has shrunk Watson to the size of three stacked pizza boxes from its original size of a master bedroom.Under the Watson Group, IBM will offer the technology, which is delivered over the cloud and can power new consumer and enterprise apps, to businesses and industries as well as to consumers.IBM said it decided to establish the unit because of strong demand for cognitive computing. ""We have reached the inflection point where the interest is overwhelming and we recognized we need to move faster,"" said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson Business.Watson will be deployed on Softlayer, the cloud computing infrastructure business IBM bought last year.

14,"  NEW YORK/HONG KONG China's Lenovo Group Ltd has resumed talks to buy International Business Machines Corp's (IBM) low-end server unit, a source familiar with the matter said, a purchase that would bolster its efforts to diversify beyond a shrinking PC market.A deal for IBM's x86 servers, which power corporate data centers, fits in with Lenovo's attempts to remold itself as a growing force in mobile devices and data storage servers. It also helps IBM's shift away from hardware towards software and services.The two companies failed to reach an agreement last year after differing on pricing. Media reports then put IBM's hopes at between $4 billion to $6 billion for the unit, while Lenovo was said to be only willing to offer $2.5 billion.Analysts now estimate the sale of the IBM unit to Lenovo could be worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion.

The company has $3 billion in cash, and very little debt, and IBM is a very willing seller, he added.

Even so, there were some bright spots, like United Technologies Corp and railroad company Norfolk Southern , both of which reported strong quarterly earnings.""We've seen significant decreases in a company's ability to deliver on earnings this quarter ... however, we've also seen signs that the top-line growth we've been looking for is starting to emerge,"" said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors in New York.""Seeing a broad-based top-line growth trend would really speak to the health of the economy ... that has allowed for the market to hang in there despite some disappointments.""The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 41.10 points, or 0.25 percent, at 16,373.34.

The company reported higher fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, though revenue fell shy of expectations.Norfolk Southern posted a 24 percent rise in quarterly income, driving its shares up 4.8 percent to $92.94.

""There has been little so far to excite the masses and it is going to lead many to question. Can this market hang in there with a flat earnings environment?"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 36.92 points, or 0.22 percent, at 16,377.52.

The company was hit in the latest quarter by weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China.Coach tumbled 7 percent to $48.86, the worst performer on the S&P 500, on declining North American sales and market share in the handbag business to fast-growing rivals.On the upside, both United Technologies Corp and railroad company Norfolk Southern reported strong quarterly earnings. Shares of United Technologies, the world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, were up 0.8 percent at $115.92. The company reported higher fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, though revenue fell shy of expectations.Norfolk Southern posted a 24 percent rise in quarterly income, driving its shares up 4.4 percent at $92.61.

The world's biggest technology services company missed revenue expectations for a fourth straight quarter amid weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China.But fellow Dow component United Technologies Corp  was a bright spot, up 0.9 percent to $116.01 to help curb declines on the blue-chip index. The world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners reported fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, although revenue fell shy of expectations. Norfolk Southern Corp jumped 6.4 percent to $94.39 as one of the best performers on the S&P 500. The railroad posted a 24 percent rise in quarterly income that beat Wall Street expectations. The gains helped lift the Dow Jones Transportation average to a record high.Coach Inc tumbled 6 percent to $49.38, making it the worst performer on the S&P 500 after it said sales in North America fell further in the final quarter of 2013, as it lost share in the handbag business to fast-growing rivals.""There has been little so far to excite the masses and it is going to lead many to question, can this market hang in there with a flat earnings environment,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. ""It will be easier to unnerve a market with less earnings confidence, and you are seeing companies like IBM and Coach that have come out and leave the investor looking for something substantial to bite into.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.35 points or 0.18 percent, to 16,384.09, the S&P 500 gained 1.05 points or 0.06 percent, to 1,844.85 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 9.179 points or 0.22 percent, to 4,234.939.After a 29.6 percent jump in the S&P 500 in 2013, the S&P has edged down 0.2 percent so far in 2014 as investors look to corporate profits for evidence of growth as the Federal Reserve has begun to wind down its market-friendly economic stimulus. About eight companies have issued negative outlooks for every positive one, which would mark the lowest ratio on record should it continue.According to Thomson Reuters data, earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to grow 7.1 percent over the prior year.

28,"   By Paul Carsten and Soham Chatterjee  Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd has agreed to buy International Business Machine Corp's low-end server business for $2.3 billion in what would be China's biggest technology deal.The long-expected acquisition comes nearly a decade after Lenovo bought IBM's money-losing ThinkPad business for $1.75 billion, eventually becoming the world leader in personal computers in 2012.The sale of the low-end server operation - which still needs U.S. government approval - would allow IBM to focus on its decade-long shift to more profitable software and services.The deal would increase Lenovo's share in the server market to 14 percent from 2 percent, said Peter Hortensius, a senior vice-president at Lenovo.The deal needs clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which protects U.S. national security.Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S. acquisitions in 2012, according to a CFIUS report issued in December.Lenovo's purchase of IBM's notebook division faced scrutiny before approval, and this time will be easier, analysts said.""It's fair to say that this deal is more likely to get through CFIUS without major problems than the 2005 transaction,"" said John Reynolds, a partner at law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell in Washington, D.C. who has handled CFIUS issues for 20 years.Reynolds saw relatively little national security risk in the deal, noting that Lenovo was well-known in the United States.Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau noted that the System X server, among the systems to be bought by Lenovo, is based on commoditized technology and components from the United States.This deal is likely also to win U.S. antitrust approval, perhaps within weeks, said Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust partner with Baker & Hostetler LLP. ""Given that Lenovo is likely to take advantage of its lower-cost manufacturing base in China, this deal is likely to be viewed as pro-competitive.""IBM shares edged 0.2 percent lower to $182.27 at mid-afternoon Thursday. Trading in Lenovo shares was halted before the close in Hong Kong ahead of the announcement. SEVEN QUARTERS OF LOSSES The deal with Lenovo marks another step in IBM's switch away from hardware to software and services. IBM said this month it would spend more than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 data centers on five continents to expand its cloud services and reach new clients and markets.The company also said it would invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the TV quiz show ""Jeopardy"" - to offer cloud services to businesses and consumers.With Lenovo's PC business under siege from powerful smartphones and super-fast tablets, the company is remodeling itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers.It would not be easy for Lenovo turn around the server unit, however. IBM's low-margin server business has posted seven quarters of losses as clients move to the cloud.""To generate costs synergy, Lenovo will need to move most of the manufacturing from IBM's existing facility in Virginia to Asia while keeping some R&D in the U.S.,"" Lau said. The server business being sold by IBM, which produced low-cost x86 servers, competes with Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell but lags both in market share.IBM dominates the higher-end server market with a 57 percent share, according to research firm Canalys. IBM will retain its higher-margin server systems and continue to develop software and applications for the x86 platform.Following closure of the deal, Lenovo will offer jobs to 7,500 IBM employees and assume customer service and maintenance operations.""We will do a variety of things - improve products, drive improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC business to improve go-to-market,"" said Lenovo's Hortensius.Analysts said Lenovo would likely find it easier than IBM to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about widespread U.S. electronic snooping.BIGGEST TECH DEAL  Lenovo said it expected demand for computing power and recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth in the x86 server market.Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker.The deal surpasses Baidu Inc's $1.85 billion acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores the clout of China's technology firms as they expand overseas.The unit posted a loss of $26.4 million after tax for the 12 months ended December 31, compared with a profit of $187 million in the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenue of $4.6 billion.Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to differences over pricing, with media reports at the time suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit.Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM's problems in China following revelations of U.S. electronic spying and ongoing weakness in hardware sales.The world's biggest technology services company posted a 23 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China.Lenovo's purchase of IBM's PC business in 2005 became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings, and the market is betting Lenovo will enjoy similar success with its latest acquisition, which is partly reflected in a 9.44 percent rise in its shares this year. The Hang Seng stock index is down 2.5 percent in the same period.IBM's server business is the world's second-largest, with a 22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner.Hewlett-Packard is the biggest player, while Lenovo does not appear in the top five.Lenovo said it was advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs Group.(Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Denny Thomas, Stephen Coates, Ryan Woo, Ted Kerr and Richard Chang)",2014-01-23,IBM,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 4:02pm EST",Lenovo to buy IBM's low-end server unit for $2.3 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ibm-server-lenovo-idUSBREA0M01U20140123?type=companyNews

Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau noted that the System X server, among the systems to be bought by Lenovo, is based on commoditized technology and components that are sourced from the United States.IBM shares were slightly higher at $182.98 in early trading on Thursday. Trading in Lenovo shares was halted before the close in Hong Kong ahead of the announcement.SEVEN QUARTERS OF LOSSES The deal with Lenovo marks another step in IBM's switch away from hardware to software and services.IBM said this month it would spend more than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 data centers on five continents to expand its cloud services and reach new clients and markets.The company also said it would invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the TV quiz show ""Jeopardy"" - to offer the cloud services to businesses and consumers.With Lenovo's PC business under siege from powerful smartphones and super-fast tablets, the company is diversifying its revenue and remodelling itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers. Lenovo would have its work cut out for it to turn around the server unit, however. IBM's low-margin server business has posted seven quarters of losses as more clients switch to cloud storage from traditional infrastructure.""To generate costs synergy, Lenovo will need to move most of the manufacturing from IBM's existing facility in Virginia to Asia while keeping some R&D in the U.S.,"" Lau said.The server business being sold by IBM, which produced low-cost x86 servers, competes Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell but lags both in market share.IBM dominates the higher-end server market with a 57 percent market-share, according to research firm Canalys.IBM will retain its higher-margin server systems and will continue to develop software and applications for the x86 platform.Following closure of the deal, Lenovo will offer jobs to 7,500 IBM employees around the world and assume customer service and maintenance operations.""We will do a variety of things - improve products, drive improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC business to improve go-to-market,"" Hortensius said.Analysts said Lenovo would likely find it easier than IBM to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about widespread U.S. electronic snooping. ISI's Marshall said the deal, if approved, would put more pressure on the server market as Lenovo may be less disciplined on pricing than IBM as tries to build market share.BIGGEST TECH DEAL Lenovo said it expected demand for computing power and recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth in the x86 server market.Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker.The deal surpasses Baidu Inc's $1.85 billion acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc  last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores the growing clout of China's technology firms as they look to expand overseas.The unit posted a loss of $26.4 million after tax for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $187 million in the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenue of $4.6 billion.Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to differences over pricing, with media reports at the time suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit.Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM's  problems in China following revelations of U.S. electronic spying and ongoing weakness in hardware sales.The world's biggest technology services company reported a 23 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China.Lenovo's purchase of IBM's PC business in 2005 became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings, and the market is betting Lenovo will enjoy similar success with its latest acquisition, which is partly reflected in a 9.44 percent rise in its shares this year. The Hang Seng stock index is down 2.5 percent in the same period.IBM's server business is the world's second-largest, with a 22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner.Hewlett-Packard Co is the biggest player, while Lenovo does not appear in the top five.""The acquisition presents a unique opportunity for the company to gain immediate scale and credibility in this market,"" Lenovo said in a statement on Thursday.Lenovo said it was advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs Group.

41,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. officials are likely to allow China's Lenovo Group to buy IBM's low-end server business and Google Inc's Motorola Mobility handset business if it agrees to concessions aimed at protecting U.S. national security, experts said.Computer maker Lenovo has advantages over other Chinese companies that should help it overcome the mutual suspicion between the United States and China over industrial spying and cybersecurity, such as its track record of successful U.S. acquisitions in the past. And importantly, it is not directly controlled by China's government.Even so, it could be in for a battle over its latest deals with at least one lawmaker expressing concern.Lenovo said on Wednesday it would acquire Motorola Mobility, along with some 2,000 patents, for $2.91 billion. That news came days after an announcement the company would purchase IBM's low-end server unit for $2.3 billion.The deals will be reviewed by the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, to ensure they do not threaten national security.""We look forward to going through the regulatory process and we're going to work with the regulators with an open and transparent approach,"" Lenovo spokesman Brion Tingler said.Lenovo has been through the secretive CFIUS process three times before and has won approval each time, according to a source familiar with the process.The first was in 2005, when Lenovo bought IBM's ThinkPad business in a deal that catapulted the company into the global technology big leagues. In that case CFIUS approval came to the dismay of Representative Frank Wolf, a Republican from Virginia and a tough critic of China.Wolf said he discovered after that approval that the State Department had made plans to purchase Lenovo computers. ""They were not able to cancel the purchases but made sure that none of them were used for anything,"" he said. ""I just think we have to be careful,"" said Wolf.Lenovo also went through CFIUS reviews when it bought Stoneware Inc to expand cloud solutions and formed a strategic partnership with EMC Corporation. Both deals were announced in 2012.It is not known what security concessions - if any - CFIUS wrung out of Lenovo in the previous transactions, but typical measures include having a security officer, a security plan or other steps aimed at preventing a foreign government from influencing a company in a way that would put U.S. security at risk, the expert said.CFIUS may also require that only U.S. citizens handle certain products and services or demand that certain products be located only in the United States. Lenovo has already been in touch with CFIUS about its latest U.S. deals, as is typical, said sources familiar with the process.PATENTS IN FOCUS A typical CFIUS analysis will touch on two sides - what threat may be posed by the foreign company involved and what vulnerabilities are exposed by the purchase, said Anne Salladin, a former Treasury official with CFIUS experience.""I do think that both of these deals are likely candidates for mitigation measures,"" said Salladin, who is now at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP.Another former government official with CFIUS experience, Jonathan Gafni, said the review of the Motorola Mobility deal likely would not focus on handsets but on more complicated patents. Lenovo will receive more than 2,000 ""patent assets"" as part of the transaction, the companies said, although it is not known which ones will change hands. Gafni said regulators would want to give them extra scrutiny.""There are already a ton of Chinese handsets being sold in this country,"" said Gafni, now with Compass Point Analytics. ""I think it could take some time to figure it all out, but I don't see a big problem here.""In the end, experts said, Lenovo was likely to win CFIUS approval.""If there was a Chinese company that was well-positioned to see this deal come off, it's Lenovo,"" said Jim Lewis, a security expert with the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""They've done the dance before and they know what the steps are.""CFIUS, which is headed by the Treasury Department, usually takes 30 days to review simple deals, but may take an additional 45 days on more complicated transactions.Of the 23 transactions CFIUS reviewed in 2012, 10 were withdrawn and abandoned, according to the latest CFIUS annual report. One Chinese transaction was blocked in 2012 - the proposed purchase of an Oregon wind farm near a sensitive Navy installation.(This story was corrected to fix spelling of law firm name to Stroock & Stroock & Lavan from Strook & Strook & Lavan in paragraph 16)(Editing by Peter Cooney, Ros Krasny and Stephen Coates)",2014-01-31,IBM,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 12:44pm EST",Experts predict Lenovo's U.S. buys will pass regulatory muster,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-motorolamobility-lenovo-regulation-idUSBREA0U06C20140131?type=companyNews

CFIUS may also require that only U.S. citizens handle certain products and services or demand that certain products be located only in the United States.Lenovo has already been in touch with CFIUS about its latest U.S. deals, as is typical, said sources familiar with the process.PATENTS IN FOCUS A typical CFIUS analysis will touch on two sides - what threat may be posed by the foreign company involved and what vulnerabilities are exposed by the purchase, said Anne Salladin, a former Treasury official with CFIUS experience. ""I do think that both of these deals are likely candidates for mitigation measures,"" said Salladin, who is now at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP.Another former government official with CFIUS experience, Jonathan Gafni, said the review of the Motorola Mobility deal likely would not focus on handsets but on more complicated patents.Lenovo will receive more than 2,000 ""patent assets"" as part of the transaction, the companies said, although it is not known which ones will change hands. Gafni said regulators would want to give them extra scrutiny.""There are already a ton of Chinese handsets being sold in this country,"" said Gafni, now with Compass Point Analytics. ""I think it could take some time to figure it all out, but I don't see a big problem here.""In the end, experts said, Lenovo was likely to win CFIUS approval.""If there was a Chinese company that was well-positioned to see this deal come off, it's Lenovo,"" said Jim Lewis, a security expert with the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""They've done the dance before and they know what the steps are.""CFIUS, which is headed by the Treasury Department, usually takes 30 days to review simple deals, but may take an additional 45 days on more complicated transactions.Of the 23 transactions CFIUS reviewed in 2012, 10 were withdrawn and abandoned, according to the latest CFIUS annual report. One Chinese transaction was blocked in 2012 - the proposed purchase of an Oregon wind farm near a sensitive Navy installation.

49,"   By Matthew Miller | BEIJING  BEIJING A slide in IBM Corp's (IBM.N) sales in China amid a broad backlash against claims of U.S. government spying has triggered a rare visit to Beijing by Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty.The head of the world's biggest technology services company arrives in China's capital on Wednesday for three days of meetings with government leaders, according to people familiar with her visit. The visit comes as U.S. firms like IBM and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) seek to restore trust with Chinese regulators and reverse slumping sales.Beijing has encouraged state-owned companies to buy China-branded products since last year's revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of spying. That has undercut business at some U.S.-based multinationals operating in the world's second-biggest economy.In Beijing, Rometty will have meetings with Chinese officials including Vice Premier Wang Yang, responsible for helping to formulate China's economic policy. The IBM chief also is expected to meet officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and top state-backed customers.The precise agenda for the meetings couldn't be ascertained immediately.""IBM doesn't talk about or confirm our executives' travel plans,"" said New York-based company spokesman Edward Barbini.Though IBM books only about 5 percent of its sales in China, it has been operating there for 30 years, tapping into the country's rise as an economic power. China sales fell more than 20 percent over the second half of last year, dragging down the company's emerging markets business overall. It's an unwelcome distraction for the Armonk, N.Y.-based firm as it continues to embrace higher-margin software and technology services while moving away from hardware. Last month, IBM agreed to sell its low-end server business to Lenovo Group Ltd. (0992.HK), the Chinese firm that acquired IBM's ThinkPad business nearly a decade earlier.The $2.3 billion deal was struck at about one-half the reported asking price a year earlier, after the low-margin server business posted seven quarters of losses as clients moved to cloud computing.SECOND VISIT Rometty is the second top IBM executive to travel to Beijing in the last four months to meet Chinese officials. In November, IBM dispatched its head of governmental programs, Christopher Padilla, the former Under Secretary for International Trade at the U.S. Commerce Department, following announcement of the company's third-quarter earnings.Padilla met with Wang Chao, China's Vice Minister for Commerce, along with officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, according to people familiar with his visit.Rometty, in her meetings, is expected to emphasize the tech giant's commitment to local partnerships, future cooperation, and information security.In the aftermath of Snowden's revelations, U.S. technology companies, including IBM, ""face an uphill battle proving their equipment is not compromised"", A.M.

51,"   By Sinead Carew | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors who were shocked by Cisco Systems Inc's dire financial outlook in its last quarterly earnings report are bracing for more bad news when the network equipment maker reports results on Wednesday.Cisco warned on November 13 that revenue would decline as much as 10 percent in its second fiscal quarter ended in January and that it would not resume growth for several quarters.It blamed weak demand in emerging markets and from service provider customers as well as a backlash against U.S. government spying in China.Now, investors may face more gloomy predictions when the company reports fiscal second-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, according to analysts.""Expectations are pretty low. I think the company is not going to be upbeat,"" said Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold. ""They'll meet expectations on earnings, they'll tell us the environment is tough and that they're working to restore their growth.""Leopold said that some investors had hoped that the company was being overly cautious when it issued its bleak financial targets in November. But with few signs of improvement from the broader market, Leopold said that any hopes of a quick turnaround have faded.""That seemingly conservative guidance seems pretty appropriate,"" said Leopold, citing broader concerns about weakness in emerging markets and weak reports from other companies with exposure there.International Business Machines Corp, another U.S. technology bellwether with emerging markets exposure, missed its revenue expectations for the fourth quarter in a row in January, citing weakness in markets such as China. Wall Street on average expects Cisco to report earnings per share of 37 cents on revenue of $11.027 billion for its fiscal second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian Marshall said Cisco's woes could reach a trough in its fiscal third quarter but added that its ""outlook remains uncertain.""""We expect emerging market demand to remain challenged in the near-term and the service provider weakness appears to be more of a Cisco-specific issue,"" White said. The average analyst estimate is for fiscal third quarter revenue of $11.34 billion, which represents a slight sequential increase but a big decline from the year-ago revenue of $12.2 billion.Cisco shares, which closed at $24 on November 13 ahead of the company's warning, fell almost 16 percent to $20.24 by mid-December, when Cisco also cut its long-term growth targets.The stock has gradually improved and closed at $22.71 on Tuesday. But this is likely because of investors' long-term hopes rather than any illusions about a quick turnaround.""Anybody who's been buying here is certainly going to be patient,"" Leopold said.(Reporting by Sinead Carew; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-02-12,IBM,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 7:03pm EST",Cisco results to reflect sales slump; investors brace for more bad news,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-cisco-preview-idUSBREA1B00720140212?type=companyNews

Lenovo, the world's biggest maker of PCs, later specified it will likely take three to five quarters to turn around the Motorola phone business.Analysts say it may take the company at least that long to turn around its acquisitions. Heavyweights like Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc, dominant in global smartphones, will also provide stiff competition as Lenovo seeks to build up the Motorola business. ""I'm expecting a slowdown in the underlying, organic business,"" said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, a Hong Kong-based technology analyst at JI Asia, an affiliate of Societe Generale. ""It will be at least a year before Lenovo can turn around growth,"" he said, speaking before Yang's comments.DEJA VU Investors might be experiencing déjà vu. Motorola Mobility and the IBM x86 server unit currently lose money - Motorola alone lost more than $1 billion in 2013 - just as ThinkPad did when it became the Chinese company's way into businesses across the United States in 2005. After the ThinkPad deal, Lenovo's net income dropped sharply and only recovered after almost two years.To bring the new acquisitions into the fold, Lenovo plans to revive its tactic of integrating ThinkPad through cost-cutting, lower material costs and merging the business with its own supply chain.Lenovo will sell Motorola handsets and IBM servers through the same channels it uses for its own low-margin smartphones and its PC business, Yang said in a post-earnings call, without elaborating on financial targets.Lenovo said it plans to re-introduce the Motorola brand to its home country - a smartphone market now beginning to become saturated - as well as expanding to emerging markets. A key part of its strategy for IBM's low-end servers is to surf on Lenovo's presence in China, where it said server demand remains strong.But the sheer size of these deals - the price tag is close to half of Lenovo's market value - will weigh on the company for some time. Analysts don't expect the deals to be finalised until the third quarter of 2014 at the very earliest. ""They did not have a choice, they had to acquire a business to take their smartphones to the developed markets,"" said Lafayeedney. ""They cannot waste the kind of time needed to grow organically into developed markets,"" the analyst said, speaking before the October-December earnings were announced.AHEAD OF ESTIMATES Lenovo on Thursday reported net income of $265.3 million for the October-December quarter, ended before the acquisitions splurge. That was well above the $204.9 million it posted a year earlier, as well as a $247.2 million consensus forecast on Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate.Although Lenovo is the world's fourth-biggest manufacturer of smartphones by shipments as of the quarter ended December, according to data firm IDC, the company is still dependent on China for the vast majority of its sales.Of the 13.9 million handsets Lenovo shipped in that quarter according to IDC, Lenovo said on Thursday only 2 million, or 14 percent, of those were sold outside China.Yang told analysts in a conference call the smartphone unit does not yet contribute a lot to the overall profit of Lenovo, particularly in China, where margins are slimmer than in other markets. Overall China smartphone shipments fell for the first time in more than two years in the quarter ended December, declining 4.3 percent quarter-on-quarter to 90.8 million handsets, according to IDC.The speed and scale of the buying spree - partly paid for by issuing new shares - spooked some investors. Earlier this month Lenovo shares tumbled 16 percent in one day after a report said the company was interested in buying Sony Corp's Vaio PC division.Lenovo shares have dropped 8.7 percent since the start of the year, compared with the Hong Kong index's loss of 4.82 percent.

54,"  * Q3 net profit $265.3 mln, up 29 pct from year earlier* Acquisitions to weigh on earnings in short term -CEO* Profit recovery after 2005 ThinkPad buy took two yearsBy Paul CarstenBEIJING, Feb 13 Lenovo Group Ltd  leader Yang Yuanqing says the Chinese technology giant will draw on cost-cutting lessons learned when it bought IBM Corp's  ThinkPad laptop unit to turn losses into profit at businesses acquired for $5.2 billion last month.Reporting third-quarter profit jumped 29 percent, Lenovo's chief executive warned the drive to turn around the Motorola handset business it bought from Google Inc and the computer server unit it bought from IBM will squeeze earnings in the short term.For Yang, the pain may only last ""a couple of quarters"" after the deals close, he said, and is worth it: though October-December personal computer sales were strong, the aggressive acquisitions are a key plank in Lenovo's search for future sources of growth as the broader desktop PC market shrinks and computer users go mobile.""In the short term (the deals) will have a negative impact on performance,"" Yang said in a telephone interview after the earnings were announced. Lenovo, the world's biggest maker of PCs, later specified it will likely take three to five quarters to turn around the Motorola phone business.Analysts say it may take the company at least that long to turn around its acquisitions. Heavyweights like Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc, dominant in global smartphones, will also provide stiff competition as Lenovo seeks to build up the Motorola business.""I'm expecting a slowdown in the underlying, organic business,"" said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, a Hong Kong-based technology analyst at JI Asia, an affiliate of Societe Generale. ""It will be at least a year before Lenovo can turn around growth,"" he said, speaking before Yang's comments. DEJA VU Investors might be experiencing déjà vu. Motorola Mobility and the IBM x86 server unit currently lose money - Motorola alone lost more than $1 billion in 2013 - just as ThinkPad did when it became the Chinese company's way into businesses across the United States in 2005.After the ThinkPad deal, Lenovo's net income dropped sharply and only recovered after almost two years. To bring the new acquisitions into the fold, Lenovo plans to revive its tactic of integrating ThinkPad through cost-cutting, lower material costs and merging the business with its own supply chain.Lenovo will sell Motorola handsets and IBM servers through the same channels it uses for its own low-margin smartphones and its PC business, Yang said in a post-earnings call, without elaborating on financial targets.Lenovo said it plans to re-introduce the Motorola brand to its home country - a smartphone market now beginning to become saturated - as well as expanding to emerging markets. A key part of its strategy for IBM's low-end servers is to surf on Lenovo's presence in China, where it said server demand remains strong.But the sheer size of these deals - the price tag is close to half of Lenovo's market value - will weigh on the company for some time. Analysts don't expect the deals to be finalised until the third quarter of 2014 at the very earliest. ""They did not have a choice, they had to acquire a business to take their smartphones to the developed markets,"" said Lafayeedney. ""They cannot waste the kind of time needed to grow organically into developed markets,"" the analyst said, speaking before the October-December earnings were announced.AHEAD OF ESTIMATES Lenovo on Thursday reported net income of $265.3 million for the October-December quarter, ended before the acquisitions splurge.

The two groups had proposed building plants in India in September.One of the consortia is made up of India's Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and TowerJazz and IBM. It plans to set up a plant near New Delhi at a cost of 343.99 billion rupees ($5.52 billion), a government statement said on Friday. The second comprises HSMC Technologies India Private Ltd, Malaysia's Silterra and STMicroelectronics. The group has  proposed investment of 290.13 billion rupees ($4.65 billion) for a plant in the western Gujarat state, the statement said. The final agreements for the two plants are expected to be signed by August. With a view to attract chipmakers to set up plants in India, the government is offering concessions including 25 percent  subsidy on capital spending, tax breaks, and interest-free loans of about 51.24 billion rupees to each plant.India's demand for electronics products is forecast to rise nearly 10 times during this decade to reach $400 billion by 2020, causing policy makers to worry that electronics imports, with no major local manufacturing, could exceed those of oil.",2014-02-14,IBM,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 4:36am EST",India approves two semiconductor wafer plants worth $10 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/india-semiconductor-idUSL3N0LJ3GO20140214?type=companyNews

65,"  (Adds details from argument and background)By Lawrence HurleyWASHINGTON, March 31 U.S. Supreme Court justices stepped gingerly into a raging debate over computer software on Monday, voicing concerns about vaguely defined patents but signaling they would avoid any radical change to existing law.This may help tech companies fend off lawsuits filed by ""patent trolls,"" defined as companies that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products, but not as much as a broad ruling would.For companies holding many patents, such as IBM Corp , a narrow ruling from the court would be better than a broader decision that tightened patent eligibility.From their questions during an hour-long oral argument, the justices appeared likely to rule, as expected, that patents held by Australian company Alice Corp Pty Ltd for a computer system that facilitates financial transactions were not patent eligible. CLS Bank International, which uses similar technology, challenged the patents in 2007.Although some of the nine justices signaled a willingness to go further and provide new guidance to lower courts that would describe exactly what types of computer-implemented inventions were patent eligible, others suggested there was no need for so broad a ruling. A ruling is expected by the end of June.If the court were to avoid any major pronouncements, the outcome could mirror a 2010 case, Bilski v. Kappos, in which the court was expected to offer guidance on business method patents but eventually issued a relatively narrow 9-0 decision. COMPANIES WATCHING CLOSELY Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether a proposed test, suggested by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli on behalf of President Barack Obama's administration, would make the complex issue any clearer.""I'm just doubtful that's going to bring about greater clarity and certainty,"" Roberts said of the proposal.Justice Sonia Sotomayor also suggested the court might steer clear of the broader question. ""Why do we have to ... reach software patents at all in this case?"" she asked Verrilli.The case is being closely watched by a broad swath of companies in the technology sector and beyond.Google Inc, Dell Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Microsoft Corp, and Hewlett-Packard Co were among a large list of companies that filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of CLS. A smaller number, including engine manufacturer Cummins Inc , supported Alice, while others, like IBM, supported neither side.Companies vary over what kind of eligibility threshold they would prefer. Those that often get sued for patent infringement, such as Google, favor a tighter definition. Those that want to protect their many patents, such as IBM, would prefer that most software be patent eligible. LOWER COURT SPLIT In May 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., ruled for CLS but the judges were split 5-5 on which legal test to adopt.On the patents contested in the case, several justices, including Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, suggested  they appeared to be too abstract to be eligible for patents. Previous Supreme Court rulings have said abstract ideas are generally not eligible for patents unless the inventor shows a way of applying the idea.Making references to ancient Greek inventor Archimedes and other historical figures, Justice Stephen Breyer was one of the court members who appeared keen on a ruling that would have broad application.On the one hand, he noted, patent eligibility that is too broad creates monopolies and reduces competition down to ""who has the best patent lawyer."" On the other hand, if patent eligibility is too strict, it could ""rule out real inventions with computers,"" he added.The case is Alice Corp v.

72,"  * China GDP grows 7.4 pct, slightly ahead of forecasts     * European shares rebound, Wall Street rallies, Yahoo shines     * Oil rises close to $110 on mounting Ukraine tension   (Adds close of U.S. markets, Google, IBM results)     By Herbert Lash     NEW YORK, April 16 Global equity markets advanced broadly on Wednesday after China reported growth that beat expectations, providing relief to investors worried about the Chinese economy, while the dollar eased on the growing view the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates lower than normal for a few years.     Fed Chair Janet Yellen told the Economic Club of New York that the U.S. economy appeared to be slowly moving toward full employment, but that it would need help from the central bank for some time to come.      Yellen said that achieving the Fed's economic goals ""will likely require low real interest rates for some time,"" a policy view she said was shared broadly across many advanced economies.     Wall Street rallied for a third straight day, and the three major stock gauges climbed 1 percent or more.     China's economy grew 7.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, topping forecasts of 7.3 percent. There had been speculation that growth would be closer to 7 percent after a string of recent soft numbers.         Relief rippled through Asian markets, then spread to Europe and Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei ended up 3 percent, its biggest gain since February.      MSCI's all-country world index rose 1.02 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares closed up 1.2 percent at 1,322.51 points. Yet many traders pegged the gain as a technical rebound after a 1 percent decline in the previous session.      Earlier this month, the European index hit a near six-year high, a rally that has been halted by worries over the crisis in Ukraine as well as worries about China, the world's second biggest economy.     ""There is a lot of concern about Chinese growth this year, so there is some relief in the GDP number,"" said Jim Russell, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati. ""We think that is influencing the market today.""     On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 162.29 points, or 1 percent, to 16,424.85. The S&P 500  gained 19.33 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,862.31, and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.064 points, or 1.29 percent, to 4,086.225.     Yahoo was the leading percentage gainer on the S&P 500 as investors focused on the company's 24 percent stake in Chinese internet company Alibaba Group Holding Inc IPO-ALIB.N, which reported a surge in quarterly revenue growth in the last quarter of 2013. Yahoo shares jumped 6.26 percent to $36.35.        Google Inc , after the market close, reported its Internet business revenue grew 19 percent in the first quarter, falling short of Wall Street targets as the price of its online ads continued to decline.     Shares of Google were down 5.8 percent at $524.40 in after-hours trading.      International Business Machines Corp reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as weakness in its storage and server businesses continued to offset gains in its software services. IBM shares fell about 4 percent to $188.40 in after-hours trade.     In U.S. economic news, industrial production rose at a faster-than-expected clip in March, the latest sign the economy was gaining momentum.      Groundbreaking for new homes also increased but remained well below the post-recession peak hit in November, signaling the drag the housing market is placing on the economy.     The euro rose 0.01 percent to $1.3813. There were also more bond gains for former trouble spots Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece.      The 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped 1/32 of a point in price, boosting its yield to 2.6337 percent, as the growth in China reduced demand for safe-haven government bonds.           But mounting risks in Ukraine after Russia declared the country to be on the brink of civil war and Kiev said an ""anti-terrorist operation"" against pro-Moscow separatists was under way helped drive up oil prices.      Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebels staged rival shows of force in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, though hopes remained that talks in Switzerland on Thursday between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union could cool the situation.     Global oil prices rose close to $110 a barrel but gave up some gains after an unexpectedly large build in crude stocks in the United States, the world's largest consumer of oil.      Brent crude for June delivery rose by a dollar earlier in the session but pared gains to settle up 24 cents at $109.60 a barrel.      U.S. crude for May delivery also rose more than $1 before paring gains immediately after closely watched data form the U.S. Energy Information Administration was released. U.S. crude settled 1 cent higher at $103.76 a barrel.     Crude oil stocks rose 10 million barrels to 394 million barrels in the week ending April 11, according to the EIA data, far more than the 2.3 million-barrel build expected by analysts.

75,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Mexican mobile phone operator Iusacell SA de CV sued IBM Corp on Wednesday, accusing the U.S. technology giant of making fraudulent representations that caused it to lose $2.5 billion in profits.The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York, centered on a contract that Iusacell said IBM induced it to enter into in Mexico.""Events subsequent to the execution of the agreement have revealed that IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during the parties' relationship,"" Iusacell said in the complaint.IBM said in a statement that the lawsuit was a ""transparent attempt"" by Iusacell, which is co-owned by media and retail mogul Ricardo Salinas' Grupo Salinas and broadcast giant Grupo Televisa, to avoid its contractual obligations.IBM said it signed a long-term contract with Iusacell in 2010 under which IBM's Mexican unit made significant investments in Iusacell's business. ""Despite major improvement to Iusacell's information technology infrastructure and growth in Iusacell's revenues, Iusacell has failed to pay IBM Mexico what it is owed under the contract,"" IBM said in the statement.IBM's Mexican unit already has filed an arbitration claim against Iusacell in an effort to enforce the contract, according to IBM, which called Wednesday's lawsuit an ""ill-advised attempt to end-run"" that case.A spokesman for Grupo Salinas had no immediate comment on the case and a lawyer for Iusacell did not respond to a request for comment. According to the lawsuit, Iusacell's management designed a plan to boost the market share and revenue of the company, which was then the third-largest mobile phone operator in Mexico.Doubtful its existing information technology systems could support the plan, Iusacell sought advice from IBM, the lawsuit said. Several pages of the complaint are then redacted, leaving it unclear what happened next. Iusacell, however, said in the lawsuit that IBM's capacity limits crippled its performance.It is not known why parts of the complaint were redacted. Companies sometimes seek to keep material confidential to protect trade secrets.The lawsuit seeks $2.5 billion in damages. Iusacell said its claims are governed by Mexican law, which entitles it to both actual damages and lost profits that stemmed from its reliance on the alleged IBM misrepresentations.The case is Iusacell SA de CV v. International Business Machines Corporation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-2697.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; additional reporting by Jon Stempel in New York and Michael O'Boyle and Dave Graham in Mexico City; Editing by Paul Simao)",2014-04-16,IBM,"Wed Apr 16, 2014 | 2:59pm EDT",Mexican mobile phone operator sues IBM for $2.5 billion,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ibm-mexico-idUSBREA3F19G20140416?type=companyNews

78,"  (Adds response from IBM)By Nate RaymondNEW YORK, April 16 Mexican mobile phone operator Iusacell SA de CV sued IBM Corp on Wednesday, accusing the U.S. technology giant of making fraudulent representations that caused it to lose $2.5 billion in profits.The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York, centered on a contract that Iusacell said IBM induced it to enter into in Mexico.""Events subsequent to the execution of the agreement have revealed that IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during the parties' relationship,"" Iusacell said in the complaint.IBM said in a statement that the lawsuit was a ""transparent attempt"" by Iusacell, which is co-owned by media and retail mogul Ricardo Salinas' Grupo Salinas and broadcast giant Grupo Televisa, to avoid its contractual obligations. IBM said it signed a long-term contract with Iusacell in 2010 under which IBM's Mexican unit made significant investments in Iusacell's business.""Despite major improvement to Iusacell's information technology infrastructure and growth in Iusacell's revenues, Iusacell has failed to pay IBM Mexico what it is owed under the contract,"" IBM said in the statement.IBM's Mexican unit already has filed an arbitration claim against Iusacell in an effort to enforce the contract, according to IBM, which called Wednesday's lawsuit an ""ill-advised attempt to end-run"" that case. A spokesman for Grupo Salinas had no immediate comment on the case and a lawyer for Iusacell did not respond to a request for comment.According to the lawsuit, Iusacell's management designed a plan to boost the market share and revenue of the company, which was then the third-largest mobile phone operator in Mexico. Doubtful its existing information technology systems could support the plan, Iusacell sought advice from IBM, the lawsuit said. Several pages of the complaint are then redacted, leaving it unclear what happened next.Iusacell, however, said in the lawsuit that IBM's capacity limits crippled its performance.It is not known why parts of the complaint were redacted. Companies sometimes seek to keep material confidential to protect trade secrets.The lawsuit seeks $2.5 billion in damages. Iusacell said its claims are governed by Mexican law, which entitles it to both actual damages and lost profits that stemmed from its reliance on the alleged IBM misrepresentations.The case is Iusacell SA de CV v. International Business Machines Corporation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-2697.

84,"   By Supantha Mukherjee and Soham Chatterjee  IBM Corp (IBM.N), the world's biggest technology services company, reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years on Wednesday, as Big Blue struggles with falling demand for its hardware and faces challenges in growth markets like China.Shares of IBM fell as much as 4 percent to $188.20 in after-hours trade.Revenue for the Armonk, NY-based firm fell 4 percent to $22.5 billion in the first quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $22.91 billion.""They have had eight revenue declines in a row,"" said Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter, which is widely read by investors. ""They have missed so many times, it's hard to keep track of it.""IBM's first-quarter revenue was the lowest the company reported since the first quarter of 2009, when revenue was $21.71 billion.Hardware revenue, which includes servers and systems storage, plunged 23 percent to $2.4 billion, as sales in growth markets declined 11 percent, led by Asia-Pacific, where reported revenue declined 12 percent.IBM has been restructuring its business and laying-off workers in efforts to achieve its targeted operating earnings of $20 per share by 2015. In January, the company agreed to sell its low-end server business to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) for $2.3 billion in January.The company on Wednesday reiterated its full-year operating earnings target of $18 per share.""They used to be a leader,"" said Hickey, who has followed IBM for 30 years. ""Now they sell one business after the next. That is not a way to grow.""All segments of IBM's systems and technology business reported double-digit declines, led by the System z segment, which fell 40 percent.The company warned that its hardware business may continue to face hurdles.""As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our hardware business,"" Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call.CHINA WOES  Revenue in the Americas fell 4 percent, while revenue in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China declined 11 percent, led by China where revenue fell by 20 percent.Although IBM books only about 5 percent of its sales in China, declining revenue over the last three quarters has been dragging down the company's emerging markets business overall.Chief Executive Ginni Rometty has visited China on two occasions in the last three months, seeking to restore trust with Chinese regulators in the wake of last year's revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of spying. That has undercut business at some U.S.-based multinationals operating in the world's second-biggest economy.In February, Rometty held meetings with Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Wang Yang, who is responsible for helping to formulate China's economic policy.""We expect it will take some time for our business in China to improve,"" Schroeter said.Software was the only major business to show some growth, with revenue rising 1.6 percent to $5.66 billion, but the growth rate was slower than the fourth quarter's 2.8 percent.Last month, the technology research firm Gartner reported that IBM lost its spot as the world's No. 2 software make behind Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) claimed that spot, which IBM had held for years.

The annual run rate of cloud delivered as a service doubled from last year to $2.3 billion.Moving to the cloud allows businesses to cut costs by ditching bulky servers for network-based software and using remote data centers run by technology companies.Recently, IBM has bought two companies to expand its cloud business, Silverpop, a developer of cloud-based marketing software, and cloud-based database software startup Cloudant. The company spent $3.1 billion to acquire 10 companies in 2013.In January, IBM said it will invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the television quiz show ""Jeopardy"" - deployed on SoftLayer cloud computing infrastructure business the company bought last year.The global cloud services market last year grew by almost a fifth to an estimated $131 billion, according to research firm Gartner.

Lenovo is acquiring System x.)* First-quarter revenue falls 4 pct to $22.5 bln* Software only major business to show growth* Shares decline 4 pct in extended tradingBy Supantha Mukherjee and Soham ChatterjeeApril 16 IBM Corp, the world's biggest technology services company, reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years on Wednesday, as Big Blue struggles with falling demand for its hardware and faces challenges in growth markets like China.Shares of IBM fell as much as 4 percent to $188.20 in after-hours trade.Revenue for the Armonk, NY-based firm fell 4 percent to $22.5 billion in the first quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $22.91 billion.""They have had eight revenue declines in a row,"" said Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter, which is widely read by investors. ""They have missed so many times, it's hard to keep track of it.""IBM's first-quarter revenue was the lowest the company reported since the first quarter of 2009, when revenue was $21.71 billion.Hardware revenue, which includes servers and systems storage, plunged 23 percent to $2.4 billion, as sales in growth markets declined 11 percent, led by Asia-Pacific, where reported revenue declined 12 percent.IBM has been restructuring its business and laying-off workers in efforts to achieve its targeted operating earnings of $20 per share by 2015. In January, the company agreed to sell its low-end server business to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd  for $2.3 billion in January.The company on Wednesday reiterated its full-year operating earnings target of $18 per share.""They used to be a leader,"" said Hickey, who has followed IBM for 30 years. ""Now they sell one business after the next. That is not a way to grow.""All segments of IBM's systems and technology business reported double-digit declines, led by the System z segment, which fell 40 percent. The company warned that its hardware business may continue to face hurdles.""As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our hardware business,"" Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call.CHINA WOES Revenue in the Americas fell 4 percent, while revenue in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China declined 11 percent, led by China where revenue fell by 20 percent.Although IBM books only about 5 percent of its sales in China, declining revenue over the last three quarters has been dragging down the company's emerging markets business overall.Chief Executive Ginni Rometty has visited China on two occasions in the last three months, seeking to restore trust with Chinese regulators in the wake of last year's revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of spying. That has undercut business at some U.S.-based multinationals operating in the world's second-biggest economy.In February, Rometty held meetings with Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Wang Yang, who is responsible for helping to formulate China's economic policy. [ID:nL3N0KQ3DL} ""We expect it will take some time for our business in China to improve,"" Schroeter said.Software was the only major business to show some growth, with revenue rising 1.6 percent to $5.66 billion, but the growth rate was slower than the fourth quarter's 2.8 percent.Last month, the technology research firm Gartner reported that IBM lost its spot as the world's No. 2 software make behind Microsoft Corp. Oracle Corp claimed that spot, which IBM had held for years.""They are not yet getting the kind of lift off of software that they would need to pump up overall IBM revenues into positive growth territory,"" Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels said.BETTING ON CLOUD IBM plans to spend more than $1.2 billion to expand its web-based software products, better known as cloud computing.IBM said its cloud revenue was up more than 50 percent in the quarter.

96,"  * Micro magazine cover shows two pandas* Inspiration was to chisel rock, but ""on nano scale""* Work done by IBM scientist for National GeographicZURICH, April 25 A laboratory in Switzerland has created the smallest magazine cover in the world, using a tiny chisel to create an image so minute that 2,000 of them could fit on a grain of salt. Scientists carved the 11x14-micrometre image of two pandas that appeared on last month's cover of the National Geographic Kids magazine onto a polymer using technology similar to 3D printing.""My idea was to do something similar to chiselling a rock, but just to do it on a nano-scale,"" said Urs Duerig, a scientist at IBM in Switzerland and one of the inventors of the machine. The device, roughly the size of a family refrigerator, used a tiny chisel with a heatable silicon tip 100,000 times smaller than a sharpened pencil point to cut out the image.The technology could be used to make transistors, as well as nano-sized security tags to prevent the forgery of money, passports and artwork, scientists involved said. ""The application range is quite broad,"" said Felix Holzner, chief executive of SwissLitho, a startup to which the IBM technology has been licensed. ""It's like a 3D printer on a microscopic scale - you can make any structure you want but a million times smaller with this machine.""At the moment, the high-tech machines, which cost around 500,000 euros ($691,500), are intended as research tools rather than for use in the production industry, Holzner said.National Geographic Kids, which commissioned the project, will unveil its Guinness world record title for the smallest magazine cover in Washington, D.C. on Friday.

Lawson Software on March 14, 2011 announced it had received an unsolicited offer, which it later accepted, to be acquired by Infor Global Solutions and an affiliate of private equity firm Golden Gate Capital for about $1.8 billion, or $11.25 per share.According to the SEC, media and analyst reports, including from Reuters, were speculating at the time that suitors including Hewlett-Packard Co, International Business Machines Corp, Oracle Corp and SAP AG  might offer higher bids, but that Richard Lawson told his brother and Cerullo this was not the case. The SEC said William Lawson, a third party tipped by him and Cerullo together made over $2 million by selling more than 1.8 million shares at prices inflated by the speculation.It said that when a definitive $11.25 per share merger for Lawson Software was announced on April 26, 2011, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company's stock price fell 8.8 percent.

110,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch and Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK IBM, one of the most reliable companies when it comes to buying back shares, is scaling back its repurchases just as the market seems to have grown weary of this strategy.Buybacks have been fruitful for companies and shareholders in recent years. Firms with larger buybacks outperformed the market for several quarters, but that streak is in jeopardy, as the S&P 500 Buyback Index is down 0.2 percent for the quarter.The index, made up of 100 companies with the largest buyback ratio, is facing its first quarterly decline since the second quarter of 2012, when it was down 3.7 percent. It has outperformed the S&P 500 in the last six quarters but trails the broader benchmark so far in the second quarter.Corporate buybacks have been strong in recent years, but higher stock valuations reduce the lift companies get from their repurchases. As economic growth improves, companies are more likely to invest in longer-term projects, such as capital expenditures.""With valuations not as attractive as where they were, it makes sense that investors are going to be a bit more selective and not reward buybacks as broadly as they had for the last couple of years,"" said Jill Carey, U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. ""If growth starts to pick up, we think companies should start to do more investing in growth: capex or M&A.""S&P 500 companies that initiated buybacks in the first three months of 2014 underperformed the benchmark index by 0.25 percent in the month after announcing, while a similar group outperformed the index by 1.29 percent in the same period a year ago, date from Birinyi Associates showed.A quarter of the biggest buybacks have come from the pricey consumer discretionary sector, Carey said. The sector's forward four-quarter P/E ratio is 17.8, above the S&P 500's 15.2, Thomson Reuters data showed. With at least $153 billion executed in the first quarter, S&P 500 buybacks could mark the second-biggest total ever once final numbers are tallied, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple accounted for $18 billion of the total.To be sure, companies with ongoing buyback programs tend to benefit more than others, said Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup in New York. ""Buying back your stock for a short-term pop in your earnings isn't going to get rewarded by the Street, if it is only a short-term phenomenon,"" he said.A Citigroup index of companies that consistently buy back shares has more than doubled the S&P's return dating to 2002. This group includes IBM.IBM spent more on buybacks than any S&P 500 company other than Exxon Mobil in the last five years. It said in its recent earnings call that it expects to finish the year with repurchases down a bit from last year. For 2013, the company's buybacks totaled about $13.9 billion.Its shares are down 3.4 percent in the second quarter, after gaining 2.6 percent in the first.(Additional reporting by Ryan Vlastelica; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2014-05-22,IBM,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 12:37pm EDT",U.S. companies see smaller lift from stock buybacks,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-markets-buybacks-idUSBREA4L0UN20140522?type=companyNews

China has also told state-owned enterprises to sever links with U.S. consulting firms, The Financial Times reported on Sunday.

He said the approach could have been used to deliver lethal doses of insulin to patients. Medtronic later that year hired security consultants to review the safety of its insulin pumps after a second research team found more vulnerabilities in the devices, which they said were also potentially lethal.Radcliffe most recently worked as a senior security analyst at InGuardians Inc. Prior to that, he spent more than a decade holding various posts at Internet Security Systems, which IBM  bought in 2006. Radcliffe said in a blog posted on Rapid7's website that he will continue his research on hacking medical devices, which has become a passion.""Emerging technologies in the medical world are often ill-equipped for the dangers that the interconnected world faces, and we need spokespeople to draw attention to these dangers,"" he said in the blog. ""As a diabetic, who depends on these interconnected devices to live, I find myself as an advocate in this arena.""

118,"  (Adds Breakingviews link)By Lawrence HurleyWASHINGTON, June 19 The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday modestly cut back on software patents by ruling that simply implementing an abstract idea using a computer does not make an invention eligible to be patented.On a 9-0 vote, the court ruled for CLS Bank International, which challenged patents held by Australia-based Alice Corporation Pty Ltd for a computer system that facilitates financial transactions. The court added some clarity to a confused area of the law concerning when software can be patented but did not provide a definitive test on when software can be patented as some had hoped.The ruling left open questions about under what circumstances the use of a computer adds enough to the idea to make it patent eligible.At a minimum, the ruling is likely to help tech companies fend off lawsuits filed by ""patent trolls,"" defined as companies that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products. ""It's going to clear away a lot of illegitimate claims pretty quickly,"" said Andrew Pincus, a lawyer with the Mayer Brown law firm who filed a brief on behalf of a technology trade group.The ruling in some ways mirrors a 2010 case, Bilski v. Kappos, in which the court was expected to offer guidance on business method patents but eventually issued a relatively narrow 9-0 decision.In Thursday's majority opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the outcome was determined by two of the court's recent patent rulings. ""We hold that the claims at issue are drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement and that merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention,"" Thomas wrote.The legal question boiled down to how innovative an invention should be to receive legal protection.The U.S. Patent Act states that anyone who ""invents or discovers a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,"" or an improvement of an existing one, can get a patent. An invention related to an abstract idea can be patented, but it must include a way of applying the idea. Google Inc, Dell In c , Verizon Communications Inc, and Microsoft Corp were among the companies that filed legal papers weighing in on the issue.Companies differ over what kind of eligibility threshold they would prefer. Those that often get sued for patent infringement, such as Google, favor a tighter definition. Those that want to protect their own patents, such as IBM Corp, would prefer that most software be patent eligible.In May 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled for CLS but the judges were split 5-5 on which legal test to adopt.The case is Alice Corp v. CLS Bank, U.S. Supreme Court, No.13-298(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Howard Goller and Grant McCool)",2014-06-19,IBM,"Thu Jun 19, 2014 | 5:42pm EDT",UPDATE 3-U.S. top court issues narrow ruling on software patents,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-court-ip-idUSL2N0P00OG20140619?type=companyNews

132,"   By David Stanway | BEIJING  BEIJING IBM Corp has signed an agreement with the city of Beijing to use advanced weather forecasting and cloud computing technologies to help tackle the Chinese capital's persistent smog.After a series of pollution scares and scandals, China's central government has promised to reverse some of the damage done to the nation's sky, rivers and soil by more than three decades of growth. But China has first had to improve data collection, monitoring and forecasting capabilities before it can work on cutting smog and pollution.Beijing city already uses an alerting system based on data from 35 monitoring stations, allowing it to shut schools and factories and cut traffic three days in advance, but residents still complain that not enough is being done.""Predicting is helpful because it helps prevent exposure, but it is not enough if it is only about knowing which days to put on masks or stay indoors,"" said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Environmental and Public Affairs, a non-government group that works to improve emissions data transparency.    Under the agreement with IBM, Beijing's city government will be one of the partners in the company's China-focused 10-year ""Green Horizon"" initiative, which aims to draw on IBM's forecasting expertise and the collection of real-time emissions data to predict smog build-ups. ""It is about how we can help cities improve management based on 'Big Data', and better predict (pollution) with accuracy so the government can take proactive action,"" said Xiaowei Shen, China director of IBM Research, speaking at IBM's lab in Beijing's northwest high-tech district of Zhongguancun.        With China committed to reducing the share of coal in its energy mix, IBM's cloud-based analytic systems could also be tailored to make better use of renewable energy, Shen said.  At the Zhangbei wind and solar power demonstration project run by the State Grid Corp in northern Hebei province, for instance, a supply and demand management system from IBM has helped reduce wasted power to just 20 percent from 30 percent.Better data about the make-up of the Beijing's pollution could also lead to more effective action, said Wang Tao, resident scholar at the energy and climate change program at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.""They can find out if stopping cars running is more effective, or stopping pollution from heavy industries,"" Wang said. IBM representatives said the Green Horizon initiative could generate new commercial opportunities in pollution control and renewable energy in China.IBM's sales in China have slumped since last year, hurt by a backlash against U.S.-based multinationals in the wake of revelations that the United States has been spying on foreign subjects and governments.

133,"   By Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON IBM announced on Wednesday it will invest $3 billion over the next five years in chip research and development in hopes of finding a game-changing breakthrough that can help revive its  slumping hardware unit.IBM announced the plan a week before its widely anticipated second quarter earnings. Last quarter, sales in its hardware sector plunged 23 percent from a year earlier and the company posted its lowest quarterly revenue in five years.IBM hopes to find ways to scale and shrink silicon chips to make them more efficient, and research new materials to use in making chips, such as carbon nanotubes, which are more stable than silicon and are also heat resistant and can provide faster connections.""The message to our investors is that we are committed to this space, we believe there is great innovation possible that will be necessary in world of big data analytics, said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president of IBM's Systems and Technology Group.""These are essential ingredients in delivering the kind of performance the world will demand. The world is demanding it now and will continue to demand it for the next 10 years,"" he said.  The investment is equal to half of all IBM's research and development last year. The company is preparing to divest its chip manufacturing business to focus on intellectual property. The company is rumored to be close to a deal with chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc.  At an investor briefing in May, IBM's Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said new research and development was essential to refreshing the hardware sector, which he expects to stabilize in 2014 and grow in 2015. Silicon chips, which have been made smaller every year, are reaching a point of diminishing returns, preventing chips from delivering performance improvements demanded by new technology,  the company said.     ""You might say this is not a good time to be in the silicon chip business, but it is a great time to be ready for the next thing. This is the next thing,"" said Richard Doherty a research director at The Envisioneering Group in Seaford, NY. IBM is the only major company investing in carbon chip research. As demand grows for faster speeds, the investment could put it miles ahead of competitors like Oracle and HP, said Doherty.Most electricity going through silicon chips gets released as heat, said Doherty, with only 30 percent going toward electricity.  ""Silicon-electron mobility is like moving through snow. You can't run as fast,"" he said. One substance IBM has already done some research on is graphene, a pure carbon through which IBM says electrons can move 10 times faster than in silicon. The company plans to invest more on research in this area.The new chips would allow for faster computing processes that could lead to artificial intelligence and high power cognitive computing. The company hopes the investment will lead to technology that allows computer systems to emulate the  brain's efficiency, size and power usage, it said.((Refiled to fix garble in paragraph 11) (Reporting By Marina Lopes; Editing by David Gregorio)",2014-07-09,IBM,"Wed Jul 9, 2014 | 6:09pm EDT",IBM to bet $3 bln over 5 years hoping for breakthrough in chips,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ibm-hardware-investment-idUSKBN0FE2HW20140709?type=companyNews

Providing further support, figures from the U.S. Labor Department showed producer prices rose more than expected in June with gains across most categories.      China's economic growth picked up slightly in the second quarter, topping market expectations, as the economy benefited from the government's stimulus measures.      The Canadian benchmark index has risen nearly 12 percent this year, more than most of its global peers. Some investors have worried that the gains might be setting the market up for a correction.     ""Stocks are reasonably valued, but they're certainly not a screaming bargain,"" said Bob Gorman, chief portfolio strategist at TD Wealth, who does not expect the recent rally in energy and gold-mining shares to continue in the second half of 2014.

""There can be little question that it is unwelcome, if not entirely unexpected news.""BlackBerry's stock has been on a tear this year. As of Tuesday, it was up more than 50 percent as some investors  became more optimistic about the company's future. News of the Apple-IBM venture took some of the steam out of the stock on Wednesday.BlackBerry shares fell 9.4 percent to $10.24 on Nasdaq and 9.3 percent to C$11.03 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after analysts said the alliance could hurt the turnaround plans.IBM said late Tuesday the tie-up will offer services geared toward security and mobile device management, an area viewed as BlackBerry's strong suit and a key selling point in its battle to win back market share from the iPhone and devices powered by Google Inc's Android software. ""The partnership's software around data security and device management pose immediate threats to mobile device management (MDM) software solutions deployed by firms such as BlackBerry and MobileIron,"" said Morningstar analyst Brian Colello in a note to clients.""Even if Apple-IBM's security 'mousetrap' isn't as good as ones offered by BlackBerry and others, these MDM vendors will have to overcome the extremely high hurdle of displacing IBM's mobile device software preloaded on iPhones and iPads.""BlackBerry downplayed the threat posed by the alliance. ""The news that Apple is partnering with IBM to expand into the enterprise mobility market only underscores the ongoing need for secure end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions like those BlackBerry has delivered for years,"" said the company in a brief statement.BlackBerry said it remained the leader in this market, with the necessary software and network to secure data for enterprise clients.UBS analyst Amitabh Passi warned, however, that competition for Blackberry in the enterprise mobile management market is set to intensify after recent deals such as IBM's acquisition of Fiberlink, VMware's takeover of AirWatch and the Citrix-Zenprise deal.""Blackberry now finds itself competing against much larger and established enterprise vendors, as well as smaller, but better capitalized vendors like Mobileiron,"" said Passi in a note to clients.The shares of Mobileiron Inc, a small recently listed player in the sector, also fell sharply - down nearly 6 percent at $8.16 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

Providing further support, figures from the U.S. Labor Department showed producer prices rose more than expected in June with gains across most categories.      China's economic growth picked up slightly in the second quarter, topping market expectations, as it benefited from the government's stimulus measures.      ""It should create more demand for resources. That's a positive,"" said Andy Nasr, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Middlefield Capital.     ""An improvement in the U.S. economy will have a very good impact on the Canadian economy,"" he added.     The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index  was up 109.61 points, or 0.73 percent, at 15,190.93.     The index is up nearly 12 percent this year, but some investors are worried about valuations getting extended and the likelihood of a possible correction.     ""We're susceptible to a pullback, but I will use a pullback as a buying opportunity,"" Nasr said.     Nine of the 10 main sectors on the index were higher on Wednesday.     Financials, the index's most heavily weighted sector, added 0.6 percent. Bank of Nova Scotia gained 0.9 percent to C$73.38.     Shares of energy producers reflected a rise in the price of U.S. crude oil. Suncor Energy Inc climbed 1.1 percent to C$44.67, and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd rose 1.1 percent to C$47.92.     The gold-mining sector rebounded with the bullion price after sharp declines in the previous two sessions. Goldcorp Inc  advanced 1 percent to C$29.31, and Barrick Gold Corp  jumped 1.3 percent to C$19.97.     Barrick was also in the news for announcing that Chief Executive Officer Jamie Sokalsky would step down on Sept. 15.       BlackBerry shares tumbled 5.3 percent, to C$11.50, a day after International Business Machines Corp said it planned to partner with Apple Inc to sell iPhones and iPads loaded with applications geared to business users.

The jet had 295 people aboard. The crash followed an increase in tensions between Ukraine and Russia that has resulted in clashes along the border, including the targeting of military aircraft.

154,"  (Repeats with no change)By Christina  FarrSAN FRANCISCO, July 22 Apple Inc's iPad is losing steam just four years after its release, but an alliance with International Business Machines Corp could rejuvenate a flagging product by entering into a largely untapped corporate market.Apple shipped 13.2 million iPads in the June quarter, 8 percent fewer than a year earlier and lagging Wall Street's forecast for 14 million or more. Sales of the device, which accounted for 15 percent of revenue, fell short of Wall Street's expectations for the second quarter in a row.Apple helped create the tablet market in 2010 with its first iPad. But growth has plummeted from 2012, as larger phones became more popular and people delayed replacing their tablets. And it is ceding market to mostly cheaper Android offerings from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Chinese manufacturers using Google Inc software.Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook described iPad sales as ""very bifurcated"" - they continue to grow at 50 percent or above in emerging markets such as the Middle East and China, but in developed countries like the United States, the ""market is weaker."" Research firm IDC lowered its forecast for 2014 worldwide tablet demand growth to 12.1 percent - a fraction of the 51.8 percent expansion of 2013. The first quarter of this year also saw Apple's market share slide to 32.5 percent, from 40 percent a year earlier.""The tablet market globally has really hit a wall,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White.Another threat to iPad sales may come from within. Apple is expected to introduce a larger 5.5-inch (14.0-cm) iPhone in the fall. At those dimensions, the iPhone would begin closing in on the 7.8-inch (19.8-cm) iPad mini. ""You have the negative impact of the larger screen iPhone and what that would do to iPad mini,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. ""You're going to get a larger screen iPhone before you'll get contributions from the IBM partnership.""Investors hope the partnership with IBM announced this month will help bolster sales in the largest global enterprises, which could provide a boon to U.S. tablet sales. Cook cited IDC figures showing that iPad penetration among businesses stood at about 20 percent, versus 60 percent for notebook computers.Analysts say the alliance, in which the two companies will work on a suite of secure business apps, may take years to show up in the bottom line. But they see potential in marrying IBM's business-software expertise with Apple's hardware and services.""I do believe Apple can leverage IBM's channel,"" said White.Growth areas include the retail sector, where employees may increasingly use tablets for inventory management, as well as financial services, and transportation, he said. Other promising sectors included education and healthcare.""We see the importance of the customer ... and both feel that mobile and enterprise is just an enormous opportunity,"" Cook, a former IBM executive himself, said on a conference call.

160,"   By Euan Rocha and Alastair Sharp | TORONTO  TORONTO IBM Corp's recent move to partner with Apple Inc to sell iPhones and iPads loaded with corporate applications has excited investors in both companies, but two rivals say they are unperturbed for now.Top executives at Dell and BlackBerry Ltd scoffed at the threat posed by the alliance this week, arguing the tie-up is unlikely to derail the efforts of their own companies to re-invent themselves.""I do not think that we take the Apple-IBM tie-up terribly seriously. I think it just made a good press release,"" John Swainson, who heads Dell's global software business, said in an interview with Reuters in Toronto on Thursday. PC maker Dell and smartphone maker BlackBerry are in the midst of reshaping their companies around software and services, as the needs of their big corporate clients morph. Swainson, who spent over two decades in senior roles at IBM, said, ""I have some trouble understanding how IBM reps are going to really help Apple very much in terms of introducing devices into their accounts. I mean candidly, they weren't very good at doing it when it was IBM-logoed products, so I do not get how introducing Apple-logoed stuff is going to be much better.""While conceding that Apple products hold more allure, Swainson said they lack the depth of security features that many large business clients like banks covet.IBM and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen similarly downplayed the threat of the alliance in an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday, likening the tie-up to when ""two elephants start dancing.""      NO COMMENT ON POSSIBLE ALLIANCE Dell and BlackBerry declined to discuss whether they would consider teaming up, but some analysts, bankers and others have argued in the past that a partnership between the two underdogs potentially made sense.Texas-based Dell has a huge sales team, vast network of business clients and is focused on growing its security and device management capabilities, long strong suits for BlackBerry. The Canadian company is building on its heritage by adding capabilities to manage not just BlackBerry, but iOS-, Android- and Windows-based devices on its infrastructure. ""Dell's always been in a partnership-driven model. As Dell has evolved it has focused on some pieces of the equation, but not all,"" said Swainson, adding that the need to broaden partnerships is growing, but declining comment on a potential tie-up with BlackBerry.Chen told the Financial Times that BlackBerry was in early discussions with some companies about working together in parts of the enterprise market, but did not name them.Whether a BlackBerry-Dell partnership will materialize is unclear for now. Initial speculation about a tie-up between the two began a year ago, when both players were exploring buyouts. At the time, one source told Reuters that BlackBerry had held talks with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners about collaboration in enterprise computing. Silver Lake, along with Dell's founder, Michael Dell, were at the time in the midst of taking Dell private. At the time, the source said if the buyout succeeded, one option was a collaboration with BlackBerry in mobile computing.Both Swainson and Chen were senior advisors with Silver Lake before moving into their roles with Dell and BlackBerry.BlackBerry, under the leadership of Chen, has been busy forging alliances and earlier this week announced it was going to allow third-parties to host its device management services.

Symantec said in a statement that the list referred to in Chinese media reports only affected some types of products.""It is important to note that this list is only for certain types of procurement and Symantec products are not banned by the Chinese government,"" the statement said.  ""We are investigating this report and will continue to bid for and win government projects in China.""Shares of Symantec closed up 1.7 percent at $23.56 on the Nasdaq on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.72 percent. The People's Daily also tweeted that it had approved the use of five Chinese anti-virus software vendors: Qihoo 360 Technology Co, Venustech, CAJinchen, Beijing Jiangmin and Rising.FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said he sees the development becoming a more contentious issue over the coming months.""It's another headwind for the company as Symantec already faces numerous challenges to show growth again. China remains a headache situation for Symantec as well as other U.S. tech providers across the board."" Ives said. Symantec said last month it was in talks with Chinese authorities following reports that China had banned use of one of its products, data loss prevention software.Sunday's report is the latest sign that Beijing is intent on promoting use of domestic information technology amid concerns about U.S. spying and the indictment of five Chinese military officers on cyber espionage charges.Still, Eric Johnson, dean of the business school at Vanderbilt University and an expert on cyber security issues, said the Chinese government's move is only a ""symbolic one"" and will have ""little meaningful impact"" on Symantec.Chinese technology corporations like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp have grown into sophisticated global conglomerates in past years, and some analysts speculate that Beijing is promoting its local industry standard-bearers on its own home turf at the expense of U.S. corporations.Chinese state media have lashed out at Google Inc, Apple Inc and other U.S. technology companies, calling on Beijing ""to punish severely the pawns"" of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets.U.S. tech companies such as Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc have recently faced anti-trust investigations, while IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc  have reported declining sales in China.

168,"   By Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Aug 7 International Business Machines Corp unveiled a ""brain-like"" computer chip on Thursday that is the size of a postage stamp and capable of processing massive amounts of data while handling inputs from many different sources, the company said.The announcement comes one month after IBM unveiled a $3 billion investment over the next five years in chip research and development to find a game-changing breakthrough that can help revive its slumping hardware unit.Unlike most chips, which operate on pre written paths, IBM's version processes data in realtime and is capable of dealing with ambiguity, the company said. It runs on the energy equivalent of a hearing aid. Built on Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd's 28nm process technology, the chip only consumes 70mW of energy. A product of almost a decade of research, the chip aims to bridge the divide between existing computers and the brain's high cognitive power and low energy use.""After years of collaboration with IBM, we are now a step closer to building a computer similar to our brain,"" said Professor Rajit Manohar at Cornell Tech, where the chip was designed. The chip contains one million programmable neurons and could allow a thermometer to scan and smell chemical signals and deliver a diagnosis, or help a search and rescue robot to identify people in need during a disaster, the company said.IBM hopes it can integrate multi-sensory processing into mobile devices and says the chip can handle future advances in memory, 3G integration, logic and sensor technologies.

173,"   By Gerry Shih | BEIJING  BEIJING IBM will help China's largest server vendor Inspur International design server systems, the two companies said on Friday, an unexpected development in what has been a politically charged rivalry in the Chinese technology market.Since last year Inspur has aggressively marketed its servers to Chinese state-owned firms as a replacement for IBM (International Business Machines Corp) systems while U.S.-China relations have worsened dramatically over mutual suspicions of cyber-spying.Inspur shares soared in late May after it told Chinese news outlets that its servers had begun to replace the U.S. company's equipment in large financial institutions and would completely supplant IBM in China in due course. The Chinese firm has coined the term ""I2I"" - IBM to Inspur - as a marketing catchphrase.In marketing materials distributed this year and seen by Reuters, Inspur extensively cited the threat of U.S. cyber-aggression and the role of servers in national security.The two companies made no mention of cyber-security on Friday when they announced that IBM would make its DB2 database software and Websphere application software available for use on Inspur's line of K1 servers.  IBM will also make available its POWER8 processors and support chips to help Inspur's development, while providing other technical assistance, the companies said.In statements, Inspur Chairman Sun Pishu and IBM Greater China head D.C. Chien both pledged greater future collaboration.Based in the eastern city of Jinan, Inspur has grown rapidly in recent years with the backing of a Chinese government keen on achieving technological independence, although analysts doubt it could topple IBM in the short term. Unveiled in early 2013, Inspur's K1 server was touted as China's first fully home-grown, high-end server. Since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden's leaks last year about U.S. spying, Chinese commentators have stepped up calls to oust foreign companies like IBM, Cisco and Oracle, which process sensitive data in a range of industries, in favour of homegrown companies. IBM's sales in China fell 20 percent in the first quarter, it said in April, although it has announced a series of partnerships in recent months to signal its long term viability in the market.The company said earlier this month it would provide risk analysis for Shanghai Wind Information, a major financial data firm, over the cloud without installing any physical hardware.IBM has also said it will help the Beijing government predict and control air quality using its big-data processing technology.

183,"   By Alina Selyukh | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS Regulating internet providers more like public utility companies could hurt the Internet and the U.S. economy, more than two dozen network technology and equipment makers have told U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.Thirty-three companies including Cisco Systems Inc, Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp joined the chorus of citizens, activists, lawmakers and companies debating how the U.S. government should regulate Internet service providers (ISPs).Other companies signing a letter to Pritzker published on Tuesday included Alcatel Lucent SA, Ericsson, Nokia Oyj's network arm NSN, Panasonic Corp of North America and CommScope Holding Co Inc.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering so-called ""net neutrality"" rules that would determine how ISPs such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc manage web traffic on their networks.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed rules that would allow ISPs to charge content companies to ensure their websites or applications load smoothly and quickly, as long as such deals are deemed ""commercially reasonable."" Critics, including popular video streaming service Netflix Corp and numerous advocacy groups, argue the plan would threaten less deep-pocketed content providers by potentially relegating them to ""slow lanes"" on the web. MORE POWER  Instead, they call on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service rather than the less-regulated information service it is now, saying the move would give more power to the FCC to stop potential violators of net neutrality. ISPs and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC, have rejected the idea. On Tuesday, 33 telecom network and tech makers, who are members of the Telecommunications Industry Association and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and who depend on ISPs for business, spoke out against the reclassification idea as well.""A sudden shift from the existing light-touch approach – which has been an unqualified success and the basis for billions of dollars in investments – to the prescriptive regime of Title II would be extremely disruptive to the broadband marketplace,"" they wrote, referring to the legal authority the FCC would use to reclassify ISPs. Experts have disagreed on whether or how reclassification would adequately prevent pay-for-priority deals. Wheeler has not proposed reclassification as the solution, but has not taken it off the table as a potential option.FCC is collecting public comment on the tentatively proposed rules until Sept. 15 and will hold several public workshops on various aspects of the regulations in the following weeks.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy will hold a hearing on the issue of net neutrality on Sept. 17.

184,"   By Paul Carsten | TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12  TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12 The sheer size of the Chinese market is so alluring to Western companies that even pro-internet freedom firms like CloudFlare may have to put moral outrage to the side in their pursuit of new business.San Francisco-based CloudFlare has a policy of providing cyber-defence services for all, based on a belief that the internet should be free, decentralised and open.Its clients have included groups that the U.S. government regards as terrorist organisations. Those values may now have to be shelved when it comes to entering China, where state control of the internet is among the world's tightest.CloudFlare is looking for a Chinese partner and aims to be in the country by 2015, said co-founder Michelle Zatlyn on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum meeting in the northern city of Tianjin this week. ""As we think about international expansion it's vital that we get China,"" said Zatlyn of CloudFlare's second-largest market by user traffic. ""There are rules and regulation which operate within the country. As a U.S. company we absolutely have to follow those, and we're okay with that.""The operating environment in China may be even tougher now. U.S. businesses have complained about Chinese protectionism, and American tech firms have repeatedly come under fire from the state since last year's U.S. National Security Agency cyber espionage revelations. Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc are being investigated for anti-trust violations, while IBM Corp, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have seen sales in China plummet in recent quarters.CloudFlare is joining a long list of companies, from firms that have seen little or no success in China like Yahoo Inc , eBay Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to recent entrants like LinkedIn Corp, for whom China's pull as the world's largest internet market by population has been too strong to resist. CloudFlare is hoping to learn from the lessons of the U.S. tech sector's fallen soldiers in China. One of these came at the World Economic Forum, where Lu Wei, the director of China's State Internet Information Office, said Facebook will be unable to access China any time soon, according to state media.""You have to play a slightly long game if you're a Western multi-national company in China,"" said Mark Spelman, a managing director at Accenture PLC.""It's very important to think about which Chinese partners you should be working with, and organisations need to think very  carefully about what business model you need in China - it might not be the same as in other countries,"" he cautioned.

Shares in the company fell as much as 7 percent in early trade on Monday.The company, which provides payment solutions to 350 financial institutions, said loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization widened to 31.4 million pounds ($51 million) for the year ended June 30. Revenue rose 31 percent to 95.1 million pounds.Monitise had in July lowered its revenue growth estimate to a range of 31-33 percent from 50 percent, citing a shift in its revenue model. The company reiterated its outlook for revenue growth of at least 25 percent in 2015 and that it would be EBITDA profitable in 2016. Monitise derives about 50 percent of its revenue from the UK and 40 percent from the United States.""A lot of our systems integration resources are moving to IBM ... At the same time that we are increasing our subscription revenue and reaching more consumers through our clients, we will also have a cost base that is more scaleable,"" co-Chief Executive Elizabeth Buse told Reuters.Monitise said it expanded its partnership with International Business Machines Corp into a multi-year global alliance to deliver cloud-based mobile money solutions. ""We expect these actions to drive a rebound in operating metrics and financial performance, but not until H2 FY15."" Canaccord Genuity analysts said in a note to clients.The company also said it signed a strategic partnership with Santander to develop and deploy a series of mobile banking solutions.Monitise's registered customers in the year were 30 million, compared with 23 million a year earlier. Live transactions rose 67 percent to 4 billion.Founded in 2003, Monitise processes payments to the value of $88 billion annually. Its customers include Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Visa Inc.Monitise, which also operates in Turkey, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, said revenue from Britain rose 54 percent to 57.7 million pounds, while the Americas saw a 9.3 percent fall.Shares in the AIM-listed company were down 4.2 percent at 44.5275 pence at 0850 GMT.

193,"   By Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON When IBM Corp CEO Ginni Rometty was asked recently for her tips on how to transform companies, she spoke of ""relentless reinvention"" and not protecting the past.Applying those precepts to IBM is proving particularly tricky as many of the company's old-line businesses have already been shut down or sold, while the units that are supposed to push future growth, such as cloud and security, face stiff competition. Earlier on Monday, IBM reported a marked slowdown in business in September and abandoned its 2015 operating earnings target. The company also announced it will hive off its loss-making semiconductor unit to contract chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc.Analysts and investors agree that relentless reinvention is something to strive for at Big Blue, but some of the moves tried by other old line technology companies - such as a split or a spinoff of weaker businesses - might not be tenable for IBM, which successfully reinvented itself into a services provider in the early 2000s.""I don't expect to see anything of that magnitude coming from IBM in part because they have systematically divested some of the businesses that were a drag on earnings in the last decade,"" said Charles King, principal analyst at research firm Pund-It in California.Rometty, who took over as CEO nearly three years ago, has accelerated divestitures with the sale of IBM's low-end server business to Lenovo Group Inc and its chip-making business to Globalfoundries Inc. Those moves eliminated two areas that were a drag on profits, but other problems remain.  Its storage and server hardware and enterprise software sectors are slumping and the company faces growing competition in cloud computing from companies such as Amazon.com Inc. ""They’re on the wrong side of the IT spending food chain. All the growth is in the cloud,"" said Dan Ives, analyst at FBR, adding that mature companies have struggled the most with the shift to cloud. International Business Machines Corp's faster-growing cloud computing, mobile, business analytics, social and security services contribute 25 percent of its revenue""It is not that they are making a lot of bad choices,"" said Scott Kessler at S&P Capital IQ. ""It is just that they are so big and so far along one path, that even if they make some good decisions in terms of investments and acquisitions, it seems like it is too little too late in many contexts."" Future spin-offs will likely be centered on its storage unit, analysts said.The company is also facing criticism that it pursued buybacks at the expense of investment in new technology. IBM spent $13.5 billion to repurchase stock in the first nine months of the year, more than double its net income.  ""The company has been using its cash to repurchase stocks and support its earnings per share, but that has severely weakened its balance sheet, which used to be one of the true strengths of the company,"" said Kessler. The disappointing third-quarter results also raise questions about investors' patience with Rometty. The CEO, who joined IBM in 1981, recently dispensed advice such as ""never define yourself as a product"" and ""never protect the past"" in a Fortune Magazine video interview.Making such ideals into reality is proving tricky at IBM.    ""When you miss expectations and come in with results the market is unhappy with, then that puts much more pressure on her, but she bought herself more time by selling off the micro-electronics business,"" said Rob Enderle, chief analyst at Enderle Group in California. ""The market today is different than the market that existed a decade ago. She is struggling to readjust to an ever more mobile and cloud business, which caught most of the industry by surprise,"" he said. (Reporting by Marina Lopes.

196,"  * Dow recovers from IBM earnings miss* European stocks close lower on SAP profit warning* Japanese shares gain on possible public pension fund spending* U.S. Treasuries prices steady   (Adds close of U.S. markets)By Sam ForgioneNEW YORK, Oct 20 A measure of global equity markets rose on Monday after strong U.S. corporate results lifted Wall Street, despite a quarterly earnings miss from IBM, building on positive sentiment that grew out of a surge in Japanese shares. On Wall Street, IBM shares closed down 7.1 percent at $169.10. While IBM's miss limited the Dow's gains, the index turned modestly higher before the end of the U.S. session, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced.""The fact that the Dow has been able to get positive with IBM's 13-point decline is pretty significant. It shows the overall strength in the market,"" said Philip Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. ""We're continuing to rebound off of oversold levels,"" he said.U.S. corporate earnings season will ramp up this week, with nearly 130 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Apple Inc  posted a better-than-expected 12 percent jump in revenue after Monday's close . Shares in Apple were roughly flat at about $100 in after-hours trade. European stocks closed lower, meanwhile, after a profit warning from German business software maker SAP hit technology shares.""It's all about growth at the moment. Cyclicals have been underperforming in recent months ... (and) with respect to SAP, it's a result of the business investment climate,"" said Mike Ingram, market strategist at BGC Partners.Japan's Nikkei average surged 4 percent, underpinned by news that Japan's $1.2 trillion public pension would likely more than double its allocation to domestic stocks to about 25 percent. The Nikkei's gain on Monday marked its biggest daily rise since June 2013. MSCI's all-country world index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last up 0.74 percent to 399.94, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed down 0.58 percent at 1,272.72.The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.12 percent, at 16,399.67, while the S&P 500 ended up 0.91 percent, at 1,904.01.

But neither company has said much about their progress since the July announcement. ""The level of interest from the corporate world has been incredible,"" Maestri said after Apple released its September quarter results. The company posted better-than-expected revenue after its best new iPhone launch on record, pushing sales of the smartphone to 39.27 million in the September quarter. Maestri told Reuters that sales of the new iPhones in China, where they went on sale just last week, have surpassed the launch of the previous generation iPhone 5S and 5C.

During that period IBM spent more than $108 billion on share buybacks and an additional $30 billion on dividends. That compares to just $59 billion on capital expenditure. That produced a doubling of pre-tax margin during the period, but arguably at a cost to the value of the core franchise, which looks less and less defensible. Indeed, in the last six years, the company’s debt load has about tripled but sales are essentially flat.In July, hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller drew a line between that strategy and Federal Reserve policy, which he said encourages companies to stint on productivity improvement and investment in the real economy and instead use cheap money to borrow and buy back shares.Buying back shares improves profitability per share, a strategy which tends to work so long as investors believe it is not done at the expense of the company’s ability to remain competitive. CAN’T STEP IN SAME RIVER TWICE IBM may simply be the unlucky victim of market forces as technology evolves, but it is hard to look around the U.S. economy, which has had a combination of very high profit margins and very low capital investment, and wonder if many publicly traded companies are in similarly vulnerable positions.“In our view, IBM is not different from companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle and Intel,” Geneva-based Lombard Odier fund manager Eurof Uppington said via email.“They all face the same sort of pressures from new trends like cloud, mobility and superscale Internet and are all reacting in the same way using financial engineering. IBM is probably just early.” Lombard Odier has been critical of what it calls the GOSOBB strategy, as in Giving Out Stock Options and Buying them Back. While, under accounting rules, this flatters operating earnings, it masks how much money is actually going home in employees' pockets as compared to if share options were cash payments.Had IBM wanted to offset the dilution caused by employee share options in the five years to mid-year, it would have needed almost $18 billion in share buybacks, or about a third of all buybacks made during the period. IBM are far from unique, much less unusual, in the scope of those figures.The broader unanswered question here is how best to manage a technology company, or indeed an economy, during a period of very rapid technological change. The market tends to assume that company revenues are far stickier, far more permanent than they actually are. That assumption grew out of 100 or more years of analyzing and investing in industrial companies which, while buffeted by war, globalization and technological change, had the luxury of operating in a more slowly changing world.That assumption, that tendency of financial markets to focus on the per-share earnings figure without giving due care to all of the many forces which make those revenues possible, may leave investors today very vulnerable.A decade of share buybacks and underinvestment is starting to look like it may have been a mistake.(At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

That produced a doubling of pre-tax margin during the period, but arguably at a cost to the value of the core franchise, which looks less and less defensible.Indeed, in the last six years, the company's debt load has about tripled but sales are essentially flat.In July, hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller drew a line between that strategy and Federal Reserve policy, which he said encourages companies to stint on productivity improvement and investment in the real economy and instead use cheap money to borrow and buy back shares. Buying back shares improves profitability per share, a strategy which tends to work so long as investors believe it is not done at the expense of the company's ability to remain competitive.CAN'T STEP IN SAME RIVER TWICE IBM may simply be the unlucky victim of market forces as technology evolves, but it is hard to look around the U.S. economy, which has had a combination of very high profit margins and very low capital investment, and wonder if many publicly traded companies are in similarly vulnerable positions. ""In our view, IBM is not different from companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle and Intel,"" Geneva-based Lombard Odier fund manager Eurof Uppington said via email.""They all face the same sort of pressures from new trends like cloud, mobility and superscale Internet and are all reacting in the same way using financial engineering. IBM is probably just early.""Lombard Odier has been critical of what it calls the GOSOBB strategy, as in Giving Out Stock Options and Buying them Back. While, under accounting rules, this flatters operating earnings, it masks how much money is actually going home in employees' pockets as compared to if share options were cash payments.Had IBM wanted to offset the dilution caused by employee share options in the five years to mid-year, it would have needed almost $18 billion in share buybacks, or about a third of all buybacks made during the period. IBM are far from unique, much less unusual, in the scope of those figures.The broader unanswered question here is how best to manage a technology company, or indeed an economy, during a period of very rapid technological change. The market tends to assume that company revenues are far stickier, far more permanent than they actually are. That assumption grew out of 100 or more years of analyzing and investing in industrial companies which, while buffeted by war, globalization and technological change, had the luxury of operating in a more slowly changing world.That assumption, that tendency of financial markets to focus on the per-share earnings figure without giving due care to all of the many forces which make those revenues possible, may leave investors today very vulnerable.A decade of share buybacks and underinvestment is starting to look like it may have been a mistake.

207,"  BERLIN/FRANKFURT German airline Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) is close to a deal to sell its IT infrastructure unit to IBM (IBM.N), including an outsourcing agreement for the services, as part of a shake-up of its technology activities, it said on Wednesday.Europe's largest airline by revenue is undergoing restructuring and cost-cutting efforts to better position itself to compete with low-cost carriers and Gulf rivals.It earlier this year said it was seeking a buyer for the unit, which provides data centers, networks and telephony, because it requires a high level of investment and economies of scale, which the airline could not provide.    Under the planned deal, Lufthansa will outsource all of its IT infrastructure services to IBM under a seven-year deal and the U.S. firm will take over the airline's IT infrastructure division, currently part of Lufthansa Systems. The partnership announcement comes two days after IBM, a company undergoing a stark transition of its own, shocked the markets with lower quarterly results and by suspending its full-year forecasts. IBM, now largely a computer services supplier, said it suffered a marked slowdown in September as many customers stopped buying new services due in part to macroeconomic concerns but also the rapid pace of changing client demand for the latest technologies delivered as Internet-based services. Lufthansa shares rose 2.6 percent in early trading, the top gainer among German blue-chips .GDAXI, as analysts welcomed the progress in the restructuring of the division, The deal will result in a one-off pre-tax charge of 240 million euros for Lufthansa, which will not impact its operating result for 2014. It will allow Lufthansa to reduce its annual IT costs by around 70 million euros a year. A final price for the sale is still being negotiated, a spokeswoman told Reuters. The sale is part of plans to reorganize the Lufthansa Systems business into three parts - Infrastructure, Airline Solutions and Industry Solutions, with the latter two to be kept within the Lufthansa group as independent companies. The infrastructure business, which employs 1,400 people, accounted for 40 percent of Systems' total turnover of 640 million euros ($883.45 million) in 2013 but it made up only 25 percent of the unit's profit. The Lufthansa Systems restructuring is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2015, with the deal to sell the IT infrastructure unit due to complete by March 31, 2015.Other parties reportedly interested in the unit were Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and France's Atos (ATOS.PA).

208,"   By Andrew Chung and Dan Levine  For two decades, companies that buy software patents to sue technology giants have been the scourge of Silicon Valley. Reviled as patent trolls, they have attacked everything from Google's online ads to Apple's iPhone features, sometimes winning hundreds of millions of dollars. But now the trolls are in retreat from the tech titans, interviews and data reviewed by Reuters show. In the wake of several changes in U.S. law, which make it easier to challenge software patents, patent prices are plummeting, the number of court fights is down, and stock prices of many patent-holding companies have fallen. Some tech firms say they are punching up research budgets as legal costs shrink, while support for major patent reform is under fire as trolls get trounced.""Their entire business model relies on intimidation, and that has lost its edge,"" said Efrat Kasznik, president of intellectual property consulting firm Foresight Valuation Group. ""If the patents are not enforceable in court anymore... the troll has no legs to stand on.""Brokers who work with the patent acquisition companies acknowledge the new climate.""In some cases, there are just no current buyers for these patents at all,"" said Robert Aronoff, founder of the patent brokerage Pluritas, citing new legal standards for the change. NetApp, a Silicon Valley maker of sophisticated data storage devices, last month used a new legal precedent to force a patent holder to pay its legal fees. The judge called the case ""reckless and wasteful.""The new playing field allows NetApp to spend more on developing its own patents, as opposed to litigation defense. ""It is freeing up dollars,"" said Douglas Luftman, NetApp's chief intellectual property counsel.To be sure, not all litigious patent owning companies are losing ground. Some with court-tested patents are doing well. And not all big tech companies are convinced of the change.Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) has been at the forefront of the fight against infringement lawsuits and has not seen a drop in new suits in recent months, said General Counsel Mark Chandler.Cisco will continue to push for laws to stop warrantless lawsuits, Chandler said. Others see the need diminishing. THE BIRTH OF TROLLS Big tech companies distinguish between their own intellectual property, which they fiercely protect, and those of their adversaries, which they often dismiss as broadly worded and vague, allowing holders to sue all manner of defendants. The big tech companies note that the patent acquisition companies they label as trolls generally make no products but are solely in the business of buying patents and litigating to enforce them.The putative trolls see a different world. They buy patents from inventors and each other, creating a marketplace that checks big tech companies' sway, and rely ultimately on a fair arbiter: courts. This can provide vital protection for investors' ideas, said Matt Vella, CEO of Acacia Research Corp, which contracts with owners to license their patents to other companies. “I see it as a Robin Hood function,” he said.If the so-called trolls had a birth date, it would be the summer of 1994, when a federal appeals court explicitly allowed computer program patents for the first time. In the ensuing years, software patents exploded, covering topics from Wi-Fi to one-click shopping. So did patent lawsuits. Last year, more than 6,000 patent suits were filed, according to intellectual property analytics firm Lex Machina. A 2013 White House report said ""trolls"" were responsible for 60 percent of suits, up from 29 percent in 2010. Congress struck the first blow against these high-volume plaintiffs in an overhaul of the patent system. Starting in 2012, companies accused of infringement could ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate patents used in litigation. The reviews are much cheaper and faster than court.The reviews proved popular -- and devastating for many patent owners. As of June, the patent office was invalidating some or all of challenged patents' claims at a rate of 80 to 90 percent, depending on the type of review. Then, in June of this year, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a basic idea -- not normally eligible for a patent -- does not become patent-worthy if run on a computer. That case, Alice vs. CLS Bank, has made it easier still to quash software patents, and at least 13 lower court rulings since then have done just that.MOUNTING EVIDENCE New federal patent lawsuits last month were down 40 percent from the previous year, to 329 cases, data from Lex Machina show.  Defendants are also fighting longer, driving up costs for the acquisition companies. In 2004, the median time it took for a case that didn't settle was 467 days. By 2013, that had reached 673 days, according to Lex Machina.Intellectual Ventures, one of the largest private patent buyers, laid off over 20 percent of its workforce this year. The company began with backing from big tech companies who saw it as an ally, but some longtime investors including Apple and Intel declined to participate in its latest funding round. Intellectual Ventures declined to comment.A survey of private patent deals compiled by brokerage IPOfferings, found the average price of a patent was $165,000 in the second quarter of 2014, down from $375,000 in 2012.Some patents have withstood challenges under the new legal rules, however. Marathon Patent Group(MARA.O) announced last month that the U.S. government rejected a request by ARM Holdings to invalidate a Marathon patent. Marathon is trading up 28 percent since mid-June.Michael Friedman, managing director at IP strategy firm Ocean Tomo, said patents on widely used technology owned by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, are still in a strong position to seek licenses. But some companies whose business model depends on successful litigation have seen their stock slide since Alice, the 2014 Supreme Court case. InterDigital (IDCC.O) has fallen over 5 percent and Acacia Research Corp (ACTG.O) is down over 9 percent. (See graphic: link.reuters.com/rej23w) Just three weeks after Alice was decided, an Acacia Research subsidiary felt its reach when a federal appeals court backed the revocation of a patent on digital image processing, used to sue over 30 tech firms. Acacia is appealing and said that in general, its other patents will not be impacted by Alice in the same way, since few deal with the kinds of software methods Alice puts at risk. Still, Vella, Acacia's CEO, said, said his company sensed the changing legal landscape and is shifting its strategy, away from one-patent cases to challenges based on several patents.

217,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 29 (Fitch) Pervasively negative market sentiment over  International Business Machines (IBM) is sending its credit default swap (CDS)  spreads to levels not seen since 2011, according to Fitch Solutions in its  latest CDS Case Study snapshot. Five-year CDS on IBM have widened 22% over the past month. Long at 'AA-' levels,  credit protection on IBM's debt is now pricing three notches lower in 'A-'  territory. 'IBM's disappointing earnings are intensifying market scrutiny, as is  uncertainty over its ability to accelerate focus revenue growth within the  context of rapidly changing industry dynamics,' said Director Diana  Allmendinger. Recent divestitures will drive profit margin expansion, while a slower pace of  share repurchases supports expectations for reduced leverage in the  intermediate-term. Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

222,"  * Many Chinese firms fare badly: Transparency International* Watchdog also points a finger at some U.S. tech giants* Lack of disclosure can harm brands, report says   (Adds IBM statement)By Michael NienaberBERLIN, Nov 5 The world's biggest companies disclose little or no financial details about their operations abroad, according to a report by Transparency International, which singled out Chinese companies but pointed to U.S. tech giants like Amazon and Google as well.The Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog named Bank of China, Honda Motor, Bank of Communications , Agricultural Bank of China and Russia's Sberbank as the five least transparent companies.Bank of China could not be reached for comment on the report. The other four companies declined to comment.""We need more transparency from multinational companies, whose power in the world economy closely rivals the biggest countries,"" said Transparency International chairman Jose Ugaz. ""By not responding to people's demands for greater transparency and accountability, companies risk harming their brand and losing customers,"" he warned.Around three quarters of the 124 companies assessed do not disclose the taxes they pay in foreign countries and nearly half publish no information on revenues abroad, the report said.The companies were ranked based on their reporting of their measures to prevent corruption, information about subsidiaries and holdings and information about financial operations abroad. By those criteria, European companies performed best. Italy's Eni, Britain's Vodafone and Norway's Statoil were the leaders.""We are committed to providing as much information and insight as possible to support informed public debate on issues such as corporate governance, anti-corruption programmes and corporate taxation,"" said a spokesman for Vodafone.While there were six Chinese companies among the 10 worst performers, U.S. corporations also figured.Warren Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway was ranked the sixth least transparent multinational, and the report said major tech companies also performed relatively poorly. ""Surprisingly, the sector that makes greater transparency possible is one of the least transparent,"" said Transparency. AAmazon, Apple, Google and IBM all scored less than three out of 10, the organization said.A spokesman from IBM said the company was publishing a full list of every subsidiary and country in which it does business every year. That list was part of IBM's annual report.The other U.S. companies cited declined to comment or were unavailable when asked for a reaction by Reuters. Some did not want to respond until they had seen the complete report.A spokesperson for Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, which was also among the bottom 10, said: ""We want to continue to work towards appropriate disclosures.""Transparency said the world's biggest oil, gas and mining companies were not yet ready for transparency rules that would enter into force across the European Union from July 2015.Those regulations require extractive companies to report payments such as taxes to governments on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. In the United States, similar measures are planned, but implementation has been delayed.

230,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. judge on Tuesday accepted the guilty plea of a former stockbroker to participating in an insider trading scheme, one week after expressing concern about whether the defendant's explanation of the crime was legally sufficient.Daryl Payton, who had been a trader at Connecticut-based Euro Pacific Capital Inc, pleaded guilty last week to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in federal court in New York.But U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter declined at that time to accept the plea, saying he was unsure whether Payton had adequately explained how he knew the inside tips were obtained as a result of a breach of confidentiality, a legal element of the crime. Payton was several steps removed from the original source. In court papers filed in response to Carter's concerns, prosecutors told Carter they had altered their theory of the case to narrow the conspiracy in which Payton was involved.At a brief hearing on Tuesday, Carter accepted the plea, after Payton said he had discussed the matter fully with his lawyer and still wished to plead guilty. His co-defendant and fellow Euro Pacific trader, Benjamin Durant, is scheduled to face trial on Dec. 8.Payton took part in an insider trading scheme centered on a technology company acquired by International Business Machines Corp in 2009.Three other people have also admitted to sharing and trading on secret information about IBM's pending acquisition of software maker SPSS Inc that originated from a corporate lawyer.

231,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 18 A U.S. judge on Tuesday accepted the guilty plea of a former stockbroker to participating in an insider trading scheme, one week after expressing concern about whether the defendant's explanation of the crime was legally sufficient.Daryl Payton, who had been a trader at Connecticut-based Euro Pacific Capital Inc, pleaded guilty last week to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in federal court in New York.But U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter declined at that time to accept the plea, saying he was unsure whether Payton had adequately explained how he knew the inside tips were obtained as a result of a breach of confidentiality, a legal element of the crime.Payton was several steps removed from the original source. In court papers filed in response to Carter's concerns, prosecutors told Carter they had altered their theory of the case to narrow the conspiracy in which Payton was involved.At a brief hearing on Tuesday, Carter accepted the plea, after Payton said he had discussed the matter fully with his lawyer and still wished to plead guilty. His co-defendant and fellow Euro Pacific trader, Benjamin Durant, is scheduled to face trial on Dec. 8.Payton took part in an insider trading scheme centered on a technology company acquired by International Business Machines Corp in 2009. Three other people have also admitted to sharing and trading on secret information about IBM's pending acquisition of software maker SPSS Inc that originated from a corporate lawyer.The lawyer, who has not been charged, has been identified in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit as Michael Dallas, a former associate at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore.Authorities said Dallas shared information about the pending deal with a friend, Trent Martin, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. Martin then told his roommate, Thomas Conradt, a broker at Euro Pacific, authorities said. Conradt in turn shared the tip with others at his firm, including Payton and Durant, whom prosecutors said purchased options and shares in SPSS based on the insider information.Martin, Conradt and David Weishaus, another Euro Pacific trader, all pleaded guilty last year and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.The indictment also refers to another co-conspirator at Euro Pacific who has not been identified.Payton is scheduled for sentencing in March.

243,"  (Correct spelling of first name in 21st paragraph to Glen from Glenn)By Nate Raymond and Aruna ViswanathaNEW YORK/WASHINGTON Dec 11 U.S. prosecutors, already smarting from a appeals court ruling that weakens their ability to crack down on future insider trading, on Thursday faced widening fallout from the decision as some existing cases threatened to unravel.Lawyers for some defendants hinted they might seek to withdraw guilty pleas, and a Manhattan federal judge questioned if four such pleas were affected.The moves were the latest repercussions from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals finding that prosecutors presented insufficient evidence to convict Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors.Speaking at a conference, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White said Thursday ""there is no question it's a significant decision,"" adding her agency was reviewing the Wednesday ruling, which she called ""overly narrow.""Some defendants who cooperated and pleaded guilty in the prosecution of Newman and Chiasson are now considering taking the extraordinary step of withdrawing their pleas, two lawyers said Thursday.The three-judge panel not only found that prosecutors needed to prove a trader knew that the original source of non-public information has received a benefit in exchange for the tip, but also narrowed what actually constituted such a benefit.In several such cases, the defendants were tipped based on information they received third- or fourth-hand, rather than straight from the source, which made it tougher to prove their awareness that source had obtained something tangible in return.The ruling threatens to challenge a broad insider trading crackdown underway since 2009 under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office during his tenure has secured 82 other convictions. 'WORTH STUDYING' While the pace of prosecutions had looked set to gradually slow from the breakneck pace of recent years, the appeals court's ruling could slam the brakes on authorities' efforts to pursue future cases.Many on Wall Street say that despite Bharara's thrusts against the practice, trading on privileged information remains common amid the current M&A boom, with Merck & Co's  acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc just the latest deal to have seen unusual options activity before being announced.Among those threatening to withdraw plea deals is Danny Kuo, a former Whittier Trust Co analyst who pleaded guilty in 2012 and turned cooperator.

244,"   By Nate Raymond and Aruna Viswanatha | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Dec 11 U.S. prosecutors, already smarting from a appeals court ruling that weakens their ability to crack down on future insider trading, on Thursday faced widening fallout from the decision as some existing cases threatened to unravel.Lawyers for some defendants hinted they might seek to withdraw guilty pleas, and a Manhattan federal judge questioned if four such pleas were affected.The moves were the latest repercussions from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals finding that prosecutors presented insufficient evidence to convict Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors.Speaking at a conference, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White said Thursday ""there is no question it's a significant decision,"" adding her agency was reviewing the Wednesday ruling, which she called ""overly narrow.""Some defendants who cooperated and pleaded guilty in the prosecution of Newman and Chiasson are now considering taking the extraordinary step of withdrawing their pleas, two lawyers said Thursday.The three-judge panel not only found that prosecutors needed to prove a trader knew that the original source of non-public information has received a benefit in exchange for the tip, but also narrowed what actually constituted such a benefit.In several such cases, the defendants were tipped based on information they received third- or fourth-hand, rather than straight from the source, which made it tougher to prove their awareness that source had obtained something tangible in return.The ruling threatens to challenge a broad insider trading crackdown underway since 2009 under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office during his tenure has secured 82 other convictions.'WORTH STUDYING'  While the pace of prosecutions had looked set to gradually slow from the breakneck pace of recent years, the appeals court's ruling could slam the brakes on authorities' efforts to pursue future cases.Many on Wall Street say that despite Bharara's thrusts against the practice, trading on privileged information remains common amid the current M&A boom, with Merck & Co's  acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc just the latest deal to have seen unusual options activity before being announced.Among those threatening to withdraw plea deals is Danny Kuo, a former Whittier Trust Co analyst who pleaded guilty in 2012 and turned cooperator. Roland Riopelle, Kuo's lawyer, said in an interview he had calls into the U.S. Attorney's Office. While he had not made a definite decision, the issue was ""certainly worth studying.""""If there's no crime there, that's a good reason to withdraw your plea,"" he said.Kuo was nearly sentenced to six months in prison in July by  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, whose ruling in the Newman and Chiasson case was subject to the appeal.

245,"   By Eric Auchard | LONDON  LONDON IBM aims to expand the number of data centers it offers clients around the world by 25 percent to meet fast-rising demand for internet-based services, after what a company executive said has been a ""breakthrough year"" in 2014 for its cloud computing business.IBM has quadrupled the number of cloud data facilities it offers around the world to 49 in the past 18 months, responding in part to laws requiring the local retention of data following revelations over U.S. government Web surveillance as well as  increased corporate compliance rules.The company said on Wednesday it has now struck a partnership with data center provider Equinix Inc for nine more cloud centers in Australia, France, Japan, Singapore, The Netherlands and the United States.In addition the company is opening up three new cloud computer facilities of its own in Germany, Mexico and Japan.The information technology giant, which is contending with a change in its classic business mix of software and outsourcing services as corporate clients focus on reaching their customers via the Internet and mobile phones, said its own cloud business is having a banner year. ""We have had a really good year. We would call it a breakthrough year in cloud,"" Angel Luiz Diaz, vice president in charge of IBM's cloud computing business, told Reuters.IBM's cloud revenue amounted to $4.4 billion in 2013 and was up by 50 percent in the first nine months of this year, it reported in October, making it one of IBM's fastest-growing businesses, although it still accounts for only a fraction of the $94 billion in total revenues which IBM is expected by analysts to generate this year.Diaz declined to comment on the company's performance during the fourth quarter but IBM has announced multi-year deals in recent weeks worth a total of more than $4 billion that are fuelling the company's expansion in data centers. The company's cloud computing services let companies mix classic computing jobs with new ways of working, a twist on the largely consumer-facing cloud services made popular by Amazon's  Web Services, Google and Microsoft. IBM, along with rivals Hewlett-Packard and EMC's vmWare, offer “hybrid cloud” services that let customers run key business data on private, internal networks along with consumer-facing public cloud systems. Such hybrids provide companies with certain speed, security and regulatory advantages but at similar costs as public clouds,  said industry analyst Charles King of the firm Pund-IT. Mixed systems also let customers move their existing business software to the Internet over several years rather than in one big leap. So far this quarter IBM has set major deals with airline Lufthansa, Dutch bank ABN AMRO, advertising giant WPP, audio electronics maker Woox Innovations in Hong Kong and the Dow Water arm of Dow Chemical.IBM has also put in place a variety of technology partnership deals with SAP, Microsoft, Tencent, AT&T and Intel to give its customers more flexibility in running other major business systems on IBM cloud networks.IBM also said on Wednesday it had reached a cloud services deal with National Express Group Plc to enable the UK-based bus and trains operator to offer commuters up-to-the-minute train schedules and what it said would be Britain's first postcode-to-postcode journey planner.

253,"   By Eric Auchard | LONDON  LONDON IBM aims to expand the number of data centers it offers clients around the world by 25 percent to meet fast-rising demand for internet-based services, after what a company executive said has been a ""breakthrough year"" in 2014 for its cloud computing business.IBM has quadrupled the number of cloud data facilities it offers around the world to 49 in the past 18 months, responding in part to laws requiring the local retention of data following revelations over U.S. government Web surveillance as well as  increased corporate compliance rules.The company said on Wednesday it has now struck a partnership with data center provider Equinix Inc for nine more cloud centers in Australia, France, Japan, Singapore, The Netherlands and the United States.In addition the company is opening up three new cloud computer facilities of its own in Germany, Mexico and Japan.The information technology giant, which is contending with a change in its classic business mix of software and outsourcing services as corporate clients focus on reaching their customers via the Internet and mobile phones, said its own cloud business is having a banner year.""We have had a really good year. We would call it a breakthrough year in cloud,"" Angel Luiz Diaz, vice president in charge of IBM's cloud computing business, told Reuters. IBM's cloud revenue amounted to $4.4 billion in 2013 and was up by 50 percent in the first nine months of this year, it reported in October, making it one of IBM's fastest-growing businesses, although it still accounts for only a fraction of the $94 billion in total revenues which IBM is expected by analysts to generate this year.Diaz declined to comment on the company's performance during the fourth quarter but IBM has announced multi-year deals in recent weeks worth a total of more than $4 billion that are fuelling the company's expansion in data centers.The company's cloud computing services let companies mix classic computing jobs with new ways of working, a twist on the largely consumer-facing cloud services made popular by Amazon's  Web Services, Google and Microsoft.  IBM, along with rivals Hewlett-Packard and EMC's VMware, offer “hybrid cloud” services that let customers run key business data on private, internal networks along with consumer-facing public cloud systems. Such hybrids provide companies with certain speed, security and regulatory advantages but at similar costs as public clouds,  said industry analyst Charles King of the firm Pund-IT. Mixed systems also let customers move their existing business software to the Internet over several years rather than in one big leap.So far this quarter IBM has set major deals with airline Lufthansa, Dutch bank ABN AMRO, advertising giant WPP, audio electronics maker Woox Innovations in Hong Kong and the Dow Water arm of Dow Chemical. IBM has also put in place a variety of technology partnership deals with SAP, Microsoft, Tencent, AT&T and Intel to give its customers more flexibility in running other major business systems on IBM cloud networks.IBM also said on Wednesday it had reached a cloud services deal with National Express Group Plc to enable the UK-based bus and trains operator to offer commuters up-to-the-minute train schedules and what it said would be Britain's first postcode-to-postcode journey planner.(This story has been refiled to correct the capitalization of VMware) (Editing by Greg Mahlich)",2014-12-18,IBM,"Thu Dec 18, 2014 | 9:06am EST",IBM says cloud business enjoying 'breakthrough year',http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ibm-cloud-idUSKBN0JV2P420141218?type=companyNews

259,"   By Robert Cyran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - IBM requires an atypical activist fix. Big Blue's strategy of cost cuts and debt-fueled buybacks is no longer working - even though the company keeps trying. A tarnished balance sheet, lean staffing and a history of disposals rule out typical activist wheezes. Encouraging Chair and Chief Executive Ginni Rometty to invest in IBM's core businesses could pay off.For two decades IBM has run the same playbook. It sells low-margin businesses, slashes expenses, buys some profitable software companies, and returns a lot of cash to investors. Over the past four quarters, the $152 billion company has spent more than $23 billion on dividends and buybacks.The snag is that IBM is investing too little. Big Blue has only spent about $11 billion over the past four quarters in total on R&D, capital expenditure and acquisitions. That's a problem in tech, where old products soon become obsolete. While Google spends about 16 percent of its sales on R&D, IBM spends 6 percent.The effect is becoming clear on the top line. Revenue has shrunk for 10 quarters in a row. Costs have been cut to the bone, sending customers fleeing to better service providers. In a good year for stocks, IBM shares have fallen more than 15 percent. That means IBM has overpaid on its last three years of buybacks. That has spurred talk of activists. But what could rabble-rousing shareholders demand? Unlike Yahoo  there's no obvious gem to dispose of or cash-laden balance sheet to raid. IBM has been selling off hardware, like last quarter's disposal of the chip division, lessening the appeal of an HP-style breakup. IBM hasn't done any big acquisitions recently, so an activist can't argue it is wasting capital like HP, which wrote off three-quarters of the $12 billion it paid for Autonomy. And year after year of punishing cost cuts leave no obvious fat to cut.A better idea is to invest more in the business. Assume IBM repurchases $10 billion of stock next year. Bought back at current rates, that would result in a 7 percent increase in earnings per share. Meanwhile, IBM's pre-tax return on its business assets is 22 percent. Diverting that $10 billion into the business could result in more than $2 billion of pre-tax profit. Put this on IBM's low 20 percent tax rate and the result is more than a 12 percent increase in earnings per share.IBM's focus on financial, rather than product, engineering has caused low employee morale, falling sales and shareholder dissatisfaction. It's time to invest.  CONTEXT NEWS - IBM's revenue shrank by 4 percent in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period a year earlier.

""If this means the ECB is considering, or would implement, an open-ended form of (quantitative easing), well then that's a whole other ball game."" The FTSEurofirst 300 index that tracks European stock markets turned positive on the news reports and was last ahead 0.4 percent.U.S. stocks opened down, in part because International Business Machines Corp issued a disappointing outlook, but rose after the reports on the ECB bond-buying program.Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average was last up 32.78 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,548.01, the S&P 500  was ahead 9.35 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,031.9, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 20.83 points, or 0.45 percent, to 4,675.67. The MSCI World Index of equities markets was up 0.6 percent.U.S. Treasury debt prices, especially those of long-term issues, rose as the European bond-buying program was seen fueling demand for Treasuries that already pay much higher yields. Thirty-year bonds yielded 2.3729 percent, reflecting a price gain of 19/32.The euro hit a nearly one-week high against the dollar, at $1.168, after the media reports and was last at $1.1602, according to Thomson Reuters data. The expectations of ECB action - with the potential stimulus seen at around 600 billion euros ($690 billion), according to a Reuters poll - kept euro zone core bond yields near record lows.ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny told a Euromoney conference in Vienna that the bank's Thursday meeting would be interesting but one ""shouldn't get over excited about it.""The Japanese yen rose more 1 percent against the U.S. dollar  after the Bank of Japan left policy unchanged. Though the decision by the BoJ not to expand its stimulus package had been widely expected, some had bet on a surprise move as inflation targets looked elusive.Bets on euro zone monetary stimulus also reached the commodities markets, with gold climbing above $1,300 an ounce for the first time since August before settling back to $1,289.70. The prospect of looming deflation and increased market volatility were cited as factors supporting demand for bullion.Oil prices edged up, with Brent crude holding above $49, following a recent heavy sell-off that led Total's  chief executive to say the French energy major plans to cut capital spending by 10 percent this year.

281,"  IBM (IBM.N) dismissed on Monday a Forbes magazine report claiming the technology firm is preparing to cut about 26 percent of its workforce, which would represent its biggest-ever layoffs.IBM is cutting jobs, as disclosed in its latest earnings report last week, but those reductions will affect ""several thousand"" employees, a ""small fraction"" of what Forbes reported, according to an emailed statement from IBM to Reuters. Forbes had said as many as 112,000 employees could be laid off.The technology giant has been steadily reshaping its 400,000-plus staff for several years, laying off workers in some areas and hiring in new growth businesses. A report last Thursday on Forbes' website by pseudonymous Silicon Valley technology gossip columnist Robert Cringely said IBM planned to break with that gradual approach and suddenly lay off 26 percent of its global workforce. IBM did not issue a categorical denial of the report, but strongly suggested it was inaccurate. ""IBM does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones,"" the company said in the email. ""If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a small fraction of what's been reported.""Last week, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told investors on IBM's fourth-quarter earnings conference call that the company was taking restructuring charges of around $580 million, but he did not specify the number of jobs affected.“We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year,"" Schroeter said in response to a Wall Street analyst's question. ""It will be a lower amount.""   IBM does not disclose the amount of layoffs it makes each year, but one Wall Street analyst estimated that this year's restructuring charge suggests about 8,000 people, in line with recent years.""For each of the last seven years, IBM has taken annual restructuring charges of between about $450 million and $1.5 billion, which we estimated have resulted in workforce reductions of between 6,500 and 21,500 per year,"" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He said the Forbes report was ""puzzling"". IBM said it had 431,212 employees at the end of 2013, slightly down from 434,246 employees in 2012. The company has not yet disclosed its overall employee headcount for the end of 2014.IBM's shares were up about 0.5 percent at $156.66 on the New York Stock Exchange after paring earlier gains.

282,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A court ruling that sharply curtailed the ability of prosecutors including Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to pursue insider trading cases is increasingly testing regulators' abilities across the country.Defendants in California and Massachusetts have sought to take advantage of a December ruling from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that narrowed the definition of insider trading, making it harder for prosecutors to pursue their cases.The challenges raise the possibility that the 2nd Circuit decision, legally binding only in New York, Connecticut and Vermont, could be adopted by other jurisdictions nationally or could create a split among the federal courts.The ruling reversed the convictions of Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors.A three-judge panel held that prosecutors need to prove a trader knew the original source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information. It also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of ""some consequence"" and cannot be only friendship.Samuel Lieberman, a defense lawyer involved in a similar challenge, said judges across the country often look to the 2nd Circuit for guidance.""The 2nd Circuit is the leading appeals court for insider trading,"" he said. ""So disregarding it comes with some peril.""While the pace of prosecutions had looked set to slow from the pace of recent years, the appeals court's ruling could slam the brakes on authorities' efforts to pursue future cases. The decision's effect was quickly felt in New York, where Bharara's office on Friday filed papers asking the court to reconsider the ruling.Bharara's office has charged 92 people with insider trading since October 2009 and had won guilty pleas or trial convictions of 86 of them, including Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and former SAC Capital Advisors trader Mathew Martoma, before the 2nd Circuit ruling.Many of those cases are unlikely to be affected by the ruling, because the benefits were financial and known to the traders. But some defendants have already sought to vacate guilty pleas and reverse trial convictions in light of it. In the first decision to follow the 2nd Circuit ruling, a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday threw out the guilty pleas of four men accused of illegally dealing in shares ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition.A spokeswoman for Bharara declined comment, but in court papers Friday, his office argued the 2nd Circuit ruling ""threatens the effective enforcement of the securities laws.""RIPPLE EFFECTS The ruling is having ripple effects beyond New York. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data shows that 52 of the 66 people charged with insider trading civilly or criminally in the 2014 fiscal year were pursued outside of New York. In Boston, for example, authorities charged a group of friends who they said exchanged non-public information about American Superconductor Corp.One of the men, Eric McPhail, learned secret information about the company from one of its senior executives, who belonged to a country club where McPhail was a member.Despite being told the information in confidence, McPhail tipped off other golfing buddies, including attorney Douglas Parigian, who reaped $300,000 in illegal profits, authorities say.McPhail and Parigian were indicted in July, after earlier being sued by the SEC, which reached settlements with four of the friends for $145,309.Both men have moved to dismiss the SEC's case and plan to do the same in the criminal case in light of the 2nd Circuit ruling, said Allison Koury, Parigian's lawyer. In court papers, they argue no allegations exist that the executive received what would constitute a benefit under the 2nd Circuit's decision, and that authorities failed to allege Parigian knew about the benefit.The U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston did not respond to requests for comment.

283,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A court ruling that sharply curtailed the ability of prosecutors including Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to pursue insider trading cases is increasingly testing regulators' abilities across the country.    Defendants in California and Massachusetts have sought to take advantage of a December ruling from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that narrowed the definition of insider trading, making it harder for prosecutors to pursue their cases.    The challenges raise the possibility that the 2nd Circuit decision, legally binding only in New York, Connecticut and Vermont, could be adopted by other jurisdictions nationally or could create a split among the federal courts.    The ruling reversed the convictions of Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors.     A three-judge panel held that prosecutors need to prove a trader knew the original source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information. It also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of ""some consequence"" and cannot be only friendship.    Samuel Lieberman, a defense lawyer involved in a similar challenge, said judges across the country often look to the 2nd Circuit for guidance.       ""The 2nd Circuit is the leading appeals court for insider trading,"" he said. ""So disregarding it comes with some peril.""    While the pace of prosecutions had looked set to slow from the pace of recent years, the appeals court's ruling could slam the brakes on authorities' efforts to pursue future cases. The decision's effect was quickly felt in New York, where Bharara's office on Friday filed papers asking the court to reconsider the ruling.    Bharara's office has charged 92 people with insider trading since October 2009 and had won guilty pleas or trial convictions of 86 of them, including Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and former SAC Capital Advisors trader Mathew Martoma, before the 2nd Circuit ruling.     Many of those cases are unlikely to be affected by the ruling, because the benefits were financial and known to the traders. But some defendants have already sought to vacate guilty pleas and reverse trial convictions in light of it.     In the first decision to follow the 2nd Circuit ruling, a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday threw out the guilty pleas of four men accused of illegally dealing in shares ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition.     A spokeswoman for Bharara declined comment, but in court papers Friday, his office argued the 2nd Circuit ruling ""threatens the effective enforcement of the securities laws.""         RIPPLE EFFECTS     The ruling is having ripple effects beyond New York. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data shows that 52 of the 66 people charged with insider trading civilly or criminally in the 2014 fiscal year were pursued outside of New York.    In Boston, for example, authorities charged a group of friends who they said exchanged non-public information about American Superconductor Corp.      One of the men, Eric McPhail, learned secret information about the company from one of its senior executives, who belonged to a country club where McPhail was a member.    Despite being told the information in confidence, McPhail tipped off other golfing buddies, including attorney Douglas Parigian, who reaped $300,000 in illegal profits, authorities say.    McPhail and Parigian were indicted in July, after earlier being sued by the SEC, which reached settlements with four of the friends for $145,309.    Both men have moved to dismiss the SEC's case and plan to do the same in the criminal case in light of the 2nd Circuit ruling, said Allison Koury, Parigian's lawyer.    In court papers, they argue no allegations exist that the executive received what would constitute a benefit under the 2nd Circuit's decision, and that authorities failed to allege Parigian knew about the benefit.     The U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston did not respond to requests for comment. But the SEC has argued since the information was misappropriated, it has to prove a benefit flowed to McPhail, who acted as the tipper.    The SEC said McPhail had made it clear he ""was looking forward to getting paid back.""

288,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 29 U.S. prosecutors said they are prepared to drop charges against five men accused of engaging in insider trading ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition, citing a major appellate court ruling limiting authorities' abilities to pursue such cases.In an unusual letter late Wednesday, prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara asked U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter to dismiss the indictment.Such a decision would allow Bharara's office to appeal Carter's ruling last week that the December appellate court decision applied to the case, a holding that prompted the judge to throw out four of the men's guilty pleas.But prosecutors said if Carter will not dismiss the indictment, they intend to drop the charges, saying its evidence ""falls short"" of the appellate court's standards.A hearing is scheduled for later Thursday.

293,"  (Corrects to revenue from profit in second paragraph)SEATTLE Jan 30 International Business Machines Corp brought back annual performance bonuses for its chief executive and her top lieutenants for 2014 despite falling profits and a tumbling stock price, a regulatory filing showed on Friday.The technology company, which has posted lower revenue for 11 quarters in a row as it struggles to transform itself into a cloud-based software and services company, withheld annual bonuses in 2013 at the executives' own request.The bonuses returned as a feature of IBM's executive compensation for 2014, according to a document filed with securities regulators on Friday, despite the fact that IBM's net profit from continuing operations fell 7 percent last year and its stock shed about 14 percent. IBM CEO Virginia Rometty will get a $3.6 million annual incentive payout for 2014, according to the filing. Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter and three other executives or advisers were also listed as getting smaller annual incentive payouts. Rometty is slated to receive a base salary of $1.6 million for 2015, a target annual incentive award of $5 million and a long-term stock payout worth $13.3 million, according to the filing.The company last year withdrew its long-term plan to hit $20 per share in operating earnings for 2015, as it faltered in its move away from hardware to focus on higher-margin businesses such as security software and cloud services.

294,"  WASHINGTON Feb 9 IBM filed a lawsuit against Priceline Group Inc on Monday, accusing it of infringing four IBM patents in running its travel and dining websites.International Business Machines Corp asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware to bar Priceline from using the patents, to award IBM royalties and to order Priceline to pay IBM's costs and attorney's fees. IBM also said that the infringement was willful, and asked for all damages to be trebled.IBM said it had approached Priceline about the alleged infringement. ""Despite IBM's repeated demands, Priceline refuses to negotiate a license. This lawsuit seeks to stop Priceline from continuing to use IBM's intellectual property without authorization,"" IBM said in its complaint.Two of the IBM patents are from the late 1990s, one which tracks prior conversations with a user and another which speeds Internet transmissions. The third patent is from 2006 and is a method of showing Internet advertising; a fourth from 2009 improves on a single sign-on. Priceline also used the patented technology on its websites kayak.com and opentable.com, IBM alleged. Priceline was not immediately available for comment.The case is at the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. It is International Business Machines Corp v.

295,"  International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), which ruled computing in the age of the mainframe, is targeting $40 billion in annual revenue from the cloud, big data, security and other growth areas by 2018.The aggressive target, set by IBM executives at the company's annual investor meeting in New York on Thursday, is the latest step for the technology giant towards emerging, high-margin businesses, and away from its previous strongholds in hardware and servers.The $40 billion will come from areas which IBM calls its ""strategic imperatives,"" namely cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security software. That would represent about 44 percent of $90 billion in total revenue that analysts expect from IBM in 2018.

299,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK IBM Corp was sued on Monday by a shareholder that said it committed securities fraud by failing to write down a money-losing semiconductor unit before agreeing to pay another company $1.5 billion to take that unit off its hands.The lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court arose from IBM's announcement last Oct. 20 that it would sell the unit to GlobalFoundries Inc, and take a related $4.7 billion pre-tax charge.IBM also announced third-quarter results that day. Its share price fell 9 percent over the next two trading days, wiping out more than $18 billion of market value.The Armonk, New York-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suit. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc is among IBM's largest shareholders. According to the complaint, IBM inflated its stock price before selling the semiconductor unit by carrying the unit's property, plant and equipment assets on its books at $2.4 billion, when it should have known the assets were worthless.The complaint said potential bidders had been unwilling to pay much more than $1 billion for the entire unit, including intellectual property and personnel, suggesting that the hard assets had no or negative market value.

307,"   By Mike Stone | March 3  March 3 Novetta Solutions LLC, a provider of software and IT services to the U.S. intelligence community, is exploring a sale which could value it at more than $650 million, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.Novetta's sale process comes as cuts in U.S. government spending, particularly in the areas of defense and security, have hit companies that rely on government contracts, spurring consolidation in the industry.Arlington Capital Partners, Novetta's private equity owner, has hired investment banks Morgan Stanley and Houlihan Lokey on an auction for the company, the people said this week.Novetta has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of between $40 million and $50 million, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is not public. Representatives for Novetta, Arlington Capital Partners, Morgan Stanley and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment.McLean, Virginia-based Novetta offers data analytics services to government clients working with large sets of data. Its customers include national intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM Corp , as well as defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co and General Dynamics Corp , could show interest in Novetta, according to the sources.Representatives from General Dynamics, Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin, and IBM declined to comment. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. A deal for Novetta would be just the latest example of a private equity firm selling a government services portfolio company.Last month, government services contractor Engility Holdings Inc, acquired TASC, a provider of professional services to government agencies for $1.3 billion. TASC was controlled by affiliates of the private equity firms KKR & Co LP and General Atlantic LLC.On Sunday, Science Applications International Corp  a provider of information technology and engineering services to governments, said it would acquire Scitor Corp, a smaller peer, for $790 million. Scitor is owned by private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP.

310,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING, March 5  BEIJING, March 5 China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Intel Corp are expanding an existing alliance to provide cloud computing to global telecoms carriers, as U.S. tech firms vie for Chinese tie-ups to retain access to a tough mainland market.The partnership, announced by Huawei in a statement, comes as U.S and other Western tech firms' scramble to burnish their bona fides with China, which has become increasingly wary of foreign technology.Joining hands with Chinese companies, including technology transfers and adopting Chinese partners' branding, can make these products more palatable to local buyers and authorities in the world's second-largest economy. ""How do you stay in this market and do the least damage to your core business - that's the puzzle everybody is focusing on now,"" said James McGregor, chairman for advisory firm APCO China.China's government has been openly pushing for the use of more Chinese and less foreign-made technology, both to grow its own tech sector and as a response to former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's leaks about widespread U.S. cyber surveillance. These policies have become a source of considerable friction in foreign relations.Earlier this week, U.S. President Barack Obama warned of a proposed anti-terrorism law's impact on technology firms and international business, and demanded amendments. Other U.S. enterprise tech firms adopting a partnership strategy include IBM Corp, Dell Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and Juniper Networks Inc.The cloud computing industry is a focus area for China, with Premier Li Keqiang saying in his government work report delivered to parliament on Thursday that the government would support its development.Intel and Huawei have collaborated previously, including a server and cloud product team-up in 2012 and an agreement to cooperate on data storage last April.

311,"   By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss | NEW YORK  NEW YORK International Business Machines Corp is considering adopting the underlying technology behind bitcoin, known as the ""blockchain,"" to create a digital cash and payment system for major currencies, according to a person familiar with the matter.The objective is to allow people to transfer cash or make payments instantaneously using this technology without a bank or clearing party involved, saving on transaction costs, the person said. The transactions would be in an open ledger of a specific country's currency such as the dollar or euro, said the source,  who declined to be identified because of a lack of authorization to discuss the project in public.The blockchain - a ledger, or list, of all of a digital currency's transactions - is viewed as bitcoin's main technological innovation, allowing users to make payments anonymously, instantly, and without government regulation. Rather than stored on a separate server and controlled by an individual, company, or bank, the ledger is open and accessible to all participants in the bitcoin network. The proposed digital currency system would work in a similar way.""When somebody wants to transact in the system, instead of you trying to acquire a bitcoin, you simply say, here are some U.S. dollars,"" the source said. ""It's sort of a bitcoin but without the bitcoin."" IBM is one of a number of tech companies looking to expand the use of the blockchain technology beyond bitcoin, the digital currency launched six years ago that has spurred a following among investors and tech enthusiasts.The company has been in informal discussions about a blockchain-tied cash system with a number of central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the source said. If central banks approve the concept, IBM will build the secure and scalable infrastructure for the project.IBM media relations office did not respond to Reuters emails about this story and the Fed declined to comment.  However, there are signs that central banks are already thinking about the innovations that could arise through digital currency systems. The Bank of England, in a report in September 2014, described the blockchain's open ledger as a ""significant innovation"" that could transform the financial system more generally. Instead of having ledgers maintained by banks that act as a record of an individual's transactions, this kind of open ledger would be viewable by everyone using the system, and would use an agreed-upon process for entering transactions into the system.The project is still in the early stages and constantly evolving, the source said. It is also unclear how concerns about money-laundering and criminal activities that have hamstrung bitcoin.  Unlike bitcoin, where the network is decentralized and there is no overseer, the proposed digital currency system would be controlled by central banks, the source said. ""These coins will be part of the money supply,"" the source said. ""It's the same money, just not a dollar bill with a serial number on it, but a token that sits on this blockchain.""According to the plans, the digital currency could be linked to a person's bank account, possibly using a wallet software that would integrate that account with the proposed digital currency ledger. ""We are at a tipping point right now. It's making a lot more sense for some type of digital cash in the system, that not only saves our government money, but also is a lot more convenient and secure for individuals to use,"" the source said.

""I think some firms find that perhaps frightening. We, though, at IBM ... find that to be a great opportunity.""Rometty's remarks were among the clearest acknowledgements to date by a high-ranking foreign technology executive that companies must adopt a different tack if they are to continue in China amid growing political pressure.A number of U.S. technology companies operating in China are forming alliances with domestic operators, hoping a local partner will make it easier to operate in the increasingly tough environment for foreign businesses.

318,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT, March 27  FRANKFURT, March 27 Nine months after Apple  and IBM began working together on building mobile apps for businesses, some of the first fruits are about to appear at UK pharmacy chain Boots, which has begun equipping store employees with iPads to serve shoppers in the aisles.These customer service apps are part of a bid by Boots to encourage consumers to pre-order cosmetics and toiletries online, similar to calling ahead for medical prescriptions, while turning its 2,500 retail outlets into convenient pick-up points.""These apps put all of Boots' inventory at (employees') fingertips,"" said Robin Phillps, who is in charge of digital and e-commerce business at the company, now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance. ""This makes it easier for them ... to interact with customers on their own terms.""Companies across dozens of different industries are now eyeing how these mobile business apps from Apple and IBM can hook up front-line staff to back-office systems and make them smarter in face-to-face dealings with customers in the field.Businesses which first invested heavily in apps for mobile shoppers have just begun to put customer-service employees on an equally mobile footing, Forrester Research said in a report this month on the phenomenon.With many companies' in-house technical staff struggling to keep pace with the ways their employees use mobile phones, Apple and IBM are part of a growing market for supplying business and government organisations with a new class of apps for employees on the move.Technology consultants Accenture, Cap Gemini  and Deloitte are also top suppliers to this changing way of doing business, along with dozens of other service providers and hundreds of custom designer app firms.MAKING STAFF ""SMARTER""  IBM says it now has more than 200 global companies gearing up to use mobile phone apps through its partnership with Apple.  These include U.S. banking group Citi and Banorte  of Mexico, Air Canada, and retailers American Eagle Outfitters and Boots UK.The partnership has announced 14 app templates so far, which IBM then works with clients to customise with specific company data and analytics. Each app lets employees look up customer profiles and answer questions on the go rather than anchoring them to counter terminals as most businesses typically do.""We are trying to bring that same 'wow' factor, the same changes we have had in our personal lives, to our working lives,"" said Katharyn White, IBM's global sales and marketing lead for the IBM-Apple partnership.The goal is to create 100 business apps running on iPhones or iPads by the end of this year, White said. Companies pay a monthly subscription fee per device running the app, plus the costs of the secure iPhones or iPads running the software, as well as for services to hook them up to back-office systems. For the airline industry, these apps will let flight attendants help passengers rebook flights in mid-air. Financial service apps allow bankers, wealth advisors or insurance agents to make on-the-spot account decisions with clients in the field.Other Apple-IBM apps give police secure, instant access on iPhones to crime-scene maps, video feeds and suspect profiles.Besides design expertise for the apps themselves, Apple provides remote technical support for a company's own technology departments managing the apps. And as part of the deal IBM sells iPhones and iPads along with the business apps, a potentially important new revenue stream for Apple as big businesses begin to mobilise more of their workforces.For IBM, which has software and design teams developing the MobileFirst apps, the apps themselves also take corporate and government customers to a range of IBM services -- technical support, mobile device management, back-office software integration and cloud computing. BRINGING ONLINE WORLD TO STORES At Boots UK the retailer plans to introduce the business apps in hundreds of pharmacies to employees equipped with 4,000 iPads it has purchased so far. Boots also plans to make Wi-Fi ubiquitous in its pharmacies, both for employees using the business apps and for shoppers on their phones.Currently 7.5 million shoppers visit Boots stores each week while 2.7 computer and phone users research and purchase goods via its online sites. About one-third of online shoppers, or around 1 million consumers, do so using mobile phones, so far.The aim is to get customers to order the bulk of their goods online and then pick them up the next morning at local pharmacies, Phillips said. Employee apps complement this mission with a means of interacting with in-store customers.Its Sales Assist app, which provides an internal version of the company's public e-ecommerce site, enables Boots employees to serve shoppers in the aisles and eventually they will also be able to take payments with a quick swipe of the customer's  phone.""The direction we are moving is purchasing in the aisles,"" Phillips says, adding that the goal is to remove the check-out till as a barrier to buying.

320,"  International Business Machines Corp said on Tuesday it will invest $3 billion over the next four years in a new 'Internet of Things' unit, aiming to sell its expertise in gathering and making sense of the surge in real-time data.The Armonk, New York-based technology company said its services will be based remotely in the cloud, and offer companies ways to make use of the new and multiplying sources of data such as building sensors, smartphones and home appliances to enhance their own products.For its first major partnership, IBM said a unit of the Weather Co will move its weather data services onto IBM's cloud, so that customers can use the data in tandem with IBM's analytics tools. As a result, IBM is hoping that companies will be able to combine live weather forecasting with a range of business data, so companies can quickly adapt to customer buying patterns or supply chain issues connected to the weather.   For example, insurance companies could send messages to policyholders in certain areas when hailstorms are approaching and tell them safe places to park, saving money all round. Or retail stores could compare weather forecasts with past data to predict surges or drop-offs in customer buying due to extreme weather, and to adjust staffing and supply chain logistics accordingly. IBM said it was already working with some large companies, such as German tire maker Continental AG and jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney to help them use data in their processes.  Focusing on the cloud is part of IBM's gradual shift away from its traditional hardware and consulting business. The company is targeting $40 billion in annual revenue from the cloud, big data, security and other growth areas by 2018, which should be about 45 percent of its total revenue at that time, based on analysts' growth estimates.

322,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE IBM has uncovered a sophisticated fraud scheme run by a well- funded Eastern European gang of cyber criminals that uses a combination of phishing, malware and phone calls that the technology company says has netted more than $1 million from large and medium-sized U.S. companies.The scheme, which IBM security researchers have dubbed ""The Dyre Wolf,"" is small in comparison with more recent widespread online fraud schemes but represents a new level of sophistication. According to IBM, since last year the attackers have been targeting people working in companies by sending spam email with unsafe attachments to get a variant of the malware known as Dyre into as many computers as possible.If installed, the malware waits until it recognizes that the user is navigating to a bank website and instantly creates a  fake screen telling the user that the bank's site is having problems and to call a certain number.  If users call that number, they get through to an English-speaking operator who already knows what bank the users think they are contacting. The operator then elicits the users' banking details and immediately starts a large wire transfer to take money out of the relevant account.The use of a live phone operator is what makes the scheme  unique, said Caleb Barlow, vice president of IBM Security.""What's very different in this case, is we saw a pivot of  the attackers to use a set of social engineering techniques that I think are unprecedented,"" said Barlow. ""The focus on wire transfers of large sums of money really got our attention.""   IBM did not release any details on which companies fell prey to the scheme or the location of the perpetrators.Once the transfer is complete, the money is then quickly moved from bank to bank to evade detection. In one instance, IBM said, the gang hit the victim company with a denial of service attack - essentially bringing down their Web capabilities - so it would not discover the theft until much later.  International Business Machines Corp's security unit is recommending that companies make sure employees are trained in spotting phishing attacks - where emails or attachments can infect a computer - and to never provide banking credentials to anyone.

323,"   By Nadia Damouni and Svea Herbst-Bayliss | NEW YORK/BOSTON  NEW YORK/BOSTON Some top shareholders of IBM, disappointed by 11 straight quarters of falling revenues, are seeking help from activist investors to shake up the company, but have been turned down by both Bill Ackman's Pershing Square and Jeffrey Ubben's ValueAct, according to people with knowledge of the matter.International Business Machines Corp is concerned about a possible attack by prominent activist hedge funds, and is working with two investment banks to formulate a defense plan, according to the people, who declined to be identified.When asked for comment, IBM said: ""IBM is continuing to execute on our strategy - making investments in growth areas such as analytics and cloud, reinventing our core franchises, and returning capital to shareholders. We are managing the company for the long term.""The storied American technology giant, worth about $160 billion currently, has struggled to transform itself from a low-margin hardware maker into a cloud-based software and services company.When Virginia Rometty took over as chief executive at the start of 2012, Wall Street was hopeful that she would be able to kickstart growth. Analysts praised the former systems engineer for her strategic thinking in guiding IBM's acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Coopers Consulting in 2002. As revenues continued to decline year on year, however, some IBM investors began to lose confidence management, according to people familiar with the matter. Last year, IBM withdrew its long-term operating earnings target for 2015, and shares of Big Blue are now down about 25 percent from a March 2013 high.Some IBM shareholders are trying to persuade prominent activists to build positions in the company and come up with ways to boost value, people familiar with the matter said. Pershing Square and ValueAct Capital both looked at IBM in recent months, but passed on making a move, the people said. A spokesman for Pershing Square declined to comment. ValueAct did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Part of the activist funds' concern was that IBM is too expensive and the company's structural problems could not be fixed easily, according to several sources. The stock was up 1.2 percent at $161.09 in late trading on Friday.Another reason, the sources said, is that some investors feel Rometty is doing a good job coping with a tough situation, so she does not fit the role of an underperforming CEO that many activists look for when they make a move.Once best-known for mainframe computers, IBM has been pivoting to security software and cloud services, but growth in those areas has not fully offset weakness elsewhere. Revenue in 2014 fell to $93 billion, from $107 billion in 2011. IBM in said in February it is targeting $40 billion annual revenue from the cloud, big data, security and other areas by 2018. It has divested about $7 billion in commoditized IT assets, such as call centers and chip manufacturing, and announced multibillion dollar investments in cloud data centers and its Watson supercomputer system.  NO DISCUSSIONS AT PRESENT It is not unusual for investors and consultants to try and shop companies to activists. At a time when stock picking is becoming tougher, pressuring companies to buy back shares, spin off units, or replace a CEO can be appealing.There are currently no discussions between IBM and any activist investor, two of the sources said. Still, the company's advisers are educating IBM's board on how to handle an activist and to conduct a strategic alternative analysis, they said. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc is a top investor in IBM. With Buffett often siding with management, his presence may make it less appealing for activists to jump in.""These days no company is safe from an activist looking at it,"" said Damien Park, who works with large corporations as head of consulting group Hedge Fund Solutions.""Everyone is on the list and either you already have been approached by an activist or you will be approached by an activist.""    The $20 billion Pershing Square helped breathe new life into Canada's No.2 railway, Canadian Pacific, and the $15 billion ValueAct helped engineer a leadership change at Microsoft Corp.ValueAct sits on the board of Microsoft, which competes with IBM in some markets. ValueAct may have faced a conflict of interest if it were to take action on IBM.Other large technology companies that have come under attack from activists in recent years include Apple Inc and eBay Inc, both targeted by Carl Icahn; Relational Investor LLC took aim at Hewlett-Packard Co; and Elliott Management Corp is pressing EMC Corp to spin off VMware Inc.

329,"  (Updates with further comment from lawyers)By Nate RaymondNEW YORK, April 3 A U.S. appeals court on Friday rejected a request by federal prosecutors to reconsider a major ruling that curtailed their ability to pursue insider trading cases and jeopardized several convictions.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York denied a petition by prosecutors to grant a rehearing in the case of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, who in December won the reversal of their insider trading convictions.The court gave no explanation for why a rehearing was rejected by both the original three-judge panel and by the full  2nd Circuit, potentially 16 judges.It was unclear if the government would within 90 days seek U.S. Supreme Court review. A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara declined to comment.""It is now time for the government to move on and allow an innocent man to continue with his life,"" Stephen Fishbein and John Nathanson, lawyers for Newman, said in a statement. Friday's ruling marked the latest setback for an insider trading crackdown by Bharara's office that has since 2009 resulted in charges against 93 people.Bharara's office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had said the December ruling threatened their ability  to pursue insider trading.The three-judge panel held that prosecutors must prove a trader knew a tip's source received a benefit in exchange for the information. The court also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of ""some consequence"" and cannot be only friendship.The ruling reversed the 2012 convictions of Newman, a former Diamondback Capital Management portfolio manager, and Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors.Newman and Chiasson had been sentenced to 4-1/2 years and 6-1/2 years in prison, respectively, for engaging in a $72 million scheme involving insider tips about Dell Inc and Nvidia Corp. Gregory Morvillo, Chiasson's lawyer, said his client hopes  the case becomes a ""cautionary story"" about the consequences of pursuing legally-novel prosecutions.Already, the December ruling has been seized upon by other defendants, and has prompted Bharara's office to drop charges against five men accused of insider trading ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition.The ruling could also benefit Michael Steinberg, a SAC Capital Advisors portfolio manager sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison after his 2013 conviction for engaging in the same conspiracy as Newman and Chiasson.Barry Berke, Steinberg's lawyer, said Friday's decision ""requires his conviction to be thrown out as well.""The case is U.S. v.

More money is expected to pour in as investors hunt for bargains. New York-listed Alibaba, the world's largest e-commerce firm, has seen its shares slide 19 percent year-to-date. This slump owes itself to investor excitement wearing off after the firm's record-setting $25 billion IPO last September, and a lacklustre set of third-quarter earnings results.Facebook is up five percent since the beginning of 2015.

340,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and IBM (IBM.N) are working together to hook cars up to the Internet, going beyond mapping and infotainment to link vehicles up to shops, service networks and urban transport grids, the companies said on Wednesday. Financial terms of the new, seven-year partnership were not disclosed. The agreement to develop new types of valued-added services for vehicles builds on an initial partnership between the automaker and technology consultant announced a year ago.The companies said in a joint statement they planned to develop services for drivers and passengers, as well as back-end applications that could perform preventive car maintenance and traffic management functions.The partnership looks beyond existing driver navigation, roadside assistance and infotainment offerings popularized by tech firms such as Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple (AAPL.O), and map services from Nokia's K1V.HE> HERE unit and TomTom (TOM2.AS). Software analytics from the car and tapping into smart grids of sensors on traffic signs and streetlights could help manage congestion and cut down on pollution, as well as feeding back to service networks for preventive car maintenance programs. It could also link vehicles to retailers, an IBM executive said.Axel Rogaichus, head of IBM's automotive consulting practice in Europe, told Reuters it was one of the largest partnerships the computer services supplier had agreed so far in the automotive industry.  IBM reached a separate partnership agreement in 2013 with Germany's Continental AG (CONG.DE), a top global auto parts supplier, to build an ""electronic horizon"" platform that enables cars to anticipate upcoming obstructions, for example.IBM and PSA, Europe's second largest carmaker, said they had agreed to share responsibilities for developing, selling and marketing, and implementing connected services with new and existing clients of the firms. The companies said they had established a center to work together in Paris to develop the new range of services. The latest deal focuses on connecting passenger vehicles into a variety of network-connected platforms that IBM is developing with other auto industry partners. But Rogaichus stopped short of saying whether Peugeot might consider working with other automakers to advance urban smartgrids and other remote, connected-car functions.

346,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Billionaire investor Warren Buffett defended some of his core holdings in a televised interview on Monday, but reiterated that equities in general would look expensive in an environment with normal interest rates.The remarks from Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), come as several of his core holdings, including International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N), have showed declining revenue trends in recent years.Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire had bought more shares of IBM during the first quarter, and forecast higher earnings at the company over the next 10 years.He also praised IBM's stock buyback program, which he said had been ""enormously beneficial"" for shareholders, though he stressed that in general, buyback programs should be done based on share price and not as an all-purpose strategy.Coca-Cola continues to have a ""strong competitive position,"" he said. Referring to the broader market, Buffett said equity valuation would appear ""on the high side"" if interest rates were normalized from their currently low levels, while U.S. bonds currently appear ""very overvalued."" The comments on equity valuation repeated remarks he had made over the weekend at an annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting. While he acknowledged that investors expect interest rates to rise this year, Buffett said it would be difficult for the United States to raise rates ""significantly"" if European rates remain low.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's ""hands are somewhat tied"" by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi with respect to interest rates, he said.Buffett also commented on the recent strength in the U.S. dollar, as well as the state of the euro zone, two key issues for Wall Street investors.  He predicted that the European Union ""more likely than not"" would exist in 20 years, though it could have different members than it currently does, a possible reference to Greece's current difficulties.Speaking about the dollar, Buffett said that given a choice between the U.S. dollar and a basket of other currencies, he would prefer the dollar over the next 10 years.

An increase in rates raises will tighten the flow of easy money that has driven stocks and bond prices to record highs and raise borrowing costs for companies.Economists and top Wall Street banks expect the Fed to raise rates in September, in what could be the central bank's first hike in almost a decade.""Investors don't want to make any big moves ahead of the meeting and Greece certainly continues to be a big factor,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.U.S. stocks climbed on Thursday as retail sales data lifted the outlook for consumer spending and as healthcare shares gained.

The stabilization in producer prices should support views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.

361,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING, June 12  BEIJING, June 12 The Internet bank affiliate of China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd on Friday touted its in-house cloud computing system as an alternative to the U.S. technology that the government wants to purge from the domestic financial sector.The new technology systems of soon-to-launch MYbank would avoid products from IBM Corp, Oracle Corp and EMC Corp, according to a presentation by Tang Jiacai, the bank's chief information officer.The detail is an example of how Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, which part-owns MYbank, often march in lockstep with government policy.Beijing has become increasingly wary of foreign technology and has actively promoted the weaning of the financial sector off of IBM, Oracle and EMC systems, which form the network backbone for much of China's finance sector. The process has been dubbed ""IOE out"", or ""de-IOE"", after the first letters of the three companies' names.""The innovative technology (discussed) today promotes the development of all Internet finance,"" said Deputy Governor of MYbank Zhao Weixing, noting this kind of ""de-IOE"" cloud banking system was a first. MYbank executives said being cloud-based would reduce the bank's technology costs and allow it to make cheaper loans.Forrester senior analyst Charlie Dai said MYbank's deployment of non-IOE technology would be a meaningful gesture, particularly after China's banking regulator recently nixed cyber security rules after domestic banks were unwilling to migrate off of foreign technology products.""It's a big step if they can prove it's viable to drop IOE from core banking functions, not just non-mission critical operations,"" Dai said. MYbank is widely expected to launch this month, although executives declined to specify when.The ""IOE out"" characteristic was just one of many features Tang highlighted in a presentation, in which he discussed the benefits of having an in-house, cloud computing network. The government has pushed for domestic industries, especially in key sectors such as finance, to drop foreign-made technology, particularly from the United States. This came after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed that U.S. spy agencies planted code in American tech exports to snoop on overseas targets.Analysts have said China's efforts to protect itself and sensitive information from potential vulnerabilities in foreign-made technology are perfectly reasonable.But using different, newer technology carries its own risks, as they have neither the technical nor security pedigree of products from the likes of IBM, Oracle and EMC.Forrester's Dai said traditional banks may be more reluctant to follow MYbank's lead.Many Chinese technology companies said they have years to go before catching up with their U.S. peers, especially in terms of data security.

362,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for  International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), including the long-term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's  action affects approximately $49 billion of debt, including IBM's undrawn $10  billion credit facility. A full list if rating actions follows at the end of  this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for stabilizing operating  trends, including the resumption of positive organic revenue growth in the  intermediate term. IBM's investments in strategic imperatives (data, cloud and  engagement) should drive double-digit growth and achieve sufficient scale in  these markets and begin to offset long-term secular decline in legacy  information technology (IT) demand. Nonetheless, Fitch expects mid-single-digit  negative revenue growth in 2015, largely due to significant currency headwinds. Fitch expects modest margin expansion following the divestitures of the less  profitable semiconductor foundry and industry standard server (ISS) businesses  in 2014. Fitch forecasts operating EBITDA margin will approach 27 % through the  intermediate term, versus a Fitch estimated 26% for the latest 12 months (LTM)  ended March 31, 2015. At the same time, a higher mix of sales from strategic  imperatives should drive more stable profitability.  Fitch expects strong annual free cash flow (FCF) ranging from $8 billion to $9  billion through the intermediate term, driven by profitability growth and lower  capital spending following the divestiture of the more capital intensive foundry  business. Fitch expects IBM will meet its commitment of using 75%-85% of  pre-dividend annual FCF for a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  Nonetheless, Fitch expects credit protection measures will remain solid for the  rating. Total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) as of the LTM ended  March 31, 2015 was flat year-over-year at 1.7x and interest coverage (operating  EBITDA to gross interest expense) decreased slightly to 23.4x for the LTM ended  March 31, 2015 from 24.4x in the comparable prior year period. Core leverage  (which excludes debt related to the financing business) decreased to 1x for the  LTM ended March 31, 2015 from 1.2x in the prior year period. The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's: --Highly diversified customer base from both an industry and geographic  perspective.  --Considerable recurring revenue from IBM's information technology (IT)  services, software and financing, which in aggregate account for approximately  half of total revenue and reduces revenue and profit volatility. --Strong market position: Breadth and quality of product and service offerings,  resulting in leading revenue market share in IT services, middleware software,  servers and No.3 share of the total disk storage market. --Significant liquidity, supported by a solid cash position, committed credit  facilities and strong FCF. --Strong core (non-financing) credit protection metrics for the 'A+' rating  category. Fitch's concerns include: --Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which, in the  absence of commensurate growth in profitability, could pressure FCF and  financial flexibility, necessitating further increases in core debt to fund  acquisitions or share repurchases. --Significant and consistent research and development (R&D) investments required  to keep pace with innovation, which constrains meaningful profit margin  expansion but also supports barriers to entry in certain markets.  --Expectations for debt financed acquisitions in new IT to accelerate  transformation.  --Long-term threat to highly profitable mainframe demand and associated  operating system software (z/OS) from increasing penetration of  industry-standard servers (ISS). KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Roughly flat revenue growth on an organic and constant currency basis for  2015, driven by growth in IBM's strategic imperatives beginning to offset  ongoing secular declines in legacy markets. Stronger than anticipated hardware  should partially offset weaker than expected growth in services. --Beyond the near term, Fitch expects flat- to low-single-digit revenue growth  on an organic and constant currency basis, driven by faster growth in strategic  imperatives markets. --Profitability will expand due to a richer sales mix following recent  divestitures. Fitch anticipates operating EBITDA margins in the 26%-28% range  through the forecast period. --R&D and capital spending levels remain consistent through the forecast period,  pro forma for the divestiture of the highly capital-intensive foundry business. --Annual cash pension contributions will remain in the $500 million to $600  million range. --Dividends will grow at 10% annually and IBM will use 75%-85% of pre-dividend  annual FCF for a combination of dividends and share repurchases. --Acquisitions will be debt financed but core debt levels otherwise will remain  flat.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded if Fitch expects: --A shift to more aggressive financial policies, including sustained core  leverage in excess of 1.25x;  --Continued mid-single-digit organic negative revenue growth (constant currency  basis) or profitability pressures within IBM's traditional recurring core  franchises, signalling a weakening operating profile despite the company's  strategic imperatives growth focus.  Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a higher  rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for acquisitions or  shareholder-friendly activities limits further positive rating actions.  LIQUIDITY Fitch believes IBM's liquidity will remain strong and, as of March 31, 2015, was  supported by: --$8.8 billion of cash and equivalents;  --An undrawn $10 billion RCF expiring Nov. 10, 2019, which fully supports IBM's  commercial paper programs;  --$8 billion to $9 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.  The funded status of IBM's worldwide defined benefit (DB) pension plans was 97%  at year-end 2014. Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, the funded  status of IBM's U.S. and worldwide plans at year-end 2014 were 102% and 90%,  respectively. IBM estimates cash contribution to the defined contribution plans  to be approximately $1.2 billion during fiscal 2015. The company is not legally  required to make any contribution to the U.S. DB pension plans, but estimates  contribution to its non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans to be  approximately $600 million. Total debt was $38.8 billion as of March 31, 2015, consisting of $4.5 billion of  short-term debt and $34.3 billion of long-term debt. Fitch estimates $26.2  billion (68%) of total debt is attributable to IBM's global financing business  with the remaining debt attributable to core (non-financing) operations. IBM has  long-term debt maturities of approximately $650 million for the remainder of  2015. The main purpose of IBM Global Financing (IGF) is to facilitate clients'  acquisition of IBM systems, software and services by providing financial and  capital management solutions. IGF has a solid long-term operating record,  provides strategic advantages to IBM in terms of attracting and retaining  customers by delivering total solutions. IBM also generates an annuity-like  revenue stream associated with multi-year leases. IGF's primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some risks  associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and clear  insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics have remained  relatively solid as a result of the relatively conservative underwriting culture  and strong risk management capabilities. IGF's capitalization remains solid for  the rating category and leverage levels continue to hover near management's  target of 7x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed IBM's ratings as follows: --IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at 'F1'.

A trader appears to have bought 40,500 calls in an apparent bet on the ETF's shares rising above $45 by mid-September. The trade opens the biggest block of open interest in the ETF's options.Sentiment for the sector seems to have been boosted from Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) strong quarterly results on Thursday, which propelled its shares to an all-time high, strategists said. The effect was most noticeable for options on Apple, scheduled to report third-quarter revenue and profit results on Tuesday. Since Google's results, there has been a significant pick-up in demand for Apple calls, usually used to place bullish bets on the shares.""It just seems that as if Google ripped and traders came in pretty aggressively to set up on the long side in Apple,"" said Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at MKM Partners.

Oil prices fell too on signs of a growing glut in refined products. The dollar index was up marginally at $97.87. It had earlier hit a three-month high due to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike this year.""The commodity markets are lower which are a concern because if those prices fall then economic growth isn't as strong as we thought,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.On Friday, strong earnings from Google pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq to a record close, which gained 4.3 percent for the week, its largest weekly gain since October while the S&P 500 stopped just short of its record high.Tech earnings will continue to be in focus this week with IBM reporting after the close on Monday and other big tech giants such as Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft  expected to report later this week. Of the companies that have reported earnings so far, 71 percent have reported earnings above analyst expectations, above the 63 percent that typically beat in a quarter.However, only 51 percent have beaten on revenue, below the 61 percent.U.S. companies were expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar that reduces the value of U.S. companies' overseas income. Profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.""Revenue growth is very weak and unless you see some sustainable growth, we'll continue to see sideways movement for the rest of the year,"" said Nolte.

SunEdison was up 3.8 percent to $32.76.Horizon Pharma jumped as much as 6.5 percent to a record of $39.49, after the Irish drugmaker raised its full-year sales forecast.Hasbro was up 6.3 percent at $83.12 after the U.S. toymaker reported a lower-than-expected decline in quarterly revenue, helped by strong demand for its ""Jurassic World""- and ""Star Wars""-themed toys.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,916 to 982.

Upholding Scheindlin's ruling, Circuit Judge José Cabranes wrote for a 3-0 appeals court panel that Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford could not be held directly responsible for alleged improper actions by its South African unit.He also found no showing that ""by developing hardware and software to collect innocuous population data,"" Armonk, New York-based IBM purposefully contributed to apartheid-era abuses. ""Knowledge of or complicity in the perpetration of a crime under the law of nations (customary international law )- absent evidence that a defendant purposefully facilitated the commission of that crime-is insufficient to establish a claim of aiding and abetting liability under the ATS,"" Cabranes wrote.Diane Sammons, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, argued that Ford's U.S. conduct justified liability, and called it ""astounding"" that IBM's conduct was not deemed purposeful.""We certainly will consider an appeal to the Supreme Court,"" she said. Ford and IBM did not immediately respond to requests for comment. IBM's full name is International Business Machines Corp.Germany's Daimler AG and Rheinmetall AG  were dismissed as defendants from the case in December 2013. Dozens of companies were previously dismissed.Apartheid ended in 1994 when South Africa held its first all-race elections, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress to power.The case is In re: South African Apartheid Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-4104.

389,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT, July 28  FRANKFURT, July 28 Business planning software start-up Anaplan is nipping at the heels of industry leaders SAP , Oracle and IBM, with sales of its cloud-based service tripling in each of the past three years as it seeks to shake up the market.Customers are demanding more flexible ways to use business planning software, which crunches corporate data to allow companies to forecast growth and set performance goals.While major players like SAP, Oracle's Hyperion business and IBM's Cognos and Applix units have been forced to offer cloud-based products, their focus has remained on packaged software as it makes up the bulk of their revenue.This has opened the door to nimbler rivals focused solely on cloud-based software in the fast-growing market.""There is a major shift going on and Anaplan is at the forefront,"" Forrester business apps analyst Paul Hamerman said. ""It appears to be the fastest-growing vendor in this space and the one which already has good traction with large companies.""Anaplan is backed by cloud market leaders Salesforce  and Workday, both as investors and by integrating their sales and marketing and human resource products.The company, which was founded in a north England farmhouse in 2006, is considering a stock-market listing in the coming year, although it said its rapid growth in customers and revenue gave it room to be patient. ""We are really going after 'global 2,000' companies,"" Laurent Lefouet, Anaplan's managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa said in an interview. As of January, it had signed up users at 300 companies, two-thirds of them global firms, he added.Lefouet said Anaplan was on track to sign up 150,000 users this year, and should triple that number in 2016, putting it in reach of 1 million users by 2017 or 2018, he said. By contrast, SAP and Oracle count tens of million of cloud software users, although these numbers include a far broader set of products.While Anaplan, now based in San Francisco, could consider an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming year, it is focused on its next milestone of signing up 1 million users, or an average of 1,000 users across 1,000 global accounts, Lefouet said.However, business software analyst Hamerman said it was more likely that small cloud players would be bought up by bigger rivals than go public. HIGH COSTS Traditional, non cloud-based, planning software suffers from high costs and inflexible design, while customers are ""locked in"" by vendors as software switching costs are high, Hamerman said. But customer demands are changing rapidly, he added.Anaplan offers users a cloud-based service that processes billions of spreadsheet cells of corporate data on central computers, then illustrates the results in charts and graphics within a user's web browser. Its closest rivals are U.S.-based Adaptive and Host Analytics. Industry experts say that what separates Anaplan from many of its competitors - both large and small - is the way it twins sophisticated data analysis and modelling with a relatively simple interface that allows its software to be used by managers across corporate departments, without lots of tech support.Hamerman said the business planning market was currently worth around $3 billion in annual sales, spread across 15 to 20 players. But Anaplan said its potential audience was 20 percent of all corporate employees, a far bigger market that it said could be worth upward of $20 billion in the long run.Business planning tools, an outgrowth of accounting systems finance teams use to manage corporate budgets, are now being used by sales and marketing teams to forecast targets, and human resources or operations to set performance goals.Anaplan said it had recently begun to see adoption of such software by thousands of users in big corporate names such as Hewlett-Packard, Intel's McAfee unit, VMware  and consumer groups Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Kimberly-Clark.Anaplan and its peers decline to disclose revenue figures. But a calculation based on the 45,000 customers Anaplan says it has signed up combined with an estimated average annual subscription fee comparable to Salesforce.com's roughly $1,000, suggests revenue is nearing $50 million (45 million euros).The Yorkshire-founded, Silicon Valley-financed and French executive-led firm has raised around $150 million to date, with its latest funding round of $100 million led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson and including Sands Capital, Brookside, Bain Capital, along with Salesforce and Workday.(1 euro = $1.1031)    (Editing by Pravin Char)",2015-07-28,IBM,"Tue Jul 28, 2015 | 10:45am EDT","Anaplan targets SAP, Oracle in fast-growing business planning market",http://www.reuters.com//article/sap-competition-anaplan-idUSL5N1081GM20150728?type=companyNews

399,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, told CNBC on Tuesday that he added to his share stake in International Business Machines Corp in the third quarter. ""We bought it in the first quarter, and normally I wouldn't tell you this, but we bought some in the third quarter,"" Buffett told the cable television network. Buffett's Berkshire owned a more than 8 percent stake in IBM as of June 30. IBM shares, which have slumped nearly 12 percent so far in the third quarter through last Friday during broad stock market volatility, last traded up 1.9 percent at $146.42 in afternoon trading Tuesday. Buffett also said that the U.S. economy was not growing at a ""booming"" rate but remained on the path it has been on for six years of growing at a rate of 2 percent or a little better annually.

403,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Two New York stockbrokers must face civil insider trading charges brought by U.S. securities regulators, a U.S. judge ruled on Friday, despite a landmark appellate ruling that torpedoed the criminal case against them.U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan rejected a bid from former Euro Pacific Capital Inc traders Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant to throw out U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that they engaged in illegal trading ahead of an IBM Corp (IBM.N) deal.However, Rakoff postponed the scheduled Sept. 21 trial with the parties' consent while the U.S. Supreme Court weighs whether to review the appellate ruling, which could affect the SEC case's outcome.Gregory Morvillo, a lawyer for Durant, and Matthew Fishbein, a lawyer for Payton, declined to comment on Rakoff's ruling, as did a spokeswoman for the SEC.The brokers had argued that the case must be dismissed in light of a December decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that curtailed authorities' ability to pursue insider trading cases. In reversing the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, the appeals court held that prosecutors must prove a trader knew that the source of a tip received a benefit in exchange.The 2nd Circuit also narrowed the definition of ""benefit,"" saying it had to be more than mere friendship.The Justice Department has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling; the court has not yet decided. In the current case, authorities said a lawyer representing IBM in 2009 told Trent Martin, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L), that the company planned to acquire SPSS Inc for $1.2 billion.Martin bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, Euro Pacific broker Thomas Conradt, who in turn shared the information with co-workers Durant, Payton and another man named David Weishaus, all of whom traded on the tip.All five men were criminally charged, and all but Durant pleaded guilty. But a federal judge threw out their guilty pleas following the 2nd Circuit's ruling, and prosecutors dropped the case. The SEC, however, pressed forward against Durant and Payton, citing a different legal standard for civil charges.The defendants argued they were too far removed from the original source to meet the 2nd Circuit's standard. But the SEC said they willfully ignored red flags, proving they knew the information was illegally obtained.The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Payton et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 14-4644.

424,"  SAN FRANCISCO The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how the International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) recognized revenue for certain deals in the United States, Britain and Ireland, IBM said on Tuesday, news that sent its shares down 4 percent.IBM, the world's largest technology services company, said it learned of the investigation in August and was cooperating with the SEC, but did not disclose what deals were being probed.An IBM spokesman told Reuters the company had a ""rigorous and disciplined process"" for its reporting of revenue. Shares of IBM fell as much as 4.4 percent to a five-year low of $137.33 and closed down 4 percent.News of the SEC probe came a week after the company posted lackluster quarterly results and cut its 2015 profit forecast.""It couldn't come at a worse possible time because now the stock is at another 52-week low as a result of this,"" said Belpointe analyst David Nelson. He said, however, that the probe ""doesn't look like a massive smoking gun.""""The investigation could be into warranty reserves, they could have recognized an item at the wrong time,"" Nelson said.IBM has been a subject of several SEC probes in the past, including a 2013 investigation on how it reported revenue from its cloud computing business. Regulators ended that probe without recommending any action. (reut.rs/1MqyJ4K) Earlier this month, the SEC called financial reporting ""a key enforcement priority"" as it announced a series of enforcement actions for violations of federal securities laws.Revenue recognition is how a company records revenue on its books, with discrepancies often arising depending on whether cash is received, or payments deferred. Accounting rules differ in the United States and in Britain and Ireland.A May 2014 change in the accounting standard for revenue recognition has increased scrutiny by regulators. Some 60 percent of SEC actions from 1998-2007 focused on improper revenue recognition, according to a 2010 report by COSO, a committee with representatives from private-sector accounting and other professional groups that studies fraudulent financial reporting. Separately, IBM also authorized a $4 billion share buyback on Tuesday, in addition to $2.4 billion remaining from a previous share repurchase program announced last October.Shares of the IBM have dropped steadily in recent months, falling 21 percent since hitting a year high of 173.97 in April.Last week, IBM posted a bigger-than-expected drop in third-quarter revenue and cut its full-year profit forecast as a stronger U.S. dollar accentuated weakness in demand from China and emerging markets.

The deal, which will not include the Weather Channel cable network, would be valued at more than $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday, citing sources. After the deal closes, the Weather Company Chief Executive Officer David Kenny is expected to join IBM, the newspaper said.

433,"  * Says IT upgrade could drag on for years* In talks for alternatives or correcting current system* CFO says too early to discuss possible compensation* Shares drop 3 pct, biggest DAX decliner   (Adds details from CFO, shares)By Victoria Bryan BERLIN, Oct 29 Deutsche Post said revamping IT systems at its logistics unit will drag on for several more years after its plans had to be re-examined, leading the group to warn that earnings would fall short of its previous expectations.Shares in the group, known globally for its DHL delivery brand, fell 3 percent on Thursday morning after it said late the previous day it now expected 2015 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of at least 2.4 billion euros ($2.6 billion).That compares with a previous target of between 2.95 and 3.1 billion. The group is writing down 345 million euros related to the failed IT implementation, but it is too early to talk about asking for compensation from IT suppliers SAP and IBM , Chief Financial Officer Larry Rosen told reporters.SAP had no immediate comment, while IBM did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ""We're still in talks about correcting the system, but we are also in parallel looking at alternatives,"" Rosen said, declining to give a timeframe for any decision on whether to stick with current suppliers or go for another option.Rosen said alternatives included using systems that were already available and successfully in use. He said the problem with the previous upgrade' dubbed NFE, was that because it was an integrated product, if one part didn't work properly this impacted all the rest.He said that because the IT reorganisation would be done on a step-by-step basis, checking one component is successful before introducing the next, the costs were expected to be the same as in the budget for the NFE upgrade.($1 = 0.9148 euros)   (Additional reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Editing by Maria Sheahan and David Holmes)",2015-10-29,IBM,"Thu Oct 29, 2015 | 4:58am EDT",UPDATE 1-Deutsche Post shares drop after IT delays cause earnings shortfall,http://www.reuters.com//article/deutschepost-results-idUSL8N12T23H20151029?type=companyNews
434,"  * Operating profit down 4 pct as insurance weighs* Buffett-backed merger leads to $4.4 bln after-tax gain   (Adds comment, derivative losses, prior record profit)By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer AblanNEW YORK, Nov 6 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  said quarterly profit doubled to a record high, reflecting a large gain on its stake in Kraft Heinz Co, while operating profit declined on weaker results from insurance underwriting.Third-quarter net income rose to $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per Class A share, from $4.62 billion, or $2,811, a year earlier.Operating profit fell 4 percent to $4.55 billion, or $2,769 per share, from $4.72 billion, or $2,876.Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,720.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Among Berkshire's larger businesses, profit fell 34 percent from insurance underwriting to $414 million, rose 12 percent at the BNSF railroad to $1.16 billion, and rose 13 percent to $786 million at Berkshire Hathaway Energy.""Overall, quite decent operating earnings,"" said Jeff Matthews, a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund and author of ""Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett's Omaha."" ""Nothing wrong with that given the weakness in the industrial side of the economy.""Berkshire has close to 90 operating businesses including the General Re reinsurer, Lubrizol chemicals, NetJets business jets and Dairy Queen ice cream. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire since 1965. KRAFT HEINZ Results reflected a roughly $6.8 billion pre-tax gain, or $4.4 billion after taxes, on Kraft Heinz.Buffett helped finance the July merger that created the food company, whose products include Oscar Mayer sandwich meats, Jell-O and Heinz ketchup, and is its largest shareholder with  26.8 percent stake.Berkshire had previously owned a majority of the former H.J. Heinz Co, and at the time of the merger had more than doubled its original investment in just two years.""Even given its large size, Berkshire can still pull off deals and investments that remain meaningful,"" said James Armstrong, who invests $550 million as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh. He said 20 percent of that sum is in Berkshire.Private equity firm 3G Capital owns about 24.2 percent of Kraft Heinz and has day-to-day oversight. It announced plans this week to close seven plants and cut 2,600 jobs there. Berkshire's gain reflects ""the hard work 3G has done cutting costs at Heinz and now Kraft,"" said Matthews, who recently sold his Berkshire stock. ""Warren Buffett, the billionaire, is getting richer on cost cuts while 2,600 families are getting poorer. It's a shame.""Quarterly revenue at Berkshire rose 15 percent to $58.99 billion, largely from Kraft Heinz.Book value, reflecting assets minus liabilities and Buffett's preferred growth gauge, was $151,083 per Class A share as of Sept. 30, up 0.9 percent from the end of June.Berkshire's prior record profit was $6.4 billion in the second quarter of 2014, also helped by a one-time gain.Kraft Heinz helped Berkshire offset recent struggles with large investments such as International Business Machines Corp  and American Express Co and in operating units including the Geico auto insurer, as well as losses from derivatives. Berkshire said it had lost $2 billion on its IBM stock, or 15 percent of what it paid, as of Sept. 30 but still has ""no intention"" of selling its shares.The price of Berkshire's Class A shares is down 10 percent this year, lagging the 2 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500.GEICO Profit from insurance underwriting fell in part because of weakness at General Re and losses on variable annuity guarantee contracts at Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.Geico recovered after a poor quarter, seeing pretax underwriting gains drop just 2 percent to $258 million. Like other insurers, Geico has experienced increased losses from accidents as people drive more, causing it to boost premiums.Berkshire said profit at BNSF was bolstered by ""improved operating performance,"" as the railroad spends $6 billion to add capacity and improve service following shortfalls in 2014.Buffett is working to finish Berkshire's largest purchase, a roughly $31.7 billion takeover of aerospace parts maker Precision Castparts Corp.Berkshire had $66.26 billion of cash as of Sept. 30. Buffett has said he plans to spend about one-third of that on Precision Castparts. He wants to keep a $20 billion cash cushion.In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares fell $1,594 to $203,100, and its Class B shares fell 24 cents to $136.33.

At least 11 brokerages lowered their price target on the stock.IBM forecast 2016 adjusted earnings of ""at least"" $13.50 per share, below the average analyst estimate of $15 per share, and reported a drop in revenue for the fifteenth straight quarter.While a strong dollar reduced IBM's profit by $300 million in the fourth quarter and is expected to lower 2016 pre-tax profit by $1.3 billion, weakness in its software division remains a key concern.Revenue at IBM's software business, which accounts for more than a quarter of the company's revenue, fell about 11 percent to $6.78 billion in the fourth quarter. ""We continue to think that the software segment represents the largest risk to ongoing top- and bottom-line financial performance, and thus also IBM shares,"" BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note to clients.The brokerage cut its price target on the stock to $135 from $155 and reaffirmed its ""market perform"" rating.

""It was like sharks attracted to blood in the water,"" Axelrod said.The trial marks a test for the SEC amid litigation over what constitutes insider trading, an issue the U.S. Supreme Court last month said it would review.The trial came after a December 2014 ruling by a federal appeals court in New York that traders could be held liable only if they knew a tip's source received a benefit of ""some consequence,"" not just friendship, in exchange. That ruling overturned the convictions of two hedge fund managers. It prompted federal prosecutors in the IBM case to drop criminal charges against five defendants, including Payton, 40, and Durant, 39. All but Durant had pleaded guilty.But the SEC, which faces a lower burden of proof, chose to press its civil case against Payton and Durant. Andrew Ceresney, head of the SEC enforcement division, attended the trial's start, signaling the importance of a victory for the regulator. Axelrod said Payton and Durant learned about the SPSS deal from Euro Pacific colleague Thomas Conradt, who heard about it from his roommate, Trent Martin.Martin, a Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst, learned about the news from a friend at IBM's law firm, who expected Martin to not tell anyone, Axelrod said.Scott Morvillo, Durant's lawyer, said what the SEC claimed Martin received for the tip - general chores by Conradt around the apartment including negotiating a rent reduction - did not constitute an illegal ""benefit.""The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.

460,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to  International Business Machines Corporation's (IBM) $5 billion senior notes  offering. IBM will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including  potentially funding a portion of the company's acquisition of The Weather  Company. Fitch's action affects approximately $55 billion of debt, including  IBM's undrawn $10 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). A full list of rating  actions follows at the end of the release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for relatively stable  operating performance, despite the continuation of a challenging operating and  competitive environment. On a constant currency and organic basis, Fitch expects  revenues will decline by the low single digits in the near term, driven by the  ongoing shift to cloud-based, from legacy, information technology (IT).  Near-term currency headwinds should remain significant, exacerbating top-line  pressures.  The ratings and Outlook incorporate Fitch's expectation that IBM's investments  in strategic imperatives (data, cloud and engagement) and achievement of  cloud-based efficiencies will result in double-digit growth and achieve  sufficient scale in these markets to offset long-term secular decline in legacy  IT demand in the medium term. Fitch also expects cash flows will remain  consistent and financial policies conservative through the intermediate term. Fitch expects IBM will sustain higher profit margins following the divestitures  of the less profitable semiconductor foundry and industry standard server (ISS)  businesses in 2014. Fitch estimates operating core operating EBITDA margin  (excludes operating EBITDA related to the financing business) was in the high  20% for 2015, versus a Fitch estimated low- to mid-20% historically.  Fitch expects strong annual free cash flow (FCF) of more than $7.5 billion  through the intermediate term, driven by lower capital spending following the  divestiture of the more capital-intensive foundry business. Fitch expects the  company will use 75%-85% of annual pre-dividend FCF for shareholder returns,  which the agency believes could result in incremental debt, given our estimate  that more than half of pre-dividend FCF is generated outside the U.S. Nonetheless, Fitch expects credit protection measures will remain solid for the  rating. Pro forma for the senior notes issuance, total leverage (total  debt-to-operating EBITDA) exiting 2015 was higher year-over-year at 1.9x, versus  1.8x for 2014. Core leverage (which excludes debt related to the financing  business) increased to 0.8x for 2015, pro forma for the senior notes issuance,  versus 0.6x 2014. The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's: --Highly diversified customer base from both an industry and geographic  perspective.  --Considerable recurring revenue model from IBM's IT services, software and  financing, which in aggregate account for approximately half of total revenue  and reduce revenue and profit volatility. --Strong Market Position: Breadth and quality of product and service offerings,  resulting in leading revenue market share in IT services, middleware software,  servers and number three share of the total disk storage market. --Significant liquidity, supported by a solid cash position, committed credit  facilities and strong FCF. Fitch's concerns include: --Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which, in the  absence of commensurate growth in profitability, could pressure FCF and  financial flexibility, necessitating further increases in core debt to fund  acquisitions or share repurchases. --Significant and consistent research and development (R&D) investments required  to keep pace with innovation, which constrain meaningful profit margin expansion  but also supports barriers to entry in certain markets.  --Expectations for debt-financed acquisitions in new IT to accelerate  transformation.  --Long-term threat to highly profitable mainframe demand and associated  operating system software (z/OS) from increasing penetration of industry  standard servers (ISS). KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Negative low-single-digit organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis  for 2016 but the resumption of positive organic growth over the medium term,  driven by growth in strategic imperatives businesses. --Profit margins will remain stable due to divestitures of less profitable  businesses. Fitch anticipates core operating EBITDA margins in the high 20%  range through the forecast period. --R&D and capital spending levels remain consistent through the forecast period,  pro forma for the divestiture of the highly capital-intensive foundry business. --Annual cash pension contributions will remain in the $500 million to $600  million range. --75%-85% of pre-dividend FCF for shareholder returns, including 10% annual  dividend growth.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded if Fitch expects: --A shift to more aggressive financial policies, including expectations core  leverage will be sustained in excess of 1.25x;  --Continued mid-single-digit organic negative revenue growth (constant currency  basis) or profitability pressures within IBM's traditional recurring core  franchises, signalling a weakening operating profile despite the company's  strategic imperatives growth focus.  Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a higher  rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for acquisitions or  shareholder-friendly activities limits further positive rating actions. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes IBM's liquidity was strong at Dec. 31, 2015 and supported by: --$9.1 billion of cash and equivalents; and --An undrawn $10 billion RCF expiring on Nov. 10, 2019, which fully supports  IBM's commercial paper programs.  Fitch's expectation for more than $7.5 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity.  Pro forma for the senior notes issuance, total debt was $44.9 billion as of Dec.  31, 2015, which includes $6.5 billion of short-term debt. Fitch estimates $27.2  billion (61%) of total debt is attributable to IBM's Global Financing (IGF)  business with the remaining debt attributable to core (non-financing)  operations.  The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients' acquisition of IBM systems,  software and services by providing financial and capital management solutions.  IGF has a solid long-term operating record, and provides strategic advantages to  IBM in terms of attracting and retaining customers by delivering total  solutions. IBM also generates an annuity-like revenue stream associated with  multi-year leases. IGF's primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some risks  associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and clear  insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics have remained  relatively solid as a result of the relatively conservative underwriting culture  and strong risk management capabilities. IGF's capitalization remains solid for  the rating category and leverage levels continue to hover near management's  target of 7x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch rates IBM's senior notes issuance as follows: --$900 million of floating rate notes (FRN) due Aug. 18, 2017; --$1.2 billion of 1.8% senior notes due May 17, 2019; --$900 million of 2.25% senior notes due Feb. 19, 2021; --$1.35 billion of 3.45% senior notes due Feb. 19, 2026; --$650 million of 4.7% senior notes due Feb. 19, 2046. Fitch currently rates IBM as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Senior unsecured RCF 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'.

470,"  SAN FRANCISCO Computing giant IBM (IBM.N) has expanded its partnership with VMWare (VMW.N), one of several initiatives it plans to announce Monday as it works to carve out a bigger role in the fast-growing field of cloud computing.The VMWare agreement will make it easier and faster for companies using VMWare's virtualization products to deploy and run them on IBM's cloud data centers, so those companies can easily connect their own data centers to the cloud. The idea is to make IBM's services more attractive to VMWare's customers.Virtualization allows one server to run many operating systems. It sits at the heart of cloud technology, by which businesses run key computing processes remotely and deliver them over the internet, which is more efficient and often cheaper than on-premises computing.“If you don’t embrace these new technologies, you won’t continue to survive,” said Jim Comfort, IBM’s chief technology officer for cloud, talking about IBM’s customers and cloud-based technologies. “It is transforming all industries.”IBM also plans to make it easy for developers using its tools to create applications in Swift, the programming language developed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O). That will smooth the way for old-school enterprises, which don’t traditionally work with Swift, to create apps for the iPhone and other widely used Apple devices.  To make it simpler for developers to build cloud-based apps, IBM is upgrading or creating other developer-oriented products. WebSphere, its widely used software that helps developers link apps to the internet, will work more easily in cloud-oriented settings. IBM’s Bluemix software-development product will work smoothly with GitHub, a service that allows intensive collaboration on software writing.Last week, Bluemix competitor Pivotal Cloud Foundry announced it would team up with Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) to jointly sell products.  As revenue declines overall at IBM, in part due to customers turning to cheaper technology such as cloud-based services, it has looked for business in new areas, including trying to harness the cloud for its own growth. Acquisitions make up a large part of the strategy. Last week, IBM announced it was buying medical-data company Truven Health for $2.6 billion.  It is unclear if IBM will be able to expand its newer cloud-based and analytics offerings at a strong enough pace to make up for weaknesses in its traditional businesses. For 2015, revenue from its cloud offerings totaled $10.2 billion, out of total overall revenue of $81.74 billion.

472,"   By Joseph Menn and Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO The legal showdown between Apple Inc and U.S. law enforcement over encryption, no matter the outcome, will likely accelerate tech company efforts to engineer safeguards against government intrusion, tech industry executives say.Already, an emerging industry is marketing super-secure phones and mobile applications.An Apple executive said the company will strengthen its encryption if it wins its court battle with the federal government, which last week secured a court order requiring Apple engineers to help extract data from a phone associated with the mass shootings in San Bernardino.The executive spoke on condition of anonymity. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment publicly.If Apple loses the court case, the legal precedent could give the U.S. government broad authority to order companies to assist in breaking into encrypted products.But even a government victory could have unintended consequences for law enforcement, potentially prompting a wave of investment by U.S. tech companies in security systems that even their own engineers can't access, said Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society.""A success for the government in this case may further spur Apple and others to develop devices that the makers aren't privileged to crack,"" he said.The fast-growing online storage provider Box has already made it a priority to give customers sole custody of data, said  Joel De la Garza, chief information security officer at the company. The intent is to make it impossible for the company to access its customers' data - even under a government order, he said.""Our goal is to achieve a `zero-knowledge' state"" for the company, he said, ""where our customers have total control over their data.""It's unclear whether Apple can - or would even want to - make smartphones the company can't access. Two Apple employees familiar with the company's security strategy said the company had no such plans. SMARTPHONE BLACK OUT One immediate beneficiary of the government's case against Apple is the niche industry, based mostly overseas, that has sprung up to design apps and phones to thwart snooping by governments, business rivals and criminals.In the more than two years since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying via U.S. companies, a handful of companies have released secure phones with names such as BlackPhone, RedPhone or Priv that trumpet security as a prime selling point.Phones such as Boeing Co's Black target government customers.

476,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett will release his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders after a year when its stock price lagged the broader market by the most since 2009, adding to years of underperformance.The letter, due Saturday, is a must-read on Wall Street, filled with his thoughts on investing, life and the Omaha, Nebraska company he has run for five decades.For some, navigating the present is of primary concern, as his shares have lagged the S&P 500 for the last several years.""His underperformance is getting conspicuous. He must address it,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Investment Partners in Palm Beach, Florida, and is selling Berkshire shares short.The price of a Berkshire Class A share fell 12.5 percent in 2015, compared with a 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends, Reuters data show. That was the worst underperformance since 2009, and between 2009 and 2015, the S&P gained about 163 percent; Berkshire, just 105 percent. Berkshire looks better when measured by book value, which looks to have gained 7.2 percent in 2015, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields. But since the financial crisis, it, too, has lagged the S&P 500, based on Shields' book value estimate.     Investors will look to see if there is any change in how Buffett views partnerships with investors such as Brazil's 3G Capital, a cost-cutting specialist he teamed with on mergers creating Kraft Heinz Co and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc. Buffett faced questions at 2015's meeting about 3G's tendency to cut jobs aggressively. Berkshire now owns some 90 businesses, employing roughly 360,000 employees, including the Geico auto insurer, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, and soon, Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business.Berkshire also owns dozens of stocks. But there, two big Buffett holdings, American Express Co and International Business Machines Corp have recently been dogs.Bill Smead, who invests $2.1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle, said Berkshire's stock price looks ""incredibly attractive"" at close to 1.2 times book value. Buffett has said Berkshire would buy back stock at that level.    One lingering question: Who will take over in coming years, given Buffett is 85, and second-in-command Charlie Munger is 92.   Analysts expect full-year operating profit of $17.3 billion, including profit of $2,814 per share in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

477,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal jury on Monday found two former New York stockbrokers liable for trading on confidential tips about an IBM Corp acquisition, despite a major appeals court ruling that made insider trading cases harder to pursue.In a victory for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal jury in Manhattan found former Euro Pacific Capital Inc brokers Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant liable for engaging in insider trading.The trial came after a 2014 appellate ruling limiting the scope of insider trading laws forced prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Payton, Durant and three others.The SEC continued to press civil charges over trades the two men placed before IBM announced its $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc in 2009.Payton, 39, and Durant, 40, conceded they traded on non-public information. But they argued that their trades did not constitute illegal insider trading, a position they adopted after the appellate ruling. Scott Morvillo, Durant's lawyer, said he was confident the verdict would be reversed on appeal. Payton's lawyers declined to comment.The trial came amid ongoing litigation over what constitutes insider trading, an issue the U.S. Supreme Court last month said it would review.The trial followed a December 2014 ruling by a federal appeals court in New York holding that traders could be held liable only if they knew a tip's source received a benefit of ""some consequence,"" not just friendship, in exchange. After the ruling, which overturned two hedge fund managers' convictions, a federal judge threw out guilty pleas by Payton and three other men in the IBM case.While prosecutors then dropped the criminal case, the SEC, facing a lower burden of proof, elected to move forward. According to the SEC, in 2009, Michael Dallas, an attorney at IBM's law firm, told his friend Trent Martin that he was working on IBM's acquisition of SPSS.While Dallas expected Martin, a Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst, not to tell anyone, Martin bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, Thomas Conradt, a Euro Pacific employee, the SEC said.Conradt then told four Euro Pacific colleagues, including  Payton and Durant, who made $629,472 and $254,141, respectively, trading in SPSS before the deal's announcement, the SEC said.Payton and Durant countered that Martin received nothing that would constitute an illegal benefit for his information, nor did they know about any benefit if it existed.The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.

478,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday the firm's ownership of IBM (IBM.N) shares could prove a mistake and that he was buying more U.S. stocks overall since the end of last year.""We've owned stocks that we've lost money in,"" said Buffett, the world's third-richest person. ""If I'm wrong, you sell them out and take a big loss. We've done that on a few occasions with stocks and bonds over the years.""Berkshire, which held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of Dec. 31, 2015, said in an annual shareholder letter on Saturday that it planned to keep that stake despite a $2.6-billion paper loss at the end of last year.Buffett told the cable television network he did not think he was wrong for owning IBM shares so far, but said it ""could be"" a mistake. He said he has been wrong before, noting Berkshire's investment in troubled British grocer Tesco PLC (TSCO.L), which he characterized as a ""huge mistake"" in 2014. ""I bought Tesco, it went down, and it kept going down, and I was wrong about the company,"" Buffett said on Monday. Berkshire no longer has a stake in the supermarket chain.Business was a bit ""softer in many places"" than he had anticipated four or five months ago, Buffett said, adding that in general, stocks would advance over time. ""We have bought more stocks since the end of the year,"" he said. He did not know what the consequences of sustained low interest rates globally would be, but they made all assets more valuable, Buffett said. Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said he had been surprised by the election season and ""amazed"" by Republican party developments, stating: ""This takes the cake."" Buffett criticized Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying he has ""a tendency to demonize institutions.""He weighed in on a privacy fight between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the U.S. government, saying privacy should trump security in smaller cases, but security should trump privacy in major cases.""If there is something major, something that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI would be willing to sign and go to a judge on and say, 'we need this information and we need it now,' I would be willing to trust that official,"" he said. Buffett said he was a ""little surprised"" by Berkshire's roughly $396 million investment in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), and that it was the decision of one of Berkshire's top portfolio managers who each run $9 billion, a reference to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Berkshire's Kinder Morgan stake was revealed earlier this month in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for the fourth quarter. Buffett said Berkshire would likely not own Dow Chemical's (DOW.N) common stock, but that he liked the company's preferred shares. He also said he hoped Britain would remain in the European Union and avoid a ""Brexit.""

481,"  HONG KONG Citigroup Inc (C.N) will sell its minority stake in Chinese regional lender China Guangfa Bank (CGB) for about 19.7 billion yuan ($3 billion) to China Life Insurance Company Ltd (601628.SS)(2628.HK), the insurer said on Monday.The deal will help the U.S. lender free up capital to expand other activities in the country, said a source familiar with the sale who declined to be named because some details of the transaction were not public.Citigroup bought the stake in 2006 for about $610 million, implying that it earned more than $2 billion on its investment since then. The transaction is not material to the bank's  earnings and is expected to close in the second half of this year, Citigroup said in a statement.China Life will more than double its stake in CGB from 20 percent after the purchase. Other main shareholders in CGB include State Grid Corp of China and CITIC Trust Co Ltd, each also owning a 20 percent stake.China's biggest insurer said in a securities filing that besides buying Citigroup's stake it is also buying shares in CGB owned by IBM Credit, a unit of International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), lifting its holding in CGB to 43.7 percent. China Life agreed to pay about $554 million for the IBM Credit stake.        The sale comes after two failed attempts for CGB to go public the past years, which would have freed up investors including Citigroup to offload their shares in the stock market.The Chinese bank had mandated banks to arrange a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai in 2011, before giving up on those plans and later trying for a listing in Hong Kong in 2014 as equity markets wobbled.With new Basel III rules making it disadvantageous for banks to hold minority stakes in other lenders, the sale would free up capital for Citigroup to expand other business in China, the source said.

482,"  HONG KONG Citigroup Inc (C.N) will sell its minority stake in Chinese regional lender China Guangfa Bank (CGB) for about 19.7 billion yuan ($3 billion) to China Life Insurance Company Ltd (601628.SS)(2628.HK), the insurer said on Monday.The deal will help the U.S. lender free up capital to expand other activities in the country, said a source familiar with the sale who declined to be named because some details of the transaction were not public.Citigroup bought the stake in 2006 for about $610 million, implying that it earned more than $2 billion on its investment since then. The transaction is not material to the bank's  earnings and is expected to close in the second half of this year, Citigroup said in a statement.China Life will more than double its stake in CGB from 20 percent after the purchase. Other main shareholders in CGB include State Grid Corp of China and CITIC Trust Co Ltd, each also owning a 20 percent stake.China's biggest insurer said in a securities filing that besides buying Citigroup's stake it is also buying shares in CGB owned by IBM Credit, a unit of International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), lifting its holding in CGB to 43.7 percent. China Life agreed to pay about $554 million for the IBM Credit stake.        The sale comes after two failed attempts for CGB to go public the past years, which would have freed up investors including Citigroup to offload their shares in the stock market.The Chinese bank had mandated banks to arrange a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai in 2011, before giving up on those plans and later trying for a listing in Hong Kong in 2014 as equity markets wobbled.With new Basel III rules making it disadvantageous for banks to hold minority stakes in other lenders, the sale would free up capital for Citigroup to expand other business in China, the source said. The bank has an investment banking joint venture with local brokerage Orient Securities Co (600958.SS) and is among the few international firms in China to offer sole branded credit cards.""This transaction is consistent with the simplification of Citi and allows us to focus our resources in China on growing our core franchise further,"" Citigroup's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Francisco Aristeguieta said in a statement.

483,"   By Dustin Volz  IBM Security plans to acquire private cyber security firm Resilient Systems, the computing giant said Monday, as part of a move to expand its role in the incident response market.The sale comes amid a consolidation in the cyber sector and a decline in valuations of public and private cyber firms. Some investors believe the companies were overvalued after a host of headline-grabbing hacks against the U.S. government and major corporations increased interest in the market. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The acquisition is being announced during the RSA security conference in San Francisco and expected to close later this year subject to regulatory review. IBM (IBM.N) said it intends to retain the roughly 100 employees working at Resilient Systems, including Chief Executive Officer John Bruce, a former vice president at Symantec, and Chief Technology Officer Bruce Schneier, a prominent cryptographer, security blogger and author.  “Our intent is all these guys are going to come on board,” said Marc van Zadelhoff, general manager of IBM Security, told Reuters. “You acquire technology, but you really want to acquire people.”Known as Co3 Systems when it was founded in 2010, Resilient Systems has become a leading player in the high-demand field of incident response by helping private and government customers prepare for, detect and mitigate cyber breaches, said Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group. Incident response is “hot in the market,” Oltsik said. “Customers are spending a lot of money on cybersecurity to address their shortcomings.”The acquisition comes against the backdrop of a U.S. cyber security market slogging through a funding slump, forcing some startups to sell themselves or cut spending. IBM also said on Monday it is creating X-Force Incident Response Services, which will leverage Resilient Systems’ technology and talent to help clients identify and respond to cyber threats. The X-Force service will also rely on a new partnership with cyber firm Carbon Black, which IBM said will help its analysts conduct security forensics on compromised endpoint devices and discover where a breach first occurred.

485,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday the firm's ownership of IBM (IBM.N) shares could prove a mistake and that he was buying more U.S. stocks overall since the end of last year.""We've owned stocks that we've lost money in,"" said Buffett, the world's third-richest person. ""If I'm wrong, you sell them out and take a big loss. We've done that on a few occasions with stocks and bonds over the years.""Berkshire, which held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of Dec. 31, 2015, said in an annual shareholder letter on Saturday that it planned to keep that stake despite a $2.6-billion paper loss at the end of last year.Buffett told the cable television network he did not think he was wrong for owning IBM shares so far, but said it ""could be"" a mistake. He said he has been wrong before, noting Berkshire's investment in troubled British grocer Tesco PLC (TSCO.L), which he characterized as a ""huge mistake"" in 2014. ""I bought Tesco, it went down, and it kept going down, and I was wrong about the company,"" Buffett said on Monday. Berkshire no longer has a stake in the supermarket chain.Business was a bit ""softer in many places"" than he had anticipated four or five months ago, Buffett said, adding that in general, stocks would advance over time. ""We have bought more stocks since the end of the year,"" he said. He did not know what the consequences of sustained low interest rates globally would be, but they made all assets more valuable, Buffett said. Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said he had been surprised by the election season and ""amazed"" by Republican party developments, stating: ""This takes the cake."" Buffett criticized Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying he has ""a tendency to demonize institutions.""He weighed in on a privacy fight between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the U.S. government, saying privacy should trump security in smaller cases, but security should trump privacy in major cases.""If there is something major, something that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI would be willing to sign and go to a judge on and say, 'we need this information and we need it now,' I would be willing to trust that official,"" he said. Buffett said he was a ""little surprised"" by Berkshire's roughly $396 million investment in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), and that it was the decision of one of Berkshire's top portfolio managers who each run $9 billion, a reference to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Berkshire's Kinder Morgan stake was revealed earlier this month in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for the fourth quarter. Buffett said Berkshire would likely not own Dow Chemical's (DOW.N) common stock, but that he liked the company's preferred shares. He also said he hoped Britain would remain in the European Union and avoid a ""Brexit.""

489,"   By Michael Flaherty and Liana B. Baker  Elliott Management Corp bought a large stake in Qlik Technologies Inc, saying on Thursday that shares are cheap and the data analytics company is ripe for being taken over by a larger technology peer.Elliott, a $27 billion hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, said in a securities filing that it owned 8.8 percent of the U.S. company, a position Elliott paid around $200 million to purchase.Elliott said Qlik shares are significantly undervalued and that there are ""strategic and operational opportunities"" for the company that would boost its stock.""We believe Elliott could push for a sale of the company to one of the stack vendors, such as IBM or Oracle Corp.,"" investment bank William Blair said in a research note, referring to firms that make hardware and software components needed for applications to run. William Blair, which rates the company an ""outperform"" said Qlik could fetch a 40 percent plus premium from a buyer. Elliott's broad range of investments across the tech industry are overseen by Jesse Cohn, 35, who led previous investments in companies such as Compuware Corp, Riverbed Technology Inc. and Blue Coat Systems Inc, to name a few. All three were ultimately purchased by private equity firms.With market volatility taking a heavy toll on the private equity financing market, Elliott's thesis for its Qlik investment shows how the hedge fund will lean more on strategic buyers for an exit opportunity rather than a leveraged buyout. Elliott started buying Qlik shares earlier this year, paying an average of $23.50 per share, for a total of 8.3 million shares, according to its filing. Qlik, which began as a Sweden-based company and is now headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania, saw its shares jump 7 percent on Wednesday to $25.88 on the Nasdaq. Its stock is down more than 40 percent since mid-August. ""This situation is as classic as an Elliott activist situation gets - small to mid-cap technology company that has strategic opportunities,"" Ken Squire, of 13D Monitor, said in a note. Squire, who runs an activist mutual fund and also monitors activist investor filings, said that Elliott could also offer to buy Qlik itself. Elliott is now Qlik's largest shareholder.(1.usa.gov/1Y5oaWG)Qlik declined to comment.

492,"   By Steve Stecklow | LONDON  LONDON The U.S. Commerce Department is set to place export restrictions on Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged violations of U.S. export controls on Iran, according to documents seen by Reuters.The restrictions will make it difficult for the company to acquire U.S. products by requiring ZTE's suppliers to apply for an export license before shipping any American-made equipment or parts to ZTE. According to a Commerce Department notice that will be published next week in the U.S. Federal Register, the license applications generally will be denied.The restrictions will take effect Tuesday, Reuters has learned, and apply to any company worldwide that wants to ship American-made products to ZTE Corp in China. Those companies are not the target of the export curbs on ZTE.""This is a significant new burden on trade with ZTE,"" a senior official at the Commerce Department told Reuters. The official declined to comment on whether the U.S. government might take further action against ZTE.The company can appeal against the action.ZTE, based in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, said in a statement on Sunday that it was aware of media reports on U.S. export restrictions. ""ZTE is highly concerned about recent media reports relating to a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation,"" the company said. ""ZTE has been working with associated U.S. government departments on investigations since 2012 and maintains constant communication with associated departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns.""Trade in shares in ZTE, which also sells consumer electronic devices such as smartphones in the United States, was suspended on Monday in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The company did not offer an explanation. ""We believe the restrictions, if implemented, will cause significant supply problems to ZTE,"" Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng wrote in a note, adding that ZTE has major trading relationships with several U.S. companies including Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N). Telecoms equipment and terminal businesses combined account for 80 percent of ZTE's total revenue of 2015, Meng said. The company's revenue for last year was expected to rise 23.8 percent to a record high of 100.8 billion yuan ($15.47 billion), preliminary results showed.ALLEGED VIOLATIONS The Commerce Department investigated ZTE for alleged export-control violations following reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America's best-known technology companies to Iran's largest telecoms carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI), and a unit of the consortium that controls it.The U.S. companies, which included Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), IBM (IBM.N), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Dell Inc [DI.UL], have all said they were not aware of the Iranian contracts. It is not clear if any of the companies still do business with ZTE.Washington has long banned the sale of United States-made technology products to Iran. The Commerce Department's investigation focused on whether ZTE had acquired American products through front companies and then shipped them to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Commerce Department investigators obtained internal ZTE documents - some of which had been marked by the company as ""Top Secret"" - outlining an alleged sanctions-busting scheme. Reuters reviewed some of the documents. The senior Commerce Department official declined to comment on whether ZTE had implemented that scheme. The ZTE statement did not provide comment relating to the documents.   The day after the first Reuters article was published in March 2012, a ZTE spokesman said the company would ""curtail"" its business in Iran. The company later issued a statement saying: ""ZTE no longer seeks new customers in Iran and limits business activities with existing customers."" BUSINESS IMPACT What effect the new export restrictions will have on ZTE's global business is not clear. One undated internal ZTE document obtained by Commerce Department investigators and reviewed by Reuters states: ""Our company has many technologies and components that came from suppliers in the U.S ... Lots of chips or software used in the products of our company are from U.S. suppliers.""One of ZTE's websites also states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft, Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are ""key strategic partners of ZTE"". The terms of the partnerships are not described.A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if the Chinese company purchases other products, such as software. The other U.S. companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment.The undated internal ZTE document also describes a proposal overseen by the company's legal department that describes ways to export American products subject to U.S. sanctions by using shell companies to avoid getting caught.""The biggest advantage"" of one method is that it will make it ""harder for the U.S. government to trace it or investigate the real flow of the controlled commodities"", the document states.In its planned action against ZTE, the Commerce Department cites the proposal, stating that the company ""planned and organized a scheme to establish, control and use a series of 'detached' companies to illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws"". It is not clear if the alleged scheme was implemented.'TOP SECRET'  Another internal ZTE document from August 2011 that discusses ""U.S. export control risks"" facing the company allegedly was signed by several top ZTE officials, including Shi Lirong, its president.The document, marked by the company ""Top Secret"" and ""No spreading abroad without permission of ZTE"", begins ""Dear company leaders"".It states that ZTE ""has ongoing projects in all five major embargoed countries - Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba"", adding that ""all of these projects depend on U.S.-procured items to some extent, so export control obstacles have arisen"".The document goes on to cite ""other risks"" to ZTE, including its operations in the United States. ""R&D employees at the U.S. Research Centers often travel between China and the U.S., carrying R&D data,"" it states, in an apparent reference to research and development. ""This already severely violates the law.""  The document does not specify what law may have been violated.The company ""needs to take preventative measures immediately, otherwise will face the risk of being investigated anytime"", the document states.The document also states that ZTE's Iran project ""can potentially put us at risk of being put on the Blacklist by the U.S.,"" and that such an eventuality could leave the company facing ""the risk of losing the supply chain of U.S. products"".ZTE Corp is one of the world's largest telecoms equipment makers with operations in 160 countries, according to its website. It also is a major manufacturer of mobile handsets. Founded in 1985, its shares trade on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets.Besides ZTE, the export curbs will apply to two of its Chinese affiliates, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd and Beijing 8-Star, and an Iranian company, ZTE Parsian.(This story has been refiled to add dropped word ""for"" in 21st paragraph) (Additional reporting by Yimou Lee in HONG KONG; Editing by Tiffany Wu, Anne Marie Roantree and Alex Richardson)",2016-03-07,IBM,"Mon Mar 7, 2016 | 8:42am EST",U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-zte-usa-china-idUSKCN0W80AV?type=companyNews

498,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. companies took to social media on Wednesday to denounce new laws enacted by southern states that target the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Companies like International Business Machines Corp and Herbalife International Inc used Twitter to criticize a North Carolina measure targeting transgender bathrooms and a Mississippi 'religious freedom' law allowing people to deny wedding services to gay couples.The tweets illustrate how diversity-minded corporations are using their clout as major employers in Republican-controlled states to wield influence against measures they consider LGBT discrimination. Social media provides a way to communicate their views to the masses. Herbalife tweeted, ""We are proud to join @equalitync, @HRC and a chorus of business voices opposed to #HB2,"" referring to     the North Carolina law that requires people to use bathrooms or locker rooms in schools and other public facilities that match the gender on their birth certificate, rather than their gender identity. ""Discrimination of any type should not be tolerated."" Several technology executives also criticized a Mississippi bill allowing people with religious objections to deny wedding services to same-sex couples after Governor Phil Bryant signed it into law on Tuesday.IBMPolicy (‏@IBMpolicy), the Twitter account for government affairs at IBM, tweeted, ""Disappointing that Mississippi Gov @PhilBryantMS signed H.B. 1523. IBM strongly opposes this discriminatory bill.""Brad Smith (‏@BradSmi), president and chief legal officer at Microsoft Corp, said, ""Very disappointing to see the news from Mississippi. These laws are bad for people, bad for business, and bad for job growth. #HB1523"" The tweets follow PayPal Holdings Inc's move on Tuesday to cancel plans to open a global operations center employing 400 workers in Charlotte, North Carolina.At least one other company said it would also reconsider expanding in North Carolina. Ric Elias, chief executive of Red Ventures, a sales and marketing company, posted a letter on Twitter that said he was reconsidering adding jobs in a state that tolerates discrimination.  Similar disputes have broken out between business interests and social conservatives in other Republican-controlled states since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in 2015.In Georgia, companies have won the outcome they were seeking. In late March, after top executives at companies ranging from Salesforce.com Inc to Unilever PLC protested a bill allowing faith-based organizations to deny services to LGBT people, the governor there said he would veto it.Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman tweeted on March 20, ""Inclusive society critical to business. Many will reconsider investment if @governerdeal passes #hb757.""

509,"  NEW YORK IBM on Friday announced new services to help companies  design and develop blockchain technology in a secure environment in the cloud, a network of computers where users are  increasingly storing their data and computing work.The blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a digital tool for doing a slew of functions such as recording and verifying transactions. The technology, according to its many supporters, would make it easier to create cost-efficient business networks without requiring central control.The interest in the blockchain surged last year when Wall Street's major players such as Goldman Sachs delved into the technology and saw it as a way to solve inefficiencies in financial markets.""Clients tell us that one of the inhibitors of the adoption of blockchain is concerns about security,"" said Jerry Cuomo, vice president, Blockchain at IBM in a statement.  ""While there is a sense of urgency to pioneer blockchain for business, most organizations need help to define the ideal cloud environment that enables blockchain networks to run securely in the cloud.""IBM said it is addressing security issues in several ways, including cloud services with the highest Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 140-2) and Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) in the industry to support the use of blockchain in government, financial services and healthcare.  The technology company also announced the opening of an IBM Garage in New York and London. These garages are similar to research labs on the blockchain created by several major financial institutions over the past year. IBM's garages are dedicated to helping clients design and develop their blockchain networks, said Cuomo. Garages in Tokyo, London and Singapore will also open in the coming weeks to enable clients to collaborate with IBM experts on the design and implementation of blockchain for business.

510,"  NEW YORK Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday he would be more likely to buy than sell IBM shares over the next two years, and that he did not seek to profit from global central bank actions. Buffett, who presided over Berkshire's 51st annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska over the weekend, told cable television network CNBC: ""We would be much more likely to buy more in the next 12 or 24 months than we would be to sell shares, but we will make that call as time goes along.""Buffett, whose Berkshire held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of the end of last year and who has caught some flak for his stake, said his cost basis in IBM was around $170 a share and that he had still never sold a share. IBM shares fell 0.4 percent to $145.34 late Monday afternoon. Buffett also said he did not seek to profit from global central bank monetary policies, but that low and negative interest rates could produce an unanticipated reaction. ""It's a fascinating movie to watch. I don't try to make money off the movie,"" Buffett said. ""If currency in a bank is worth less than currency in your hands or in a mattress, that could produce something in the way of behavior that nobody has ever anticipated."" Buffett, whose Berkshire is an American Express shareholder, said the company's loss of its contract with retailer Costco Wholesale Corp was ""significant"" but he agreed with American Express Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault's decision to split from Costco. He said American Express would remain ""under attack"" from alternative payment methods, but he was confident in his stake. ""Costco was a very, very, very valuable co brand to have for American Express, but that value wasn’t limitless,"" he said.  Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told CNBC, however, that he would have made the opposite decision with regard to American Express's contract with Costco. Buffett also criticized companies that repurchase their own shares at too high a price: ""They have in mind a limit as to what they pay for any business they buy except their own, and it has become fashionable to repurchase shares.""Buffett, who has ordered that most of the money he is not giving away at his death should be placed in an index fund, also said active investing as a whole was ""certain"" to produce worse-than-average results.  Buffett and Munger added to previous criticisms they have made of embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's drug-price hikes. Buffett said there ""really wasn't any defense"" for Valeant's price hikes, while Munger said Valeant was ""leading the pack"" of certain industry players who were raising prices dramatically.""I don't think you'd want your son to grow up and run a company in the manner that Valeant was run,"" Buffett said. Munger said he suspected it was ""massively stupid"" for the U.S. government to rely heavily on printing money and lightly on fiscal stimulus for infrastructure, and that the United States would have been better off with more fiscal stimulus.

520,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) revealed a more than $1 billion stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a rare foray into the technology sector, which Buffett has largely shunned apart from a poorly performing investment in IBM (IBM.N). Shares of Apple rose 3.7 percent on the news, closing up $3.36 at $93.88. Berkshire made its investment in the first quarter, before the iPhone maker in April reported its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years.The investment was announced amid an increasing view among investors that Apple may deserve a lower valuation because its heady growth days may be over. However, Apple has a strong balance sheet and management, attributes long favored by Berkshire.""It makes sense because it's a consumer company disguised as a technology company with a great business model, strong cash flow and a cheap valuation,"" said Jeff Matthews, author of books about Buffett and a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund. ""It's not a leap of faith.""In a regulatory filing detailing most of its stock holdings, Berkshire said it held 9.81 million Apple shares worth $1.07 billion as of March 31.The value of the stake has since fallen to about $921 million, even with Monday's gain. Berkshire's largest technology bet has been Buffett's roughly $12.1 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp, an investment now more than $1.6 billion in the red.  Apple stock ""is stunningly cheap, and it has a massive pile of cash,"" said Steve Wallman, founder of Wallman Investment Counsel in Middleton, Wisconsin, who has owned shares of Berkshire since 1982 and Apple since 2003. ""Apple is not getting credit for research and development it is doing behind the scenes.""An Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.MIXED VIEWS OF HEDGE FUNDS  The Apple investment was made by one of Buffett's two stockpicking deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his assistant said in an email to The Wall Street Journal. Combs and Weschler, who ran hedge funds before joining Berkshire, each invest about $9 billion and usually make smaller wagers, while Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, makes bigger investments such as IBM.Investors said Combs may have been the Apple buyer. He  invested in chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) for Berkshire in 2011.Buffett's assistant did not respond to a request for comment.In April, Apple said revenue for the quarter ended March 26 declined as an increasingly saturated smartphone market hurt iPhone sales, which fell for the first time. Chief Executive Tim Cook is looking to develop other technologies for the Cupertino, California-based company, and last week unveiled a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing.Apple's market value last week dipped below that of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), even though Apple generates roughly triple the revenue and profit. Before Monday, shares of Apple were down by a third from their April 2015 peak. Synovus Trust Company portfolio manager Daniel Morgan, noting that Buffett is known as a value buyer, said; ""That kind of puts the icing on the cake that Apple now is probably considered more of a mature technology company, like we would think of Microsoft, Intel or Cisco.""I don’t think we can put them in the same bracket right now as Google, Amazon (AMZN.O) or Netflix (NFLX.O),” said Morgan said, who owns Apple because of its low price-earnings ratio and high dividend yield.""It's a value stock that has the potential for a big growth,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York who also holds Apple stock.Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is also a fan, and his firm Greenlight Capital on Monday said it boosted its Apple stake by 31 percent in the first quarter.Other prominent investors have retrenched.Last month, billionaire Carl Icahn said he sold his Apple stake on concern about the company's relationship with China. David Tepper's Appaloosa LP sold its stake in the first quarter, while Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates and Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management slashed their stakes. Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors also shed its Apple stake, a person familiar with the matter said.BUFFETT ON YAHOO Despite his traditional aversion to technology sector, Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he offered to help Dan Gilbert, the chairman of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, finance a bid for internet company Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).Reuters first reported Buffett's involvement on Friday. While Buffett told CNBC he would not be an equity partner, he could collect dividends or interest on the financing, and perhaps take an equity stake later.""Buffett has always restricted himself from investing in things he doesn't know or understand, and staying within his circle of confidence,"" said Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook & Bynum Capital Management LLC in Birmingham, Alabama, which invests 8 percent of the $350 million it manages in Berkshire.The Apple investment may have been made with proceeds from the sale of AT&T Inc (T.N) stock, as Berkshire exited what had been a $1.6 billion stake.In Monday's filing, Berkshire also reported higher stakes in IBM, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Visa Inc (V.N), and lower stakes in MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

534,"   By Himank Sharma | MUMBAI  MUMBAI India's ambitious plan to be a major player in semiconductors, taking on the Chinese and churning out locally-made chips for a new generation of smartphone users, has proved to be a little too ambitious.The government boldly announced three years ago it would host two new $5 billion chip plants as part of a project to become a global manufacturing powerhouse, creating thousands of jobs, reducing its need for imports and taking on global rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and GlobalFoundries.But potential investors have not materialized, put off by India's wobbly infrastructure, unstable power supply, bureaucratic red tape and poor planning, according to analysts and industry insiders.Just weeks after Jaypee Infratech, which was partnering IBM Corp and Israel's Tower Jazz, abandoned plans for one of the big chip plants, STMicroelectronics NV is set to scrap plans to build the other $5 billion plant as its main local partner failed to raise enough money from skeptical investors, government officials said.""We've had a lot of issues with the original (semiconductor) plan,"" a top official at India's Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITY) told Reuters. ""The technology curve has moved ahead in the last three years, the global environment has changed and China has emerged as a big player.""Two other officials at the department said a consortium led by Indian start-up Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (HSMC) with STMicro and Malaysia's Silterra had not been able to raise the funding for the plant, and it might be scrapped.Investors doubted the potential of the Indian government's plan to set up a 22 nanometer (nm) chip fabricator as the industry's cutting-edge manufacturing has already shifted to smaller 14 nm chips, and is expected to move to sub-10 nm in the next three years, the officials said. ""Our original estimates for chip demand were incorrect, and we decided to postpone our plant until 2020 since there's no market for semiconductors in India yet,"" HSMC founder Deven Verma told Reuters.Verma said the consortium had not yet closed financing for the plant, but had commitments for only 40 percent of the required funding. Operations had been expected to start this year.STMicro declined to comment. LOWERING AMBITIONS  India is now toning down its ambitions and setting its sights on low-end chip making, the government officials said.DEITY plans to attract low-tech component companies including makers of printed circuit boards (PCBs), integrated circuits and analog chips. ""If we target manufacturers of electronic components to look at India for their global production, we can start by manufacturing components such as PCBs and ICs locally, and that will give a much-needed boost to manufacturing in India,"" said one of the two top government officials.To that end, the government has courted foreign manufacturers including Apple Inc to set up plants in India, though analysts say the country needs first to bulk up its component making capabilities.""It's crazy if India thinks it can compete with China on something like chip manufacturing when our electronics industry is a shambles,"" said Ganesh Ramamoorthy, an analyst at research firm Gartner.India's ambitions in electronics manufacturing include cutting net imports to zero by 2020, from about $40 billion last year. It is the world's fastest growing smartphone market with over 100 million sold last year - but almost all of those phones' chips and circuits are imported.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attracted some phone makers, including Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, to set up assembly plants in India. Samsung Electronics also manufactures some smartphones locally.

537,"   By Brad Haynes and Ana Mano | SAO PAULO  SAO PAULO Brazil's biggest bankruptcy filing ever is sending shockwaves far beyond the recession-hit country's borders as operator Oi SA seeks creditor protection from global telecoms suppliers and export banks around the world. Oi is seeking protection on over 500 million reais ($150 million) of accounts payable to international providers from Nokia Corp and Ericsson to IBM Corp and Alcatel-Lucent SA, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters.The biggest Brazilian fixed-line carrier also owes about $1 billion to foreign development banks in China, Finland, Canada and Germany, which encouraged exports to Brazil during a recent surge in spending on wireless and broadband networks.That cycle came crashing to a close this week with Oi's record bankruptcy filing in a Rio de Janeiro court, punctuating the broader slump in a sector curtailing investments to protect profits amid Brazil's worst economic recession since the 1930s.While those debts to suppliers are dwarfed by more than 17 billion reais in bank loans and some 34 billion reais in bonds, they may create headaches for equipment and service providers already struggling with slumping investments in the country.    ""The focus is on keeping the company working. That's what everybody wants,"" said a source close to the company. ""Obviously you don't want to affect suppliers, but that has to be discussed in court."" Oi has refrained from making public comments while the judge in Rio evaluates its petition.    The company was expected to be the only telecom group in Brazil to raise capital spending this year, Credit Suisse Securities analysts said last month in a note that forecast an end to the industry's recent investment cycle driven by fourth-generation mobile technology.Although it did not announce an investment target for the year, Oi invested around 1.2 billion reais in the first three months of the year, about a quarter of the 4.5 billion reais that Credit Suisse analysts forecast for the full year. The question facing Oi now is how to pay for already acquired equipment as it seeks an in-court reorganization of 65.4 billion reais in bonds, bank debt and operating liabilities.Oi has made no changes to its capital spending plans and is doing everything it can to keep operations running normally, said the source, who asked not to be named given the legal proceedings under way.Brazil's bankruptcy protection law allows Oi to stay current on its bills going forward, but freezes all payments on services rendered before the Monday filing while creditors negotiate how to settle the debts. Its biggest outstanding debt to a foreign supplier appears to be 129 million reais due to Brazilian subsidiaries of Finland's Nokia, which in 2013 bought out partner Siemens AG in their network equipment venture. Nokia's receivables are more than twice the 53 million reais due to Chinese runner-up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Asked about possible Oi-related provisions, Nokia, IBM, Alcatel and Ericsson declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to questions.

546,"   By Anya George Tharakan  IBM Corp (IBM.N) has given itself a tall order - a full-year profit target many analysts think it will have trouble meeting.Big Blue has made solid progress as it shifts into high-growth areas such as cloud-based services, and both profit and revenue beat analysts' expectations in the second quarter.But the company may have over-promised by sticking to its full-year adjusted earnings forecast of at least $13.50 per share, analysts said, especially after it indicated that profit in the current quarter would come in below estimates.In order to meet the target, IBM would need to turn in its best sequential improvement in profit in nine years in the fourth quarter, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.""Possibly achievable? Yes, but unlikely, at least statistically,"" Sacconaghi said.IBM, which reported a profit of $14.92 per share from continuing operations last year, has missed its full-year target for the last two years. The company's shares were down slightly at $159.53 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, having risen about 16 percent since the start of the year.Sacconaghi raised his price target to $140, from $135 in April, mainly to reflect the rise in the S&P 500 over the past three months.On a post-earnings conference call with analysts on Monday, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter indicated IBM would report a third-quarter profit of $3.11 to $3.24 per share. That means IBM will need to report a profit of between $4.96 and $5.09 per share in the fourth quarter to hit its target.Analysts on average expect earnings of $3.22 per share for the third quarter and $4.96 in the fourth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would mean IBM would earn $13.48 per share for year, two cents shy of its target.Investors and analysts have raised doubts about IBM's ability to increase revenue growth in its newer cloud-based and analytics businesses at a pace fast enough to make up for falling revenue in its traditional hardware businesses. Still, at least eight brokerages raised their price targets on IBM's stock after the company reported its smallest revenue decline in eight quarters.Citigroup raised the most, to $160 from $140, saying there were ""marginally more positives than negatives vs. prior quarter earnings, which were typically disappointing.""The median price target on the stock is $160 - around where it was trading on Tuesday.Of the 25 brokerages covering IBM, seven rate it a ""buy"" or higher, 13 ""hold"" and five ""sell"" or lower.

553,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch and Noel Randewich | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Technology heavyweights might be all that keeps the U.S. earnings recession from extending into a fifth quarter in September if they hit the higher estimates Wall Street is calling for. A bright spot in generally dour second-quarter results reported so far, technology is the only sector showing improved third-quarter analyst expectations, mostly because of strong scorecards recently from Facebook Inc (FB.O), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and others.Analysts' third-quarter expectations for all other sectors have been deteriorating since last year on worries about slower global growth and the strength of the U.S. dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, though profit growth still is expected in consumer discretionary, materials and other sectors.Earnings across the S&P 500 are now seen growing just 0.2 percent in the third quarter over the same quarter a year ago, down from an estimate of 2 percent growth a month ago.Technology profits, which this year have been the biggest contributor to S&P 500 earnings after financials, are now seen growing 3.1 percent in the third quarter, up from the 2.4 percent growth predicted a month ago.  Without the contribution of leaders like Alphabet and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for example, the entire index might show another quarter of slowing profit growth.Investors have been predicting that S&P 500 aggregate earnings would start to grow again in the third quarter of this year after starting to shrink in the third quarter of 2015. The second quarter, mostly over, is on track to show a 2.4 percent decline. Wall Street has been banking on fatter corporate profits to justify pricey valuations following a recent rally that has propelled the S&P 500 to record highs. Part of the reason for strength in the tech sector may be related to the weight of just a few larger players. In 2015, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft, Alphabet, IBM (IBM.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) pulled in combined earnings of $125 billion, equivalent to over half of all profits in the sector, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis.""They have just become such powerful, dominant market players that they don't face quite the pressures of other companies,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""In the case of Facebook and Google, they continue to just steal share, advertising share, from traditional sources. So they are truly shifting the pie towards them,"" he said. All those companies beat Wall Street's earnings expectations for the June quarter, except for Cisco, which is expected to report its quarterly results on Aug. 17. Its earnings per share beat expectations in at least the past eight quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.Tech's improving outlook has been noted on Wall Street, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen 12 percent since its June 27 post-Brexit referendum low.""Tech looks attractive,"" said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. ""Technology offers better values, especially when you factor in growth estimates.""

The lawsuits stemmed from IBM's Oct. 20, 2014 announcement that it would pay GlobalFoundries Inc $1.5 billion to take over  a money-losing unit that designed and produced microchips.

But Pauley said the lawsuit ""fails to raise a strong inference"" that the need to write-down the unit was so apparent to IBM before the October 2014 announcement that failure to take an earlier write-down constituted fraud.The judge similarly granted IBM's motion to dismiss a lawsuit by plaintiffs Larry Jander and Richard Waksman on behalf of participants in IBM's 401(k) Plus Plan, though he said the could seek to file an amended complaint. Sam Bonderoff, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said while he was disappointed by the ruling, ""we are gratified that it did so without prejudice, giving us leave to file an amended complaint, which we intend to do.""The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers Local #6 Pension Fund v.

570,"   By Jemima Kelly | LONDON  LONDON Banks and other financial institutions are adopting blockchain technology ""dramatically faster"" than initially expected, with 15 percent of top global banks intending to roll out full-scale, commercial blockchain products in 2017, IBM said on Wednesday. The technology company said 65 percent of banks expected to have blockchain projects in production in three years' time, with larger banks - those with more than 100,000 employees - leading the charge.  IBM, whose findings were based on a survey of 200 banks, said the areas most commonly identified by lenders as ripe for blockchain-based innovation were clearing and settlement, wholesale payments, equity and debt issuance and reference data.Blockchain, which originates from digital currency bitcoin, works as an electronic transaction-processing and record-keeping system that allows all parties to track information through a secure network, with no need for third-party verification.  But while almost every major bank has said it is looking into the technology, widespread financial adoption has been thought to be at least 5 to 10 years away. Consultancy Oliver Wyman said in a report in February it would take at least a decade for blockchain to overhaul core parts of the financial industry.  ""The industry is hurtling toward blockchain adoption far faster than many expected,"" IBM said in its report. ""2017 looks to be the year banking on blockchains shifts from zero to sixty."" The company also conducted a separate survey of 200 other global financial markets institutions, 14 percent of which intended to implement commercial blockchain products in 2017.  ""First movers are setting business standards and creating new models that will be used by future adopters of blockchain technology,"" said IBM Banking and Financial Markets general manager Likhit Wagle. ""These early adopters are better able to anticipate disruption, fighting off new competitors along the way."" Microsoft and Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Tuesday they had teamed up on a new project using blockchain in trade finance, aiming to create a framework that could eventually be sold to other businesses.

The consulting firm also launched EnterpriseNext, a program aimed at helping clients make better use of Apple products and services.Apple has announced a steady stream of enterprise partnerships in recent years as it aims to draw more revenue from a market that some say it has traditionally overlooked. A partnership struck with IBM in 2014 signaled Apple's intentions of getting more serious about corporate clients, or enterprise, and deals with Cisco and SAP have followed.The deal with Deloitte will ensure that Apple is top of mind as companies think strategically about their practices, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview.  ""What's needed now is more of a focus on transforming the enterprise and helping businesses identify which areas have the highest either return on investment or highest impact on customer satisfaction,"" Cook said. ""Deloitte is well positioned for this.""As part of the EnterpriseNext program, customers can meet with designers and engineers who specialize in Apple's operating system. ""The intent there is to, in one location, bring the best engineers, the best products and the best thinkers to try and address clients' problems,"" Punit Renjen, CEO of Deloitte Global, said in an interview. Apple faces mounting pressure to find new streams of revenue after sales of the iPhone, which drives more than half of its revenue, declined for the first time this year. The tech giant appears to have concluded that the quickest way to progress in enterprise is to partner with companies rooted in the space, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Cook said in 2015 that Apple's enterprise business had reached $25 billion in annual revenue. He declined to provide a new figure on Wednesday but stressed the company is gaining ground. ""The momentum is significant, and we see this as a very important growth vector,"" he said.

600,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has bought shares in the four biggest U.S. airlines: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc.The investments mark an unexpected reversal for Berkshire, which has avoided the airline sector for nearly two decades after a troubled investment in the former US Air Group, a forerunner to American.They also expand Berkshire's bet on the U.S. economy, and in particular transportation. Berkshire already owns the BNSF railroad and the NetJets luxury plane unit, and in January paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts.According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire as of Sept. 30 owned 21.8 million American shares worth $797 million, 6.3 million Delta shares worth $249.3 million, and 4.5 million United shares worth $237.8 million.Buffett told CNBC television that Berkshire later invested in Southwest, and was disclosing that stake to avoid misleading investors into believing he was avoiding the carrier.It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in the airlines.Shares often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur.Buffett usually handles larger Berkshire investments such as Kraft Heinz Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp.His Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as BNSF, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.The airline investments are ""really important for investor confidence"" in that sector, said Adam Hackel, an airline analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York. Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment.In after-hours trading, American shares rose 3.8 percent, Delta 3.4 percent, Southwest 3.3 percent and United 2.2 percent.U.S. airlines have benefited in recent years from lower fuel costs, labor peace, higher fees from checked bags and other once-free services, and reduced competition through mergers.Such factors helped the four largest U.S. carriers post a record $21.7 billion combined profit in 2015, and command more than two-thirds of the domestic market. WRIGHT BROTHERS, WRONG INVESTMENT Berkshire had ventured into airlines in 1989 when Buffett bought $358 million of USAir preferred stock, but he quickly regretted that investment.In 1997, he told Berkshire shareholders he had misjudged how USAir would ""increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely-competitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the days when regulation protected profits.""Eleven years later, Buffett felt no better, calling airlines a capital-intensive business that earned little or no money.""A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers,"" he wrote in his February 2008 shareholder letter. ""Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down."" Buffett nonetheless admitted to having sold the USAir stock, in 1998, at a ""hefty gain.""Orville Wright died in 1948, more than 44 years after he and his brother Wilbur flew their plane at Kitty Hawk, N.C.American and Delta said they welcomed Berkshire as an investor, and American said it ""reinforces our view that our industry has fundamentally changed in a profound and lasting way.""Southwest declined to comment. United had no immediate comment.Berkshire on Monday also disclosed other portfolio changes.It slashed its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc by roughly two-thirds to 13 million shares. Berkshire had begun paring its stake in the world's largest retailer earlier this year, after more than a decade of ownership.Separately, Berkshire reduced its stake in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc, and exited an investment in Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc.

602,"   By Allison Lampert | MONTREAL  MONTREAL Investors Group and GWL Realty Advisors are set to buy two Montreal office buildings from Germany's KanAm Grund Group for around C$415 million ($308.99 million), though the transaction has not been finalized, two sources familiar with the deal said.Investors Group is part of IGM Financial Inc (IGM.TO) while GWL is part of Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO.TO) Power Financial Corp (PWF.TO) is the controlling shareholder of both companies. Power Corp of Canada (POW.TO) in turn controls Power Financial.The buildings are expected to be sold at a low capitalization rate for the Montreal market, indicating that demand for high-quality office buildings is spilling over from Toronto and Vancouver.The potential sale of the office towers was reported on Friday by Reuters.Power Corp spokesman Stephane Lemay referred a reporter's query directly to Winnipeg-based Investors Group which declined to comment. GWL Realty in Toronto and KanAm could not immediately be reached for comment.The deal should close before year's end, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because terms of the transaction have not been made public. The downtown buildings are expected to be sold at a capitalization rate of just over 5 percent, which is indicative of a premium asset, said the sources.Capitalization rates are calculated by dividing an asset's net operating income by its market price.According to recent data from Colliers International, Montreal cap rates for Class A buildings range from 5.50 percent to 6.25 percent. ""It (a 5 cap) is unusual for the city,"" said a third source familiar with both the deal and the Montreal commercial real estate market, who declined to comment because the transaction is not yet public.According to data from CBRE Ltd, Montreal's third quarter downtown vacancy rate was 11 percent, compared with 10.6 percent for downtown markets in Canada as a whole.KanAm, which owns real estate assets in Europe, North America and Australia, acquired the buildings at 1350-1360 René-Lévesque West, in 2007 and 2008.  The nearly 1 million square-foot property is managed by Canderel Inc, a Canadian real estate developer. Tenants include IT services providers CGI Group, Computer Sciences Canada, IBM and TD Bank, according to its website.Real estate services firm JLL, which is selling the properties, declined to comment.

604,"  SYDNEY International Business Machines Corp failed in its handling of the A$10 million ($7.4 million) IT contract for Australia's first predominantly online census, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday.IBM was the lead contractor for the five-yearly Aug. 9 household survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that went offline the day after four distributed denial of service attacks that were caused by the website being flooded with clicks.""This was not a particularly clever attack or some great international assault on the census,"" Turnbull told Melbourne's 3AW radio on Friday.""IBM had a contract to deal with it and they failed,"" he said.The style of the attack, which occurred through a router in Singapore, was ""common"" and ""utterly foreseeable,"" Turnbull said, although it was not clear who was responsible for it. An IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, but the company apologized last month to an upper house Senate inquiry over the outage, while also saying that the router was set up by a subcontractor, Nextgen Networks Pty Ltd.IBM has since reached a confidential settlement with Australia for its role in the breach, Australia's minister responsible for the census, Michael McCormack, said in a statement. The Senate inquiry heard that IBM failed to test the Singapore router properly, which was wrongly configured and became overloaded, causing the website shutdown.The inquiry's report, released on Thursday, also criticized the ABS for favoring IBM during the tender process. ""There used to be a saying: 'No-one got fired for buying IBM',"" Turnbull said.""I can assure you the lessons will be very carefully learned,"" he said.
