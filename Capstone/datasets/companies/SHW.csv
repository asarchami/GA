0,"  MEXICO CITY Mexican paint company Consorcio Comex said on Wednesday it was suing Sherwin-Williams (SHW.N) over the U.S. paint maker's failed attempt to acquire it, arguing that the U.S. company had not tried hard enough to honor a deal struck between the two.Sherwin-Williams said in November 2012 it had signed an agreement to purchase Comex for $2.34 billion, but the deal was rejected twice by Mexico's federal competition watchdog on the grounds it would create unfair market conditions.Mexico's Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE) said the tie-up would create a company with around 50 percent of Mexico's paint market which would make it eight times bigger than its nearest competitor. After the second rejection last October, Sherwin-Williams had until March 31 to change the offer, but its efforts to get the approval of COFECE in that period were ""well below"" the standards set out in the purchase agreement, Comex said.Comex said it had asked for the International Chamber of Commerce to arbitrate in its dispute with Sherwin-Williams, which terminated the purchase agreement in April. A family-owned company founded in the 1950s, Comex is seeking unspecified damages in the case. A spokesman for the company could not immediately say how much Comex hoped to win.

The U.S. company added that it may fund part of the purchase price with debt.Mexico's federal competition authority twice rejected Sherwin-Williams' proposed $2.34 billion takeover offer for Comex last year, saying it would create unfair market conditions.Comex, a family-owned company founded in 1952, said in May it was suing Sherwin-Williams because it had not tried hard enough to honor the takeover agreement.

Mexico's competition authority did not immediately respond to request for comment on the deal. Privately held Comex has eight manufacturing plants and six distribution centers and had sales of about $1 billion in 2013.PPG said in April that its board had authorized a $2 billion share repurchase agreement. The purchase would be the latest in a string of Latin American investments PPG has made in recent months. In June, the company said it would invest $40 million in expanding its coating manufacturing plant in Brazil.    In March, PPG said it would acquire Panama-based Canal Supplies, a manufacturer of protective marine coatings.Earlier that month, the company said it would invest more than $27 million in its coating manufacturing plant in San Juan del Rio, in central Mexico.
