3,"  June 15 Investment firm Affiliated Managers Group Inc (AMG) has reached an in-principle agreement to buy a stake in hedge fund manager D.E. Shaw & Co LP from the estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.The deal is the latest sign of an asset manager coveting a slice of a hedge fund manager's fees as banks that have traditionally backed hedge funds retrench due to regulations implemented in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.AMG has bid more than $500 million for the 20 percent stake for sale by Lehman, the financial newspaper reported on its website, citing people familiar with the matter it did not identify. A final deal is not imminent and talks could still fall apart, it added. Lehman, a U.S. investment bank whose collapse was a major contributor to the 2008 crisis, paid between $750 million and $800 million for the stake in 2007, the Wall Street Journal said.AMG and D.E. Shaw representatives did not respond to requests for comment while a Lehman estate spokeswoman declined to comment. New York-based D.E. Shaw has about $32 billion in investment capital, according to its website. It was founded in 1988 by David Shaw, a former Columbia University computer science professor. Boston-based AMG has $594 billion in assets under management. These assets including stakes in hedge fund managers BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, ValueAct Capital Management LP and AQR Capital Management LLC, according to its website.Lehman emerged from bankruptcy in 2012 and its estate has been gradually unwinding its assets since.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has completed a peer review of five  rated traditional investment managers (IMs). Based on this review, Fitch has  affirmed the following Long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR): Affiliated  Managers Group, Inc. (AMG) at 'BBB', AllianceBernstein L.P. (AB) at 'A+',  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) at 'A-', Aberdeen Asset Management PLC (AAM) at 'A', and  Schroders Plc (Schroders) at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook for AMG has been revised  to Positive from Stable, while the Rating Outlooks for the remaining traditional  IMs are Stable. Please refer to company specific rating action commentary published today, and  available on Fitch's website, for further rating rationale. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK The operating environment for traditional IMs remains favorable, driven by  improved global equity markets that have lifted assets under management (AUM)  levels and attracted investor flows. This has resulted in good fee revenue  generation, improved investment performance and stable operating margins,  supported by continued cost discipline.  Leverage levels have generally declined, and in some cases been reduced to zero,  driven by improved cash flow generation and debt repayment. Many traditional IMs  have taken advantage of favorable capital markets and low interest rates to  refinance debt at attractive spreads, which should improve interest coverage.  Liquidity remains strong, with most traditional IMs operating at or near  negative net debt position. These positive trends are tempered by the cyclical nature of market value  appreciation, potential performance and reputational risks in a rising interest  rate environment and regulatory uncertainty surrounding IMs and/or their funds.  MARKET APPRECIATION Market appreciation over the last several years has increased the value assets  under management, attracted asset inflows, improved margins given scale  efficiencies and driven higher levels of management fees. These dynamics result  in improved cash flow leverage (debt/EBITDA) metrics, even without changes in  debt levels, given that EBITDA is the denominator. Fitch views lower leverage  levels positively, but recognizes that with market value declines at other  stages in the economic cycle, such cash flow leverage improvements can reverse  themselves.  INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY Potential tightening of monetary policy by central governments could have a  negative impact on equity and fixed income flows depending on the pace of which  it occurs. Interest rate risk remains for managers with high exposure to fixed  income AUM from unexpected rise in rates, which could potentially hurt  investment performance and pressure flows. The magnitude of the interest rate  impact for a given manager will depend on the extent to which their AUM is  concentrated in fixed income offerings, the characteristic of such funds in  terms of their interest rate sensitivity and the composition of the investor  base. AB, with 56% of its AUM in fixed income assets as of March 31, 2014, has  an above average exposure. However, Fitch believes AB's product and client  diversity along with good investment performance in fixed income should help  mitigate some of this pressure.  At a minimum, market value depreciation or outflows as a result of rising rates  would reduce management fees and thus increase cash flow leverage. It could also  create reputational risk for managers if performance is materially worse than  peers. However, in the long term, rising rates accompanied by sustained economic  growth should benefit equity assets and flows. REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY Traditional investment managers have historically avoided broad regulatory  scrutiny due to the advisory nature of their business. However, the Financial  Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in the U.S. and the Financial Stability Board  (FSB) in Europe are looking into possible systemic risks posed by large  investment management firms and/or their funds, and whether such risks could be  addressed through regulatory measures. While the outcome is highly uncertain,  Fitch believes that increased regulation could be a positive for debtholders if  higher explicit capital and liquidity requirements resulted, although it may  necessitate material equity raises given the limited equity positions of most  managers and negative tangible equity positions in certain instances.  Profitability could also be adversely impacted depending on the extent to which  increased capital/liquidity requirements or heightened transparency requirements  affect IMs or their funds.

15,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Olivia Oran | BOSTON  BOSTON Affiliated Managers Group Inc (AMG.N), a holding company for money management firms, said on Monday it will buy stakes in five hedge funds from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) for $800 million, sparking a 3.5 percent jump in Affiliated Managers stock.AMG, which has been buying pieces of hedge funds for more than a dozen years, said the deal will boost its assets under management by roughly $55 billion to $700 billion and increase economic earnings per share by 50 cents to 80 cents in 2017.Goldman is selling minority stakes that its Petershill Fund I owns in hedge funds Winton Capital Group Ltd, Capula Investment Management LLP, Partner Fund Management LP, Mount Lucas Management LP, and CapeView Capital LLP.Senior management at each of the funds will continue to own the bulk of the equity and operate independently under the same terms as the prior arrangements with Petershill Fund I, AMG said. AMG's share price, which has fallen 21 percent over the last 12 months, got a shot in the arm after the announcement, trading at $177.45, up $5.93.Hedge funds have suffered through their worst period since the financial crisis, with many posting lackluster returns and investors complaining loudly about hefty fees.During the first three months of 2016, investors pulled out $17 billion in assets from hedge funds, which manage roughly $2.8 trillion. In a letter to investors obtained by Reuters, Petershill said it ""maintains its conviction"" in investing in the alternatives industry, including hedge funds. The fund will receive up to $835 million from the deal, the letter said.   Petershill's second fund is raising funds to buy stakes in private equity firms as it tries to diversify its investment pool, according to reports in May.Petershill is part of the alternative investment management group within Goldman's investment management division, led by Tim O'Neill and Eric Lane. Investment management has grown its share of revenue within Goldman to 21 percent in the first quarter of 2016, up from 15 percent in the year-ago period.
