0,"  * Delays could limit sale profits, scupper deals* Shell, Total, Eni, ConocoPhillips also divesting* Nigeria firms, partnered with foreign, biddingBy Joe BrockABUJA, Jan 13 Chevron faces delays in closing sales of oil blocks in Nigeria worth up to $1 billion because of legal disputes involving potential buyers, industry sources say, highlighting a risk other oil majors could face.Chevron is joining competitors ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total and Italy's Eni  in disposing of stakes in onshore and shallow water offshore fields in the Niger Delta region.OPEC-member Nigeria has the potential to double its 2 million-2.5 million barrel per day oil output in the next five years but problems with oil theft, pipeline sabotage and regulatory uncertainty are putting off investment.Oil majors want to keep hold of the biggest producing fields, offshore assets and key pipelines and export terminals.  But they are disposing of less profitable onshore blocks and  fields that the government could strip from them if they remain undeveloped for ten years, notably in the restive Niger Delta.Chevron has chosen its preferred bidders for the five blocks it put up for sale in June but the deals have not closed because rival firms have disputed its decision, with one taking the U.S. company to court, sources close to the deals said.A Chevron spokeswoman said the company did not comment on ongoing transactions.Nigerian firm Brittania-U, run by former Chevron executive Catherine Uju Ifejika, was the highest bidder at over $1 billion for the biggest cluster of blocks - OML 52, 53 and 55 - and Chevron began discussions with the company over the sale, two banking sources close to the deal said. Chevron decided to look at alternative bids after Brittania-U did not show sufficient evidence it could muster the amount promptly, banking and oil industry sources said.Brittania-U did not respond to requests for comment.Chevron then agreed to sell the biggest block, OML 53, to Seplat, which is partly owned by French oil explorer Maurel & Prom and Swiss-based commodity trader Mercuria, while OML 52 would go to local firm Amni Petroleum and the smallest, OML 55, to Belema Oil, run by a local Delta community.$1 BILLION  None of the companies responded to request for comment.A Nigerian federal high court issued an interim injunction in December stopping Chevron from selling the blocks to Seplat and others after Brittania-U brought action against the U.S. major saying it had already agreed a deal to buy the assets, court documents showed.Chevron could earn between $700 million and $900 million for the three blocks, two sources involved in bids said.The three blocks had proven reserves of 555 million barrels of oil equivalent, with the biggest block OML 53 holding 310 million of those reserves, two oil industry sources said, citing a Chevron memorandum given to bidders.Court cases can drag on for years in Nigeria and the longer the delay the less profit oil majors are likely to make from the deals and the greater the chances the sales could fall through altogether. Such litigation also slows down the potential oil and gas production increases that could be felt from new buyers exploiting assets left undeveloped by oil majors.ConocoPhillips has waited for more than a year to close a $1.6 billion deal with Nigeria's biggest energy company, Oando  , for its business in Africa's biggest oil producer because the local firm has taken more than a year to raise finance.Oando plans to raise $193 million in a share issue to help finance the deal, banking sources said in December, and the company has said the acquisition will be completed early this year.Chevron has also agreed to sell two smaller blocks - OML 83 and 85 - to Nigerian firm First Exploration and Production with a bid of around $100 million but the deal has not been completed and rival bidders are also considering disputing this deal, the two banking sources said. They did not give details of which companies might challenge the sale.First E&P's Chairman Henry Odein Ajumogobia is a former foreign affairs minister and its Managing Director Ademola Adeyemi-Bero spent five year working at BG Group.Chevron and First E&P declined to comment.Shell, Total and Eni are selling a combined 45 percent stake in at least four more oil blocks with combined production of around 70,000 barrels per day. Bids on these blocks are due next month, sources said.Shell, the biggest producer in Nigeria, has sold eight oil blocks in the Niger Delta for a total $1.8 billion since 2010 and some industry sources believe the Anglo-Dutch major may have the experience needed to get deals agreed.""It's not about the highest bid, it's about which buyer has the know-how and the connections to get the deals done,"" one executive at a Nigerian company said.",2014-01-13,COP,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 9:07am EST",Legal challenges delay Chevron's $1 bln Nigeria oil block sales,http://www.reuters.com//article/chevron-nigeria-idUSL5N0ID3A220140113?type=companyNews
1,"  HOUSTON Oil producer ConocoPhillips (COP.N) outshone larger competitors on Thursday with a quarterly profit that beat expectations as it moved to overcome the problems of high costs and lack of fresh reserves that have nagged at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. oil company without refining operations, said its profits were helped by the sale of its Algerian business and by higher crude oil production in North America.The company shed its refining business in 2012 and has sold billions of dollars of lower-yielding assets to focus on more profitable oil production from North American shale basins such as the Eagle Ford in south Texas.Analysts said Conoco's plan is beginning to pay off at a time when the industry faces pressure from shareholders to lift returns despite flat oil prices and rising costs for risky exploration work designed to replace reserves.Conoco's profit in the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, or $2.00 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, profits inched down, though analysts characterized Conoco's reserve replacement ratio, a measure of a company's ability to find new oil and gas reserves to replace what is produced, as strong.On a preliminary basis, Conoco's proved reserves rose 3 percent from a year earlier to 8.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). Proved organic reserve additions are expected to be about 1.1 billion BOE for a replacement ratio of 179 percent of 2013 production.In a note to clients, Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse dubbed Conoco the best performing large oil company, citing 7 percent growth in cash flow despite asset sales, a reduced share count and more cash on the balance sheet.""I think we're seeing pretty good evidence that the strategy is working,"" Jeff Sheets, Conoco's chief financial officer, said, citing cash margin growth and expected gains in production. Conoco's shares rose slightly, while those of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), the fourth-largest U.S. oil and gas company, edged lower even though it reported a quarterly profit that beat expectations.At $2.04 per share, Occidental's earnings were significantly higher than the 42 cents per share earned a year earlier, when the company wrote down the value of gas properties in the U.S. midcontinent by $1.1 billion.SHELL, EXXON At Shell, Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, just a month on the job, set out plans to make the world's No. 3 investor-owned oil company leaner, putting a new focus on increasing cash, while scrapping an Arctic drilling program. ""Our overall strategy remains robust, but 2014 will be a year where we are changing emphasis, to improve our returns and cash flow performance,"" van Beurden said. ""Our returns are at this point in time too low to be considered competitive.""This year, Shell plans to slash spending to $37 billion from $46 billion and to increase asset dispositions to $15 billion - about 6.5 percent of its $228 billion market capitalization - from $1.7 billion in 2013.The promises, along with a higher dividend, helped lift Shell's shares 1 percent to 2,147 pence.Shell's fourth-quarter earnings, excluding identified items and on a current cost of supply basis, came in at $2.9 billion, 48 percent lower than in the year-before quarter but in line with the downgraded forecast Shell gave on January 17, making the quarter its least profitable for five years. Shares of Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company by market value, were down 0.5 percent at $94.60 after the company posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and failed to offset declining production with fresh reserves.The results reflected a ""mediocre quarter"" for Exxon, especially in international production, Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said. ""They've lost momentum already, reverting back to declining production and stagnant earnings.""Exxon's oil and natural gas production fell 1.8 percent from year-before levels, with natural gas production falling around the world and oil output slipping in half the regions in which the company operates.Still, Exxon executives said they were confident new projects in the Middle East, Asia and the United States would help boost production.The blip in fourth-quarter results doesn't change Exxon's investment appeal, or for that matter the sector's, said Oliver Pursche of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, who manages Exxon shares for clients.""There's nothing in this report that's overly alarming,"" he said.

8,"   By Melissa Massey and Oleg Vukmanovic | LONDON  LONDON Feb 21 U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) by the end of the decade is likely to challenge Russian gas for market share in Europe as the region becomes increasingly dependent on imports, ConocoPhillips' head of LNG trading said.A surge in production worldwide, driven by new projects in the United States, Australia, East Africa, Russia and Canada, could double LNG output to 600 million tonnes annually from 2018 and provide ample new supply to global markets, industry estimates suggest.Kicking off the export growth, after years of stagnating supply, will be Exxon Mobil's Papau New Guinea LNG plant in the third-quarter of this year, followed by BG Group's  Queensland Curtis project in Australia by year-end.Most new Australian and east Africa supplies are expected to reach Asia to fill demand, while significant output from the United States and elsewhere is expected to arrive at European terminals.""We believe that the European gas market will be a balancing market for global gas,"" said Birger Balteskard, global LNG marketing manager at ConocoPhillips, told the International Petroleum Week industry conference.Balteskard said Europe's dependence on gas imports will grow as its domestic fields age and that America's proposed LNG export terminals will help meet that need. ""There is a potential large gap between demand and supply into Europe. We think by 2025 that will be as much as 25 (billion cubic feet) a day, which is significant,"" Balteskard said.The United States, meanwhile, is producing record amounts of gas from shale, and more than a dozen export projects have been proposed, some of which could target Europe from 2015 onwards.Europe's biggest supplier Russia charges high prices for supplies, offering U.S. LNG shippers a chance to grab market share through cut-rate deals.In Europe, a case could be made that ""there will be competition between Russian pipe gas and LNG from the States and potentially East Africa"", Balteskard said. ASIA STEPPING UP In Asia, gas demand has outstripped supply. Japan, the world's top LNG buyer, has shifted more to gas following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, while second-biggest buyer South Korea has stepped up purchases after a nuclear safety scandal. Asian gas prices currently trade above $20 per million British thermal units, while European prices are around $10 per mmBtu.Atlantic Basin LNG producers have in recent years diverted cargoes to the higher-paying Asian and South American markets, halving Europe's intake.But as producers open the taps from new projects to fill Asian demand, and as Mexico and some South American energy producers work to wean themselves off costly LNG imports, deliveries to Europe could rebound.Some uncertainties remain, however, that could still skew this scenario.If China's demand grows faster than expected, it could potentially limit the availability of gas supplies to Europe. Similarly, any decision by top LNG importer Japan to uphold its atomic energy ban means it will need gas to meet any growth in energy needs.""Assuming East Africa, the U.S. and Australia do happen the way we think, the main thing to look at is what is going on in China. How much energy will it be able to absorb?""

11,"  (Repeats story published late Thursday; no changes to text)YANGON, March 26 International oil majors including Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil, ConocoPhillips and Total  won rights to explore for oil and gas off Myanmar, according to the Southeast Asian country's Ministry of Energy.Myanmar has awarded 10 shallow-water blocks and 10 deepwater blocks in an auction process that began in April last year, according to a posting on the ministry's website on Wednesday.Winners of deepwater blocks will be able to explore and operate the blocks on their own, while shallow-water winners will need to work with a registered local partner, according to the terms of the production sharing contracts.

14,"  HOUSTON, April 10 ConocoPhillips, the largest independent oil company, is using the knowledge it gained drilling in Texas' Eagle Ford rocks to fuel growth in less-developed shale formations in North American and even Poland.""The value associated with that learning curve has been pretty tremendous,"" Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance told the company's annual analyst meeting.Conoco and many other companies are spending ever higher amounts to coax more profitable and lower-risk crude oil and natural gas liquids from shale and other rocks in North America.This year, Houston-based Conoco said about one-third of its $16.7 billion budget will be spent on so-called unconventional resources in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shales with the aim of raising that output more than 20 percent by 2017, the Houston company told its annual analyst meeting. Now, Conoco is taking the success it has seen drilling in the Eagle Ford and exporting that to horizontal wells in Texas' Permian Basin, Canada, Colorado and Poland.""We were one of the first people to produce shales gas in Poland,"" said Matt Fox, Conoco's head of exploration and production. Of a planned well in Poland he said, ""We're going to drill it like an Eagle Ford well, we're going to frack it like an Eagle Ford well."" Knowledge gained drilling in the Eagle Ford and Bakken is enabling Conoco to increase efficiencies, lower costs and raise the amount of oil and gas it expects to produce over the lifetime of a well in other places, it said. Conoco left its major targets unchanged, saying it still sees overall production and margin growth of 3 percent to 5 percent through 2017.This year, Conoco sees production of 1.51 to 1.55 million barrels oil equivalent per day (boepd), with a year-end exit rate of 1.6 million boepd.Shares of Conoco fell $1.38 to $70.16, down 1.9 percent.

15,"  (Adds details from order, background)By Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON, April 14 The U.S. Energy Department on Monday renewed ConocoPhillips' permit allowing the company to export liquefied natural gas from Alaska to all countries.The approval was largely expected, as the U.S. government has long allowed LNG exports from Alaska's Kenai terminal, issuing its first permit allowing the shipments in 1967. With the latest permit, ConocoPhillips will be able to export up to 40 billion cubic feet of LNG from Kenai over the next two years.ConocoPhillips' previous permit lapsed in March 2013 amid concerns about falling gas output in the Cook Inlet region. Last September, Alaska's Department of Natural Resources asked ConocoPhillips to resume LNG exports to help support local natural gas production and provide natural gas supply security in Southcentral Alaska.""Today's announcement by DOE ... highlights the growth that's occurring in Cook Inlet, where there is now ample gas supply to both meet local needs and help out our friends overseas,"" said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the top Republican on the Senate energy committee. The recent push to export substantial amounts of LNG from the lower 48 states has faced opposition from some heavy industrial companies concerned that exports may cause shortages and price spikes. However, Alaskan gas exports have not been a major source of controversy because the state's geographic isolation means not much of its gas goes to the lower 48.Japan has typically been the main buyer of Alaskan LNG.ConocoPhillips shares were up about 0.8 percent at $64.30 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

17,"   By Dmitry Zhdannikov | LONDON  LONDON When U.S. firm ConocoPhillips (COP.N) spun off its refining assets in 2011 to focus on more profitable oil production, it seemed only a matter of time before one of the oil majors followed suit.Three years on, the six vertically integrated global majors are still holding onto their often loss-making plants, seen as a drag by investors.They cut oil processing rates, sell individual plants, shift exposure from region to region, but have yet to follow Conoco's lead, hanging on instead to returns that are a shadow of the boom years of 2004-2007 but still worth having.Conoco's downstream spinoff was part of a trend in the U.S. industry where a handful of mid-level companies split their upstream and downstream operations, including Hess (HES.N) and Marathon (MRO.N).Europe's oil refining guru, Marcel van Poecke, believes the move will be repeated one day.""Investors say: 'We don't need you to be an integrated company' ...They say: 'We can buy BP (BP.L) for upstream and Valero (VLO.N) for downstream. And we will create our own oil company',"" Van Poecke, who runs a fund at private equity giant Carlyle (CG.O), said this month.The head of the world's largest trading house Vitol, Ian Taylor also sees majors drastically reducing exposure to refining.However, majors themselves say not many people realize how much scaling down has been already done in the past years.BP, once considered to be a monster of refining, has sold 13 refineries in as many years, effectively halving the number of plants in which it participates or operates.BP's chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg says he believes majors will be actively shifting refining centers rather than selling off entire divisions.""It is a different story if you look at developed and developing markets. We are decreasing our position in western markets... Whereas if you go to developing markets like Russia or China, then you still have the integrated chain,"" Svanberg said this month.""DON'T OVERPRODUCE""  Ivan Glasenberg, the head of commodities giant Glencore (GLEN.L), which is currently leading a drive among miners to reduce costs and increase payouts, says oil majors embracing the same strategy should learn one lesson from mining.""Don't overproduce,"" Glasenberg said this month.His message is more applicable to downstream at oil majors rather than to upstream, where oil cartel the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can perform a balancing act to smooth out sharp production fluctuations.In downstream, overproduction effectively happened over the past decade when a refining peak in the early 2000s saw too many refineries built around the world.""If you look at the energy outlook you will see that fuel consumption in the developed market is flat or even coming down. With the increased share of biofuels you are actually seeing a slightly decreasing consumption of fossil fuels,"" said Svanberg.""Because of that the market is actually oversupplied. And very competitive... The only reason to be in refining in the Western world is actually if you have a distinct advantage as we have in Whiting,"" he said referring to BP's modern U.S. plant. JBC Energy analysts estimate global crude distillation capacity will rise 9 percent to 92.6 million barrels per day in 2014, from 85.1 million bpd in 2004.""Six years ago (in June 2008) we expected 2014 capacity to come in at 98.2 million bpd. This is a nice illustration of the post-crisis slowdown of demand as well as the reaction to overcapacity in terms of both shutdowns of existing plants and delays and cancellation of planned additions,"" said David Wech from JBC.""CHEMISTRY"" Even as global refining capacity grew, albeit at a slower pace than expected, majors took a different approach.Total refining capacity at six global majors - ExxonMobil (XOM.N), BP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Total (TOTF.PA), Chevron (CVX.N) and Eni (ENI.MI) - fell by over 16 percent over the past decade to around 15 million bpd, according to Reuters calculations.Except for Eni, all majors reduced their capacity, especially in Europe, where 1.5 million bpd of capacity has closed since 2008 amid weak demand and competition with new, modern plants in Asia, the Arab Gulf and the United States. As Russian refineries upgrade too, another 2 million bpd are likely to close in Europe before 2018, according to JBC.But as refining operations at majors become slimmer and more modern, the peak of the low returns pain might have passed.According to BMO Financial, part of Bank of Montreal, majors such as Chevron, Exxon, BP and Total will probably see returns on average capital employed (ROACE) - a key metric for investors - in the area of 9-12 percent in downstream by 2017. Shell will see its ROACE at 7 percent and Eni at around 1 percent.That is course a pale reflection of returns of 17-18 percent during the boom years of 2004-2007 but still not enough to fully divest downstream, especially as ROACE in upstream is also expected to fall to 11-15 percent from the peaks of 30 percent.For BP free cash flows from downstream are expected to more than double to $9.6 billion by 2017, while free cash flow from upstream will only rise by 20 percent to $28.7 billion, according to BMO.""The proportion of free cash flows that the downstream creates from its operating cash is much higher than the upstream,"" Iain Conn, who runs BP's downstream, told Reuters.There are other reasons that will also help majors retain their downstream, including access to new regions.""Quite often (emerging market) governments like a company that has got the downstream and helps them with their market evolution as well as developing their resources,"" says Conn.Finally, downstream can play an important role in bringing refining and extraction technologies together with research into how car engines interact with lubricants helping shed light on upstream fracking operations where oil is separated from rocks.""It is exactly the same chemistry. We have put those teams together,"" said Conn.(Additional reporting by Peg Mackey and Alex Lawler; editing by Keiron Henderson)",2014-04-16,COP,"Wed Apr 16, 2014 | 11:58am EDT","After years of downsizing, refining still matters for majors",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-majors-refining-analysis-idUSBREA3F18J20140416?type=companyNews

26,"  CARACAS May 6 A World Bank panel said on Tuesday it has rejected Venezuela's request to change the arbitrators reviewing a dispute over compensation sought by U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips for 2007 expropriations.The International Centre for Resolution of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, in March shot down Venezuela's appeal for a new hearing to contest a 2013 partial ruling that it failed to act in good faith in compensation negotiations with Conoco.The dispute dates from then-President Hugo Chavez's socialist government's takeover of oil projects in 2007 including two multi-billion dollar heavy oil operations in the vast Orinoco Belt. Venezuela had sought to remove Kenneth Keith and L. Yves Fortier from the panel hearing the case, complaining of their ""general negative attitude"" and ""propensity to decide  by 'sheer fiat.'"" Conoco said the request constituted ""meritless and desperate delaying tactics by Venezuela."" Despite formally withdrawing from ICSID in 2013, Venezuela still faces about 20 claims stemming largely from compensation disputes over the late Chavez's wave of nationalizations.

27,"  By Anna DriverHOUSTON May 13 ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance on Tuesday said his company and Venezuela are due to argue damages before the World Bank's arbitration panel as their dispute over oil assets in the South American country moves forward.The arguments are ""imminent,"" Lance told reporters after the company's annual meeting, adding it was uncertain when the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) would issue a final ruling.Conoco's projects were taken over during the socialist administration of deceased former President Hugo Chavez, who led a wave of nationalizations that included the oil, electricity and steel industries. In a partial resolution, the arbitration panel in September said Venezuela failed to act in good faith or properly compensate ConocoPhillips for three big oil assets the country expropriated in 2007. The court also limited the scope of the company's claims by excluding future tax credits .This month the panel also said it rejected Venezuela's request to change the arbitrators reviewing the dispute. Independent lawyers expect a final ruling, including a compensation amount, in 2014-2015.ConocoPhillips initially asked Venezuela for $30 billion in compensation for its stakes in the Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy crude upgraders and a separate offshore project called Corocoro, but Venezuela offered no more than $2 billion. The Andean country has more than 20 arbitration cases pending at ICSID and other courts stemming from Chavez's nationalizations. The country pulled out of the ICSID in 2012, but will still be subject to cases submitted beforehand.(Written by Anna Driver and Marianna Parraga; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-05-13,COP,"Tue May 13, 2014 | 12:29pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Conoco to soon argue damages in Venezuela dispute -CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/conocophillips-venezuela-idUSL1N0NZ15T20140513?type=companyNews
28,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON  The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday largely upheld the Obama administration’s authority to curb greenhouse gases from major emitters like power plants and refineries in a ruling that nonetheless exempted some smaller sources from the regulation.On a 7-2 vote, the court rejected an industry-backed argument that most emitting facilities should not be regulated for greenhouse gases under one particular air pollution program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).But industry could claim a partial win because the court ruled on a 5-4 vote that some facilities the government had wanted to regulate will be exempted. Some landfills, pulp and paper facilities, electronics manufacturing plants, chemical production plants and beverage producers are among the small industrial sources likely to be exempted, an EPA spokesman said.""It bears mention that EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case,"" Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, read from a statement in court.The ruling brought an end to what started out as a broad legal challenge to the Obama administration's first suite of greenhouse gas regulations issued in 2009 and 2010. The administration won on every count except in the mixed ruling announced on Monday.The case focused only on the ""prevention of serious deterioration"" or PSD program, which requires any new or modified major polluting facility to obtain a permit before any new construction is done if it emits ""any air pollutant.""BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY  The EPA said in a statement: ""The Supreme Court’s decision is a win for our efforts to reduce carbon pollution because it allows EPA, states and other permitting authorities to continue to require carbon pollution limits in permits for the largest pollution sources.""Industry groups also claimed victory. The American Petroleum Institute said in a statement that the decision was a ""stark reminder that the EPA's power is not unlimited.""The justices were split in multiple ways. The four liberals voted with Scalia on one point but would have ruled for EPA on all counts. Conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas would have ruled against the government across the board.Scalia was critical of the administration, saying its interpretation of the law ""would bring about an enormous and transformative expansion of EPA's regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization."" The parties agreed that as a result of the ruling roughly 83 percent of greenhouse gas emissions that could potentially be regulated under the EPA's interpretation of the law would still be covered, compared with the 86 percent of emissions that the EPA had hoped to regulate.Under the program, operators have to show they use the best technology available to reduce emissions of covered pollutants. More than 300 facilities have applied for permits.BROADER CHALLENGE  The small-bore nature of the case was in stark contrast to the broader legal challenges initially made by industry groups and states. When the administration's first four climate change rules were issued, armies of lawyers were lined up to fight them. Some even questioned the landmark Massachusetts v EPA ruling from 2007, in which the Supreme Court said greenhouse gases were pollutants that could be regulated under the federal Clean Air Act.But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the rules in a unanimous June 2012 decision.The challengers sought Supreme Court review and, in October 2013, the justices agreed to hear the narrow case that was decided on Monday. The court opted against hearing any of the broader legal challenges, leaving intact the EPA's finding that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act and the agency's first regulations for cars and light trucks.Ultimately, the all-out legal assault largely fizzled. It constituted ""sound and fury, signifying much less than it should have,"" said Eric Groten, a lawyer with the Vinson & Elkins law firm, who represented one of the challengers.The Supreme Court decision is not expected to affect the administration’s ability to set air pollution standards for greenhouse gases under a separate provision of the Clean Air Act. On June 2, the White House announced proposed rules calling for 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, including coal-fired facilities.The case is Utility Air Regulatory Group v Environmental Protection Agency et al, U.S. Supreme Court No. 12-1146 (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Howard Goller and Grant McCool)",2014-06-23,COP,"Mon Jun 23, 2014 | 6:51pm EDT",Top court mostly upholds Obama bid to curb carbon emissions,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-court-climatechange-idUSKBN0EY1L920140623?type=companyNews

31,"   By Michel Rose | PARIS  PARIS Nigerian oil company Oando (OANDO.LG) completed a $1.5 billion deal to buy ConocoPhillips's assets in Nigeria on Wednesday, catapulting it to be one of the top players in the West African country's emerging indigenous oil and gas exploration industry.ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has waited for more than a year to close the deal with Oando, which is listed in Lagos, Toronto OER.TO and Johannesburg, because the local firm struggled to raise finance and had to navigate local bureaucracy.     But for Oando's chairman, the deal means as much for the young Nigerian company as for the country as a whole.""It's a significant transaction: it's the largest single upstream acquisition done in Nigerian industry by an indigenous company,"" Wale Tinubu told Reuters in an interview in Paris, where a ceremony was held on Wednesday.""In the long term it will be good for the country, in terms of being able to retain value in the country, as opposed to the exploitation or the exports of profits outside the country,"" he added.Since 2010, Nigeria has had a policy of encouraging more direct ownership of its oil and gas by Nigerians, either through the state oil company or local private firms. That has raised concerns among foreign oil majors they may lose smaller assets if they do not sell now, industry experts say.ConocoPhillips is joining competitors Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), France's Total (TOTF.PA) and Italy's Eni (ENI.MI) in disposing of stakes in onshore and shallow water offshore fields in the swampy Niger Delta region.Oando's chairman said encouraging the local industry did not mean there was no place left for international majors, however. ""The offshore belongs to the international oil companies. There's so much oil offshore! I think we need that capital, we need that expertise to develop offshore,"" he said.Tinubu said the company was interested in doing similar deals with oil majors to grow more in the next 2 to 3 years.""We're looking for similar assets, with sizeable, proven and developed reserves, with their own export facilities.""Asked if Oando could bid for the OML 138 block that France's Total failed to sell to Sinopec, the chairman said:""It's a good asset but the price was quite high. $24 per barrel, I think it's a bit too expensive."" A LOT OF SELF-HELP Tinubu said he believed a bigger indigenous participation in the country's oil and gas industry will also help Nigeria deal with issues such as oil theft, pipeline sabotage and regulatory uncertainty that are putting off investment.""If you live in an emerging market, or in an place like Nigeria, you realize that a lot of self-help is required,"" he said. ""Everybody has private guards, everybody builds their own fences, there's a neighborhood watch. "" ""That same principle will apply to oil and gas assets, with more fragmented pieces owned by indigenous companies who provide protection for these assets,"" he said.  If it fixes these issues, OPEC-member Nigeria has the potential to double its 2 million-2.5 million barrel per day oil output in the next five years, analysts said.Tinubu said he was aiming to bring Oando's production to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the current 46,700 boepd.Rival firm Seplat, which raised $500 million in a debut stock market listing in Lagos (SEPLAT.LG) and London (SEPL.L) in April, produces about 23,000 barrels per day, while London-listed Afren AFRE.L produces about 47,000, according to Oanda's estimates.Asked if he expected consolidation in the Nigerian industry in the future, Tinubu said:""If you ask me, I think there will be 3 to 5 champions coming from Nigeria. And you will find a lot of small, profitable players,"" he said.

37,"   By Luciana Lopez and Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 14 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter.Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30.Charter is ""the play of choice on cable consolidation,"" said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan.""You've got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,"" he said.DirecTV is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T for $48.5 billion.Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him.Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire's larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest. Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz.The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire's cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion.That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion. In Thursday's filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc, an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc , whose stock Berkshire also owns.Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp, IBM Corp, Suncor Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips, former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co, National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp.U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks.Berkshire ended June with more than $119 billion of equities, about 90 percent of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

We agree with the voters that oil tax reform is working, and BP is committed to doing its part to make sure that continues.” Parnell, who claimed his own victory in the state's Republican primary election on Tuesday night, has said his tax rollback will make Alaska more competitive for investment and North Slope oil producers. He called the More Alaska Production Act crucial to the state's long-term future because it would reverse declining output.Repeal backers got on the ballot last year with a petition featuring 50,000 signatures shortly after Parnell signed Senate Bill 21. They have faced opposition that has raised close to $15 million compared with their several hundred thousand dollars. Those pushing for the repeal said Parnell's system only put more money in the oil companies' pockets for investment elsewhere, while depleting the state's fiscal war chest.

42,"  Sept 15 ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. independent oil and gas company, is preparing to auction its 24 percent stake in the Clair oilfield in the United Kingdom, the Financial Times reported on Monday.The Houston-based company has hired banks to sell its stake in the Clair oilfield in a deal that could fetch between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to the FT report, which cites people familiar with the matter. Clair oilfield, which was discovered in 1977 and extends over 220 square kilometers (135 square miles), is located in Scottish territorial waters west of the Shetland islands. The oilfield has an estimated 8 billion barrels of oil, making it the largest hydrocarbon resource in Europe, according to oil major BP Plc's website. BP, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc were developing a second phase of the oilfield, known as Clair Ridge, at a cost of 4.5 billion  pounds, with production estimated to start in 2016/2017.

47,"   By Anna Driver  ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the largest U.S. independent oil and gas company, on Thursday reported higher third-quarter profit after the sale of its Nigerian unit and said overall spending would decline next year, partly in response to falling crude oil prices.Crude oil prices have tumbled more than 20 percent in recent weeks as global demand slows and supplies rise. Crude traded in New York fell to a more than two-year low on Monday at $79.44 a barrel but recovered a bit to above $81 on Thursday.Conoco expects to spend less than $16 billion next year, down from the $16.7 billion projected for 2014, Ryan Lance, the chief executive officer, told investors on a conference call to discuss earnings. Over the last several years, Conoco has shed lower-margin assets, directing more capital to projects like shale drilling in Eagle Ford area in south Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota that offer higher returns and faster production growth. Even with a drop in spending, the company expects to meet its forecast to boost oil and gas output 3 percent to 5 percent in 2015, Lance told investors.  Conoco will continue to invest near current levels in Eagle Ford and Bakken, but has the flexibility to pare spending in exploration and on less-developed fields in such places as the Permian Basin in West Texas and western Canada, it said.""Beginning in 2015 capital in our major projects begins to taper off,"" said Lance, ""We have significantly more flexibility to ramp up or down our capital as circumstances dictate."" Profit rose to $2.7 billion, or $2.17 per share, from $2.5 billion, or $2.00 per share, in the 2013 third quarter. Excluding items such as the proceeds from the sale of its Nigerian business in July and a tax benefit, Conoco had a profit of $1.29 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The proceeds from the Nigerian sale were $1.4 billion.ConocoPhillips had third-quarter oil and gas production from continuing operations, excluding Libya, of 1.473 million barrels oil equivalent per day (boed), up 25,000 boed from a year ago. For the fourth quarter, Conoco forecast production from continuing operations rising to 1.545 million boed to 1.575 million boed, excluding Libya. Previously, it said it would produce as much as 1.590 million boed to 1.640 million boed.The production cut is due in part to third-party infrastructure constraints in Malaysia and a depressed market for the natural gas liquid (NGL) ethane in the United States, according to analysts at Wells Fargo.Shares of Conoco rose 0.8 percent to $71.32 in afternoon  trading.

52,"   By Sonali Paul | MELBOURNE  MELBOURNE Nov 5 East Timor has ordered five foreign judges out of the country after a court ruled in favour of U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips in cases tied to $236 million in disputed tax assessments.ConocoPhillips operates the Bayu Undan gas field in the Timor Sea between East Timor and Australia. Royalties and taxes from the field are the main source of revenue for East Timor, one of the world's poorest nations.The young country, which won independence from Indonesia in 2002, had hired international judges and prosecutors to beef up its judicial system, but Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao has been unhappy about the rulings on the tax cases, among other issues.The government's move on the judiciary raises concerns about the rule of law in East Timor, which needs foreign companies to develop its oil and gas resources.An East Timor embassy spokeswoman in Canberra, Australia, confirmed on Wednesday that five judges and two prosecutors had been ordered to leave the country on Tuesday. She said it was not yet clear when they would depart.ConocoPhillips has challenged the government in 28 cases over tax assessments that were higher than what the company says it owes, and has won all seven that have been decided so far. The government's move to expel the judges and prosecutors was done according to the law to ""protect the interests of our people"", East Timor Foreign Minister Jose Luis Guterres said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.ConocoPhillips says it has paid all the taxes that are due under East Timor law and has paid ""under protest"" all taxes, interest and penalties assessed by the government, adding that it still highly values its relationship with the government.""In our view, an independent and impartial court system is crucial to create a good investment climate for Timor-Leste,"" ConocoPhillips President Australia-West Todd Creeger said in an emailed statement commenting on the deportations. ""If the business community and potential investors are confident they will be treated fairly, Timor-Leste's long term economic development will benefit.""GREATER SUNRISE  The move by East Timor comes amid talks with the Australian government to try to resolve a long-running dispute over the treaty that gives East Timor a 50 percent share of the royalty revenue from another gas field, Greater Sunrise, which straddles the maritime boundary between the two countries.The governments recently agreed to adjourn an international arbitration over the dispute for at least six months to try to resolve their differences directly.A resolution would help clear the way for a decision to develop the Greater Sunrise project, which remains untapped 40 years after its fields were discovered, and is key to the growth prospects of Australia's biggest oil and gas producer, Woodside Petroleum.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the talks do not involve negotiating permanent maritime boundaries with East Timor and that Australia continues to support current treaty arrangements.""Through the consultations we hope to find a way to resolve our differences amicably, rather than through litigation,"" a department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

""Of course new business could be affected if the oil price continues to be down,"" Kaeser said at an investor conference on Tuesday. However, he added that falling prices should boost demand for high-margin services as customers seek to cut costs.Crude oil prices have dropped to five-year lows and billions of dollars worth of oil and gas exploration projects are expected to be put on hold in the coming months. ConocoPhillips said on Monday that its 2015 capital budget would be 20 percent, or about $3 billion, lower than this year's, the biggest spending cut by a U.S. oil and gas producer in dollar terms.Kaeser said he would not consider pulling out of the Dresser-Rand deal, Siemens's biggest since it bought Dade Behring in 2007, despite the oil price fall.""The average cost of taking out oil in the United States has come down from $72 (per barrel) in 2012 to $57 in 2013, so you can see that the productivity that oil & gas service providers helps companies a lot to bring down costs,"" he said. JP Morgan recently said that the market underestimated the risk that falling oil prices posed for Siemens's business because relatively healthy U.S. demand for gas turbines would not be sufficient to offset declining sales in the Middle East and other oil producing countries.It said it preferred the stocks of Siemens rivals with a lower exposure to oil-producing sectors and countries, such as Schneider Electric, Philips or Rexel  to Siemens and Switzerland's ABB.Siemens, whose products range from gas turbines to high-speed trains and industrial automation software, unveiled a corporate overhaul in May that will focus more on high-margin services and help it make up ground on more profitable rivals such as Switzerland's ABB and U.S.-based General Electric .Shares in Siemens were down 1.8 percent at 92.41 euros by 1326 GMT, underperforming Germany's blue-chip DAX index , which was 1.4 percent lower.

57,"   By Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 14 ConocoPhillips has asked the U.S. Commerce Department for guidance on whether it can ship its minimally treated light oil abroad, though the company does not believe it makes sense to export it now, the company's CEO said on Wednesday.U.S. oil drillers that have enjoyed a boom over the last six years are pressuring the government to lift the 40-year ban on oil exports, a remnant of the 1970s Arab oil embargo that led to fears of energy shortages.The Bureau of Industry and Security at the commerce department said on Dec. 30 that it had given permission for exports of treated light oil called condensate to ""some"" companies without going into detail. The permissions do not lift the export restriction, but have given confidence to companies that want to ship light oil to markets in Asia and Europe.Conoco Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance told reporters at the Center for Strategic and International Studies research institute that the company has ""an application in front of"" the Department of Commerce. ""We're looking at the rulings and taking a look at how our condensate compares to the condensate that they have ruled in,"" Lance said.Another energy major, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said earlier this week that it received U.S. approval to export condensate. With oil prices falling by more than half since June to less than $50 a barrel, Shell said it would export the condensate when it was sufficiently profitable.Conoco's Lance said now might not be the time for Conoco to export any condensate. ""We don't think we have significant differentials to being able to export, but if that situation were to change we would look at that, and we are looking at that,"" Lance said.The Commerce Department has given previous approvals to Enterprise Partners, Pioneer Natural Resources  and Peaker Energy.Some analysts have said condensate exports could rise from 200,000 barrels per day to as much as 1 million bpd by the end of next year. Lance questioned whether drillers could produce that much condensate, however.

ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) on Thursday slashed exploration spending plans for this year, as the third- and fourth-largest U.S. oil companies attempt to cope with a steep slide in crude prices.The cuts follow similar steps by rival Hess Corp (HES.N) earlier this week while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Europe's largest oil company, said on Thursday it would reduce its spending the next three years by $15 billion.  Rising supplies of oil, from sources including North American shale basins, and weakening demand have flooded global markets with crude, sending prices plummeting almost 60 percent since June. On Thursday, crude traded in New York at $43.80 per barrel, much lower than many oil and gas projects require to make money.In response to the price collapse, oil and gas companies have made drastic cuts to budgets, idled drilling rigs and in some cases, cut jobs.For a factbox on capex cuts, click on:Conoco, which said in December it would cut 2015 spending by 20 percent to $13.5 billion, now expects spending to be scaled back by a further 15 percent to $11.5 billion.

Conoco's second trimming of its 2015 capex budget raised the specter that others in the industry could further reduce their own spending, potentially reinforcing a dip in U.S. production that the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts to occur this summer.

Conoco said it would defer drilling some U.S. onshore exploration programs and delay spending on some major projects. Occidental said it will pull back spending in North Dakota's Bakken Shale and in Bahrain. ""We think it is imprudent to accelerate some of these opportunities in the current low product price environment,"" Occidental Chief Executive Stephen Chazen told investors.Analysts at Houston-based investment bank Simmons & Co said Conoco's plan to further reduce capital spending is the right move to make, in this ""challenging environment.""Neither Conoco nor Occidental are running out of cash, despite the low prices, though.

It also wants to reduce imports of Russian energy by producing more of its own.Yet hopes that drilling for shale gas can replace these have dimmed, with Chevron the latest major energy company to quit Poland.ExxonMobil, Marathon and France's Total  have all been and gone. A drastic cut in Poland's estimated shale gas reserves marked a first blow in 2012. A 50 percent drop in oil prices since last June has proved a second.""For us the situation is dramatic. All projects have to be put on hold,"" said one manager at a small energy company in Poland, pointing to hundreds of layoffs as investors withdraw and servicing firms remain idle.While exploratory drilling has been done, Poland has not delivered a single commercial well and the only global major company left is ConocoPhillips.""We continue to evaluate results of our recent testing in Poland,"" said a spokesman when asked about Conoco's outlook.Market sources said Conoco was looking for a local partner but the spokesman declined to comment on the matter. That leaves the rest of the field to Polish state firms and small independents with a handful of wells.And industry insiders say it will be at least 12 months before exploratory drilling gathers pace again even at state-run firms such as PGNiG and PKN Orlen as they, like their foreign peers, slash spending to ride out the low oil prices.When drilling does pick up, the pace of activity could hinge on whether the government offers subsidies, the industry sources said.At the start of Poland's hoped-for shale boom, Jakub Kostecki, a 38-year-old entrepreneur, set up his firm, New Gas Contracting, to provide support services to foreign majors clamouring to get in. Now, he has folded his company and relocated to Denver, Colorado.""Most of our customers left,"" said Kostecki of his business in Poland. In a sign of the decline, he said he is now placing Polish specialists with U.S. firms because there is no work for them at home.The numbers illustrate the decline: shale gas licences in Poland have fallen by half in the last two years to 53.Just 10 investors remain in the Polish Exploration and Production Industry Organization, a lobby group that had 23 members in 2013.PKN Orlen, which holds nine shale gas permits, said that all operators had to be cautious in allocating money to shale gas because of trends in energy prices.Investors will also be looking out for a report due from the Polish Geological Institute, probably by mid-year, on the most updated reserves estimates.""If the estimates turn out lower then either some incentives will be needed or only PGNiG and PKN Orlen will remain,"" said a manager at a small shale company, referring to measures including state subsidies.""Shale gas and energy security will still be our priority,"" Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz told a news conference this month, but it remains unclear if subsidies will be offered.

Former OPEC member Indonesia has been hit hard by falling oil production, insufficient gas infrastructure and a series of corruption scandals that led to the downfall of top energy officials.While it is still one of the world's top exporters of natural gas and Southeast Asia's top crude producer, Indonesia is also a major fuel importer, the main driver behind the country's fiscal and current account deficits.

Others with similar approvals include Royal Dutch Shell and pipeline companies Enterprise Products Partners and Plains All American LP. If processed in a stabilizer, which removes natural gas liquids (NGLs) but does not make motor fuels, condensate qualifies as an exportable refined product and can be shipped out without violating the U.S. crude export ban, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. ConocoPhillips has three stabilizers in the condensate-heavy Eagle Ford shale in South Texas with a combined capacity of 135,000 barrels per day. Such stabilizers are common in the Eagle Ford to shave off NGLs so output will meet requirements to move via pipeline.

""While we've ramped down to adjust to current market conditions and lower commodity prices, our intention is to ramp back up with rig count in both those two plays,"" Conoco CEO Ryan Lance told a small group of reporters on a conference call.Those shale projects have higher margins, a shorter cash cycle and provide higher returns, the executive said.

87,"   By Mike Stone  ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is preparing the sale of noncore oil and gas producing acreage in the United States, in the latest sign that oil majors are becoming more accepting of lower oil prices, according to people familiar with the matter.While the world's oil and gas companies have been looking to buy assets on the cheap since oil prices plummeted, epitomized by Royal Dutch Shell Plc's (RDSa.L) agreement earlier this month to buy BG Group Plc BG.L for $70 billion, they have been reluctant to sell assets in case oil prices recover and they can fetch more.ConocoPhillips has hired Wells Fargo (WFC.N) to sell some of its noncore U.S. assets, the people said on Monday. These assets include oil and gas properties in the Rockies, East Texas, South Texas and Northern Louisiana, according to one of the people. While the value of the assets up for sale could not be learned, industry sources said they expected ConocoPhillips to sell between $1 billion and $2.5 billion worth of noncore assets in the United States.The sources asked not to be named because the sale process is confidential. A representative of ConocoPhillips declined to comment on this specific asset sale but said: ""It is common in the energy business for companies to review, readjust and optimize their portfolio from time to time."" A Wells Fargo representative declined to comment.  ConocoPhillips' asset sale would be the largest U.S. acreage sale by a major U.S. oil and gas company so far this year. It follows a 50 percent drop in the price of oil since last June, which halted dozens of similar asset sales.This would be the second asset sale by ConocoPhillips launched this year. Earlier, it retained boutique investment bank Scotia Waterous (BNS.TO) for an asset sale in Canada, according to Scotia Waterous' website.  A couple of other big companies have also started to explore a sale. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) has put a few hundred million dollars worth of East Texas acreage up for sale with Citigroup Inc (C.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Anandarko and Citigroup representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

88,"  (Adds ConocoPhillips CEO quote)By Ernest ScheyderHOUSTON, April 20 Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said on Monday she will introduce legislation this year to allow U.S. crude exports, saying the Obama administration should not dare lift sanctions on Iran before scrapping the U.S. crude export ban.""It's time to lift America's ban on crude oil exports,"" Murkowski said at the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston, the world's largest annual gathering of oil executives.""We shouldn't lift sanctions on Iranian oil while we are keeping restrictions on American oil,"" she said. ""It just doesn't make sense.""The Obama administration has been locked in deep talks for weeks designed to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions, using the easing of sanctions as a bargaining chip. While the final framework of the deal has yet to be determined, it appears it would let Iran export far more crude oil than at present. ""We are one of a very few nations that would limit our own opportunity through our own policy,"" said Murkowski, who became chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in January. ""We're willing to back off sanctions on Iran while keeping sanctions on us.""Murkowski, by linking a domestic policy issue to a foreign policy one, was sending a clear message to Obama that lawmakers from oil states might show more support for a deal with Iran if the U.S. crude export ban ends. Lifting the ban has been a key focus for oil and natural gas producers as well, many of whom long to export shale-derived hydrocarbons globally.""Energy should be traded internationally like any other product,"" Ryan Lance, the chief executive ConocoPhillips, the world's largest independent oil and gas company, said at CERAWeek.Lightly processed super-light oil, known as condensate, can be exported from the United States without violating the U.S crude export ban, though the full ban on shipping extracted crude oil remains intact. Lance said U.S. refiners could not handle all of the condensate produced from shale so it made sense to ship the excess to global markets.Energy economists say that if the export ban were lifted, gasoline prices would fall for all consumers while generating jobs and tax revenue.No timeline has been set to introduce the bill, a Murkowski spokesman said.Murkowski said the bill to lift the ban will be separate from an energy policy bill she is crafting with other senators.

91,"   By Anna Driver  ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the largest independent U.S. energy company, reported sharply lower quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by a steep decline in crude oil prices.Crude prices in the quarter tumbled by about half from a peak over $100 a barrel in June as global supplies grew and demand was dented by slowing economies in places like China. In recent weeks, crude has rebounded to around $60 a barrel.ConocoPhillips, like other exploration and production companies, has slashed capital spending in response to persistently lower oil prices, and is further reducing its rig count for fields in the lower 48 U.S. states.By the end of April, the Houston company's shale rig count will be down to 15 from 32 at the end of 2014, and will be pared to 12 rigs in the second half of the year, said Chief Financial Officer Jeff Sheets. Production is expected to fall in the third and fourth quarters in the company's shale fields, including the Permian in West Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota. But total output was still expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent for the year, Sheets said.Profit in the first quarter slid to $272 million, or 22 cents per share, from $2.1 billion, or $1.71 per share, in the same period a year earlier.Excluding one-time items including a tax benefit, Houston-based ConocoPhillips had a loss of $222 million, or 18 cents per share, near the loss of 19 cents that analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ConocoPhillips said the average price per barrel oil equivalent it received was $36.96, down from $71.21 in the same period a year earlier.

The first oil from the expansion, which will push the project's total capacity to 150,000 bpd, is expected in the third quarter of the year and will ramp up through next year. Surmont's phase 2 is one of several new projects in the oil sands to begin production despite weak oil prices, including Imperial Oil Ltd's recent 40,000 bpd expansion of its Cold Lake oil sands project, which began initial production earlier this year. Output from Canada's oil sands region, the world's third-largest crude reserve, is expected to rise by about 150,000 bpd this year to an average 2.3 million barrels per day, according to industry forecasts.

102,"  (Adds details, background)WARSAW, June 5 ConocoPhillips, the U.S. energy company, said on Friday it has stopped its shale gas exploration in Poland due to unsatisfactory results, leaving the rest of the field to Polish state-run firms.Earlier this year another U.S. energy major Chevron Corp  gave up looking for shale gas in Poland, following the withdrawal of Exxon Mobil, Total and Marathon Oil over the past three years.ConocoPhillips said its subsidiary Lane Energy Poland has invested around $220 million in Poland since 2009. It drilled seven wells over its three Western Baltic concessions.""We understand the disappointment surrounding this difficult decision,"" Tim Wallace, ConocoPhillips country manager in Poland, was quoted as saying in a statement. ""Unfortunately, commercial volumes of natural gas were not encountered."" ConocoPhillips also said it expected a charge related to the Poland withdrawal of approximately $90 million pre-tax, and around $30 million after-tax.Global oil firms were attracted to Poland a few years ago, sharing a belief that eastern Europe's biggest economy would  repeat the shale gas boom seen in the United States. In 2011 Poland's former Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that he expected the first commercial shale gas in 2014, expressing hopes it will help Poland significantly reduce its reliance on gas imports from Russia.A drastic cut in Poland's estimated shale gas reserves marked a first blow in 2012 and a slump in oil prices in the past year proved a second. While exploratory drilling has been done, Poland has not delivered a single commercial well. The only companies that declare further drilling are the state-run gas distributor PGNiG  and the refiner PKN Orlen.(Reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko; Editing by William Hardy)",2015-06-05,COP,"Fri Jun 5, 2015 | 10:57am EDT",UPDATE 1-Conoco the last global oil firm to quit Polish shale gas,http://www.reuters.com//article/conoco-poland-shalegas-idUSL5N0YR2R320150605?type=companyNews

Spokesman Rob Evans said the cuts, which staff were told about on Monday, would take effect in mid-October.""We had previously informed staff that there would be reductions by the end of the year, so yesterday's announcement was meant to add context and clarity to that conversation,"" Evans said.ConocoPhillips, which has oil sands operations as part of its international portfolio, is reducing its global workforce by 10 percent on average because of low oil prices.

134,"  (Repeats with no changes to text)By Tim McLaughlinBOSTON, Sept 30 One-in-four U.S. large-cap mutual funds have increased their stakes in energy companies this year and many have suffered heavier losses than their peers as a result of ill-timed bets.The moves into shares of frackers, refiners and integrated oil conglomerates reflect a gamble that the sector will rebound after rising supply and slowing global growth triggered a nearly 60 percent slide in crude prices since the middle of 2014.But so far, the gambit has not paid off.""We are kind of holding our nose to buy them, but we see value there,"" said Ernesto Ramos, who oversees about $15 billion in large-cap equity assets at BMO Asset Management. ""We've been selling the defensive part of the portfolio exposed negatively to higher interest rates, such as consumer staples and utilities, and making room for what we see as a slow but gradual recovery in world growth.""BMO's Large-Cap Value Fund boosted it energy exposure to 13 percent from 10 percent at the end of February after buying more shares of ExxonMobil Corp and refiner Valero Energy Corp , for example.With oil prices down, ExxonMobil is seen as a defensive play because its refineries and chemicals manufacturing can benefit from lower input costs and offset lower profits from crude production.Shares of Exxon and other oil majors, such as Chevron Corp  and ConocoPhillips are hardly doing any better than the S&P 500 Energy Index, which is down 25 percent this year.Exxon shares are off 21 percent, while Chevron and Conoco are down 32 percent and 34 percent, respectively, reflecting expectations that the global crude supply glut will persist, ultimately weighing on their returns. A Reuters analysis of 265 actively managed large-cap funds with at least $500 million in assets and combined assets of about $1.8 trillion, revealed that 25 percent of them increased their energy sector bets this year.That overall group of funds produced an average return of minus 7.17 percent so far this year, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company. And three-quarters of the funds that increased  their exposure to energy performed worse than the overall average. (Graphic: link.reuters.com/mug75w)INVESTOR PULLOUT Investors have not been pleased with the shift, pulling nearly $27 billion from funds that increased exposure to energy, according to Lipper data. Those which did not, saw about the same amount of net investor withdrawals, but over a larger number of funds with nearly five times more in assets, Lipper data shows. BMO's Ramos said managers and investors have to remain patient with their energy picks.""We think we will eventually be rewarded with these stocks,"" he said.The $2 billion Ridgeworth Large Cap Value Equity Fund  made among the biggest bets on the energy sector among its peers earlier this year, raising its exposure to 14 percent at the end of August from 6.7 percent at the end of February, according to Lipper. The fund nearly doubled its stake in ConocoPhillips and bought more shares in EOG Resources, Hess Corp and Noble Energy Inc, disclosures show.All of those stocks are down at least 19 percent over the past three months, badly underperforming broad benchmarks. The Ridgeworth fund's year-to-date total return of minus 13 percent is worse than 88 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Mills Riddick, manager of the fund, declined to comment for this story.Other portfolio managers who bet big on some energy stocks, thinking they found bottom, or somewhere near it, have been sorely disappointed, too.Take the $68 billion Investment Company of America fund , which bought nearly 23 million shares of former shale oil boom star Chesapeake Energy Corp during the first half of the year. That represented just 0.50 percent of the fund's assets, but still hurt as Chesapeake shares dropped 43 percent during that time. Chesapeake stock has fallen 70 percent since November, and 39 percent since June, to below $7 a share.The fund, run by Capital Group's American Funds, declined to comment, saying as a matter of policy the company does not discuss individual holdings. The fund's year-to-date total return of minus 8.90 percent is worse than that of 66 percent of peers, according to Lipper. The fund is not alone as many other managers have made bets on the belief that the slump in oil prices would be short-lived.By contrast, large-cap portfolio managers that did not get caught up in the shale oil boom and remained skeptical about crude recovery delivered positive returns for their investors, according to the analysis.Sonu Kalra, manager of the $20 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund, has kept his portfolio's exposure to energy below 2 percent of assets.His fund's year-to-date total return of minus 2.85 percent is better than that of 73 percent of its peers. This year he has eliminated positions in oil refiner Hess and oilfield services provider Halliburton Co while hunting for more information technology stocks.He said what a portfolio manager chooses to avoid can often be as important as what to own.""It has been that type of year.""

135,"  * Origin to offer 4-for-7 shares at 34 pct discount* To cut dividend, capital spending and sell some assets* Shares have slumped to nine-year low* Australia Pacific LNG still seen profitable   (Adds CEO, analyst comments)By Sonali PaulMELBOURNE, Sept 30 Australia's Origin Energy  has asked its shareholders for $1.8 billion to help cut debt as weak oil prices have dented the outlook for its huge liquefied natural gas project.The move by Australia's largest gas and power retailer comes after mining and trading giant Glencore Plc was forced to sell new shares, suspend its dividend and flag asset sales to cut its $30 billion debt pile amid a broad slump in commodities, and after Origin's rival Santos put its assets on the block. Origin is turning to shareholders to raise money after its shares sank to a nine-year low, down nearly 30 percent over the past month, as investors feared it would not be able to service its A$10.3 billion ($7.2 billion) in net debt.It had banked on doing so with revenue from its A$25 billion Australia Pacific LNG project (APLNG).""The broader market has made very clear that the combination of (oil) price volatility and the levels of debt we have in our business are a deterrent to investors investing in the company, and we must fix that,"" Chief Executive Grant King told reporters on Wednesday. Investors pressured Origin to beef up its balance sheet  just as APLNG is set to start producing, with its oil-linked LNG revenue hit by the slump in world oil prices to their lowest since 2009.Origin's King had said in August there was no need to issue equity after the company sold its stake in New Zealand's Contact Energy and cut debt.""They've been pushed into this position as a result of the continued weakness in the oil price. Following a significant share price fall, it's far from an ideal situation,"" said Gareth James, an analyst at Morningstar in Sydney.

136,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON, Sept 30  BOSTON, Sept 30 One-in-four U.S. large-cap mutual funds have increased their stakes in energy companies this year and many have suffered heavier losses than their peers as a result of ill-timed bets.The moves into shares of frackers, refiners and integrated oil conglomerates reflect a gamble that the sector will rebound after rising supply and slowing global growth triggered a nearly 60 percent slide in crude prices since the middle of 2014.But so far, the gambit has not paid off.""We are kind of holding our nose to buy them, but we see value there,"" said Ernesto Ramos, who oversees about $15 billion in large-cap equity assets at BMO Asset Management. ""We've been selling the defensive part of the portfolio exposed negatively to higher interest rates, such as consumer staples and utilities, and making room for what we see as a slow but gradual recovery in world growth.""BMO's Large-Cap Value Fund boosted it energy exposure to 13 percent from 10 percent at the end of February after buying more shares of ExxonMobil Corp and refiner Valero Energy Corp , for example.With oil prices down, ExxonMobil is seen as a defensive play because its refineries and chemicals manufacturing can benefit from lower input costs and offset lower profits from crude production.Shares of Exxon and other oil majors, such as Chevron Corp  and ConocoPhillips are hardly doing any better than the S&P 500 Energy Index, which is down 25 percent this year.Exxon shares are off 21 percent, while Chevron and Conoco are down 32 percent and 34 percent, respectively, reflecting expectations that the global crude supply glut will persist, ultimately weighing on their returns.A Reuters analysis of 265 actively managed large-cap funds with at least $500 million in assets and combined assets of about $1.8 trillion, revealed that 25 percent of them increased their energy sector bets this year. That overall group of funds produced an average return of minus 7.17 percent so far this year, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company. And three-quarters of the funds that increased  their exposure to energy performed worse than the overall average. (Graphic: link.reuters.com/mug75w)INVESTOR PULLOUT Investors have not been pleased with the shift, pulling nearly $27 billion from funds that increased exposure to energy, according to Lipper data. Those which did not, saw about the same amount of net investor withdrawals, but over a larger number of funds with nearly five times more in assets, Lipper data shows. BMO's Ramos said managers and investors have to remain patient with their energy picks.""We think we will eventually be rewarded with these stocks,"" he said.The $2 billion Ridgeworth Large Cap Value Equity Fund  made among the biggest bets on the energy sector among its peers earlier this year, raising its exposure to 14 percent at the end of August from 6.7 percent at the end of February, according to Lipper. The fund nearly doubled its stake in ConocoPhillips and bought more shares in EOG Resources, Hess Corp and Noble Energy Inc, disclosures show.All of those stocks are down at least 19 percent over the past three months, badly underperforming broad benchmarks.The Ridgeworth fund's year-to-date total return of minus 13 percent is worse than 88 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Mills Riddick, manager of the fund, declined to comment for this story. Other portfolio managers who bet big on some energy stocks, thinking they found bottom, or somewhere near it, have been sorely disappointed, too.Take the $68 billion Investment Company of America fund , which bought nearly 23 million shares of former shale oil boom star Chesapeake Energy Corp during the first half of the year. That represented just 0.50 percent of the fund's assets, but still hurt as Chesapeake shares dropped 43 percent during that time. Chesapeake stock has fallen 70 percent since November, and 39 percent since June, to below $7 a share.The fund, run by Capital Group's American Funds, declined to comment, saying as a matter of policy the company does not discuss individual holdings. The fund's year-to-date total return of minus 8.90 percent is worse than that of 66 percent of peers, according to Lipper. The fund is not alone as many other managers have made bets on the belief that the slump in oil prices would be short-lived.By contrast, large-cap portfolio managers that did not get caught up in the shale oil boom and remained skeptical about crude recovery delivered positive returns for their investors, according to the analysis.Sonu Kalra, manager of the $20 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund, has kept his portfolio's exposure to energy below 2 percent of assets.His fund's year-to-date total return of minus 2.85 percent is better than that of 73 percent of its peers. This year he has eliminated positions in oil refiner Hess and oilfield services provider Halliburton Co while hunting for more information technology stocks.He said what a portfolio manager chooses to avoid can often be as important as what to own.""It has been that type of year.""

162,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By Clyde RussellLAUNCESTON, Australia Jan 18 - In contrast to the carnage in crude oil markets, liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices in Asia have enjoyed relative stability for the past three months, but it's unlikely the calm will persist much longer.Spot Asian LNG prices LNG-AS ended last week at $5.60 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), about 28 percent below the recent peak of $7.80 reached on Nov. 22.In contrast, Brent crude oil has dropped 46 percent from its recent peak in early October to trade currently around $28.55 a barrel.The relative outperformance of spot LNG holds over the longer term as well, with the price of the super-chilled fuel having dropped 68 percent since its all-time high of $20.50 per mmBtu in February 2014.Brent has declined by 75 percent since its 2014 closing peak of $115.06 a barrel, reached on June 19 of that year.While both markets would appear to suffer from excess supply and less than stellar demand growth, what appears to be happening is that LNG is currently trading with a lag to crude.The reasons for the decline in oil appear well understood by the market, even if the current drop below $30 a barrel is viewed as unsustainable for an extended period given the amount of global production that will be loss-making.Oil markets have been oversupplied since the decision by top exporter Saudi Arabia not to balance the market by cutting output, but rather to let low prices eventually drive out higher-cost producers. The return of at least 500,000 barrels per day of Iranian crude in the short term after the lifting of Western sanctions is also putting a dampener on oil prices.But the outlook for LNG in 2016 looks just as bad, if not worse, than that for crude.The oversupply in LNG, particularly in the Asian region, is set to increase dramatically in the next few months as new projects in Australia ramp up.The 9 million tonnes-a-year Australian Pacific LNG project, co-owned by ConocoPhillips and Origin Energy, shipped its first cargo on Jan. 9, becoming the third coal-seam gas to LNG plant to start operating in Australia's Queensland state in the past year. On the other side of Australia, Chevron said it's on track to export its first cargo early this year from the 15.6 million tonnes-a-year Gorgon venture, the world's most expensive LNG project with an estimated cost of $54 billion.And it's not just Australia that's flooding the market with new LNG, shipments from the United States are coming in the next few months as well.U.S. SHIPMENTS DELAYED, STILL COMING While the first cargoes from the lower 48 states have been delayed, the point is that by late February or early March it's likely that Cheniere Energy Partners will join the global LNG supply boom with exports from the first train of six planned at its Sabine Pass project. While Sabine Pass is the only U.S. LNG plant scheduled to start this year, four more are currently under construction.Australia also has two more conventional LNG projects under construction, which are due to start output later this year, and  Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude floating LNG project, which is slated to start operating next year.In total, the new Australian projects started in the past 12 months and those expected to commence shipments in the next 12 to 18 months will add 61.8 million tonnes of capacity, while plants under construction in the United States could add 72 million tonnes by 2020.The demand for LNG looks certain to be unable to keep up with the additional supply coming, meaning that prices will likely have to fall to incentivise coal-to-gas switching in top Asian consumers Japan, South Korea and China, as well as in Europe.Global demand will grow by 23 million tonnes in 2016, according to consultancy Energy Aspects, but only 7.1 million tonnes of this will be in Asia.If this is the case, it's logical to expect that the flood of Australian LNG will force spot Asian prices lower, as well as displacing Qatari LNG cargoes from the region.This means more Qatari shipments will likely head to Europe, competing with the nascent cargoes from the U.S. Gulf coast.Overall, it appears likely that LNG's period of calm relative to oil is poised to end, and spot prices should decline to at least match the plunge in crude, or perhaps even exceed it, especially as the lower-demand shoulder season starts with the end of the northern winter around March.

170,"  (Corrects to change that Western Australia royalty payments were deferred and not waived in 25th paragraph.)By Clyde RussellLAUNCESTON, Australia Feb 10 - When the going gets tough, the tough ask for tax relief. If you are looking for a sign that the end game of the commodity downturn is getting closer, witness the clamour for more support from Australia's embattled resources sector.Asking for government help is one of the last steps a mining company can take to stay alive, assuming it's already exhausted every conceivable cost saving, emptied the pockets of its owners and reached the limits of what its bankers will lend.The latest call came this week from the Queensland Resources Council (QRC), which said the coal mining industry needs support to keep the remaining 60,000 workers employed, following the loss of 21,000 jobs in the past two years.""We are not looking for bailouts or subsidies but our entire sector needs certainty and support in the shape of commitments to reduce red tape and unjustified government-imposed and government-sanctioned costs,"" QRC Chief Executive Michael Roche said in a Feb. 8 statement.""At the top of our list are royalties, local government rates and the charges from government and private sector providers of rail, port, power and water services,"" he said.The preceding two paragraphs from the statement illustrate the problem facing the resources sector, insofar as they don't want to be seen to be asking for government handouts, although in effect that's exactly what they want.Asking for relief from royalty payments, other government charges and for lower costs at government-owned facilities is a de facto request to receive what could broadly be termed as a handout.It may well be the case, especially for smaller and higher-cost coal mines, that more jobs will be lost and pits closed if such relief isn't forthcoming, as Roche warns.But governments also find themselves in a bind, facing ever-rising demands for more spending on health and other services while seeing the revenue they expected from the resources boom evaporate in the face of low commodity prices.The Queensland state government wrote down the expected revenue from coal-mining royalties over the next four years by almost A$3 billion ($2.11 billion) in its budget last year. This means it's extremely unlikely to want to lower royalty payments, or the amount state-controlled corporations charge for using railways and ports.Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is willing to discuss the issues with the QRC, but won't hand out cash to mining companies, the Brisbane-based Courier Mail reported on Wednesday.""As I said very clearly, my Government is not in the business of giving money to private enterprise,"" the newspaper quoted her as saying.This is a consistent message from Palaszczuk, who earlier this year refused to provide financial guarantees to Queensland Nickel, the refining operation owned by flamboyant miner turned politician Clive Palmer that was placed in voluntary administration last month.It is sensible policy for the Queensland state government to decline to subsidise struggling resource companies, even if this will come at the cost of mine closures and job losses.For politicians in democracies it's a brave decision to risk job losses and subsequent voter displeasure, even in pursuit of sustainable longer-term industries. For the QRC, there is nothing wrong with lobbying hard in the interests of your members, even if the wider interest of all of them would actually be better served by the collapse of the weakest.It still seems that many in the resources industry haven't yet grasped that the inevitable consequence of massively overbuilding supply is the failure of the shakiest companies.LNG, IRON ORE ALSO SEEK RELIEF Queensland, which produces the vast majority of Australia's coking coal and is also home to three new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, will be better served in the longer term by the closure of unprofitable operations, rather than seeing them cling on through royalty and other government relief.Just like coal, the LNG plants are also facing the reality of huge oversupply, and have started the process of seeking relief, albeit in a somewhat different manner. APLNG, the facility owned by Origin Energy Energy  and ConocoPhillips, is asking the state Supreme Court to set aside the Queensland government's royalty calculations, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review on Feb. 8.Even if the legal challenge fails, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to expect the LNG industry to also seek other forms of relief, especially if prices and demand in Asia remain soft.But the problems of government support can be seen across the country in Western Australia, home to the world's biggest iron ore mining industry.There the state government decided last year to defer 50 percent of royalty payments from smaller mines that were actively trying to restructure their operations.This provided a lifeline to minnows such as BC Iron , but at the same time kept supply in the market that should have been closed down.Iron ore is probably one of the most over-supplied commodities currently, and with the softening outlook for Chinese steel demand is likely to remain that way.The question for governments is whether assistance in any form is actually a help or a hindrance to efforts to re-balance commodity markets.The faster markets can re-balance, the faster the relief of higher prices can be felt by the survivors.Ultimately, a smaller but more sustainable resources sector is better than weak companies struggling along, propped up by the public purse.($1 = 1.4190 Australian dollars)   (Editing by Christian Schmollinger)",2016-02-11,COP,"Thu Feb 11, 2016 | 12:03am EST",CORRECTED-RPT-COLUMN-Australia's tough miners want government help; shouldn't get it: Russell,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-russell-commodities-tax-columnrep-idUSL3N15P0UT?type=companyNews

174,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK After several false starts over the last two years, U.S. fund managers are betting that energy stocks have finally hit bottom. Firms including T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and American Funds have been adding shares of exploration and production companies that they say have the most to gain from oil prices stabilizing. The price of oil fell from $115 a barrel to $27.88 between June 2014 and January of this year, yet is up more than 50 percent since hitting its low. The number of funds buying shares of ConocoPhillips jumped 144 percent over the last three months compared with the previous quarter, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar. Occidental Petroleum Corp, meanwhile, had a 110 percent increase in new owners.""The E&P companies have taken the brunt of the pain that I think they will see in their business, so they will go into recovery faster and first,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood who has been adding to his exposure of the sector. Some companies in the sector, such as Marathon Oil Corp and Devon Energy Corp have plugged holes in their balance sheets by selling assets and offering additional equity shares to investors, he said, allowing them to withstand a prolonged era of relatively low oil prices.  The rush of fund managers to buy exploration and production companies after several quarters of shedding them is one reason why the sector is up 9 percent for the year to date, outpacing both the 6.3 percent gain for energy stocks as a whole and the 1.8 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor's 500. Overall, energy stocks remain the most underweight sector among fund mangers, with the average large cap fund holding approximately 1 percent less of its portfolio in the sector than its weight in the benchmark index, according to Lipper data.Fund managers say that they are buying exploration and production companies in part because they expect the oil glut to dwindle this year as production halts begin to take effect, setting up for a rally in revenue and earnings in 2017. ""If you stop being negative on energy, you don't want to buy a safe energy play, you want to buy a levered play,"" said Ernesto Ramos, a portfolio manager at BMO Asset Management Company, referring to EOG Resources, whose revenues are closely tied to oil prices. Shares of the company are up 6.7 percent for the year to date, roughly half of the 14.6 percent increase in oil over the same time. Overall, earnings among energy companies in the S&P 500 are expected to fall 66.5 percent in 2016, before gaining 203.1 percent in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The prospects of a revenue and earnings rebound over the next two years is attracting growth-focused fund managers who have typically shied away from the energy sector. Mike Pytosh, portfolio manager of the Voya MidCap Opportunities fund, said that he shifted his energy exposure during the January and February sell-off from refineries to exploration and production companies that were the hardest hit. ""It certainly got to a point where it was oversold. You have to not look at where the expectations are now, but where these companies will be a year or two out,"" he said.

The company, like many of its peers, has had to grapple with shrinking margins resulting from low oil prices. It has slashed its dividend, cut staff and curbed the drilling of new wells, all while trying to preserve growth options should crude prices recover.Oil prices touched a low of $27.10 per barrel during the first quarter before recovering to close at $39.60 at end of March.Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance, trying to balance both approaches, said he would continue to curb costs while also trying to generate strong returns.""As challenging as this price downturn has been, we are a much stronger company for the long term,"" Lance said in a statement.Conoco reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.5 billion, or $1.18 per share, compared with a profit of $272 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.

The Houston-based company cut its forecast for capital spending in 2016 to $5.7 billion from $6.4 billion, just two months after reducing it and slashing its dividend by 25 percent.

""We're spread out along the world so there's no one individual marker that dominates our revenue flow in the company,"" he said. ""To get real protection that some of the smaller players do on the hedging practice is not as practical in a company of our size.""

182,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A New York energy investor has been indicted for engaging in a multiyear scheme to evade paying over $45 million in taxes in connection with the sale of an oil company and the purchase of paintings by European artists, U.S. prosecutors said on Monday.Morris Zukerman, a former Morgan Stanley banker who serves as chairman of investment firm M.E. Zukerman & Co, pleaded not guilty at a hearing in federal court in Manhattan to charges that included tax evasion and wire fraud.The charges followed a two-year grand jury investigation, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stanley Okula said in court. Both Okula and a lawyer for Zukerman, James Bruton, said he is in plea talks.""Hopefully, we'll be able to resolve this with the government to make things right and resolve things for Mr. Zukerman,"" Bruton said following the hearing, where his client's bail was set at $2.5 million. Zukerman, 71, worked at Morgan Stanley from 1972 to 1988 and served as joint head of the investment bank's energy group, according to his company's website.In 1988, he launched M.E. Zukerman & Co, which, according to its website, concentrated its investments in energy, natural resources and agriculture companies.Prosecutors said Zukerman schemed to evade paying taxes on income earned on a 2008 sale of an oil company he co-owned through an M.E. Zukerman subsidiary with a publicly traded company that resulted in his firm receiving $130 million. While the company was not named in court papers, around that same time his company sold a Texas-based firm called Penreco that was co-owned with ConocoPhillips.Prosecutors said Zukerman transferred the sale's proceeds to a trust and various corporations, including one from which he directed $50 million be used to buy paintings by European artists from the 15th through the 19th centuries. In buying those paintings, which were used to decorate his Manhattan apartment and two family members' apartments, Zukerman further sought to avoid over $4.5 million in New York state taxes owed on their purchases, prosecutors said.He also schemed to avoid paying New York taxes on a $645,000 pair of diamond earrings, prosecutors said.Zukerman also made $1 million in fraudulent deductions for charitable contributions related to buying property on Black Island off the coast of Maine, and orchestrated fraudulent investment interest expense deductions, prosecutors said.The case is U.S. v.

Zukerman subsidiary with a publicly traded company that resulted in his firm receiving $130 million.While the company was not named in court papers, around that same time his company sold a Texas-based firm called Penreco that was co-owned with ConocoPhillips. Prosecutors said Zukerman transferred the sale's proceeds to a trust and various corporations, including one from which he directed $50 million be used to buy paintings by European artists from the 15th through the 19th centuries.In buying those paintings, which were used to decorate his Manhattan apartment and two family members' apartments, Zukerman further sought to avoid over $4.5 million in New York state taxes owed on their purchases, prosecutors said. He also schemed to avoid paying New York taxes on a $645,000 pair of diamond earrings, prosecutors said.Zukerman also made $1 million in fraudulent deductions for charitable contributions related to buying property on Black Island off the coast of Maine, and orchestrated fraudulent investment interest expense deductions, prosecutors said.The case is U.S. v.

186,"   By Eric M. Johnson and Nia Williams | CALGARY, Alberta  CALGARY, Alberta ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has 25 percent of wells activated at its 60,000 barrels per day Surmont oil sands project, which had been shut down as a precaution due to a massive wildfire in northern Alberta, a company executive said on Tuesday.Conoco, the largest U.S. independent oil company, restarted production last week after a 29-day shutdown at its thermal project some 63 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of the fire-stricken town of Fort McMurray. First production started flowing on Friday.The blaze shuttered more than a million barrels per day of crude production in the oil sands region, the world's third-largest crude reserve, though most producers are now in the process of ramping up.""We have about 25 percent of the wells done,"" Perry Berkenpas, senior vice president oil sands, said in an interview at the company's offices in Calgary. Conoco said 39 of 156 wells are back on line. ""What we've been able to do is keep within safe operating windows and still ramp-up the production more aggressively than we originally planned,"" he said.While he declined to provide a specific timeline for when the site would reach full pre-fire production levels, Berkenpas said it would ""probably not"" be by early July.Even so, Berkenpas said the company is ""absolutely on track"" to reach a capacity of 150,000 bpd gross by the end of 2017. The joint venture between Conoco and Total E&P Canada was producing roughly 60,000 bpd before the fire, or 30,000 bpd net for Conoco alone. Earlier on Tuesday the company said there was very minor damage at Surmont and the majority of its nearly 700 employees were expected on-site by the end of this week. It said it found ""very minor damage"" with no impact to on-going operations.Thermal operations means that steam is injected into the oil sands reservoir, slowly liquefying the tarry bitumen deposits so they can flow to the surface. In general, the length of time operations are halted and the maturity of the reservoir are crucial for determining how difficult and costly a restart process is. Berkenpas said generally they are finding that the pressures and temperatures either match what they thought they would be, or in some cases were better.""During the startup we found that we have a couple of different wellbore designs (the wells and internal equipment) and some of those designs seem more robust than others and allow us to do the startup and ramp-up a little bit faster than some of the previous designs,"" he said.

220,"   By Paul Kilby and Davide Scigliuzzo  WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (IFR) - The fate of a debt swap from PDVSA was thrown in doubt on Friday after the Venezuelan oil company extended the deadline for the transaction and ConocoPhillips sued over the use of Citgo shares as collateral.PDVSA bonds suffered a multiple point drop as investors expressed concern that a failure to extend maturities on short-term debt would bring the state-owned company closer to a restructuring.""We could be back to square one with an intense redemption calendar that makes it hard for PDVSA to cover,"" an investor attending the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington told IFR.Intensifying the focus on the troubled oil exporting nation, Venezuela's central bank head Nelson Merentes was scheduled to attend a small gathering with investors organized by Deutsche Bank on Friday afternoon.Venezuelan bonds opened several points lower on Friday, with the 2017 notes initially down five to six points and the rest of the curve opening three to four points weaker, according to one trader.They later clawed back roughly half of their intraday losses on the expectation that PDVSA may have to improve the terms of the offer for the second time since the exchange was launched on September 16. PDVSA's decision on Thursday to extend the early tender deadline of the swap to October 12 suggested to many that the company had received an underwhelming response to its offer, which targets US$7.1bn of bonds maturing in 2017.""As of the prior early tender deadline, substantially less than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the existing notes have been tendered,"" the company said Thursday.PDVSA sweetened the transaction last month when it offered more new 2020 bonds backed by shares of its US oil unit Citgo in exchange for bonds maturing in 2017. The new terms were largely viewed as net present value (NPV) positive, but some investors preferred to hold existing bonds to benefit from the initial secondary pop on news of improved terms and the prospects of getting paid at maturity.""We are going to be free-riders,"" said a second investor at the IMF meeting, who noted that his Venezuelan holdings were his second-largest contributor to performance this year.But gains were reduced by the sell-off Friday sparked by the extended deadline and a lawsuit filed by oil producer ConocoPhillips against PDVSA in a Delaware court the day before. ""This could be a bargaining tactic to dissuade some of the free-riders,"" said Sean Newman, a senior portfolio manager at Invesco.In the complaint, ConocoPhillips said PDVSA's pledge of equity in Citgo as collateral for the bond swap was part of a fraudulent scheme to prevent Conoco from collecting compensation in an ongoing dispute with the Venezuelan government.The news was seen further complicating the swap and exacerbated worries about the sovereign, which already faces several arbitration claims from foreign companies.""It has become very complex legally,"" the first investor said.Others think that the latest claim from ConocoPhillips won't necessarily sabotage the exchange.""This is not the first time that this kind of suit has been made,"" said Newman. ""Whether or not it can stop the exchange, it is hard to say.""

221,"   By Brian Ellsworth and Alexandra Ulmer  Subsidiaries of U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips have sued Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA in Delaware, according to a court filing, accusing it of fraudulent operations involving its U.S. subsidiary Citgo. ConocoPhillips said in an Oct. 6 filing PDVSA operations, including an ongoing bond swap that uses shares in Citgo Holding Inc as collateral, are part of an effort to prevent Conoco from collecting compensation in a dispute over a 2007 nationalization of its Venezuela holdings.ConocoPhillips has for nearly a decade been pursuing a case against Venezuela in a World Bank tribunal to obtain billions of dollars in compensation for the 2007 takeover of its Venezuela assets by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. The tribunal known as ICSID in a partial ruling in 2013 said that takeover was illegal.  The U.S. company cited numerous operations involving Citgo, including an attempt to sell it in 2014, a debt offering that financed dividend payments to PDVSA, and most recently a bond swap operation that uses Citgo Holding as collateral. ""The purpose behind each of these transfers is the same: to remove assets from the United States to Venezuela and/or to encumber assets in the United States, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud PDVSA's and Venezuela's arbitration award creditors, including ConocoPhillips,"" it said in the document. ConocoPhillips says Venezuela has also sought to protect its assets from being seized in any of some 20 arbitration cases filed by companies ranging from U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil to small Canadian mining company Crystallex.  PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] said in a statement on Friday that the bond swap was ""perfectly legal"" and that the lawsuit did not have any legal basis. ""These claims are one more instance of manipulation by ConocoPhillips,"" the Caracas-based company said in a statement, adding that operations would continue as planned.  A court decision will likely take several weeks, said Carlos Bellorin, petroleum analyst at IHS.  ""Before taking any additional steps the tribunal has to weigh the merits of the case and if Conoco's claims are sufficiently strong,"" said Bellorin. PDVSA's bonds dropped sharply on Friday after it postponed a deadline for offering to swap debt due to low participation, signaling that investor reluctance could scuttle the operation, and following news of Conoco's suit.
