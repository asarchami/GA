0,"  Feb 6 Noble Energy Corp said on Thursday it has finalized an agreement to sell part of its interest in a massive Israeli natural gas project to Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd for $1.03 billion in cash and future revenues.Noble Energy is developing the field, which is estimated to hold about 19 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, with Delek Group, Avner Oil Exploration and Ratio Oil Exploration.Each of the partners are selling 25 percent of their respective stakes to Woodside. The group wanted Woodside's expertise in developing liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects as well an additional investor.Noble Energy will receive $390 million when the deal closes later this year and an additional $135 million when a decision is made on an LNG facility or export contracts exceed a predetermined limit. The company, which will retain the largest stake in the Leviathan project at 30 percent once the deal closes, will also receive $502 million in shared future revenues from Woodside. The deal was first announced in late 2012, though negotiations dragged on for more than a year while Israel's supreme court debated whether to allow natural gas exports and while other studies on the field's total potential were completed.The Israeli high court ultimately allowed natural gas exports of up to 40 percent of produced natural gas.",2014-02-06,NBL,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 6:02pm EST",Noble Energy sells Israel gas project stake to Australia's Woodside,http://www.reuters.com//article/nobleenergy-israel-idUSL2N0LB26020140206?type=companyNews
1,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Oil and natural gas producer Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) surprised Wall Street on Thursday with a weak production forecast and a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as its costs spiked.The report comes as Noble Energy, like many of its peers, spends heavily to find more oil and natural gas to satisfy Wall Street's demands for constant reserve growth. Energy resources are becoming increasingly hard to find, a difficulty that is prompting spending that would have been considered astronomical a decade ago.Noble Energy, for instance, spent $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter on capital projects, ending the year with reserves 19 percent higher than 2012.Despite the new reserves, Noble Energy expects to produce 280,000 to 288,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) this quarter. That is less than it produced in the fourth quarter and far below analysts' expectations of at least 300,000 boe/d in the first quarter.The company said weather was why results were out of whack. A rare December snowstorm in Israel, where the company has begun supplying natural gas for heating and electricity generation, sharply boosted demand. The first-quarter production forecast reflects a leveling out of demand, Chief Executive Charles Davidson said on a conference call with investors.""The first quarter is really right on track with where we expected and right on track to deliver the growth rate that we've laid out this year,"" Davidson said. For the fourth quarter, Noble Energy reported net income of $134 million, or 37 cents per share, compared with $251 million, or 70 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Excluding hedging losses and other one-time items, the company earned 50 cents per share, compared with the 60 cents expected, on average, by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales rose 16 percent to 293,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), exceeding the company's previously announced forecast for the quarter. Almost half of the sales were in crude oil, with the rest in natural gas.Operating expenses, including the cost of finding, transporting and storing oil and natural gas, increased 22 percent from the same quarter in 2012.The increase was starkest in exploration expenses, which more than doubled. The company's production taxes rose 31 percent, also surprising Wall Street analysts. Noble has identified giant natural gas fields off the coast of Israel as one of its most promising developments, but the cost to develop them and other areas will be high.The company is also growing rapidly in the Marcellus and Denver-Julesburg shale basins in the United States.Noble Energy's shares were up 0.3 percent at $62.24 in mid-day trading on Thursday.

6,"   By Ernest Scheyder | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) slashed the risks to its colossal Israeli natural gas project by selling a stake to Australia's largest oil producer and sealing a crucial supply deal with a Palestinian power company in one of the world's political flash points.Both steps, carefully choreographed over the past month, should help Noble achieve its goal of doubling production by 2018 and mitigate Wall Street's fears about the company's prospects in the politically unstable region.In a deal worth $2.55 billion in cash and future revenue, Australia's Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) agreed last week to help Houston-based Noble Energy and three Israeli companies develop the offshore natural gas field Leviathan. The field, along with smaller ones nearby, holds nearly 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the same amount consumed each year in the United States.The deal came a month after the Noble Energy consortium signed a $1.2 billion contract to begin supplying natural gas to the Palestine Power Generation Co. in a couple of years.The group is already shipping gas to Israel from a small field near Leviathan, meaning Israel and the Palestinian Authority will both rely on the same source for natural gas.Woodside's experience in liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects will help regional exports begin sooner. Selling to a broad range of neighboring countries should reduce the project's appeal as a target for attacks, security analysts say.Regionally, Jordan, Turkey and Egypt are hungry for natural gas supply and could be future buyers, analysts say.In a sign of how vital the natural gas is to Israel, its military patrols the seas above the deposits to defend against any potential attacks.Despite turmoil in nearby Egypt and Syria, as well as roller-coaster negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Noble insists it's not naive about operating in the region. The company decided potential risks of developing the fields amid the geopolitical turmoil were acceptable considering the probable rewards, said a well-placed source who declined to be named, citing a policy of not speaking to the media.""When you think of Middle East conflicts, Israel really is in the best place in terms of risk,"" said the same source, who is close to the company's board of directors.Noble will remain the project's operator after the Woodside deal closes later this year, holding 30 percent to Woodside's 25 percent. The other three partners - Delek Group (DLEKG.TA), Avner Oil & Gas Exploration (AVNRp.TA), and Ratio Oil Exploration (RATIp.TA) - will each hold less than 17 percent.For Noble, the enormous offshore project in foreign waters is one it must undertake, analysts and investors say, if it hopes to replenish declining reserves faster than fellow rivals such as independent energy producers Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N), Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), and Apache Corp (APA.N).Noble first began operating off Israel's coast in 1998, but it was not until 2010 that Leviathan was discovered. The company recently said there could be large oil deposits near the formation as well. The cost to produce natural gas in the Mediterranean is only slightly less than market prices in much of Europe right now, suggesting that Asia - where prices are double Middle Eastern production costs - could be an attractive export opportunity.That global export potential helped lure Noble and its partners to Woodside in the first place, given the Australian company's LNG expertise.Indeed, Noble Energy Chief Executive Chuck Davidson flew to Perth last month to negotiate with Woodside, which agreed tentatively to the deal in late 2012, then cooled to the idea when it was unclear whether Israel would allow LNG exports.Noble and its development partners fought aggressively for the right to export 40 percent of the natural gas in Leviathan and nearby fields, winning that right late last year in a decision from Israel's supreme court.""You knew that Israel would be pragmatic about negotiations with Noble Energy on this,"" said Tim Rezvan, an energy analyst at Sterne Agee. ""Leviathan is too important for the country as it works to produce more energy locally."" Expectations are high on Wall Street, where Noble Energy's shares have sagged in the past three months amid a dip in the price of crude oil and rising production costs. At current estimates, Leviathan is expected to begin operations in 2017.""Assuming the project comes online, it'll be a big part of the pie at Noble Energy,"" said Rezvan.To be sure, Noble is still investing aggressively in its United States onshore shale operations, planning to spend 70 percent of its $4.8 billion capital budget this year on projects in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Pennsylvania Marcellus formation.But it's spending the remainder of that budget on deepwater projects in the Mediterranean and elsewhere, and hopes to use cash flow, not debt, to finance future Israeli expansion.""The continued demand for our gas in both Israel and other regional areas combined with the potential for multiple LNG or FLNG solutions sets us up for some dramatic growth in this region over the next decade or longer,"" David Stover, Noble Energy's president, told investors early last week.A rare snowstorm in Jerusalem in December sharply increased natural gas demand, giving investors a hint of the project's longer-term potential. Many Israeli power plants had to temporarily switch from coal to natural gas to produce power.That storm helped Noble Energy's fourth-quarter sales volumes jump 16 percent.""This whole region has a lot of potential due in part to the size of these energy reserves,"" said Emre Tuncalp of Sidar Global Advisors, a geopolitical risk advisory firm that specializes in energy matters. ""Given all the components that need to come together to develop this area, I think it's moving forward pretty well.""(Editing by Terry Wade and Bernadette Baum)",2014-02-10,NBL,"Mon Feb 10, 2014 | 2:48pm EST",Analysis: Israeli natural gas fields hold big promise for Noble Energy,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nobleenergy-israel-idUSBREA191SC20140210?type=companyNews

The three were Noble Energy Inc , Cobalt International Energy Inc and a company called Elenilto. Gabon awarded 13 oil and gas blocks to 11 companies in October 2013 as part of a major deepwater licensing round, which the central African country hopes will double its output to 500,000 barrels per day.In a decision which surprised some industry participants at the time, existing producers Total and Royal Dutch Shell did not appear on the list. Ngoubou said Total had been invited for negotiations, without giving any details. ""Total has been called in for discussions with the body in charge of negotiations,"" he said. The other companies awarded blocks in October were Ophir Energy, Eni, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Perenco, Repsol, Petronas and Impact.The bidding round, which has been delayed for three years, offers a chance for the former OPEC member to reverse a decline in production from a peak of about 370,000 bpd in the 1990s.Some geologists think offshore west Africa may contain deepwater reserves beneath a layer of salt on the ocean bed comparable to those found offshore Brazil.

21,"  * Leviathan partners to focus on gas exports by pipeline* Woodside open to future talks on different terms* Near-term growth options for Woodside point to M&A* Woodside shares jump 1.4 pct in weaker market   (Adds analyst, Noble Energy comments)By Sonali PaulMELBOURNE, May 21 Woodside Petroleum Ltd , Australia's top gas producer, has ditched long-awaited plans to take a stake worth up to $2.7 billion in Israel's flagship Leviathan gas project, as the venture focuses on exporting by pipeline.Woodside's decision to end an agreement to buy a 25 percent stake in the project leaves the partners without the expertise in liquefied natural gas (LNG) that was key to helping Israel expand its gas export options beyond the Middle East to Asia.""All parties have worked very hard to secure an outcome which would be commercially acceptable, but after many months of negotiations it is time to acknowledge we will not get there under the current proposal,"" Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in a statement.The leader of the project, Texas-based Noble Energy Inc , said while talks with Woodside had fallen through, development of Leviathan would go ahead with support from the Israeli government and the existing partners.Plans for Leviathan had changed significantly over the past two years, Noble said, as demand for gas had grown in countries around Israel and in southern Europe, effectively ruling out the need for Woodside's experience, at least in the near-term. ""The emergence of these regional markets, which are accessible through pipeline outlet, has pushed the need for LNG into a later phase of development versus our earlier plans,"" Noble Chairman and CEO Charles Davidson said in a statement.Noble said it was aiming for first production in late 2017.The shift to export more of the gas by pipeline instead of LNG made it less worthwhile for Woodside to invest in on existing terms, Coleman said in April.At the same time, the company has been in dispute with the Israeli government over the tax treatment of a $1.2 billion downpayment on the project. Investors applauded the move to abandon an investment in a region fraught with geopolitical risk and in a country that has never developed such a large gas field, sending Woodside's shares up as much as 1.4 percent on the decision.""You would have wanted a very high hurdle rate for investment in Israel given the uncertainties that surround it,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Mark Samter.Woodside left the door open to renegotiating a deal with the project stakeholders - Noble and Israeli firms Delek Drilling , Avner and Ratio Oil - if there were ""material changes"" to the investment conditions.ACQUISITION HUNT  Leviathan, a large field with 540 billion cubic meters (19 trillion cubic feet) of gas reserves, had been seen as critical to Woodside's growth prospects amid delays in bringing on new production from assets closer to home, including the Browse and Greater Sunrise LNG projects.Analysts said Woodside's buoyant share price, strong cash position and lack of near-term growth options suggested it would look for acquisitions.""We do believe they'll be on the M&A path going forward. Clearly there is a hole in their growth profile at the moment,"" said UBS analyst Nik Burns.There has been speculation Woodside may be interested in Oil Search, which has just started exporting LNG from Papua New Guinea, after Woodside recently missed out on buying a stake in some undeveloped gas fields in PNG.However, Oil Search at A$13 billion ($12 billion) is trading on a fat price-to-earnings multiple of 20, compared to 13 for its peers, which would make paying a premium on top of that hard to justify, analysts and bankers said.LNG opportunities in North America, and oil and gas exploration assets in Africa and the Middle East could attract Woodside, analysts said, based on recent comments by Coleman ruling out parts of South America and anywhere that's icy cold.Investors expect the company to shed more light on its strategy at a full-day briefing on Thursday.($1 = 1.0790 Australian Dollars)   (Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Richard Pullin)",2014-05-21,NBL,"Wed May 21, 2014 | 1:12am EDT",UPDATE 2-Australia's Woodside scraps $2.7 bln Israeli gas field deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/israel-woodside-leviathan-idUSL3N0O652420140521?type=companyNews

Consol and Noble have confidentially filed paperwork for the MLP to launch an initial public offering. The confidential filing, made possible by a 2012 U.S. law designed to shield small companies from a media frenzy, enables the Securities and Exchange Commission to privately review the IPO documents before they are made public.Twitter Inc took such a step in its 2013 filing, hoping to avoid the hype surrounding Facebook Inc's own filing. Consol and Noble said they hope to have the Marcellus MLP launched by the end of this year.

""There's such a mad rush to build out U.S. shale plays in every respect, not just production, but also in logistics transportation,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Stewart Glickman.""Production had to slow down a bit because there just wasn't enough takeaway capacity.""Noble gets a third of its total production from the Denver-Julesburg basin, and analysts said the infrastructure problems there could also hurt Bonanza Creek Energy Inc , Bill Barrett Corp and PDC Energy Inc.Noble's shares were down 3 percent at $71.95 in afternoon trading. Shares of Bonanza Creek, Bill Barrett and PDC Energy were mostly unchanged. Noble, which also operates in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa, said total oil and gas production rose 14 percent to average 290,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in the second quarter ended June 30.That fell short of the company's own forecast and also missed analysts' estimates.ISRAEL WEIGHS  Noble expects to produce as much as 305,0000 boe/d in the third quarter, well below the 324,000 estimated by Simmons & Co analysts.The company said fourth-quarter production could touch 330,000 boe/d, slightly above Simmons & Co's 328,000 forecast.Noble, which also operates in a giant natural gas field off Israel's coast, said it expects its third-quarter natural gas sales in the country to be hurt by the ongoing conflict there.The company and its partners in the Leviathan gas project in the region suffered a setback after Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd pulled out in May, leaving them without the expertise to kickstart exports sooner.Texas-based Noble said on Thursday that it signed on two regional customers for natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar projects in Israel.""We are closing in on securing additional customers that will further support the first phase of development at Leviathan"", Chief Executive Charles Davidson said.Noble's net income nearly halved to $192 million, or 52 cents per share, in the second quarter due to a $187 million loss on commodity derivatives.However, its adjusted profit of 87 cents per share beat the average analyst estimate of 79 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

28,"   By Suleiman Al-Khalidi | AMMAN  AMMAN Jordan expects to finalize a deal next month with Noble Energy Inc to supply the kingdom with natural gas from Israel's Leviathan field, that could save at least $1.4 billion in the country's annual import energy bill, the energy minister said.     The kingdom is struggling to meet electricity demand which is growing by more than 7 percent due to a rising population and industrial expansion. At the same time, reducing losses at state electricity firm NEPCO are a key performance criterion in Jordan's 36-month standby loan deal with the IMF.    NEPCO piled up debts of 4.7 billion dinars ($6.6 billion) after it was forced to pay independent power producers for energy generated from costly diesel and heavy fuel, after disruptions to cheap Egyptian gas supplies.""We are working on the long-term supply deal (with Noble Energy) but we have not yet decided the amounts and prices. We are aiming by mid-November to reach an agreement,"" energy minister Mohammad Hamed said in an interview.    NEPCO signed a letter of intent last September with Noble but the parties did not say when the deal would be finalised.Under the mooted 15 year deal, gas would be transferred directly across the border with Israel following the completion of a pipeline and would likely start arriving by late 2017. While the price is still being negotiated, it is likely to be linked to Brent oil prices.The kingdom's energy bill has soared to more than 4 billion dinars annually following the interruption of gas deliveries from Egypt, which it had relied on to generate over 80 percent of its electricity, forcing it to switch to more expensive imports of heavy fuel and diesel. Egypt gas supplies have stopped completed since May, having been falling sharply since sabotage attacks on the network in Egypt's Sinai region since 2011 and bottlenecks in the country's own domestic market.PREFERRED OPTION  Jordan saw natural gas from huge gas reserves off the eastern Mediterranean coast as the preferred option to ease the country's energy crunch by the end of the decade, Hamed said. It is also working to strike long-term gas deals with the Palestinian Authority, where BG Group Plc has rights to develop a gas field 30 km off the coast of Gaza, and with the Cypriot energy ministry, signing an agreement relating to gas reserves along its southern coast, Hamed said.Jordan's over-reliance on Egyptian gas showed it was crucial to have more than one main source of energy, Hamed said. ""Its crucial to have a diversity of gas resources.""Yet the Israeli gas deal, which would be the largest collaboration between the two countries since a 1994 peace treaty, has faced opposition from some senior lawmakers who say Israel should first deliver on peace pledges.  The kingdom has also recently signed a deal with Royal Dutch Shell to supply a $65 million LNG terminal, 18 km south of the Red Sea port of Aqaba, that will be completed next May.The deal involves the supply of up to 600 million cubic feet per day, a medium-term relief measure to cut at least 500 million dinars annually from the energy import bill.""It will make an big impact on the cost of producing electricity,"" Hamed said, adding the LNG shipments could cover as much as a third of the country's electricity generation.""The cost of electricity is high and probably one of the highest in the Middle East,"" Hamed added. ""It's huge and this growing pressure on our budget is not sustainable. We cannot continue with these losses.""

31,"  * Delek and Noble hold 85 pct of Leviathan* Gas production had been expected to begin by 2018* Noble says could re-think investment in Israel* Oil, gas shares stocks down as much as 22 pct   (Adds comments by analyst, Delek, Noble; political angle)By Steven ScheerJERUSALEM, Dec 23 Israel's competition regulator recommended on Tuesday breaking up what it says is a monopoly control of the country's offshore gas reserves by Noble Energy  and Delek Group, who together hold 85 percent of the giant Leviathan field.The decision puts in doubt current development plans for Leviathan, the huge deepwater gas field discovered four years ago off the Israeli coast, hitting the share prices of all the local partners in Leviathan.Following heavy political pressure, Commissioner David Gilo has revoked a compromise deal that would have allowed Texas-based Noble Energy and Israel's Delek Group to keep control of Leviathan.Anti-trust authorities have been targeting the companies, which discovered the field and other, smaller fields nearby, after critics, mostly political opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the firms have too much control over such a valuable national asset.Leviathan is one of the world's largest offshore gas finds to be made in the last decade, with an estimated 22 trillion cubic feet (622 billion cubic metres) of reserves. Production had been expected to begin in 2018 following an initial investment in the development of around $6.5 billion.Noble and Delek also own controlling stakes in the nearby Tamar field, which was discovered in 2009 and started producing nearly two years ago from reserves estimated at some 10 tcf (280 bcm). The duo previously bought into the exploration block licences that resulted in the discovery of Leviathan without the competition regulator's permission but Gilo had previously allowed the purchase on condition that the two sold stakes in two of their other smaller discoveries in the same East Mediterranean area, Karish and Tanin, which have combined reserves of 3 tcf.However, Gilo told Noble and Delek executives at a Monday evening meeting that he had now decided their licence ownerships constituted a cartel and on Tuesday recommended a break-up of the control of the country's key gas reserves.""The entry of Delek and Noble into Leviathan created a situation in which these groups control all of the gas reserves on the State of Israel's coast,"" the regulator said in a statement.It had never been fully comfortable with the idea of allowing Noble and Delek to control both Tamar and Leviathan but felt it was acceptable to a long legal battle. Now, it believes there will be competition that will lead to lower prices and that the issue may ultimately be decided in court.Noble owns 39.66 percent of Leviathan. Delek Drilling  and Avner Oil Exploration, both units of Delek Group, hold 22.67 percent each and Ratio Oil Exploration  owns 15 percent. Shares in Delek Drilling were down 10 percent by 1315 GMT at 14.80 shekels while Avner was down 9 percent at 2.68 shekels and Ratio was down 10 percent at 0.33 shekel. Delek Group was down 13 percent at 952 shekels.""It sends a very bad message for investors in Israel,"" said Noam Pincu, an analyst at the Psagot brokerage, adding it also may delay Leviathan's development significantly.""Instead of creating competition, it will delay competition,"" he said.The dispute over allowing the companies sole control over developing the gas field has been brewing for about three years and is a hot political topic ahead of a March election focussed on economic issues such as high living costs.Liberal politicians who opinion polls suggest could stymie Netanyahu's bid for a fourth term, accuse his government of permitting tycoons an unfair monopoly over Israel's greatest natural resource. The Israeli authority plans a hearing with the companies before making a final decision and analysts believe a settlement will ultimately be reached, although Noble and Delek could be forced to sell their interests in Tamar or Leviathan.Pincu said one possible outcome could be that Noble and Delek are allowed to hold onto a share of Leviathan's gas earmarked for export but not the 60 percent that is destined for Israel's own use.Noble said it would take all necessary action to protect its legal and legitimate rights.Binyamin Zommer, Noble's manager in Israel, said the authority's decision ""will cast a shadow over the future of the oil and gas industry in Israel and will impact Noble Energy's continued investment there.""Zommer said Noble, which along with its partners has invested $6 billion in Israel's oil and gas sector, remained committed to developing Leviathan, as soon as regulatory, commercial and financial conditions allow.He also said Noble bought the Leviathan licence with Israeli government approval.Yitzhak Tshuva, Delek's controlling shareholder, said he had   risked a large amount of money to develop the oil and gas business and that a forced sale of Leviathan might harm agreements Israel has made with other countries.Leviathan partners are in talks with Britain's BG Group , which wants to run a subsea pipeline from Leviathan to its 10 bcm a year liquefied natural gas export plant on  Egypt's Mediterranean coast, and with Jordan's national electricity company.Only the Palestinian Authority has so far committed to buying gas, agreeing a 20-year deal worth $1.2 billion.

37,"  CAIRO Feb 1 A delegation from American oil firm Noble Energy is in Egypt for talks with the state gas company about importing Israeli gas to energy-starved Egypt, sources at the airport and the oil ministry said on Sunday.Gas shipments could come from Israel's offshore Tamar gas field, which Noble operates, and whose partners have floated plans to connect the field with Egypt's Damietta LNG plant.Israel's Delek Drilling, one of the partners in the field, said in November that if an agreement is signed, gas supplies to Egypt could start flowing in 2017.Egypt has signed several deals in past months to import natural gas, which powers most of its homes and factories, but imports from Israel are potentially more sensitive because of the countries' rocky history.The oil ministry source said Sunday's talks concerned the technical procedures for bringing natural gas from Israeli fields into Egypt. ""Negotiations are under way about the amount of gas that can be imported,"" the source said.Another source at Cairo's airport earlier in the day said that a delegation came for several hours from Israel to discuss gas shipments.Egypt's oil minister said two weeks ago that the country was open to Israeli imports. Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, following three decades of intermittent conflict since Israel's creation in 1948.While many Egyptians still view Israel with suspicion, relations have improved since the army toppled President Mohamed Mursi, an Islamist, in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. The two countries also have a shared interest in containing the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, and maintaining stability in the Sinai Peninsula where security has deteriorated since Mursi's ouster.Egypt, which once exported gas to Israel and elsewhere, is going through its worst energy crisis in decades, with rising consumption and declining production turning it into an energy importer.The government has tried to improve the energy landscape by slashing subsidies, paying down its debt to foreign energy firms, and negotiating import agreements.After finalising a long-delayed deal for an LNG import terminal, it has reached agreements to receive gas from Algeria, and is in talks with Russia and Cyprus for gas shipments.

38,"   By Ari Rabinovitch | TEL AVIV  TEL AVIV Feb 3 Israel's energy minister said on Tuesday natural gas companies operating offshore Israel will have to sell some of their reserves to avoid being deemed a monopoly, reinforcing a stance against control of the assets by Noble Energy and Delek Group.His comments were the most explicit to be in made public since the country's antitrust authority said in December the U.S.-Israeli partners who discovered two large natural gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean may constitute a monopoly.The regulator's comments had jolted the sector and the energy companies said they were holding off further investment until matters became more clear, throwing off development timelines and endangering major export deals. Energy Minister Silvan Shalom said the government is working to find a balance between increasing competition and making it worthwhile for companies to ensure the offshore Tamar and Leviathan fields are developed.Texas-based Noble and Israel's Delek are the main shareholders in both fields, whose discovery in 2009 and 2010 turned import-dependent Israel into a potential energy exporter. ""Part of the decision will be that the gas companies will have to give up some of the reserves they have. What can you do? It will happen,"" Shalom told an energy conference in Tel Aviv. ""Sadly, I don't see a lot of new players waiting to come here."" He said part of the reason that large foreign companies are hesitant to invest in Israel is because they already have major operations in Arab states that do not have good ties with Israel.""The Israeli market is a small market. And the interests they have in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states, they are much bigger and stronger than what they have here. So to bring them here as competitors to other groups is not simple,"" he said.Noble and Delek have already agreed to sell their licenses to two smaller gas fields nearby. Officials have said other options being discussed are splitting up the consortium so the partners sell gas in competition, or even to sell stakes in either Tamar or Leviathan.

53,"   By Shubhankar Chakravorty  Noble Energy Inc said on Monday it would acquire Rosetta Resources Inc for about $2 billion in stock, marking the first significant deal among U.S. shale oil producers following a steep fall in global crude prices.A nearly 50 percent drop in crude prices since June highs of over $100 per barrel has for months raised expectations for a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the highly-fragmented shale oil industry. But until now buyers and sellers had been unable to agree on valuations and the outlook for future prices. With the Noble acquisition, a precedent has been set that will clear a path for other companies plotting shale deals, people familiar with the transaction said. Shares of Rosetta rose 25 percent to $24.23 and shares of Noble fell 7 percent to $45.39 on the New York Stock Exchange.The deal will give Noble entry into two of the country's top producing shale fields, the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Bain in Texas. Noble, which is also drilling for natural gas offshore Israel, is already pumping oil and gas in other fields, including in Colorado.   The Houston-based company said it had identified more than 1,800 drilling locations across Rosetta's liquids-rich assets, consisting of 50,000 net acres (20,234 net hectares) in the Eagle Ford shale and 56,000 net acres in the Permian.The assets have the potential to produce about 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and will raise company-wide production 21 percent, Noble said.""Noble has the balance sheet, the expertise, and the bandwidth to do a great job with these two properties,"" Irene Haas, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities Inc, said in a note.  Royal Dutch Shell agreed last month to buy BG Group for about $70 billion in a deal centered around liquefied natural gas. That deal was also seen as paving the way for mergers and acquisitions in the oil sector..The offer of 0.542 Noble share for each Rosetta share held represents a 38 percent premium to Rosetta's Friday close.

58,"  JERUSALEM May 25 Israel's anti-monopoly regulator, who has been pushing to open the energy sector to competition, said on Monday he would step down in August, potentially lifting the pressure on exploration companies Noble Energy and Delek Group.Antitrust Commissioner David Gilo caused an uproar in December when he ruled that Noble and Delek may constitute a monopoly over their control of two large natural gas fields Tamar and Leviathan.In a stinging rebuke of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Gilo, whose post is independent, said he was resigning because the government was pushing for a deal to speed up development of the gas field at the expense of bringing in new competition.He did not, however, list details of what the deal would entail. Tamar began producing gas two years ago, but development of Leviathan, the world's largest offshore gas discovery of the past decade, has since been frozen.Texas-based Noble and Israeli conglomerate Delek have been negotiating with the government to find a solution over which, if any, assets they would have to sell off. ""The government, especially the prime minister's office and Finance and Energy Ministries, will do everything they can to promote the outline that is being drafted for the natural gas market - an outline I am convinced will not bring competition in this important market,"" said Gilo, who has been in the post for more than four years. While not directly related, the resignation of the regulator comes as Netanyahu has been shaking up the leadership of two ministries under his control.Last week Netanyahu dismissed the director-general of the Communications Ministry and this week the director-general of the Foreign Ministry was also let go, to be replaced by a close Netanyahu confidant, Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations.Noble and Delek own 85 percent of Leviathan, which has with an estimated 22 trillion cubic feet (622 billion cubic metres) of reserves. Production had been expected to begin in 2018 following an initial investment in the development of around $6.5 billion.

65,"   By Terry Wade and Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Israel is working to persuade more U.S. energy companies to invest in its growing offshore fields, saying a fractious delay to Houston-based Noble Energy Inc's (NBL.N) massive Leviathan natural gas project will soon end if a new regulatory regime takes effect.Israel Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said U.S. companies should not be turned off, even as Noble threatens to take Israel to arbitration and demand billions of dollars in lost future revenues if Leviathan - one of the world's largest offshore discoveries of the past decade - does not soon receive final approvals.A new policy framework, designed in part to alleviate anti-trust concerns that Noble and its partner Delek Group Ltd  DKEKG.TA would control too much of Israel's gas supply if Leviathan were to start up, has been approved by the Cabinet and parliament.""What's left now in order to put it into action is just the signature of the minister of economy,"" Steinitz told the Reuters Commodities Summit late Tuesday. ""I am confident that in the near future, until the end of this year, and hopefully in the next few weeks, this will be over and the framework will be finally in place.""The economy minister, Aryeh Deri, has not given clear signals in recent days that he will sign it to end years of delays.Steinitz said he wanted to see Leviathan's gas flowing and not tied up in arbitration.""I hope the threat will no longer exist soon,"" he said. Israel, which has gone from an energy dependence to a potential exporter, currently receives its gas for electricity generation from the Tamar gas field, which began production in 2013.The new framework will involve Noble and Delek reducing stakes in Tamar.These types of changes, made after billions of dollars have been invested, often rankle companies.Steinitz said the new regulatory framework better prepares Israel for big energy discoveries that have a good chance of growing larger - bringing huge tax and royalty revenues and potentially allowing it to become an energy exporter. ""We hope to encourage other companies. This is the main reason for my visit to Houston. To explain to them the potential and attractiveness of investing in Israel,"" Steinitz said.Oil is thought to sit in deeper rock below the gas field that sits 80 miles (130 km) off Israel's Mediterranean coast.And there is talk that Egypt, Israel and Cyprus could develop a subsea pipeline to supply Europe with gas and wean it off supplies from Russia.

66,"  * For other news from Reuters Commodities Summit, click hereBy Terry Wade and Kristen HaysHOUSTON Oct 21 Israel is working to persuade more U.S. energy companies to invest in its growing offshore fields, saying a fractious delay to Houston-based Noble Energy Inc's massive Leviathan natural gas project will soon end if a new regulatory regime takes effect.Israel Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said U.S. companies should not be turned off, even as Noble threatens to take Israel to arbitration and demand billions of dollars in lost future revenues if Leviathan - one of the world's largest offshore discoveries of the past decade - does not soon receive final approvals.A new policy framework, designed in part to alleviate anti-trust concerns that Noble and its partner Delek Group Ltd   would control too much of Israel's gas supply if Leviathan were to start up, has been approved by the Cabinet and parliament.""What's left now in order to put it into action is just the signature of the minister of economy,"" Steinitz told the Reuters Commodities Summit late Tuesday. ""I am confident that in the near future, until the end of this year, and hopefully in the next few weeks, this will be over and the framework will be finally in place.""The economy minister, Aryeh Deri, has not given clear signals in recent days that he will sign it to end years of delays.Steinitz said he wanted to see Leviathan's gas flowing and not tied up in arbitration. ""I hope the threat will no longer exist soon,"" he said.Israel, which has gone from an energy dependence to a potential exporter, currently receives its gas for electricity generation from the Tamar gas field, which began production in 2013.The new framework will involve Noble and Delek reducing stakes in Tamar. These types of changes, made after billions of dollars have been invested, often rankle companies.Steinitz said the new regulatory framework better prepares Israel for big energy discoveries that have a good chance of growing larger - bringing huge tax and royalty revenues and potentially allowing it to become an energy exporter.""We hope to encourage other companies. This is the main reason for my visit to Houston. To explain to them the potential and attractiveness of investing in Israel,"" Steinitz said.Oil is thought to sit in deeper rock below the gas field that sits 80 miles (130 km) off Israel's Mediterranean coast. And there is talk that Egypt, Israel and Cyprus could develop a subsea pipeline to supply Europe with gas and wean it off supplies from Russia.Leviathan could be part of that.""Prime Minister Netanyahu is taking this very seriously because it is vital for the state of Israel, for our energy security, and for the Israel economy,"" Steinitz said.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_SummitsFor more summit stories, see          (Reporting by Kristen Hays and Terry Wade; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",2015-10-21,NBL,"Wed Oct 21, 2015 | 12:54pm EDT","REUTERS SUMMIT-Amid Noble flap, Israel recruits U.S. oil firms",http://www.reuters.com//article/israel-noble-natgas-idUSL1N12L1A320151021?type=companyNews

Cyprus, which required an international bailout in 2013, is hoping natural gas will fuel an economic turnaround.The original partners in developing Aphrodite, Noble and Delek, said in June that the field was commercially viable and said their plans called for producing 8 billion cubic metres of gas a year and the construction of a pipeline to Egypt.J. Keith Elliott, Noble Energy`s senior vice president for the eastern Mediterranean, said BG would bring substantial technical, financial and marketing capacity as the consortium develops the project.

A prospectus for HSBC fund says it invests in ""companies that aim to be the market-leaders in their respective sectors at managing their businesses in the face of climate change.""Deutsche Bank's $75 million Global Warming Prevention Equity Fund offered to Asian investors - the second biggest climate-focused fund in the field - held stock this year in U.S. oil and gas driller Helmerich and Payne Inc, according to fund disclosures.A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman on Tuesday cited the drilling company's focus on natural gas, which burns cleaner than oil or coal, and its hydraulic fracturing or fracking technology, which had increased its productivity. She added the fund had since sold off the stock.The fund had also previously owned large stakes in oil companies Noble Energy and pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc, according to disclosures.

The project was rejected by the Obama administration on Nov. 6 on environmental grounds after a prolonged review.A spokesman for Nomura said the fund was small and available only to investors in Taiwan. He did not respond to requests for comment about the fund's holdings. Nomura's fund also held stock in Australia's top oil and gas producer, Woodside Petroleum Ltd, and Norway's Statoil .Another Taiwan-based fund, the Jih Sun Anti-Global Warming Fund, held a small stake in Enbridge Inc, a Canadian company that has proposed an oil sands pipeline to Canada's West Coast, a potential Plan B to the failed Keystone XL project.The best performers in the climate fund field so far this year were portfolios that avoided fossil fuels entirely.

78,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N), North Dakota's second-largest oil producer, said on Tuesday it would slash its 2016 capital budget by 66 percent as it tries to preserve cash amid tumbling crude prices.Led by billionaire wildcatter Harold Hamm, Continental plans to spend $920 million this year, down from $2.7 billion in 2015.The cut comes just after rival Hess Corp (HES.N) and Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) slashed their own 2016 budgets, adding to a chorus of company executives chanting that the plunge in oil prices has made it all but impossible to turn a profit.Oklahoma City-based Continental, for instance, said it would not become profitable until oil prices CLc1 return to $37 per barrel. U.S. oil prices closed Tuesday at $31.45 per barrel.    Hamm famously canceled Continental's oil hedges in the fall of 2014, a bold bet that now appears misguided as the price of crude has only tumbled since then, dragging down Continental's profitability. Yet Hamm showed little sign of remorse on Tuesday, betting that oil prices will jump before 2017. ""We are dedicated to preserving the value of our premier assets and building operational efficiencies in preparation for crude oil prices to stabilize and start recovering later this year,"" Hamm said in a statement. The company does plan to cut its oil output this year by 10 percent from 2015 levels to roughly 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), a recognition that it can no longer afford to extract and sell oil from the more-than 1 million acres it controls at depressed prices. The largest plurality of Continental's 2016 budget spending will be in North Dakota's Bakken shale, which the company helped make a global oil play.  Oklahoma's SCOOP shale formation will receive the next-largest share of the budget, followed by other Oklahoma fields and well repair projects.Overall, Continental plans to complete 71 wells this year, a sharp drop from 2015. The company said it will delay bringing online most of its North Dakota wells this year, increasing its count of drilled-but-uncompleted wells from 135 in December to 195 at the end of 2016.Shares of Continental rose 10.5 percent to close Tuesday trading at $18.84 per share.

80,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The two-year slide in energy company shares has produced wildly inflated dividend yields - a sign of more pain to come for investors who already have suffered the effects of a historic slide in crude prices.Oil-dependent companies now are paying out as much as 19 percent of their share prices in dividends, raising flags that payout cuts will keep rolling on. Oil-dependent companies, in particular, have seen revenues and cash levels fall along with their share prices, so they may not have the wherewithal to maintain their dividend payments.""The stock prices are absolutely telling you that a (dividend) cut of some order is expected,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""Their basic business is eroding so they can’t support a dividend at this level.""The high dividend yields are a mathematical result of share price declines. Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N), for example, had a dividend yield of 1.5 percent at the end of 2014, when it was paying 18 cents a share. The yield rose to 2.2 percent at the end of 2015 as Noble's shares fell. On Tuesday, Noble cut its quarterly payout 44 percent to 10 cents, lowering the dividend yield to 1.3 percent. Analysts now are eyeing ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) 8 percent payout; Barclays analysts said it is in the company's best interest to slash its dividend by ""at least"" 75 percent and it should announce the move when its results are out next week.But Gary Bradshaw of Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, who holds the stock, said he sees Conoco keeping the dividend steady even if it has to borrow cash to do so. He expects other big diversified companies like Exxon (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) to maintain their payouts, as well, unless oil stays around $30 a barrel for the year - a level he says is unsustainable for the industry. Williams Companies (WMB.N), in the process of being acquired by Energy Transfer Equity (ETE.N), pays out nearly 13 percent of its share price in annual dividends - the highest for any member of the S&P 500 index, and more than triple its 2014 dividend yield of 3.7 percent.Other energy companies yielding double digits are Archrock Inc (AROC.N) near 12 percent compared to its 2015 payout of about 3 percent and ONEOK Inc (OKE.N), yielding more than 10 percent compared to a 2.7 percent yield in 2014. A dividend cut or suspension is a signal to investors that a company could in financial dire straits. Given the widely-known hurdles for the energy industry, however, announcements have not always been met with sharp stock price declines.For a list of energy companies that have seen the sharpest increase in their dividend yields, click here. (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2016-01-28,NBL,"Thu Jan 28, 2016 | 5:18pm EST",Dividends in crosshairs as energy sector continues to struggle,http://www.reuters.com//article/global-oil-usa-dividends-idUSL2N15B32W?type=companyNews
81,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Chevron Corp (CVX.N) reported its first quarterly loss in more than 13 years on Friday despite Wall Street's expectations for a profit, as plunging oil prices eroded profitability across all its divisions.It was the latest sign that the more than 70 percent drop in crude prices CLc1 since 2014 has humbled a once-strong energy sector and forced it to curtail new projects, lay off staff and shrink spending.Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil producer, last month signaled its pain by cutting its 2016 budget by 24 percent to $26.6 billion, part of a strategy to contend with lower oil prices and hunker down for a hoped-for price rebound. Smaller rivals Hess Corp (HES.N), Continental Resources (CLR.N) and Noble Energy (NBL.N) cut their own budgets early this week, ranging from 40 percent to 66 percent.""We're taking significant action to improve earnings and cash flow in this low price environment,"" John Watson, Chevron's chief executive, said in a press release.         The company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $588 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with a net profit of $3.47 billion, or $1.85 per share, in the year-ago period. The last time Chevron posted a quarterly loss was the third quarter of 2002.Analysts at Wells Fargo had expected the San Ramon, California-based company to report a profit of 45 cents per share, while analysts at Barclays had expected a profit of 32 cents a share. Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read attributed the miss to higher exploration expenses and weak operating results in the company's U.S. exploration and production unit.The bulk of Chevron's losses came from its divisions that explore for and produce oil and natural gas, with its U.S. division alone posting a loss of $1.95 billion. Surprisingly, Chevron's refining divisions also saw profit plunge. Refiners typically see profitability increase when the price of their main feedstock - oil - falls. Chevron said the drop was due to a boost in the prior year from asset sales, and also smaller margins on specialty refined products.Production rose 4 percent to 2.67 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter ended Dec. 31.Shares of Chevron have slid about 5 percent so far this year through the Thursday close of $85.92 per share.

Analysts had expected 404,000 boe/d.However, Noble said it expected sales volumes to decline to 395,000-405,000 boe/d in the first quarter due to downtime at its Alba field compression project offshore Equatorial Guinea.

Noble priced 12.5 million shares at $22.50, above its previously indicated range of $19 and $21, the source said, asking not to be named because the pricing was not yet public. The IPO of Houston, Texas-based Noble came after it shelved its plans to go public in November 2015 due to a slump in oil prices. It gives hope to the growing backlog of oil and gas companies aspiring to go public, following a modest rise in the price of oil. Noble did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

110,"   By Lauren Hirsch  Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX.N), a wholly owned unit of Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N), priced its initial public offering (IPO) above earlier expectations, the company said on Wednesday, raising $281 million and breaking a year-long drought for IPOs in the oil and gas sector.First Noble priced 12.5 million shares at $22.50, above its previously indicated range of $19 and $21, the company said in a statement. The IPO of Houston, Texas-based Noble came after it shelved its plans to go public in November 2015 due to a slump in oil prices. It gives hope to the growing backlog of oil and gas companies aspiring to go public, following a modest rise in the price of oil.A slow IPO market, in conjunction with an oil rout, had made it nearly impossible for oil and gas companies to break through to the public market. By this time last year, on the other hand, there were 59 IPOs in the energy and power sector, raising a total of $10 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Data.  After reaching 12-year lows hit early this year, oil prices have begun to bounce back. The industry's slow return, which has coincided with a stronger IPO market, has jarred open the IPO window for the many oil and gas drilling and pipeline companies looking for liquidity. Roughly a dozen natural resource drillers and producers are considering an IPO, Reuters has previously reported. Yesterday, Vantage Energy Inc filed publicly for an IPO after having confidentially filed, as first reported by Reuters. Still, industry insiders expect that a handful of these firms will be bought by larger energy companies, who have collectively fortified themselves with $30 billion through secondary stock offerings since early 2015. Noble midstream partners LP will own and operate pipelines and processing assets largely in Colarado's Weld County. Noble will use the proceeds from the IPO to put cash back into its parent company. Noble's shares are scheduled to start trading on NYSE on Thursday under the symbol ""NBLX."" Barclays, Baird, J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank Securities are among underwriters to the  Noble Midstream offering.

111,"  Coal and natural gas producer Consol Energy Inc and Noble Energy Inc said on Monday they would dissolve their 50-50 Marcellus shale joint venture, resulting in a payment of about $205 million to Consol on closing.The joint venture was formed in 2011 to explore and develop   about 669,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The venture produces the equivalent of about 1.07 billion cubic feet of gas per day.U.S. shale oil production is expected to fall for a 12th consecutive month in November, according to a U.S. government forecast, on the back of a two-year global rout in oil markets, leading several oil and gas companies to sell assets or revisit deals with other companies.Canadian energy producer Enerplus Corp put its natural gas assets in the U.S. Marcellus shale region up for sale earlier this month, while Norwegian oil company Statoil sold its assets in the same region to EQT Corp early this year. Noble and Consol said they would now own and operate wells in two separate areas where they would have independent control and flexibility over development.The deal does not change the total acreage or gathering rates dedicated by Consol and Noble to Cone Midstream Partners LP, a limited partnership formed by the two companies to develop and acquire natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets in the Marcellus shale.  Consol will control about 306,000 Marcellus acres with production of nearly 620 million cubic feet per day of natural gas equivalents, while Noble will control about 363,000 acres with production of about 450 million cubic feet per day of natural gas equivalents. The deal is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, the companies said.
