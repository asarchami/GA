0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Host  Hotels & Resorts Limited Partnership's (Host) $500 million series E senior  unsecured notes due June 15, 2025. Host plans to use the net proceeds and cash  on hand to redeem its 5.875% $500 million series X notes due 2019. The company  anticipates paying an aggregate redemption price of approximately $515 million.  A full list of Fitch's ratings for Host follows at the end of this release. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that Host will sustain leverage at or  below its stated 3.0x leverage target and that the company's credit metrics will  remain appropriate for the 'BBB-' IDR through the lodging cycle. The ratings  also consider Host's high-quality portfolio of geographically diversified  upper-tier hotel properties, as well as its large and liquid unencumbered asset  pool. Fitch views the latter as an important source of contingent liquidity that  supports the rating. U.S. Lodging Still in a Good Place  Accelerating U.S. GDP growth and low levels of new supply set the table for  strong U.S. lodging industry fundamentals during 2015. Robust demand has boosted  occupancy rates, providing hotels with material pricing power. Fitch expects  U.S. RevPAR to increase by 6% this year, based on a 1% occupancy gain and 5%  average daily room rate (ADR) growth. Fitch expects Host's RevPAR to grow  in-line with to slightly below the industry average during the next one-three  years, primarily due to the company's exposure to upper-price-tier hotels and  portfolio weightings in markets with weaker near-term outlooks, such as New York  and Washington, D.C. Diversified Portfolio Host maintains a high-quality, geographically diversified portfolio of 113  consolidated luxury and upscale hotel properties across the U.S. including 16  international hotels located in, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and  New Zealand. The company's portfolio provides significant financial flexibility  and geographically diverse cash flows, which Fitch views positively. Sustained Lower Leverage  Host has reduced its leverage from its down-cycle peak of 5.8x to 2.4x for the  trailing 12-month (TTM) period ending March 31, 2015 - a level that is in-line  with Fitch's rating case projections. The reduction and Host's public commitment  to sustain leverage at around 3.0x or below are key elements behind Fitch's  ratings.  Fitch's ratings for Host have only limited tolerance for leverage sustaining  above 4.0x over the rating horizon (typically two-three years). However, the  ratings contemplate a scenario where Host's leverage temporarily increases above  4.0x - a recognition of hotel industry cyclicality and capital intensity, as  well as the limited ability to retain cash and reduce debt due to its REIT  status. Under such a scenario, the company's speed and willingness to bring  leverage back below 4.0x would likely determine whether Fitch maintains its  investment-grade ratings.  Fitch's stress case forecast assumes that peak cyclical leverage is comfortably  below 5.0x and that it would decline to below 4.0x within the ratings horizon.   Fitch defines Host's leverage as net debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA. Large and Liquid Unencumbered Asset Pool Host's large unencumbered asset pool provides an excellent source of contingent  liquidity. Fitch calculates that the company's unencumbered assets-to-net  unsecured debt (UA/UD) ratio at 2.8x as of March 31, 2015.  Fitch reflects the cyclicality of Host's cash flows in its UA/UD analysis by  haircutting its TTM unencumbered EBITDA by 20% and applying a stressed 8x  multiple to calculate unencumbered asset value. Host's unencumbered asset profile has several attractive features that should  enhance their appeal as collateral. The company's hotels are principally located  in key 'gateway' markets that balance sheet lenders tend to favor. Moreover, its  hotels are generally aligned with the strongest brands in the industry. Finally,  Host owns some of the largest and most valuable hotels in the U.S., which should  allow it to raise secured debt capital quickly and in size, if needed. Strong Fixed-Charge Coverage Fitch's rating case projections anticipate that Host's fixed-charge coverage  ratio will sustain in the mid-5.0x range over the rating horizon. Strong  property-level EBITDA growth, lower leverage and the refinancing of higher-cost  debt support Fitch's expectations. Under a stress case scenario not anticipated  by Fitch, the company's coverage could decline (but remain adequate) to 2.5x  over the next 12-to-24 months.  Fitch defines Host's fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less  renewal and replacement capital expenditures, divided by cash interest expense  and capitalized interest. Cyclicality Drives Earnings Volatility The cyclical nature of the hotel industry is Fitch's primary credit concern  related to Host. Hotels re-price their inventory daily and, therefore, have the  shortest lease terms and least stable cash flows of any commercial property  type. Economic cycles, as well as exogenous events (i.e. acts of terrorism),  have historically caused material declines in revenues and profitability for  hotels. The Stable Outlook centers on Fitch's expectation that Host's credit profile  will remain appropriate for the 'BBB-' rating through economic cycles, barring  any significant changes in the company's capital structure plans. The Stable  Outlook also reflects the quality of Host's portfolio and unencumbered asset  coverage that provides good downside protection to bondholders.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --U.S. lodging industry RevPAR grows 6% during 2015; --Upper-price-tier hotels deliver moderately below-average RevPAR growth; --Group demand (room nights booked in blocks of 10, or more) momentum continues  to improve; --Fitch has not incorporated any share repurchases under the company's recently  authorized $500 million repurchase program into its rating case projections. RATING SENSITIVITIES --A reduction in Host's public stated leverage target of 3.0x and commensurate  deleveraging of its balance sheet could lead to positive momentum. At this  point, Fitch believes this is unlikely given the company's growth strategy and  historical financial policies. --Fitch expects management to support its balance sheet at a level commensurate  with a 'BBB-' rating. Host revising its medium- to long-term leverage target  above 3.0x could have negative rating implications.  --Fitch's expectation for leverage to sustain above 4.0x over the rating horizon  could also lead to a downgrade in the ratings and/or Outlook; --A negative rating action could also occur if a downturn is more severe than  Fitch's stress case scenarios, which contemplates industrywide RevPAR declines  of 13%-15%. Due at least in part to the more attractive supply growth  environment relative to the last recessions, we believe RevPAR declines would be  somewhat less severe than the 20% declines experienced in 2008-2009. --A material reduction in Host's UA/UD ratio could have negative rating  implications. Fitch currently rates Host as follows: Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB-'. Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. --IDR 'BBB-'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured exchangeable notes 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDR) for Host Hotel & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST) and its operating  partnership, Host Hotels & Resorts Limited Partnership (collectively Host) at  'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at  the end of the release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that Host will sustain leverage at or  below its stated 2.5x to 3.0x leverage target and that the company's credit  metrics will remain appropriate for the 'BBB-' IDR through the lodging cycle.

U.S. Lodging Still in a Good Place  Accelerating U.S. GDP growth and low levels of new supply set the table for  strong U.S. lodging industry fundamentals during 2015. Robust demand has boosted  occupancy rates, providing hotels with material pricing power. Fitch expects  U.S. RevPAR to increase by 7% this year, based on a 2% occupancy gain and 5%  average daily room rate (ADR) growth.  Fitch expects Host's RevPAR to grow moderately below the industry average during  this year due to its exposure to upper-price-tier hotels and portfolio  weightings in markets with weaker near-term outlooks, such as New York and  Washington, D.C., as well as renovation disruption at several large properties.  Accelerating group fundamentals and strong growth from recently renovated  properties should support solid RevPAR growth during 2016 and 2017. Fitch has  assumed 5% and 4%, respectively. Sustained Lower Leverage  Host has reduced its leverage from its down-cycle peak of 5.8x to 2.8x for the  trailing 12-month (TTM) period ending June 30, 2015 - a level that is in-line  with Fitch's rating case projections. The reduction and Host's public commitment  to sustain leverage in the 2.5x to 3.0x range are key considerations  incorporated in Fitch's ratings. Host's TTM leverage was 2.6x on a pro forma  basis that assumes its $400 million 2.5% exchangeable notes are converted to  equity during October 2015. Fitch's ratings for Host have only limited tolerance for leverage sustaining  above 4.0x over the rating horizon (typically one-two years). However, the  ratings contemplate a scenario where Host's leverage temporarily increases above  4.0x - a recognition of hotel industry cyclicality and capital intensity, as  well as the limited ability to retain cash and reduce debt due to its REIT  status. Under such a scenario, the company's willingness and sense of urgency to  bring leverage back below 4.0x would likely determine whether Fitch maintains  its investment-grade ratings.  Fitch's stress case forecast assumes that peak cyclical leverage is comfortably  below 5.0x and that it would decline to below 4.0x within the ratings horizon.  Fitch defines Host's leverage as debt, net of readily available cash divided by  recurring operating EBITDA.  Large and Liquid Unencumbered Portfolio  Host's large unencumbered asset pool provides an excellent source of contingent  liquidity. Fitch calculates that the company's unencumbered assets-to-net  unsecured debt (UA/UD) ratio at 2.6x as of June 30, 2015. The company's UA/UD  ratio improves to 2.8x on a pro forma basis that assumes its $400 million 2.5%  exchangeable notes are converted to equity during October 2015.  Fitch reflects the cyclicality of Host's cash flows in its UA/UD analysis by  haircutting its TTM unencumbered EBITDA by 20% and applying a stressed 8x  multiple to calculate unencumbered asset value.  Host's unencumbered asset profile has several attractive features that should  enhance their appeal as collateral. The company's hotels are principally located  in key 'gateway' markets that balance sheet lenders tend to favor. Moreover, its  hotels are generally aligned with the strongest brands in the industry. Finally,  Host owns some of the largest and most valuable hotels in the U.S., which should  allow it to raise secured debt capital quickly and in size, if needed.  Strong Fixed-Charge Coverage  Fitch's rating case projections anticipate that Host's fixed-charge coverage  ratio will improve to the 7.0x to 8.0x range over the rating horizon. Strong  property-level EBITDA growth, lower leverage and the refinancing of higher-cost  debt support Fitch's expectations. Fitch defines Host's fixed-charge coverage as  recurring operating EBITDA less renewal and replacement capital expenditures,  divided by cash interest expense and capitalized interest.  Diversified Portfolio  Host maintains a high-quality, geographically diversified portfolio of 110  consolidated luxury and upscale hotel properties across the U.S. including 16  international hotels located in, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and  New Zealand. The company's portfolio provides significant financial flexibility  and geographically diverse cash flows, which Fitch views positively. Heightened Event Risk Potential Fitch's ratings for Host do not contemplate a deviation from its current  financial policies. However, Fitch recognize the heightened possibility for  'event risk' in the form of a change in financial policy given the weak absolute  and relative performance of its shares and concerns expressed by some market  participants that the company's low leverage strategy is suboptimal.  Share Repurchases Fitch's ratings for Host have some tolerance for share repurchases, provided the  company executes its program within its stated financial policies, primarily  sustaining leverage below 3.0x. Nevertheless, Fitch view share repurchases as a  credit negative, all else equal, that favors equity holders over bondholders. The company's board authorized a $500 million share repurchase program earlier  this year to respond to the share underperformance. Host has repurchased 17.4  million shares for $330 million under its current authorization, leaving $170  million of capacity remaining at Sept. 25, 2015. The $19.00 per share average  repurchase price is roughly 18% above Host shares' $16.05 closing price on Sept.  25, 2015. Cyclicality Drives Earnings Volatility  The cyclical nature of the hotel industry is Fitch's primary credit concern  related to Host. Hotels re-price their inventory daily and, therefore, have the  shortest lease terms and least stable cash flows of any commercial property  type.

Fitch's 5%  RevPAR expectation for 2016 assumes continued healthy group demand trends and a  moderate benefit from its recently renovated hotels. Fitch has assumed 4% RevPAR  growth for Host during 2017. --Host's EBITDA margin improves by roughly 50 bps per year through  2017,  excluding non-routine items. --No acquisitions or dispositions during the forecast period; --The company satisfies its exchangeable notes put obligation through the  issuance of new shares, rather than cash; --Host draws the remaining $200 million under its $500 million delayed draw term  loan during 4Q15; --The company completes its $500 million share repurchase authorization during  2015. Fitch has also assumed the company repurchases an additional $250 million  of shares during 2016 and 2017 that are currently not authorized. RATING SENSITIVITIES --A reduction in Host's public stated leverage target of 2.5x to 3.0x and  commensurate deleveraging of its balance sheet could lead to positive momentum.

The company anticipates paying an aggregate redemption price of  approximately $515 million. Host will issue the Series F notes under its  existing indenture dated May 15, 2015. A full list of rating actions follows at  the end of the release. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that Host will sustain leverage at or  below its stated 2.5x to 3.0x leverage target and that the company's credit  metrics will remain appropriate for the 'BBB-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  through the lodging cycle.

7,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the ratings of Host  Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST) and its operating partnership Host Hotels &  Resorts, L.P. (collectively Host or the company), including the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR), to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of  rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The IDR upgrade to 'BBB' reflects the issuer's demonstrated adherence to, and  Fitch's expectation of, maintaining leverage within its more conservative 2.5x  to 3.0x public financial policy target adopted following the last downturn.  Sustaining leverage in this range during lodging industry expansions should  allow Host to keep leverage during a downturn a turn or more below similarly  rated REITs with less volatile cash flows. This assumes that the company's  peak-to-trough EBITDA decline during a downturn is consistent with its negative  30% to negative 50% historical experience.  It is appropriate for Host to sustain trough leverage below similarly rated  REITs with less volatile cash flows backed by longer duration contractual  leases. This is due to the generally weaker institutional demand for secured  property-level mortgages for hotels during periods of economic and capital  markets stress relative to other CRE property type. The ratings also consider Host's high-quality portfolio of geographically  diversified upper-tier hotel properties, as well as its large and liquid  unencumbered asset pool. Fitch views the latter as an important source of  contingent liquidity that supports the rating. Host's portfolio is almost  entirely unencumbered. U.S. Lodging Cycle Peaking Fitch projects that U.S. revenue per available room (RevPAR) will increase by  3%-4% during 2016 and by 1%-2% during 2017, with monthly comparisons possibly  turning negative during the latter half of the year. We expect 2018 to mark the  first full year of RevPAR declines, assuming the historical six- to 12-month lag  between occupancy and RevPAR declines holds. Fitch expects Host's RevPAR to grow moderately below the industry average during  the year due to its exposure to upper-price-tier hotels and portfolio weightings  in markets with weaker near-term outlooks, such as New York and Washington, D.C.  Solid group demand and recently completed growth capex investments should  support Host's RevPAR growth during 2016 and 2017 of 3% and 1%, respectively. Sustained Lower Leverage  Host has reduced its leverage from its down-cycle peak of 5.8x to 2.6x for the  trailing 12-month (TTM) period ending June 30, 2016. This leverage level is in  line with Fitch's rating case projections through 2019. The reduction and Host's  public commitment to sustain leverage in the 2.5x to 3.0x range are key  considerations incorporated in Fitch's ratings. Fitch's ratings for Host have only limited tolerance for leverage sustaining  above 4.0x over the rating horizon (typically one-to-two years). However, the  ratings contemplate a scenario where Host's leverage temporarily increases above  4.0x in recognition of hotel industry cyclicality and capital intensity, as well  as the limited ability to retain cash and reduce debt due to its REIT status.  Under such a scenario, the company's willingness and sense of urgency to bring  leverage back to the 3.0x range would likely determine whether Fitch maintains  its ratings and Stable Outlook, along with Fitch's outlook on for leverage to  return to the company's 2.5x-3.0x policy range.  Fitch's stress case forecast assumes that peak cyclical leverage is comfortably  below 4.0x. Fitch defines Host's leverage as debt, net of readily available cash  divided by recurring operating EBITDA.  Large and Liquid Unencumbered Portfolio  Host's large unencumbered asset pool provides an excellent source of contingent  liquidity. Fitch calculates the company's unencumbered assets-to-net unsecured  debt (UA/UD) ratio at 2.5x as of June 30, 2016. Fitch reflects the cyclicality  of Host's cash flows in its UA/UD analysis by haircutting its TTM unencumbered  EBITDA by 20% and applying a stressed 8x multiple to calculate unencumbered  asset value.  Host's unencumbered asset profile has several attractive features that should  enhance its appeal as collateral. The company's hotels are principally located  in key 'gateway' markets that balance sheet lenders tend to favor. Moreover, its  hotels are generally aligned with the strongest brands in the industry. Finally,  Host owns some of the largest and most valuable hotels in the U.S., which should  allow it to raise a large amount of secured debt capital quickly, if needed.  Strong Fixed-Charge Coverage  Fitch's rating case projections anticipate that Host's fixed-charge coverage  (FCC) ratio will improve to the 7.0x to 8.0x range over the rating horizon.  Strong property-level EBITDA growth, lower leverage and the refinancing of  higher-cost debt support these expectations. Fitch defines FCC as recurring  operating EBITDA less renewal and replacement capital expenditures, divided by  cash interest expense and capitalized interest.  Diversified Portfolio  Host maintains a high-quality, geographically diversified portfolio of 98  consolidated luxury and upper upscale hotel properties across the U.S. including  nine international hotels located in, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and New  Zealand. The company's portfolio provides significant financial flexibility and  geographically diverse cash flows, which Fitch views positively. Heightened Event Risk Potential Fitch's ratings for Host do not contemplate a deviation from the company's  current financial policies. However, Fitch recognizes the heightened possibility  for 'event risk' in the form of a change in financial policy given the weak  absolute and relative performance of the company's shares and concerns expressed  by some market participants that the company's low leverage strategy is  suboptimal.  Share Repurchases Fitch's ratings for Host have some tolerance for share repurchases, provided the  company executes its program within its stated financial policies, primarily  sustaining leverage below 3.0x. Nevertheless, Fitch views share repurchases as a  credit negative, all else equal, that favor equity holders over bondholders. The company's board authorized a $500 million share repurchase program in  October 2015 to respond to the share underperformance. Host has repurchased  approximately 21 million shares for $338 million under its current  authorization, leaving $162 million of capacity remaining at June 30, 2016. Cyclicality Drives Earnings Volatility  The cyclical nature of the hotel industry is Fitch's primary credit concern.  Hotels re-price their inventory daily and, therefore, have the shortest lease  terms and least stable cash flows of any commercial property type. Economic  cycles, as well as exogenous events (i.e. acts of terrorism), have historically  caused material declines in revenues and profitability for hotels.  LIQUIDITY Host has a strong liquidity position that is underpinned by its committed  revolving credit facility and retained cash flows from operations. The company  has a coverage ratio of 1.8x, including estimated retained cash flows from  operations and no refinancing of maturing debt and 2.0x, assuming 80% of secured  debt is refinanced at maturity.  Fitch expects the company to exercise its option to extend maturity of its $500  million term loan due 2017 to 2019, which would result in a coverage ratio of  3.7x, including estimated retained cash flows from operations and no refinancing  of maturing debt and 4.2x, assuming 80% of secured debt is refinanced at  maturity. The Stable Outlook centers on Fitch's expectation that Host's credit profile  will remain appropriate for the 'BBB' rating through economic cycles, barring  any significant changes in the company's capital structure plans. The Stable  Outlook also reflects the quality of Host's portfolio and unencumbered asset  coverage that provides good downside protection to bondholders. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --U.S. lodging industry RevPAR grows 3%-4% during 2016 and 1%-2% in 2017 before  turning negative in 2018; upper-price-tier hotels deliver moderately  below-average RevPAR growth;  --Fitch expects Host's RevPAR growth trails the industry for the full year 2016  at 3% due to its portfolio exposures to weaker markets, such as New York City  and Washington, D.C. Fitch's 2016 and 1% 2017 RevPAR growth expectations assume  continued healthy group demand trends and a moderate benefit from its recently  renovated hotels. Host's 2016 RevPAR guidance of 2%-3% growth excludes recently  renovated hotels. Fitch has assumed a 2.5% RevPAR decline for Host during 2018; --Host's EBITDA margins are flat through 2017 and contract slightly in 2018,  excluding non-routine items; --Fitch expects annual maintenance capital expenditures of $300 million through  the forecast horizon. --Host completes the sale of two New Zealand hotels currently under contract in  2016. No further acquisitions or dispositions during the forecast period; --The company completes its $500 million share repurchase authorization during  2016. Fitch has also assumed no share repurchases in 2017-2019 as the  disposition slow and the company has publicly stated that it will not leverage  up beyond its policy targets to repurchase stock. RATING SENSITIVITIES --Host adopting a publicly stated leverage target below its current 2.5x to 3.0x  policy could lead to positive momentum. Fitch believes this is unlikely given  the company's growth strategy and historical financial policies. --Host revising its policy leverage target above 3.0x could have negative rating  implications. The ratings have limited tolerance for Host's leverage temporarily  increasing to the mid-3.0x range for a strategic acquisition and, to a lesser  extent share repurchases. This assumes we see a path for Host's leverage to  return to its 2.5x-3.0x policy range within approximately one year (strategic  acquisition) to six months (share repurchases) and that Fitch has a stable or  positive lodging industry outlook.   --Fitch's expectation for leverage to sustain above 4.0x over the rating  horizon, due to a cyclical lodging industry downturn could also lead to a  downgrade in the ratings and/or Outlook. Fitch has little or no tolerance for  Host's leverage exceeding 6.0x during a cyclical downturn at the 'BBB' rating  level.  --A U.S. lodging industry downturn more severe than Fitch's stress case scenario  could also cause a negative rating action. Fitch's stress case contemplates  industrywide RevPAR declines of 13%-15%, which is conservative, but less severe  than the 20% declines in 2008-2009.

Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. --Long-Term IDR to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured credit facility to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
