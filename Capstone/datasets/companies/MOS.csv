2,"  By Rod Nickel     Feb 11 Mosaic Co offered an encouraging outlook and announced a big share buyback on Tuesday, buoying the U.S. fertilizer company's stock even as it reported a 79 percent plunge in quarterly profit, a sharper decline than expected.    Last summer's breakup of the Belarusian Potash Co - one of the world's two dominant potash traders - caused a sharp drop in the price of the crop nutrient potash and a slide in grain prices has also weighed down phosphate. The lower prices dragged down Mosaic's profit in the fourth quarter.     Even so, Mosaic shares jumped 3.2 percent to $48.33 in early New York trading, as it said it would buy $1 billion in shares, topping up a $2 billion buyback announced in December.     ""You've got to like that,"" said Jim Llewellyn, portfolio manager at WorldCommodity Fund, a small investor in Mosaic. ""I wouldn't worry about the earnings.""     More importantly than the earnings miss is guidance for the current quarter that looks strong, Scotiabank analyst Ben Isaacson said in a note.     Mosaic forecast first-quarter phosphate sales volumes of 2.3 to 2.6 million tonnes, down from 2.7 million tonnes a year ago. It expects to earn a realized diammonium phosphate price of $390 to $420 per tonne, topping the fourth-quarter price.     Potash sales volumes look to range between 2.3 and 2.7 million tonnes in the current first quarter, Mosaic said, up from 2 million tonnes a year earlier. The company forecast a first quarter average realized price of $245 to $275 per tonne, lower than last quarter's price.     Chief Executive Jim Prokopanko said prices are already rebounding in phosphates and potash prices look to improve later this year.     ""The atrocious lack of buying in the last quarter is the common denominator"" in an expected pickup in demand for both nutrients, Prokopanko said in a Reuters interview.     The company confirmed its forecast for record 2014 global shipments of 64 to 66 million tonnes of phosphate and 57 to 59 million tonnes of potash.     The pace of potash shipments has already picked up substantially and looks to carry into the second quarter, said Rick McLellan, Mosaic's senior vice-president, commercial.     Canpotex Ltd, the offshore sales arm of Mosaic, Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Agrium Inc, should set a potash supply contract with Indian buyers by the end of April, Prokopanko said.     Phosphate prices have improved since late last year even without much Indian demand, but the world's biggest phosphate importer should buy a lot more in 2014, said Mike Rahm, Mosaic's vice-president of market analysis and strategic planning.      That said, the direction of grain prices and severe problems moving commodities in North America also look to influence fertilizer prices, Prokopanko said.     Frozen rivers in the United States and backlogged railways in Western Canada have left Mosaic behind on its shipping commitments, but could push up fertilizer prices, he said.     ""This is as bad as we've ever seen it ... People are going to be desperate. They'll pay higher for whatever's available.""     Mark Gulley, an analyst at BGC Financial Research, said he does not expect a return to larger potash profits any time soon because of industry over-capacity, but the prospects for phosphate are more promising.     Net earnings for the fourth quarter slid to $129 million, or 30 cents a share, the Plymouth, Minnesota-based company's second-smallest quarterly profit in four years. A year earlier, it earned $616 million, or $1.44 per share.     The results included one-time items that weakened earnings by 6 cents per share.     Revenue dropped 8 percent to $2.2 billion.     Analysts, on average, expected Mosaic to earn 42 cents a share on sales of $1.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc in late January reported its smallest quarterly profit in four years and produced disappointing 2014 forecasts.      Mosaic sold a record 3.4 million tonnes of phosphate in the fourth quarter, exceeding guidance of 2.5 to 2.9 million tonnes, at an average price of $381 per tonne of diammonium phosphate, within the guidance range but a 28 percent drop year over year.      The company sold 1.9 million tonnes of potash in the quarter, hitting the top end of its guidance range of 1.5 to 1.9 million tonnes, at an average realized price of $303 per tonne. That price fell within Mosaic's guidance range but was 30 percent cheaper than a year earlier.

ADM said it had been ""difficult for this business to consistently meet our return objectives"". Brazil is one of the world's biggest fertilizer importers due to nutrient-deficient soil and its huge annual crops of corn, soybeans and sugar cane. However, it can be difficult to move crops and nutrients because Brazil's transportation system is prone to bottlenecks.The acquisition of ADM's distribution business will accelerate Mosaic's growth plans in Brazil and ""replace a substantial amount of planned internal investments"" in the country, Mosaic said.

17,"  (Recasts with job cuts, CEO interview)By Rod NickelMay 6 U.S. fertilizer company Mosaic Co  said on Tuesday it will eliminate more than 500 jobs in the next year as it reported a larger-than-expected 43 percent drop in quarterly profit.The fertilizer sector has been under pressure since last summer's breakup of one of the world's biggest potash traders, Belarusian Potash Co, led to a steep drop in prices. Transportation problems in North America also dogged the industry during the frigid winter.Chief Executive Officer Jim Prokopanko said the Plymouth, Minnesota-based company will shed 550 to 560 jobs across the company, using layoffs, attrition, early retirement and  eliminating contractors. It said in October it aimed to cut $500 million in costs during the next five years, bolstering its status as a low-cost phosphate producer and reducing its relatively high cost of producing potash.""We feel we can reduce the spending because we have a sounder enterprise overall"" than previously, Prokopanko said in an interview. ""We've allowed ourselves to grow when times were good. Now we think we can be just as productive with fewer people.""Prokopanko said more than half of the jobs to be eliminated are not directly involved in production, but would not say how the cuts break down between the phosphate and potash segments.The company will shed another 200 jobs from previously announced asset sales in South America and the United States.Mosaic's job cuts follow rival Potash Corp of Saskatchewan's  move in December to slash its workforce by 18 percent, or more than 1,000 jobs.Mosaic's shares fell 2.3 percent to $48.54 on the New York Stock Exchange. POTASH OVERSUPPLY Prokopanko said the potash market looked oversupplied for the next three years as demand grows only modestly just as producers have expanded capacity.""It could be, just (based on) purely supply and demand, some tough sledding,"" he said on an earlier conference call.Prokopanko said the company will not halt expansion of the Esterhazy, Saskatchewan mine, but would not comment directly when asked if Mosaic may close or sell other potash mines. ""We look at our portfolio of assets frequently and we're always asking ourselves that question, that's all I'll say. We're looking to maximize production to our lowest cost facilities and balance the supply with the actual market demand,"" he told Reuters.The company's dividend is secure and it will carry out its share buyback program as planned, Prokopanko said.The cost-cutting comes on the heels of two acquisitions. Mosaic said in April it would buy Archer Daniels Midland Co's  fertilizer distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay for $350 million. It recently bought the phosphate business of CF Industries Holdings Inc for $1.4 billion.""I don't think they're conflicting messages,"" Prokopanko said in the interview. ""With a cyclical low, you have to trim your sales, but that's a time you have to have the courage and the conviction in your sectors to strike when assets come for sale.""Mosaic forecast global potash shipments to rebound in 2014 by 7 percent to a record 57.4 million tonnes. Phosphate shipments look to rise 4 percent to a record 65.5 million. ""Prices are still bumping along the bottom,"" but volumes are starting to return, said BGC Financial analyst Mark Gulley.First-quarter net earnings fell to $217.5 million, or 54 cents per share, from $379.8 million, or 89 cents, a year ago, while net sales tumbled 14 percent to nearly $2 billion.Analysts expected Mosaic, the world's largest producer of finished phosphate products, to earn 59 cents a share on sales of $2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The quarterly results were ""outstanding"" in the trough of a market, Prokopanko said.Average realized prices of diammonium phosphate and muriate of potash fell 16 percent and 29 percent to $414 and $267 per tonne, respectively, but came within forecast ranges.Mosaic said it sold 2.7 million tonnes of phosphate in the first quarter, flat versus last year but topping its forecast of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes.The company sold 2.4 million tonnes of potash in the quarter, within its outlook of 2.3 million to 2.7 million tonnes and ahead of the year-ago total of 2 million tonnes.For the second quarter, Mosaic forecast phosphate sales volumes of 3.1 million to 3.4 million tonnes, up from 2.9 million last year. It said potash sales should range from 2.2 to 2.5 million tonnes, compared with 2.4 million a year earlier.Prokopanko said in March he has cancer but would keep a regular schedule as CEO as he underwent chemotherapy. On Tuesday, he said he felt ""fit and well.""

27,"  (Updates with CEO interview, comments from other producers, analyst)By Rod NickelSept 30 Mosaic Co, the world's largest maker of finished phosphate products, said on Tuesday it will reduce phosphate output due to rising costs, while it also moderated its sales expectations.The U.S. fertilizer producer said the output cut, due to the high costs of raw materials sulfur and ammonia, is not expected to result in layoffs.The reduction comes as corn and soybean prices have fallen to multiyear lows due to expectations of record U.S. production. Softening prices reduce the income farmers have to spend on fertilizer, although big crops offset the price drop somewhat.Costs have escalated with strong demand for sulfur and due to ammonia output curtailments in Ukraine, Trinidad and elsewhere.Mosaic is setting its phosphate production levels on a month to month basis, Chief Executive Officer Jim Prokopanko said in an interview. He declined to quantify the size of the cut but said it would be ""system-wide"". The company operates facilities in Florida and Louisiana. ""The timing is going to be largely dependent on how these markets react, what happens to our raw material costs,"" Prokopanko said.""We don't want to take a risk of having very high-priced inventories and possibly weaker pricing.""The company last reduced phosphate output in late 2011. Mosaic sold 11.2 million tonnes of phosphate last year. It has invested billions in boosting phosphate capacity, acquiring operations this year from CF Industries Holdings Inc and forming a joint venture in 2013 with Ma'aden and Saudi Basic Industries Corp SJSC in Saudi Arabia.The fourth quarter is typically a slow period for phosphate sales, but Prokopanko said the curtailments could tighten supplies for the spring planting season.Benchmark Tampa, Florida, ammonia prices recently reached the highest level since early 2013, while prices for diammonium phosphate have fallen, said Citi Research analyst P.J. Juvekar. Potash Corp of Saskatchewan downsized its phosphate operations in December and isn't planning further cuts, spokesman Bill Johnson said.Agrium Inc isn't as vulnerable to cost pressures because it produces its own ammonia for phosphate production, and has long-term sulfur supply contracts, spokesman Richard Downey said.Mosaic expects third-quarter potash and phosphate sales volumes to fall to the lower end of its forecasts. The revised guidance is due to New Mexico floods and Saskatchewan lightning storms that caused outages in potash production, as well as timing problems with phosphate shipments.The company, based in Plymouth, Minnesota, said on July 31 it expected phosphate sales to range from 3.3 million to 3.6 million tonnes in the third quarter, up from 2.7 million a year ago. It saw potash sales at 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes, up from 1.4 million tonnes.Prices of the nutrients should remain near the midpoint of its outlook, Mosaic said.Mosaic shares were down 2.5 percent at $44.30 on Tuesday morning.

Net phosphate sales rose 21 percent to $1.7 billion. The average realized price of diammonium phosphate rose 5.7 percent to $461 per tonne.

It forecast prices at $275 to $295 per tonne. The company reported a nearly 29 percent rise in potash sales to 1.8 million tonnes in the third quarter.

Canpotex is owned by Mosaic, Potash Corp of Saskatchewan  and Agrium Inc.""China's holding firm,"" Prokopanko said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ""As one shareholder, my advice to Canpotex is, 'just hold firm.' ""I'm in no rush.""Sinofert's argument for a price freeze is partly based on a 35 percent year over year reduction in freight rates from Vancouver, British Columbia to Asian markets, cutting the producers' costs, Prokopanko said. From the producers' standpoint, potash is already moving smoothly to other buyers, he said. Agrium said on Tuesday that its potash production is fully committed for the first half of the year.Contracts between major potash producers and Sinofert traditionally set a global price floor, and are followed by supply agreements with Indian buyers.

39,"  WINNIPEG, Manitoba, March 19 Mosaic Co, North America's second-largest potash producer, is seeking a simpler potash tax and royalty system in the resource-rich Canadian province of Saskatchewan, spokeswoman Sarah Fedorchuk said on Thursday. Saskatchewan said on Wednesday that it will require potash mining companies to take tax deductions based on their capital spending over a longer period of time. The government said the move was an interim step and it plans a broader review of the system. The interim changes will have no significant impact on near-term earnings for Agrium Inc , which just finished expanding its Vanscoy, Saskatchewan mine, said spokesman Todd Coakwell.

41,"  (Adds Potash Corp comment, report on price)By Rod NickelWINNIPEG, Manitoba, March 30 Canpotex Ltd, the offshore potash sales arm of North America's Potash Corp of Saskatchewan , Mosaic Co and Agrium Inc , said on Monday it had set 2015 supply contracts with major Chinese buyers, including Sinofert Holdings Ltd, and expected higher volume.Canpotex did not release price terms for the fertilizer contracts, but said shipments to China will reach at least 1.8 million tonnes, up from 1.6 million in 2014, and may be as much as 2.5 million tonnes, depending on supply, demand and logistics.The settlement comes months later than usual, and the delay had fueled speculation that the contract system would not continue. Chinese and Indian buyers purchase the crop nutrient through annual contracts, while U.S., Brazilian and other buyers make purchases on the spot market. Earlier this month, Belaruskali was the first major potash trader to announce an agreement with China. The first contract with China usually sets a benchmark for others.Belarus said it increased the price of potash exports to China by $10 to $315 per tonne, which was lower than expected, according to Russian rival Uralkali. BMO Capital Markets, citing a report by Argus Media, said Canpotex settled with Sinofert at the same $315 price, as had been expected.Potash Corp spokesman Randy Burton declined to confirm the price but said it was competitive with earlier deals. Mosaic Chief Executive Jim Prokopanko said in February that Sinofert wanted to pay the same rate as last year, while Canpotex was seeking a $25 per tonne increase to $330.Shares of Potash Corp and Agrium gained about 2 percent in Toronto, while Mosaic also rose in morning trading in New York.Spokespersons for Canpotex, Mosaic, Agrium, Sinofert and Uralkali could not be reached for comment immediately.

45,"   By Rod Nickel  U.S. fertilizer producer Mosaic Co boosted its chief executive officer's pay last year by more than $5 million as a reward for slashing costs and jobs, a regulatory filing shows.Construction of excess potash capacity and fiercer competition have pressured the sector, and leading North American producers Mosaic, Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Agrium Inc have chopped expenses.  Mosaic CEO Jim Prokopanko collected $5.3 million more in stock awards last year, taking the value of his pay package to $14.8 million, up $5.5 million, according to a filing last week.Mosaic executives got shares as an incentive to save costs, spokesman Ben Pratt said. Minnesota-based Mosaic, which has a $16.4 billion market cap, said in 2013 it would cut $500 million in operating costs over five years, including about 550 jobs. Prokopanko said on March 31 that the company was ahead of schedule in finding savings.  The recent filing said cost-cutting incentives ""enhance our alignment of executive compensation with stockholder interests and will significantly benefit us and our stockholders by helping ensure that Mosaic remains a low-cost producer.""Mosaic's stock price and net earnings both slipped about 3 percent in 2014. Shareholders will vote on Mosaic executive pay and the incentives at its May 14 annual meeting. Rewarding executives for cutting jobs and costs is ""a very bad idea,"" said Yvan Allaire, executive chair of the Montreal-based Institute for Governance of Private and Public Organizations.""In terms of the sense of sharing, the spirit that, 'we're all in the same boat in this company,' what we do with this (pay approach) really is create two boats - a yacht and a very small dinghy,"" Allaire said. Potash Corp paid former CEO Bill Doyle and other executives more in 2014 largely because of interest rate fluctuations that affected the company's short-term pension obligations, spokesman Randy Burton said. Doyle, who was replaced as CEO midway through 2014 but remained senior adviser, earned $7.9 million, up from $6.4 million. His salary was unchanged at $1.3 million and Doyle received no stock awards.Agrium paid CEO Chuck Magro $6 million in 2014, his first year on the job, slightly less than it did in 2013 when he was chief operating officer.

47,"   By Alastair Sharp | TORONTO  TORONTO Canadian tech start-up Mosaic is putting color into low-end 3D printers in a move to make the technology more accessible for everything from architectural modeling to medical training.Mosaic is one of the latest in a slew of Canadian start-ups to jump into hardware, as the tech landscape, especially in the hardware segment enjoys a revival in Canada. Canadian hardware, once dominated by BlackBerry Ltd and its devices, has been relatively quiet over the last decade. The slide in BlackBerry's fortunes has partially led to a surge in the number of Canadian hardware-focused start-ups in recent years. Companies like Aeryon Labs, which makes drones, to  Clearpath Robotics, which makes mobile robots and Nymi, the maker of a wristband that authenticates a person's identity by using their cardiac rhythm are among the firms leading the Canadian resurgence. Montreal-based Mosaic is hoping to capitalize on a rapidly growing 3D printer market. More than 108,000 3D printers shipped in 2014 and numbers should double every year, hitting 2.3 million by 2018, according to a forecast from technology research firm  Gartner.""Parents will have a 3D printer at home for their secondary and post-secondary students taking design, engineering or arts courses,"" said Pete Basiliere, an imaging and print services analyst at Gartner. ""There is a vast market of consumers worldwide who have the means to afford a 3D printer for their home,"" he said.  Mosaic, whose device feeds multiple colors into the most common 3D printers, is taking pre-orders on a sub-$1,000 product called the Palette. The device offer an option to make 3D color prints and is compatible with most low-end 3D printers and should be compatible with future models as well. Early indications are that interest in the Palette is high, as Mosaic, which began a crowd-funding campaign to raise some C$75,000 ($61,064) for the first production run of the model on Tuesday, raised more than 90 percent of its goal within the first hour.  Some are already lining up to get their hands on the device that is expected to launch early next year. Paul Fotheringham, a former investment banker turned 3D print maven, plans to scoop up one of the first production models for a pilot project at a hospital in Liverpool.

49,"  (Adds Mosaic comments on demand, share activity, sales forecast)April 30 North America's two biggest potash producers, Potash Corp of Saskatchewan  and Mosaic Co, reported larger first-quarter profits on Thursday, but results missed expectations.Canada's Potash Corp, the world's biggest fertilizer maker by market capitalization, cut its full-year profit forecast, and both companies warned potash prices could slide.Prices are yet to recover after a collapse in 2013, which was triggered by Russia's Uralkali exiting a trading venture with Belarus. Prices have since improved but are under pressure from increased competition and a surplus of production capacity.Weaker prices may stimulate demand later this year. Mosaic and Potash nudged higher their forecasts for 2015 global potash shipments, which they say could reach 60 million tonnes.""With a strong second half to refill and meet the growing demand we're seeing in India and China, we think we're going into a tight potash market in the second half,"" Mosaic Chief Executive Officer Jim Prokopanko said. Potash cut its full-year profit outlook to $1.75-$2.05 per share from $1.90-$2.20 per share, factoring in higher taxes in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan and the disappointing quarter.The change sent Potash shares down 2 percent in New York and 1 percent in Toronto. Mosaic shares rose slightly. Potash forecast second-quarter profit of 45 cents to 55 cents per share, lower than analysts' average estimate of 56 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Potash reported first-quarter profit of $370 million, or 44 cents per share, up from last year's $340 million, or 40 cents, but missing the average estimate of 49 cents.Mosaic earned $295 million, or 80 cents, up from $218 million and 54 cents. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 70 cents per share, missing analysts' estimate of 74 cents. For the second quarter, Mosaic expects to sell 2.3 million to 2.7 million tonnes of phosphates, compared with 2.6 million a year earlier, at $425 to $450 per tonne for diammonium phosphate, the most widely used phosphorus fertilizer. It sees sales of 2 million to 2.4 million tonnes of potash during the quarter, down from 2.5 million, at $265 to $290 per tonne.Phosphates and potash are two of the most important crop nutrients.Prokopanko said Canpotex, the offshore potash seller for Mosaic, Potash and Agrium Inc, expects to sign a contract with Indian buyers in May.Potash's revenue slipped marginally to $1.67 billion, Mosaic's revenue rose 7.7 percent to $2.14 billion.

56,"   By Shubhankar Chakravorty and Rod Nickel  U.S. fertilizer company Mosaic Co (MOS.N) reported a much higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by strong phosphates sales and improved potash prices.Mosaic's shares rose 2.8 percent to $43.96 in New York.Second-quarter net earnings climbed 57 percent to $390.6 million, or $1.08 per share.On an adjusted basis, Mosaic, the world's largest producer of finished phosphate products, earned $1.05 per share, above the average analyst estimate of 89 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales rose 2 percent to $2.5 billion, in line with expectations.Joc O'Rourke, currently chief operating officer, takes over as chief executive on Wednesday, succeeding Jim Prokopanko. The move completes the changing of the guard at North America's biggest fertilizer companies, following Potash Corp of Saskatchewan (POT.TO), Agrium Inc (AGU.TO) and CF Industries (CF.N).O'Rourke, 54, said in an interview that the company will keep its capital priorities of first sustaining existing businesses, followed by maintaining its dividend and growing internally; acquisition opportunities; and returning cash to shareholders. Opportunities to buy potash companies may become more scarce if Potash Corp succeeds in buying K+S (SDFGn.DE), O'Rourke said.""The (potash) industry is reasonably concentrated and a lot of M&A-type growth is going to be difficult, and particularly if this next move by our one competitor is done,"" he said.Potash Corp said last week that if it acquires K+S, it hopes to export potash from the German miner's Western Canada mine through Canpotex, its sales partnership with Mosaic and Agrium. Prokopanko said Mosaic would not object.Mosaic said its joint venture to produce phosphate in Saudi Arabia with Ma'aden will cost $500 million more to build than expected, for a total of $8 billion. Phosphates sales rose 8 percent to 2.8 million tonnes in the second quarter, while the average realized diammonium phosphate price fell 3.2 percent to $450 per tonne.Mosaic expects to sell 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes of phosphates at $435-$455 per tonne in the current quarter. North America's second-biggest potash producer said second-quarter potash sales fell 8 percent to 2.3 million tonnes from a year earlier, while the average realized potash price rose 5 percent to $280 per tonne.Mosaic expects to sell 1.6 million to 2.0 million tonnes of potash at an average $260-$280 per tonne in the third quarter.Mosaic narrowed its 2015 phosphate sales forecast to 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes from 9 million to 10 million.The company cut its potash sales forecast for the year to 8.2 million to 8.6 million tonnes from 8.5 million to 9.0 million.

61,"  SAO PAULO Aug 12 Fertilizer sales in Brazil will likely be between 30 million and 31 million tonnes in 2015, down from 32.2 million tonnes in 2014 due to market uncertainty, the head of U.S. fertilizer company Mosaic Co in Brazil, Floris Bielders, said on Wednesday.Bielders said farmers were not booking sales as far in advance as usual, which could result in a crunch at Brazilian ports when the imported products finally arrive, potentially resulting in delayed delivery.Farmers will start planting the 2015/16 grain crops in mid-September in Brazil, the world's No. 2 soybean producer, and analysts expect soy area to expand less than in recent years with lower margins expected. Late or decreased application of fertilizer could result in lower yields from the upcoming crops. ""Farmers are waiting because there is a lot of volatility in prices of the grains and of the fertilizers,"" Bielders told Reuters at an event in Sao Paulo, adding that a weaker Brazilian currency had made the cost of imported fertilizers more expensive. Farmers benefit from the real, which has been trading at its weakest levels in 12 years, when they sell soybeans and other crops that are priced in dollars.Mosaic is the world's largest producer of finished phosphate products.

""We are managing our production levels to match current demand, controlling our costs, and maintaining our discipline,"" said Chief Executive Joc O'Rourke, who took over in August. Mosaic, North America's second-biggest potash producer, said potash volumes for the third quarter are expected to be in the bottom half of its guidance range of 1.6 million to 2 million tonnes. The average selling price for muriate of potash is expected to be in the bottom half of the previously announced range of $260 to $280 per tonne. The world's largest producer of finished phosphate products said phosphate volumes are expected to be at the low end of its range of 2.1 to 2.4 million tonnes for the third quarter.

80,"   By Nichola Groom  Solar Mosaic Inc, a former crowdfunding startup that reinvented itself as a provider of home solar loans, said on Wednesday it had secured $200 million in funding that will support at least 5,000 rooftop installations.Germany's DZ Bank and New York state's NY Green Bank provided the warehouse financing to the Oakland, California-based company, which goes by Mosaic.The announcement marks the largest funding to date for Mosaic, which in the last two years has grown into the nation's top loan provider for residential solar installations, Chief Executive Billy Parish said in an interview.The company offers its loans through some of the top U.S. solar installers, including Vivint Solar, SunPower Corp and NRG Energy Inc.Mosaic's average loan amount is $30,000, Parish said. The loans can be structured to be paid over 10, 15, 20 or 25 years, with interest rates between 2.49 percent and 7.99 percent. Customers are saving 15 percent on their electricity bills, on average, he added.Founded five years ago, Mosaic first grabbed headlines as a scrappy solar financing company that raised money from retail investors who put up as little as $25 to fund commercial solar projects.By 2014, however, the company had shifted its focus to the fast-growing residential sector and raising funds from institutional investors. Two years later, Mosaic said it aims to originate $1 billion in home solar loans in the next year.The U.S. residential solar market has grown dramatically over the last decade thanks mainly to financing schemes like leases and power purchase agreements pioneered by SolarCity Corp and Sunrun Inc. In the last three years, however, loans have grown in popularity. With a loan, a homeowner owns the rooftop solar system outright and can claim generous federal tax credits. With a lease or PPA, the system is owned by a third party, such as a bank, that claims the tax credit.Mosaic has made strides in an area of the market in which SolarCity, the top U.S. solar installer, has stumbled. The company recently stopped offering the loan product it introduced in 2014 after it received criticism for its complex payment structure, which fluctuated depending on the amount of energy the system produced.

81,"   By Nichola Groom  Solar Mosaic Inc, a former crowdfunding startup that reinvented itself as a provider of home solar loans, said on Wednesday it had secured $200 million in funding that will support at least 5,000 rooftop installations.Germany's DZ Bank and New York state's NY Green Bank provided the warehouse financing to the Oakland, California-based company, which goes by Mosaic.The announcement marks the largest funding to date for Mosaic, which in the last two years has grown into the nation's top loan provider for residential solar installations, Chief Executive Billy Parish said in an interview.The company offers its loans through some of the top U.S. solar installers, including Vivint Solar, SunPower Corp and NRG Energy Inc.Mosaic's average loan amount is $30,000, Parish said. The loans can be structured to be paid over 10, 15, 20 or 25 years, with interest rates between 2.49 percent and 7.99 percent. Customers are saving 15 percent on their electricity bills, on average, he added.Founded five years ago, Mosaic first grabbed headlines as a scrappy solar financing company that raised money from retail investors who put up as little as $25 to fund commercial solar projects.By 2014, however, the company had shifted its focus to the fast-growing residential sector and raising funds from institutional investors. Two years later, Mosaic said it aims to originate $1 billion in home solar loans in the next year.The U.S. residential solar market has grown dramatically over the last decade thanks mainly to financing schemes like leases and power purchase agreements pioneered by SolarCity Corp and Sunrun Inc. In the last three years, however, loans have grown in popularity. With a loan, a homeowner owns the rooftop solar system outright and can claim generous federal tax credits. With a lease or PPA, the system is owned by a third party, such as a bank, that claims the tax credit.Mosaic has made strides in an area of the market in which SolarCity, the top U.S. solar installer, has stumbled. The company recently stopped offering the loan product it introduced in 2014 after it received criticism for its complex payment structure, which fluctuated depending on the amount of energy the system produced. It also had a lengthy 30-year term.SolarCity could still emerge as a formidable competitor, however. A company spokesman, Jonathan Bass, said SolarCity's next generation of loans would have multiple term options and a fixed payment schedule.

99,"   By Rod Nickel  A sinkhole spanning 45 feet (13.7 meters) in diameter opened at a Mosaic Co phosphate fertilizer facility in Florida, leaking 215 million gallons of ""slightly radioactive water,"" a company spokesman said on Friday.Mosaic said the monitoring system at its New Wales facility at Mulberry, Florida, showed a decline in water levels on Aug. 27 from the retention pond of a phosphogypsum stack, a hill of hazardous waste. Phosphogypsum is a radioactive byproduct resulting from the production of phosphate.The Minnesota-based company immediately reported the incident to state and federal environmental authorities, Mosaic spokesman Ben Pratt said on Friday. But it did not otherwise report it publicly until posting information on its website on Thursday, he said.The leaked water is enough to fill more than 300 Olympic swimming pools.The nearly three-week gap between detecting the sinkhole and reporting it to the public is alarming, said Jacki Lopez, Florida director of the Center for Biological Diversity. ""It’s hard to trust them when they say 'Don’t worry,' when they’ve been keeping it secret for three weeks,"" she said.The sinkhole, located about 30 miles from Tampa, damaged the liner system at the base of the stack, causing the pond on top to drain. Seepage continued and the sinkhole reached Florida's aquifer, Mosaic said on its website.  Specific environmental and health concerns are the release of uranium, radium and radon gas, Lopez said. Once contaminants reach the aquifer, which extends from central Florida to Georgia, they can potentially travel hundreds of miles, she said.""We don't know what the long-term effects will be,"" said Lopez. ""If I were living in this area, and I had well water, I would be worried about my health.""Mosaic said it had increased monitoring and sampling of groundwater and found no offsite impact. It also said it pumped water out of the affected pond to reduce the volume of leakage. The company said it is attempting to recover the water through production wells on site.The incident has not interrupted operations at the facility.Mosaic shares fell 1.7 percent, declining with other major fertilizer producers.In 2015, Mosaic reached an $800 million settlement with U.S. regulators over its waste management practices at plants in Florida and Louisiana.

The retention pond of a phosphogypsum stack, a hill of hazardous waste generated by phosphate production, leaked the equivalent of 326 Olympic swimming pools of contaminated water into a Florida aquifer. Samples were collected from wells within three to five miles of Mosaic's facility at Mulberry, Florida, by environmental consulting firm ECT.
