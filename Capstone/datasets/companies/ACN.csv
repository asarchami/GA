0,"   By Roberta Rampton and Caroline Humer  The U.S. government will part ways next month with contractor CGI Federal over the troubled Obamacare enrollment website, HealthCare.gov, which failed to work when it launched in October for millions of Americans shopping for insurance, the company said on Friday.HealthCare.gov struggled with error messages and slow speeds for weeks after its October 1 launch, creating a political crisis for President Barack Obama, threatening the roll-out of his signature healthcare law and emboldening its foes among Republican lawmakers to call for its repeal.CGI Federal, a subsidiary of CGI Group, built the website.Its contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible for the roll out of the Affordable Care Act, was originally awarded in 2011 and is scheduled to end February 28.CMS would not confirm or deny CGI's departure. ""We are working with our contract partners to make a mutually agreed upon transition to ensure that HealthCare.gov continues to operate smoothly for consumers,"" a CMS spokeswoman said.Obama has said the fiasco with HealthCare.gov has made him want to overhaul the way the federal government buys technology services. Critics say the system favors large, established contractors such as CGI.""At the end of the day, you have a company here that turned in subpar and visibly high-profile work. I think that that's a fireable offense,"" said Clay Johnson, chief executive officer of the Department of Better Technology, and former Presidential Innovation Fellow who has pushed for procurement reforms.But the government appears poised to replace CGI with another large contractor. The Washington Post, which first broke the news, reported that Accenture will get a year-long contract for the website worth about $90 million.The government's dissatisfaction over the website's early crashes, as well as aspects of the site that still do not work, prompted the switch, the Post reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.In an emailed statement, an Accenture spokesman said, ""We are in discussions with clients and prospective clients all the time - but it is not appropriate to discuss new business opportunities we may or may not be pursuing.""Johnson called the news ""disappointing"" and pointed to examples of poorly managed Accenture contracts highlighted by the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. For example, the company was publicly faulted by the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) for costly delays and other problems during a major IT overhaul, Johnson noted.""We'll see how well they do, but Accenture doesn't have a strong reputation of doing this stuff successfully,"" Johnson said.CASEWORKER SYSTEM FOR TRICKY CASES Officials from the administration and CGI had assured Congress over the summer that HealthCare.gov would open on time and work as intended.At a September 10 hearing, CGI vice president Cheryl Campbell testified that the company ""is confident that it will deliver the functionality that CMS has directed to enable qualified individuals to begin enrolling in coverage when the initial enrollment period begins on October 1.""Instead, the site failed to load, returned countless error messages, and generally thwarted the attempts of millions of users to create accounts, shop for coverage or enroll. The administration eventually acknowledged that the fault lay in hundreds of coding errors in the software CGI wrote, and the White House brought in trusted Obama aide Jeffrey Zients to fix the site by the end of November.The improvements allowed more than 1.1 million people to shop for and enroll in insurance on HealthCare.gov by the end of 2013, far short of original hopes for early enrollment.Although the site is vastly improved, technical glitches continue to bedevil enrollment. There are about 13,000 people who are now in a ""caseworker system"" to try to resolve particularly thorny technical issues, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.The website still lacks several ""back end"" features, such as a payment system for insurance companies.The deadline for signing up for 2014 health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is March 31, meaning the new contractor will take over at a time when the government needs the site to handle what it hopes will be a surge of last-minute sign-ups. ""With only limited days to enroll, the government is rolling the dice, and the new vendor could be a savior or a bust if new problems arise,"" said Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight.But Peter Neupert, an operating partner with Health Evolution Partners, a private equity firm that invests in health companies, said he did not think the switch in contractors likely would affect the website, which is now overseen by Kurt DelBene, a former Microsoft executive.""This appears to be about getting a new, hopefully better, team for the next few cycles of iteration,"" Neupert said, noting he suspects DelBene will have a ""transition plan"" to manage the change.'A VERY, VERY GOOD THING' This is at least the second contract switch for HealthCare.gov. In November, CMS said it would not renew its contract with Verizon Communication Inc's Terremark unit for computer servers hosting the troubled website and instead award a contract for that work to Hewlett-Packard Co.Terremark's contract ends on March 30, the day before the sign-up deadline. The Terremark servers suffered at least one outage last fall that lasted for hours, making the website inaccessible.Despite the bad publicity from the website woes, two analysts said they did not expect CGI to take a significant hit from the end of the HealthCare.gov contract.""You could say what they're losing in effect is this $90 million, 12-month contract, which in the context of a $10 billion revenue company is nothing,"" said one of the analysts, who declined to be quoted by name.U.S.-listed shares of CGI Group closed at $31.58, down 2.9 percent.The second analyst said CGI might be better off to not be associated with the highly politicized project. ""We will never hear CGI's name associated with Obamacare, which, frankly, is a very, very good thing,"" the analyst said.(Additional reporting by Sandra Maler in Washington, Lewis Krauskopf and Sharon Begley in New York, and Leah Schnurr in Toronto; Editing by Karey Van Hall, Michele Gershberg, Nick Zieminski, Dan Grebler and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-01-10,ACN,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 6:53pm EST",U.S. to part with contractor CGI for Obamacare website,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-healthcare-cgi-idUSBREA090Y520140110?type=companyNews

6,"  Unpredictability is the abiding theme for this week's WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona where every player in the 64-man field is prepared to expect the unexpected.Because of the sheer lottery of the matchplay format, good form does not guarantee success in Wednesday's opening round and a player could easily be sent packing despite piling up a bunch of birdies in a bogey-free display.""We know you can shoot 64 and someone else shoot 63 and you're going home,"" Swedish world number three Henrik Stenson told reporters at Dove Mountain on Tuesday.""You can shoot 74 and you still squeeze by because the other guy is having a worse day than you are having.""You've got to be able to squeeze by on the matches when you're not playing that well. Hopefully you'll win the ones where you're playing well. It's all about timing in that sense.""Stenson is the tournament's top seed with world number one Tiger Woods and second-ranked Australian Adam Scott opting not to play in the first of the year's four WGC events.He said he felt no added pressure due to his elevated status.""I don't think it makes a difference for me here,"" explained the 37-year-old Swede. ""If you're going to have a good week, you need to play well. ""You need to have better luck on your side and it doesn't really matter if you're No. 1 seed or if you're No. 50 coming into this week.""Stenson, who ended a stellar 2013 campaign by topping the European Tour's money list after also securing FedExCup honours on the PGA Tour, will come up against Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat in the first round.BLURRED EXPECTATIONS Former world number one Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, who was beaten by American Hunter Mahan in the 2012 final, said the event's unpredictability made it very difficult to hold any expectations for the week. ""What is a good week? You could shoot 67 tomorrow and be going home,"" said McIlroy, 24. ""It's hard to know. You have to take one match at a time.""The year that I got to the final here, I didn't play very well the first three days and then my game started to come around. I played well in the quarters, the semis and the final, as well.""It's just one of those formats ... someone can get hot and that can be it. Expectations, I've just got to go out and try to beat whoever I'm up against,"" added McIlroy, who meets American Boo Weekley in the opening round. Mahan, who also reached the final last year before losing to compatriot Matt Kuchar 2&1, was delighted be back at a venue where he has produced a lot of winning golf.""Excited to be here, excited about this event,"" said Mahan, who will face Spaniard Gonzalo Fenz-Castano on Wednesday. ""Obviously I enjoy this golf course. It's a lot of fun to play.""Wherever you're drawn, you're going to have to beat some good players.

7,"  Jimmy Walker, arguably the hottest player in the game, drew first blood at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship with a commanding 5&4 win over South Africa's Branden Grace in Marana, Arizona on Wednesday.American Walker, who has already triumphed three times on the 2013-14 PGA Tour, never trailed in his first-round match at Dove Mountain before sealing victory with a 15-foot birdie putt at the par-four 14th.He will next play fellow American Rickie Fowler, who pulled off an upset 2&1 win over matchplay expert and 2010 champion Ian Poulter of England.In other early matches, Bubba Watson clawed his way back from two down after 12 holes to battle past Finland's Mikko Ilonen 2&1 while South African George Coetzee won 3&1 against a rusty Steve Stricker.Walker, making his debut in the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event, was delighted to maintain his red-hot early season form.""I played pretty solid all day, hit a lot of really good shots, made some birdie putts,"" Walker told reporters. ""You've got to go out and continue to hit good shots and make good putts.""Branden had a couple of three-putts early in the round and that got me up to a pretty good little lead. Just kind of stayed nice and steady and then closed it off with two birdies there at the end."" MATCHPLAY PROWESS Fowler took advantage of a sub-par performance by Poulter, who is renowned for his steely matchplay prowess, especially in the Ryder Cup.""I knew it was going to be a tough match today, no matter if Poulter is not on his game,"" said Fowler. ""He wasn't playing great today, but I knew he was going to find a way to hang around. ""Obviously it feels good to get a win against him, against anyone. I'm excited for tomorrow.""Fowler knows he will have his hands full against Walker, who won the season-opening Frys.com Open in October before adding further victories at the Sony Open in January and the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am earlier this month.""He's best player in the world right now, coming off three wins,"" said Fowler. ""He's going to be tough to beat. I'll have to be on top of my game and make some putts."" Left-hander Watson, who clinched his fifth PGA Tour title at the Northern Trust Open on Sunday, was relieved to pull out a comeback win with four birdies in his last five holes.""I fought hard,"" said Watson. ""My caddie just said, 'Keep going, keep going, give me one hole, give me one hole.' He kept pushing me and somehow it came out to me winning.""It's a just short week. You have one less day than normal to prepare, so the energy level is just not where I want it to be. Hopefully some rest today ... be ready tomorrow.""In other matches, former world number one Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland was all square with American Boo Weekley after five holes while top-seeded Swede Henrik Stenson was one up on Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat after one.U.S. Open champion Justin Rose of England, the second seed, was scheduled to play against American Scott Piercy in one of the day's late matches.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Gene Cherry)",2014-02-19,ACN,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 2:59pm EST","Early Match Play wins for Walker, Watson and Fowler",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-idUSBREA1I1YW20140219?type=companyNews

9,"  The sheer lottery of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship was again front and center on Thursday as top seed Henrik Stenson of Sweden and fourth-seeded Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy were both eliminated in the second round.Stenson, the 2007 champion, never led before going down 4&3 to South African Louis Oosthuizen while McIlroy lost a see-sawing encounter with American Harris English after 19 holes at Dove Mountain.McIlroy, beaten by American Hunter Mahan in the 2012 final, had clawed his way back from two down after 13 holes to edge one up after 16 on another breezy day of dazzling sunshine in Arizona's high desert.However, English levelled the match with a birdie at the par-four 17th and sealed victory after his opponent made a compete hash of the 19th.""Obviously a little bit disappointed with how I finished,"" McIlroy told reporters. ""Being two down with five to go, playing the last five holes like I did, I was happy about that.""I didn't hit the greatest drive off the 19th and got a pretty bad lie in the rough. It was just unfortunate. I played pretty well for the most part.""But, you know, he played really solid today and didn't really do much wrong, didn't really give me anything. So the more consistent player won at the end of the day.""English will next face Jim Furyk, the PGA Tour veteran having beaten former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South Africa 3&2. Oosthuizen won three of the first four holes against a sub-par Stenson and maintained control before ending the match with a birdie at the par-four 15th.""I played pretty solid today,"" Oosthuizen said. ""I just kept it together. Henrik didn't start very well and I made an early lead.""I just played solid and made nice putts on the back nine. I'm playing well. I'm just trying to keep the ball in play so that I'm in every hole I'm playing.""GIANT-KILLING WAYS  Rickie Fowler continued his giant-killing ways with a one-up win over in-form fellow American Jimmy Walker and will next meet Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who beat good friend Bill Haas of the United States 3&1.Fowler came from one down with three holes to play, sealing his second win of the week with a birdie on 16 followed by well executed par saves on 17 and 18.""I told my caddie, 'Joe, let's try and birdie the last three, make some good swings',"" Fowler said.

10,"  Unpredictability was again a recurring theme at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship as former champions Ian Poulter and Luke Donald of England, and American Zach Johnson, were all eliminated in Wednesday's first round.While American Jimmy Walker maintained his red-hot form this season with a commanding 5&4 win over South Africa's Branden Grace, matchplay expert and 2010 winner Poulter was upset 2&1 by American Rickie Fowler in the 64-player event at Dove Mountain.Donald, who clinched the 2011 title, was hammered 5&4 by Italy's Matteo Manassero and world number six Johnson, the tournament's third seed who is known for his gritty play, was stunned 5&4 by South Africa's Richard Sterne.Long-hitting Dustin Johnson, who has triumphed once and been a runner-up twice in just four starts on the 2013-14 PGA Tour, also made an unexpected early exit, going down 4&3 to Swede Peter Hanson.In total, there were nine upsets based on seedings from the 32 matches at Dove Mountain as the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event once again lived up to its reputation for wild uncertainty and sharp swings in fortune.Fowler took advantage of a sub-par performance by Poulter, who is renowned for his steely matchplay prowess, especially in the Ryder Cup.""I knew it was going to be a tough match today, no matter if Poulter is not on his game,"" Fowler told reporters. ""He wasn't playing great, but I knew he was going to find a way to hang around.""Obviously it feels good to get a win against him, against anyone. I'm excited for tomorrow.""

""Branden had a couple of three-putts early in the round and that got me up to a pretty good little lead. Just kind of stayed nice and steady and then closed it off with two birdies there at the end.""The top two seeds advanced, Swedish world number three Henrik Stenson coming from one down after 13 holes to edge Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat 2&1 and fifth-ranked Englishman Justin Rose battling past American Scott Piercy one up.""I'm still in shock,"" said Stenson, the 2007 Match Play champion who is top seed this week with world number one Tiger Woods and second-ranked Australian Adam Scott opting not to play in the elite WGC event.""It was a tough match.

11,"  South African Louis Oosthuizen delivered a sizzling display of golf to become the first player to reach the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship quarter-finals with a commanding 5&4 victory over American Webb Simpson on Friday.Former British Open champion Oosthuizen, who upset top-seeded Swede Henrik Stenson in the previous round, was a flawless six under for the day when he sealed the win at the par-four 14th.Oosthuizen eagled the par-five second, then added four birdies to tighten his grip on the third-round encounter at Dove Mountain.""I'm playing some of my best (golf) now,"" Oosthuizen told reporters. ""I'm hitting the ball really good and just need to make the putts. ""I made quite a few birdies coming in, and he put himself in a few tough spots off the tee to make bogeys and pars.

12,"  The sheer lottery of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship was again front and center on Thursday as top seeds Henrik Stenson, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose were all eliminated in the second round.Swede Stenson, seeded one this week, never led before going down 4&3 to South African Louis Oosthuizen while fourth-seeded Northern Irishman McIlroy lost a see-sawing encounter with American Harris English after 19 holes.In the final match of the day at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona, U.S. Open champion and second seed Rose was pipped by Els after 20 closely contested holes, the big South African sealing victory with a magical birdie at the par-five second.Former world number one Els somehow struck his third shot from a near-impossible lie in a greenside bunker to within three feet of the flag before Rose needed two strokes to escape the sand on the way to a losing par five on their 20th hole.McIlroy, beaten by American Hunter Mahan in the 2012 final, had clawed his way back from two down after 13 holes to edge one up after 16 on another breezy day of dazzling sunshine in Arizona's high desert.However, English levelled the match with a birdie at the par-four 17th and sealed victory after his opponent made a compete hash of the 19th.""Obviously a little bit disappointed with how I finished,"" McIlroy told reporters. ""Being two down with five to go, playing the last five holes like I did, I was happy about that.""I didn't hit the greatest drive off the 19th and got a pretty bad lie in the rough. It was just unfortunate. I played pretty well for the most part.""But, you know, he played really solid today and didn't really do much wrong, didn't really give me anything. So the more consistent player won at the end of the day."" English will next face Jim Furyk, the PGA Tour veteran having beaten former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South Africa 3&2.Oosthuizen won three of the first four holes against a sub-par Stenson, the 2007 champion, and maintained control before ending the match with a birdie at the par-four 15th.""I played pretty solid today,"" Oosthuizen said. ""I just kept it together. Henrik didn't start very well and I made an early lead. I'm playing well. I'm just trying to keep the ball in play so that I'm in every hole I'm playing.""GIANT-KILLING WAYS  Rickie Fowler continued his giant-killing ways with a one-up win over in-form fellow American Jimmy Walker and will next meet Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who beat good friend Bill Haas of the United States 3&1.Fowler came from one down with three holes to play, sealing his second win of the week with a birdie on 16 followed by well executed par saves on 17 and 18.""I told my caddie, 'Joe, let's try and birdie the last three, make some good swings',"" Fowler said. ""I didn't birdie 17 and 18, but I made two really good putts along with the birdie putt on 16.""Fowler, who upset match play expert and 2010 champion Ian Poulter in the opening round, was delighted to add the scalp of Walker, who has already won three times on the 2013-14 PGA Tour.

Day had trailed by one after Oosthuizen made a fast start with birdies at the second and third but then upped his game to take charge as his opponent had periodic back treatment from his physiotherapist out on the course.""We both played well today ... it didn't seem like Louis had a sore back because the way he played was pretty good,"" Day said after finishing birdie-birdie-par-par.""I've loved match play ever since I was a little kid. You just have to grind at it and keep fighting until the end.""RED-HOT PUTTER  Fowler, wielding a red-hot putter, birdied three of the first four holes to go three up on Furyk before his opponent briefly cut the deficit to one by winning the sixth and seventh holes.Birdies at the ninth and 11th got Fowler back to three up but Furyk again rallied, leveling the match with three consecutive birdies from the par-five 13th.PGA Tour veteran Furyk briefly went one up with a par at the short 16th, where Fowler bogeyed, but then stumbled when he bogeyed the par-four 17th after being bunkered off the tee for the match to reach the 18th all square. After Fowler had comfortably reached the green in two, Furyk duffed his chip from just short of the putting surface on the way to another bogey as his opponent wrapped up victory with a two-putt par.""I played well,"" said Furyk. ""I'm honestly disappointed with the finish. I hit some good shots down the stretch.

14,"  South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen had been one of the standout players at this week's WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship but was ousted in the quarter-finals on Saturday after struggling with an ailing back.Oosthuizen, who was sidelined for almost three months last year with a lingering neck and back injury, lost 2&1 to Australian Jason Day after receiving periodic treatment from his physiotherapist out on the course.""I was a bit disappointed to start this morning on the range not feeling too good,"" former British Open champion Oosthuizen told reporters. ""It got better the last four or five holes and I felt a lot better.""It's just a bit painful that it always happens when I'm playing well. I need to address it big time now and get it sorted.""Oosthuizen, who clinched his only major title with a commanding seven-stroke victory at the 2010 British Open, had upset top-seeded Swede Henrik Stenson 4&3 in the second round before crushing American Webb Simpson 5&4 on Friday. ""I felt I played really well (today) but you can't give away holes to a guy like Jason, you're not going to get them back,"" said the 31-year-old South African. ""I had a tough start and it was really tough to get back. He played really well.""Asked how much back pain he had suffered during his quarter-final match, Oosthuizen replied: ""The walking was quite affecting it today. If I can commit myself to hit the shot it's not that bad, but I can't commit. ""My body is restricting me to go through the shot. So I just hit a few iron shots that I really stuck down and committed, and hit great shots - the third shot on 11 and things like that.""It's irritating to play something like that in the back of your head. But I'm not making any excuses. Jason played really well."" Oosthuizen, who won his seventh European Tour title at the Volvo Golf Champions in his native South Africa in January, endured a frustrating 2013 campaign because of his persistent back and neck problems.He had to withdraw after three rounds of the Byron Nelson Championship in May, pulled out of the U.S. Open the following month after opening with a 75 and lasted just six holes at the British Open in July before calling it quits.Oosthuizen only returned to competitive golf at the European Tour's Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in late September after being sidelined with injury since July.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Larry Fine)",2014-02-22,ACN,"Sat Feb 22, 2014 | 6:06pm EST",Ailing Oosthuizen goes out in last eight at Dove Mountain,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-oosthuizen-idUSBREA1L16D20140222?type=companyNews

HOTLY CONTESTED Furyk came from three down after six holes to win a hotly contested match with compatriot Harris English one up, making sure of the win with birdies at 16 and 17 before recording a matching par at the 18th.""Just steady play,"" said Furyk, 43, after reaching the last eight for the first time in 14 starts at the elite WGC event. ""I really hit a lot of greens, a lot of fairways, gave myself a lot of opportunities.""It was a tough match. He played real well early on and I played real well, chipped in on 18 and that's what gave me the one-up victory."" Fowler, who upset 2010 champion Ian Poulter and in-form American Jimmy Walker in his first two matches, rallied from three down after eight holes to pip Spaniard Sergio Garcia one up.The American piled up five birdies in the last 10 holes to seize control and will take on Furyk in Saturday's quarter-finals.""I knew I had my work cut out for me, and I gave it the best fight I could,"" said Fowler. ""We've had a lot of fun playing together.

The Northern Irishman won the 17th and 18th, sank a 20-footer for par at the 20th to stay in the match and then sealed his third remarkable victory this week with a birdie at the 21st.""I really don't know what to say,"" former U.S. Open champion McDowell said after emerging triumphant in a re-match of his decisive singles clash with Mahan at the 2010 Ryder Cup, also won by the Northern Irishman.""Obviously I'm holing some very important putts that I really can't give my normal reactions to, because I can scarcely believe what's going on.

16,"  Sergio Garcia was ousted by American Rickie Fowler in the third round of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship on Friday in a match that will be remembered for a surprise concession by the Spaniard on the seventh hole.Garcia, who had been two up after six holes, conceded a 17-foot par putt on the seventh green after feeling he had taken too long to take a drop from a sprinkler head on the previous hole with bees buzzing around his ball.A stunned Fowler, in return, conceded the Spaniard's seven-footer for par to halve the hole and went on to win the match one up at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona.""I don't regret it at all,"" Garcia told reporters about his generous act of sportsmanship. ""He played much better than me on the last 10 holes and he deserves a win.""This is a gentleman's game, and lately it hasn't felt like it's been like that. This is the way I was brought up by my dad, playing golf.""At least I can leave here feeling good, even though I lost. And that's all there is to it."" Fowler, who came from three down after eight holes with five birdies over the closing stretch, was initially uncertain about what was happening on the seventh green.""I had to kind of find out what he was asking or offering there,"" said the American. ""Took me a few (minutes) to kind of realize. And obviously I'd be stupid to not take a half. ""I was outside of him. He had a good look for par. He had the advantage there. Anything could have happened. I was ready to make the putt, put the pressure on him.""He made a good birdie on eight to go three up. I knew I had my work cut out for me, and I gave it the best fight I could.""Fowler said that Garcia had explained the reason for his surprise concession as they made their way to the eighth tee. ""He felt like he had a little bit of a load on his chest after taking a little time with the drop on (hole) six,"" said Fowler. ""I really didn't have a problem with it.""He just said, 'I felt like I took too much time.' I was like, 'Sure, whatever.'

17,"  Australian Jason Day held off a late fightback by American Rickie Fowler to book his place in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final with a 3&2 victory in a battle of the young guns at Dove Mountain on SundayOn a crisp and clear morning in Arizona's high desert, Day sealed the win when fellow 25-year-old Fowler surprisingly three-putted from just five feet at the par-three 16th.Day, who recorded six birdies in 16 holes to reach the final for the first time, will face Frenchman Victor Dubuisson in the title match later on Sunday at Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton Golf Club.Dubuisson, who had never previously played matchplay golf until his debut this week in a World Golf Championships (WGC) event, came from three down after seven holes to beat veteran South African Ernie Els one up.""It was a tough day,"" Day, who was beaten by eventual champion Matt Kuchar of the United States in last year's semi-finals, told Golf Channel.""Rickie is playing great golf right now and I just thought if I gave that little bit of an inch for him to move in, he was going to knock the door down.""So I was just trying to hang tough and my game was solid today. Hopefully I can take it into the final.""Day birdied four of the first eight holes to go three up before Fowler twice trimmed the lead to two, first with a concession at the ninth and again at the short 12th, where Day missed a seven-foot par putt. The Australian also bogeyed the 13th for his advantage to be cut to one before getting back to two-up with a birdie at the driveable par-four 15th, where he chipped to three feet.Fowler responded with a brilliant tee shot to five feet at the 16th but squandered the chance to level when he pushed his birdie attempt to the right of the cup, then missed the par putt coming back to lose the match.EARLY ELS LEAD  In the second semi-final, four-times major winner Els raced into a three-up lead after just four holes against a slow-starting Dubuisson before the Frenchman got into his stride with birdies at the eighth and ninth to trail by one.Dubuisson leveled the match with another birdie at the par-five 11th, where he chipped to within three feet, and went one ahead when his 44-year-old opponent bogeyed the 12th.It looked likely that Els would get back to all square after he hit a stunning approach to a foot for a conceded birdie at the par-five 13th, but Dubuisson coolly matched him by sinking a clutch putt there from 18 feet.However, the Frenchman stumbled at the par-four 14th where he failed to reach the green in two, executed a poor chip and ran his par putt well past the cup before conceding the hole. Dubuisson got back to one up with a birdie at the 15th where his tee shot ended up just short of the green but Els immediately leveled when he stunningly drained a curling downhill birdie putt from 32 feet at the 16th.Both players parred the 17th but the South African lost the match on the 18th green when he missed his par putt from 13 feet after the Frenchman had lagged his birdie putt to within two feet of the cup.Dubuisson, who burst into the limelight by winning his maiden European Tour title at the Turkish Airlines Open in November, admitted he had been very nervous competing against one of his golfing idols.""I didn't sleep very well last night, I slept like one hour, and this morning I woke up and I realized that I was playing against Ernie Els, one of my favorite players,"" the 23-year-old said.""On the first tee.

19,"  Jason Day had heard all the criticism, that a player of his undoubted talent should have won a lot more than just one PGA Tour title even though he is just 26.It felt like a long time coming but finally, on Sunday at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, the Australian secured his second victory on the U.S. circuit by beating Frenchman Victor Dubuisson after 23 holes.""I've worked very, very hard in the off-season,"" Day told reporters after knocking in a four-foot birdie putt to clinch a one-up win in the title match at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona.""I've worked very hard on my physical fitness and mental fitness and it certainly paid off this week at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship.""It feels like it's been a long time coming since my last win.

Since he turned professional in 2006, he has recorded six top-10s at the majors, including three runner-up spots.In November, he won the coveted World Cup of Golf by two strokes at Royal Melbourne, along with the team title in partnership with Adam Scott.""I've had a lot of consistent finishes in big events and obviously I said to myself I've got to keep working hard and work, work, work, work, work smart,"" said Day. ""As long as I don't give up and keep pushing through, it (a win) will happen again, and hopefully happen in bunches.""It took me nearly three years, I guess. I got my second win finally.

Asked whether he had been at all disappointed with the progress of his career, Day replied: ""No, no, no. A career is very long in golf.""You see guys like Adam Scott, Justin Rose winning major championships in their early 30s.

20,"  Three months after bursting into the limelight with his maiden victory on the European Tour, Victor Dubuisson elevated his profile on the PGA Tour in spectacular fashion Sunday at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship.Despite never having played matchplay golf until this week's elite event in Marana, Arizona, the 23-year-old Frenchman produced several moments of magic, along with a bucketful of birdies, as he stormed through to Sunday's final.Though bitterly disappointed after losing one down to Australian Jason Day in a marathon title match that lasted 23 holes at Dove Mountain, Dubuisson had much to be proud of after making only his fifth start on the U.S. circuit.""I'm happy but, at the same time, disappointed because this afternoon I didn't play very well,"" the Cannes native told reporters after a birdie by Day at the 23rd hole, the driveable par-four 15th, ended the match.""I just battled, especially the back nine. And at the end, I really battled hard because I wanted to take a chance, at least try to take my chance.""I've learned that my nerves, my mental approach, can be very solid in a difficult situation. I've learned that anything can happen. I did well this week and I had some good nerve against my opponent. I know what I have to do now to improve."" Dubuisson, who in November won the inaugural Turkish Airlines Open where Tiger Woods and U.S. Open champion Justin Rose were also in the field, conjured two spectacular recovery shots on Sunday that fans watching will never forget.On the 19th hole, the par-four first, he got up and down to save par from desert scrub over the back right of the green, hitting his third shot from behind a cactus, via sand, rocks and a television cable strung in front of him, to four feet.WRY SMILE  One hole later, at the par-four ninth, he missed the green badly to the left with his approach, his ball ending up in a bush from where he amazingly hit his third to seven feet, prompting a wry smile from Day.""I just play my shot 100 percent, like it was a playable shot, like I have nothing to lose,"" Dubuisson said of his strategy. ""I battled as hard as I could at the end,"" added the Frenchman, a brilliant amateur who turned professional after he missed the cut at the 2010 British Open following his only major start so far.Day was astonished as anyone after watching Dubuisson's two up-and-downs from seemingly impossible positions.""Vic coming down the stretch was just unbelievable,"" the 26-year-old Australian said. ""I've never seen someone as young, apart from Jordan Spieth, and in the old days, Tiger Woods, how clutch he was, especially out of the cactus.""I kept shaking my head because it was so surprising because there was a couple of times there where I thought he was absolutely dead.

I'm just so thankful to be here right now,"" said the winner.(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Larry Fine)",2014-02-24,ACN,"Sun Feb 23, 2014 | 9:56pm EST",Losing finalist Dubuisson makes big PGA Tour splash,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-dubuisson-idUSBREA1N03520140224?type=companyNews
21,"  Jason Day fended off a stunning fightback by Frenchman Victor Dubuisson to clinch the biggest title of his career with a one-up victory after 23 holes in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final in Marana, Arizona on Sunday.A commanding three up lead after 12 holes on an afternoon of light breezes at Dove Mountain, Australian Day was caught by the Frenchman, who recorded clutch birdies at the 13th and 17th, followed by an amazing par from a greenside bunker at the 18th.Dubuisson then conjured two miraculous up-and-downs from desert scrub at the 19th and 20th holes to keep the match alive before Day sealed the win by sinking a four-footer for birdie at the 23rd, the driveable par-four 15th.The Frenchman, who had missed the green to the right off the tee, hit a high lob wedge 20 feet past the cup and missed the birdie putt coming back before the Australian made his to secure the title.""I've never wanted something so bad in my life,"" an emotional Day, 26, told CBS Sports after clinching the winner's check for $1.53 million.""Obviously I didn't want it to go this long but Victor, he has a lot of guts and he has got a great short game. He got it straight out of a cactus twice.""The biggest thing was just how much do I want it, how much do I want to win? I kept saying that to myself last night, kept visualizing myself with the trophy. I am just glad that I could finish it off, but it was a close one.""It was Day's second triumph on the PGA Tour, following the 2010 Byron Nelson Championship, and his first success in one of the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) events which bring together the game's leading players.Dubuisson, who had never previously played matchplay golf until his WGC debut this week, appeared to be on the way to a heavy defeat after he recorded five bogeys in the first seven holes to reach the turn three down.However, the 23-year-old Frenchman raised his game on the back nine and trimmed the deficit to two with a birdie at the par-five 13th where he was just off the edge of the green in two shots. Both players parred the short 16th before Dubuisson won the par-four 17th with a magical birdie to trail by just one.STUNNING APPROACH The Frenchman, who booked his place in the final with a one-up victory over veteran South African Ernie Els earlier on Sunday, had ended up in a fairway bunker off the 17th tee, but struck a stunning approach to 12 feet above the hole.Day, in the right rough off the tee, hit his second shot to 20 feet and narrowly missed his birdie attempt before watching steely-eyed as Dubuisson coolly sank his putt for a three. The Frenchman's late bid for the title looked decidedly shaky at the par-four 18th when he pulled his approach well left into a greenside bunker.Day, who beat American Rickie Fowler 3&2 in his Sunday semi-final, was on the back fringe of the two-tiered green in two, 70 feet above the hole, from where he ran a very slick first putt 10 feet past the cup.Dubuisson conjured a miraculous shot from the sand for his ball to end up five feet away and the Australian, with the title on the line, left his par putt inches short of the cup.Ice-cool, the Frenchman knocked in his par putt to level the match and force extra holes.ASTONISHING MOMENTS  Two astonishing moments were produced by Dubuisson before Day finally clinched the title.At the 19th, the par-four first, the Frenchman ended up in desert scrub over the back right of the green with his approach.Day then struck a wedge into the left greenside bunker before Dubuisson, using soft hands, somehow hit his third shot from behind a cactus, through sand, rocks and a television cable strung in front of him, to four feet.After the Australian had splashed out to six feet, he sank the par putt before Dubuisson followed suit to remain all square.One hole later, at the par-four ninth, the Frenchman missed the green badly to the left with his approach, his ball ending up in a bush from where he amazingly hit his third to seven feet, prompting a wry smile from Day.The Australian was on the back fringe in two from where he cozied his approach putt to within two feet of the cup. Dubuisson, non-plussed, duly sank his par putt to keep the match alive.""I know he was the (world's) number one amateur back in 2009,"" said Day about the gutsy Frenchman. ""He has got a lot of game and you're going to see a lot of him for years to come.""(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Larry Fine)",2014-02-24,ACN,"Sun Feb 23, 2014 | 8:38pm EST","Day outlasts Dubuisson, wins thrilling Match Play",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-pga-matchplay-idUSBREA1N00G20140224?type=companyNews
22,"   By Tony Jimenez | LONDON  LONDON Swashbuckling young French musketeer Victor Dubuisson has the weapons to win majors and become the world's number one golfer, according to fellow countryman and former Ryder Cup player Thomas Levet.The 23-year-old Dubuisson lost to Australian Jason Day at the 23rd hole in Sunday's WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final in Arizona but not before conjuring some Houdini-like escapes from the desert scrub.The Frenchman's ball was twice buried deep in cactus bushes during the extra holes and each time he chipped and putted to keep the match alive, prompting eight-times major winner Tom Watson to describe them as ""two of the greatest up and downs I have ever seen"".""Victor lost in the final but the first thing he said after was that it was a step forward for him,"" his friend Levet told Reuters in a telephone interview while practicing in Florida.""His goal isn't to win that event, he wants to win bigger things. He is a very ambitious guy, he is aiming really high.""Victor's determination is second to none. He's very dedicated to the game and he wants to become the best player in the world,"" said the 45-year-old Levet who is part of the same management stable as Dubuisson.""He is giving it everything he has and it's nice to see. He wants to reach the top, he dreams big and he's not afraid to say it.""The bearded Dubuisson first made the golfing world sit up and take notice by winning the inaugural Turkish Airlines Open in November, eclipsing the likes of world number one Tiger Woods and U.S. Open champion Justin Rose to claim his maiden European Tour title. He has performed consistently well since then and climbed from 30th to 23rd in the rankings after powering his way into last week's final at the first WGC (World Golf Championship) event of the season.""The good thing about Victor for me is there's still a lot of room for improvement,"" said Levet, who holds the record for the most European Tour wins (six) by a Frenchman.""Imagine what he will be like in a few years time? He will be France's best-ever player by far.""He has all the weapons to achieve that. He can go a long way if he stays injury free.""You always need a bit of luck to achieve in golf, to win majors for example, but with a bit of luck on his side he can do very big things."" MAVERICK FIGURE The blond Dubuisson is something of a maverick. He does not practice as much as most of his colleagues and he often prefers his own company but Levet rejected the idea that he was a loner on the circuit.""I've known him for maybe eight or 10 years now,"" said the 2004 Ryder Cup player. ""We have the same manager and he's a good friend on the tour.""He's a shy guy, he's not outspoken, but no, he's not a loner. It's just that he gives everything to his golf,"" Levet added. ""Victor likes to mix with the French guys, go out to dinner with us. But he does have a different diet to the rest of us, he doesn't eat a lot.""He does his own stuff sometimes and just goes with the feeling he has at the time. Yes, he's a very different type of guy but, hey, maybe that's why he's so successful.""Levet, beaten by Ernie Els in a sudden-death playoff at the 2002 British Open, said there was a touch of the Tiger Woods about Dubuisson.""Funnily enough Victor needs to improve his chipping and he could also hit the ball a lot higher,"" said the French veteran.""His distance control and short irons aren't as good as some other players and his left to right fade is not his favorite shot but he reminds me a lot of Tiger.""Tiger doesn't practice a lot on the range. When he gets to a tournament he is always ready and Victor is the same.""Victor gave an incredible performance last week but the way he's been playing the last couple of years I always thought he could do very big things in 2014.""(Editing by Rex Gowar)",2014-02-25,ACN,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 2:44pm EST",Swashbuckling Dubuisson aiming to be No 1 - Levet,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-golf-european-dubuisson-idUSBREA1O1NV20140225?type=companyNews

25,"  Accenture Plc warned that weakness in its consulting business that hurt second-quarter results would carry on though the year, sending its shares down as much as 8 percent.The consulting business, which brings in more than half of the company's revenue, has fallen in six of the last seven quarters as customers cut discretionary spending and stiff competition puts pressure on contract prices.Accenture raised its full-year profit forecast and the lower end of its revenue forecast. But it said revenue in the consulting business would be flat or grow in the low-single digits in the year ending August 31.The company reported record high consulting bookings of $4.6 billion but Chief Financial Officer David Rowland said on a conference call with analysts that pricing pressure was eating into revenue growth.Consulting revenue fell 1 percent in U.S. dollar terms and payroll costs rose, leading to a lower-than-expected profit for the quarter ended February 28.However, Evercore analyst David Togut said Accenture's track record of managing costs and the strong bookings numbers bode well for growth in 2015. ""Multiple times since its 2001 IPO Accenture has successfully managed cost pressures. Superior bookings growth, high book-to-bill ratios and a strong track record of managing expenses reinforces our conviction in ACN's earnings growth prospects,"" Togut said.Hewlett-Packard Co said in February that revenue from its technology consulting business dropped 4 percent in the quarter ended January but that the business was more profitable.Accenture, recently chosen as the lead contractor for the Obamacare enrollment website, said it expected strong growth in its health and public service business in the second half of the year. The company raised its full-year profit forecast to $4.50 to $4.62 per share from $4.44 to $4.56 per share.It forecast full-year revenue growth of 3-6 percent in local currency, compared with its previous forecast of 2-6 percent. The company's net income fell 39 percent to $722.3 million in the second quarter. It earned $1.03 per share, slightly lower than analysts average expectation of $1.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net revenue, or revenue before reimbursements, rose 1 percent to $7.13 billion.

28,"   By Lehar Maan and Abhirup Roy  Accenture Plc (ACN.N), a consulting and outsourcing services provider, cut the top end of its full-year earnings forecast as margins come under pressure, taking the shine off a rebound in its consulting business that boosted quarterly revenue.Accenture's shares, which have been trading around their life-high, fell as much as 3.9 percent in volatile trading on Monday.The company said it expects full-year operating margin at the lower end of its previously forecast range of 14.3-14.5 percent.Analysts have said that Accenture is facing increasing pricing pressure from rivals such as International Business Machines (IBM.N) and others amid sluggish business spending.""I think now you are seeing that lower profitability on some contracts continues to weigh on margins,"" Atlantic Equities analyst Christopher Hickey told Reuters.Accenture said it now expects full-year earnings to be in the range of $4.50-$4.54 per share, compared with $4.50-$4.62 earlier.Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $4.53 for the full-year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's total operating expenses for the quarter rose 7.5 percent to $7.06 million. CONSULTANCY REBOUND Accenture reported a better-than-expected 7.5 percent rise in quarterly net revenue, led by a rebound in demand for its consulting services.Hickey said the company was benefiting from its newer business offerings and several large contracts it had signed earlier. Revenue in the consultancy business rose 5.7 percent in the third quarter compared with a 1 percent decline in the second quarter, highlighting a recovery in the unit that accounts for a little over a half of the company's total net revenue.Outsourcing revenue rose 9.6 percent, accounting for 48 percent of total net revenue. In the IT outsourcing business, it competes with India's Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS).Accenture forecast revenue of between $7.45 billion and $7.70 billion for the fourth-quarter. Analysts on average were expecting $7.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""(Accenture) is generally well positioned to capture more than their fair share of discretionary spending and ongoing cost reduction spending,"" Hickey added. Gartner Inc (IT.N) forecast in April that it expects worldwide IT spending to total $3.8 trillion in 2014, a 3.2 percent increase from 2013.Accenture's net income rose to $881.8 million, or $1.26 per share, in the third quarter ended May 31 from $874.1 million, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.21 per share.     Net revenue, or revenue before reimbursements, rose 7.5 percent to $7.74 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.55 billion.Accenture's shares fell to a low of $79.77 but pared some of those losses to trade down 1 percent at $82.13 by mid-day.

29,"  * Licences first step in exploration process* Additional guidance issued on natural beauty spots* Shale development still 5-10 years away-Accenture   (Recasts, adds detail, quote)By Nina ChestneyLONDON, July 28 The British government took steps to speed up energy exploration including controversial hydraulic fracturing for shale gas on Monday with a new licensing round for companies looking for onshore oil and gas.Concerns about the potentially dangerous impact of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the search for shale gas has prompted protests in Britain and outright bans on the practice in France and elsewhere.The licences are the first step in the exploration process but do not give outright permission to drill. Oil and gas exploration companies must also obtain planning permission, environmental permits and health and safety approvals before they can receive final go-ahead to drill in Britain. ""Ultimately, done right, speeding up shale will mean more jobs and opportunities for people and help ensure long-term economic and energy security for our country,"" said Business and Energy Minister Matthew Hancock.Britain is betting on the development of shale gas to help curb its growing dependence on imports and to stem a decline in oil and gas tax receipts as output from the mature North Sea basin dwindles.A third of Britain's gas needs can come from its own shale gas by the early 2030s if government policies and economic growth allow firms to invest in gas exploration, the National Grid said this month. Britain's technically recoverable shale gas resources are estimated at around 26 trillion cubic feet and the government has offered tax breaks to drive investment in a sector which has transformed the U.S. energy market.However, Britain is still in the early stages of exploring for shale gas and opposition has grown on grounds that it is potentially harmful to the environment and after one project triggered earth tremors.Fracking involves pumping chemicals, sand and water at high pressure deep underground to release oil and gas trapped in layers of rock. ""The more factors that are favourably met in the UK, the sooner it is likely ...although even in the most favourable circumstances, development is at least five to 10 years away,"" said Melissa Stark, managing director of Accenture's new energy business.The government also spelled out steps for companies wanting to drill for unconventional oil and gas such as shale in areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks and world heritage sites.Firms would have to submit ""environmental awareness"" statements to show they recognise the importance of these sites.Applications for such sites should be refused unless there are exceptional circumstances and it is in the public interest,  the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said.When an application in such areas is refused by local authorities and the developer appeals that decision, Britain's Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles will personally consider the appeals for at least a 12-month period, DECC added.

30,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO The Netherlands’ Royal Philips and IT consultancy Accenture are developing software to help people with neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, live more independently. The companies said they have built a trial application that lets patients with ALS, a disease that diminishes muscle action, issue ""brain commands"" to turn lights on and off or send an alert to a doctor.The software works by connecting a wireless headset developed by Emotiv, a San Francisco-based startup, to a wearable device. Emotiv says its headset can read brain waves and translate them into readable data, which is then used to issue commands to Philips’ existing connected products such as ""smart"" TVs and lighting systems.Wearers also can issue commands using their voice or eyes, and the app lets patients store pre-recorded messages in their own voice.Accenture and Philips jointly developed the software that connects the various technologies. It marks the latest in a string of partnerships between information technology and medical firms to develop products for people with chronic conditions. In July, Google struck a deal with Swiss drug maker Novartis to develop a smart contact lens that can monitor blood-sugar levels, which would particularly be useful to diabetics. Accenture and Philips stress their app is a ""proof of concept"" but said they have tested it with patients. They are open to conversations with other consumer technology providers, like Apple and Google, and are seeking partnerships with caregiver associations.""We are looking for our next set of partners,"" Thibaut Sevestre, who heads innovation for Philips' IT architecture and platforms, said in an interview with Reuters. ""Patients find that they can do less and less by themselves, until they are completely paralyzed,"" Sevestre added. ""So we asked, 'How can we help them regain control?'"" Philips stressed, however, that commercial viability was not yet established.    ""At this point, we are exploring this concept for the sake of innovation and research. We’ll continue to collect feedback and explore its potential, but we cannot confirm any commercial development at this time, nor any plans to test this on patients in the future,"" a Philips spokesman said in a statement.The app is not designed as a monitoring tool that can inform doctors of a patient's current state. Instead, Sevestre said, it aimed to give people back ""some capabilities they’ve lost."" In the later stages of ALS, people will sometimes be rendered completely paralyzed but retain brain functions.  The project kicked off in May after several Accenture employees pitched the idea. A key employee died in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane over eastern Ukraine in July.Throughout the summer, Accenture conducted interviews and tests with ALS patients at its research lab in San Jose, California. Some 400,000 people suffer from the disease, but Accenture’s chief technology officer, Paul Daugherty, said the goal is to adapt the application to a broad spectrum of patients.The firms estimate their app can eventually benefit some 40 million people.

32,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Aug 5 The Netherlands' Royal Philips and IT consultancy Accenture are developing software to help people with neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, live more independently.The companies said they have built a trial application that lets patients with ALS, a disease that diminishes muscle action, issue ""brain commands"" to turn lights on and off or send an alert to a doctor.The software works by connecting a wireless headset developed by Emotiv, a San Francisco-based startup, to a wearable device. Emotiv says its headset can read brain waves and translate them into readable data, which is then used to issue commands to Philips' existing suite of connected products, such as ""smart"" TVs and lighting systems.Wearers also can issue commands via their voice or eyes, and the app lets patients store pre-recorded messages in their own voice. Accenture and Philips jointly developed the software that connects the various technologies.It marks the latest in a string of partnerships between information technology and medical firms to develop products for people with chronic conditions. In July, Google struck a deal with Swiss drug maker Novartis to develop a smart contact lens that can monitor blood-sugar levels, which would particularly be useful to diabetics.Accenture and Philips stress their app is a ""proof of concept"" but they said they have tested it with patients. They remain open to conversations with other consumer technology providers, like Apple and Google, and are seeking partnerships with caregiver associations. ""We are looking for our next set of partners,"" Thibaut Sevestre, who heads innovation for Philips' IT architecture and platforms, said in an interview with Reuters.""Patients find that they can do less and less by themselves, until they are completely paralyzed,"" Sevestre added.

33,"  * SAIC broadens raids one week after previous raids* Investigation for suspected anti-monopoly law violations* Suspected violations relate to Windows, Microsoft Office   (Adds comment from Microsoft, Accenture)BEIJING, Aug 6 A Chinese anti-trust regulator conducted new raids on Microsoft Corp and partner in China Accenture PLC, the agency said on its website on Wednesday, after saying last week Microsoft is under investigation for anti-trust violations.The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) raided offices in Beijing, Liaoning, Fujian and Hubei, it said. The SAIC also raided the Dalian offices of IT consultancy Accenture, to whom Microsoft outsources financial work, according to the regulator.""We're serious about complying with China's laws and committed to addressing SAIC's questions and concerns,"" a Beijing-based Microsoft spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement.Accenture also said it is involved in investigations. ""We can confirm that, as required by Chinese laws, we are cooperating with investigators of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and are helping provide them with certain information related to one of our clients,"" Accenture Greater China said in an e-mailed statement, declining to elaborate.Last week, the SAIC said it was formally investigating Microsoft for breach of anti-trust rules and had raided four of the software firm's offices in China.Microsoft has been suspected of violating China's anti-monopoly law since June last year in relation to problems with compatibility, bundling and document authentication for its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office software, the SAIC said last week. The SAIC declined to provide further comment when contacted by phone on Wednesday.Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp was in Beijing to meet with the SAIC on Monday, where the regulator warned Microsoft to not obstruct the probe.But industry experts have questioned how exactly Microsoft is violating anti-trust regulations in China, where the size of its business is negligible. The U.S. company has taken a public beating in China in recent months. It has been subject to wider scrutiny against U.S. technology firms in China in the wake of former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's cyber espionage revelations.It has also seen its OneDrive cloud storage service disrupted in China, and had its latest Windows 8 operating system banned from being installed on the central government's new computers.The Microsoft investigation comes amidst a spate of anti-trust probes against foreign firms in China, including mobile chipset maker Qualcomm Inc and German car maker Daimler AG's luxury auto unit Mercedes-Benz.China is intensifying efforts to bring companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008, having in recent years taken aim at industries as varied as milk powder and jewellery.China on Wednesday said it will punish foreign car makers Audi, owned by Volkswagen, and Fiat SpA's  Chrysler as well as some 10 Japanese spare-part makers for anti-trust violations.A number of multinational companies including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co and Danone SA have been slapped with substantial fines following similar investigations in the past.

37,"  (Adds Accenture as source in paragraph 8)By Caroline HumerNEW YORK Dec 15 Healthcare companies including Aetna Inc, Mercer and Towers Watson & Co have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build exchanges that allow company employees to buy their own insurance, betting that Corporate America wants to get out of managing workers' health benefits.By last year, blue chip names such as Sears Holding Corp  and Walgreen Co had signed on and industry experts predicted that more than 20 percent of the nation's employees would soon buy their health insurance in this way, compared with less than 2 percent today. But Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen industry executives has found that no major U.S. company signed up their employees for the first time to a private health insurance exchange for 2015.Many of those executives expect a similar situation in 2016, as blue chip employers wait for proof that the new exchanges will save them enough money to warrant the switch, raising doubts about this new business model.""We have a lot of wait-and-see going on with large employers,"" said Brian Marcotte, chief executive officer of the National Business Group on Health, a lobbying group for large corporations. ""They are not quite sure yet how they will deliver on managing costs better.""U.S. employers provide health benefits for more than 160 million people, mostly by contracting with large health insurers to administer the healthcare benefits that the company funds, with contributions from employee-paid premiums. But as healthcare costs rose steadily, and President Barack Obama's healthcare law required coverage of more medical services, many sought ways to rein in those expenses.Private exchanges such as Aon Hewitt, part of Aon Plc , aim to be the Amazon.coms of the insurance world, where employees choose and pay for their own plans and competition helps keep prices down.Employers contribute a fixed dollar amount to help their workers buy coverage, but can save money by no longer managing the benefits within their companies. They are not directly related to the state-based Obamacare insurance exchanges that offer government-subsidized health plans.Since 2012, employers covering as many as 3 million people have signed on to use the exchanges, according to consulting firm Accenture. A recent report from Mercer LLC, part of Marsh & McLennan, found that 3 percent of large employers were using private exchanges and that 28 percent of employers would make the shift within five years, taking a bite out of the business served by major insurers like UnitedHealth Group Inc  and Anthem Inc, previously known as WellPoint. NEW SENSE OF CAUTION Industry executives are now projecting more caution about when private exchanges will take off. Aon Hewitt said in October that it would lose money on its private exchange this year, after previously expecting the business to be mildly profitable. Aon did not say how much money it would lose. Insurer Cigna Corp  will sell health plans on the Aon exchange in 2016.""This is coming. It's just the pace at which we believe the market is going to make the transition"" that is slower than expected, said Patty Fontneau, who runs Cigna's private exchange business.Mercer and Towers Watson's Liazon unit are still seeing growth from serving more mid-sized businesses, which are signing up for exchanges at a higher rate since they have less invested in managing health coverage for employees. Other insurance experts question whether the forecasts will ever materialize.""Private exchanges were over-hyped from the beginning,"" said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of healthcare research firm Avalere Health. Large employers enjoy significant leverage in negotiating down the price of benefits for the many members of their workforce, an advantage that an exchange cannot match, he said.LARGE MOVE FOR LARGE COMPANIES Darden Restaurants Inc, owner of the Olive Garden chain, was one of the first large companies to move to Aon Hewitt's private exchange. Medical costs were rising 8 to 10 percent per year and it had used the same insurer for 15 years. In 2012, it made a ""leap of faith"" that Aon Hewitt could do a better job, said Danielle Kirgan, Darden's senior vice president for human resources.It took four months to overhaul Darden's benefits systems and explain the change to employees. The pay off has been lower year-over-year increases in healthcare spending. ""We have over three years of seeing rates, and they have been dramatically and consistently less,"" Kirgan said in an interview. Starbucks Corp, however, took a close look at the private exchanges to understand them, but has never planned to move its 136,000 employees.""What we tended to learn is that what we do is just easier and better for people,"" Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters.Large companies that are open to joining the exchanges are now asking to see at least two or three years, and as many as five years, of data on insurance premiums and medical claims from plans sold on the exchanges to be sure that there will not be a sudden increase in premiums to contend with, benefits consultants said.Some corporations also describe a sense of fatigue after several years of getting their coverage compliant with Obamacare and are loath to make additional changes in short order.Many have introduced health plans with high deductibles to shift costs to employees and want to see whether that will be enough to save money. They are also uncertain about what may be required of them if the Affordable Care Act is changed by a new Congress with Republican opponents of the law in charge.Aetna said last month it would spend $400 million to buy private exchange company Bswift and remain competitive against Aon and others. Kerry Sain, who runs Aetna's private exchange business, acknowledged that large companies are just ""dipping their toes"" into the new model.Aetna said it will still benefit from Bswift's technology even if the private exchange market does not end up as large as forecast.Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said large companies need a catalyst to spur them to move onto the exchanges, namely the cut to U.S. corporate tax benefits that come from providing health coverage planned for 2018.""If that doesn't do it, I think we're pretty much done on this thing,"" she said.

50,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Accenture  plc (Accenture) and subsidiaries, including Accenture's Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) at 'A+'/Stable Outlook. Fitch's actions affect approximately $1  billion of debt, including the undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF). A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Negligible Debt: Fitch expects that Accenture's debt will remain negligible over  at least the intermediate term. Solid FCF & Liquidity: Accenture's liquidity is supported by significant and  consistent free cash flow (FCF), despite cyclical demand associated with the  consulting and systems integration (C&SI) business. Fitch projects FCF (Fitch  defined as post-dividends) will exceed $2 billion annually through at least  fiscal 2018. The company had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Feb.  29, 2016. Cloud-Driven Consulting Growth: Fitch expects increased customer spending on  cloud-related services will continue to drive double-digit consulting growth  over the intermediate term. Consulting represented 53% of revenue during the LTM  ending Feb. 29, 2016 vs 52% for the year-ago period.  Offshore Delivery Capability: The company's significant and diversified offshore  delivery capability, which translates into a strong market position in  attractive long-term growth markets, including applications and business process  outsourcing. Profit Margin Expansion: Recent acquisition activity and attendant integration  expense should constrain profit margin expansion, which Fitch expects will be  modest in FY2016. Talent Acquisition Challenges: High demand and short supply of talent with the  requisite skills in Analytics, Cloud Services, Digital Marketing, and Mobility  will likely drive higher labor acquisition and retention costs. Long-Term Outsourcing Contracts: Fitch believes Accenture's long-term  outsourcing contracts, which account for nearly half of revenues, will drive  meaningful recurring revenues relative to peers. Meaningful Diversification: Accenture has a diversified portfolio of customers,  industries, geographies and service line offerings, supporting Fitch's  expectations for more consistent operating performance than historically. Competitive Environment: Pricing pressures due to intense competition from  multinational, offshore (primarily India-based) and niche IT Services providers. Legacy Services: Fitch expects that long-term software as a service (SaaS)  adoption will suppress demand for traditional systems integration services,  particularly enterprise resource planning software. Fitch believes total IT  services SaaS revenue generation could be less than that from traditional  software implementations over the software's life cycle, despite higher initial  revenue from integrating SaaS into clients' existing systems. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Organic revenue growth of nearly 4% annually; --EBITDA margin increases by 100 basis points annually through FY2018; --Post-dividend FCF exceeds $2.3 billion per year through FY2018; --Most of Accenture's post-dividend FCF will be used for share repurchases and  acquisitions; --Accenture will not engage in significant debt-funded share repurchases or  acquisitions that would signify a shift in the company's financial policies. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may lead to a negative rating action include: --Significant debt-financed acquisitions and/or share repurchases that result in  Fitch's expectations for adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR above 2x for a sustained  period; or --Revenue declines from market share losses resulting in Fitch's expectations  for annual FCF below $1 billion. Positive: Fitch does not anticipate further positive rating actions.  LIQUIDITY As of Feb. 29, 2016, Accenture's liquidity was solid and consisted of: --$3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, almost all of which was available,  given the company's incorporation in Ireland;  --An undrawn $1 billion revolving RCF expiring October 2016. The credit  agreement requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio  (debt/EBITDA) of less than 1.75x. Fitch's expectation for more than $2 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity. We anticipate Accenture will continue to use FCF for share  repurchases and acquisitions.  As of Feb. 29, 2016, Accenture had negligible outstanding debt, given that the  company's FCF internally funds shareholder returns and acquisitions.  The company does have off-balance-sheet debt in the form of significant  operating lease commitments, since it does not own any of its real estate as  part of its 'asset-light' strategy. Nonetheless, Fitch expects total adjusted  debt to EBITDAR will remain below 1.5x and was 0.8x for the LTM period ended  Feb. 29, 2016. Fitch affirms the following ratings: Accenture --Long-term IDR at 'A+'. Accenture International Capital SCA --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured RCF expiring Dec. 2020 at 'A+'. Accenture Capital Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured RCF at 'A+'.

55,"   By Tova Cohen | TEL AVIV, June 20  TEL AVIV, June 20 Seeking to shore up the cybersecurity services it provides to customers, Accenture Plc  has acquired an Israeli company and is establishing a research and development centre in the country.Israeli cyber security firms, many of which have their roots in the military, have attracted growing foreign investment over the past few years, raising a record $540 million in 2015.Accenture, a professional services firm whose competitors include IBM and India's Infosys, did not disclose financial details of its acquisition of Tel Aviv-based Maglan which provides cyber forensics and simulation servives, malware defence and research on intelligence threats.It employs about 30 people, who ""are extremely expert ... from Israel's military and intelligence complex,"" Omar Abbosh, Accenture's chief strategy officer, told Reuters on the sidelines of a cyber conference at Tel Aviv University on Monday. Abbosh said the company spent about $1 billion acquiring some 20 companies in fiscal 2015 and a similar amount in fiscal 2016, which ends in August.""You can use that to work out a typical deal size,"" he said. Maglan will help Accenture tailor services to clients' needs as the growing variety of cyber attacks today cannot be eliminated with standard off-the-shelf solutions, Abbosh said. Maglan's clients include financial services, telecom and automotive companies.Accenture's new R&D centre will focus on industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and active defence, which uses artificial intelligence and advanced analytics to see an anomaly before an attack has happened.""They are working on research we expect to apply within a three-year time frame,"" he said.Accenture is also collaborating with Team8, an Israeli firm that creates cybersecurity companies. In February, Accenture, which is incorporated in Ireland, participated in a $23 million funding round for Team8.

76,"   By Julia Love  Alphabet Inc's Google said on Thursday it renamed its business-to-business cloud computing brand and enhanced some enterprise applications using artificial intelligence, the company's latest gambit to better compete with Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. in the lucrative cloud business.  Discussing the rebranded Google Cloud, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google's enterprise business, said the company has made good progress courting customers and improving its technology. Cloud computing uses remote internet servers to store, manage and process data, and Google offers a range of apps like word processing and email, as well as the ability to host data and offer resources for developers. The new name replaces the Google for Work brand. ""We are closing the gap incredibly fast"" with competitors, Greene, a former CEO of VMware who joined Google last year to ramp up its cloud business, told experts and journalists at an event.  Analysts say Google trails Amazon and Microsoft in market share but is gaining under Greene. Although the business is not big enough to break out separately in its quarterly earnings statement, Google reported a 33 percent surge in ""other revenue"" in its most recent quarter, which analysts said was probably due largely to gains in cloud computing.  Greene has moved quickly to streamline engineering and appointed new leadership to beef up the company's cloud business. This has helped improve sales, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.Earlier this month, Google acquired cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about $625 million. The company on Thursday also announced a partnership with consultant Accenture to develop cloud services for clients in industries such a retail, healthcare and finance.In addition, the company said it had woven more artificial intelligence into its apps to help employees work more efficiently. Using machine learning to crunch troves of data, Google says its apps will prompt users to, say, open files at certain times of day or propose meetings based on their habits. Google recently added a U.S. data center in Oregon in order to speed up service and next year will open more in Virginia, Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, São Paulo, London, Finland and Frankfurt.
