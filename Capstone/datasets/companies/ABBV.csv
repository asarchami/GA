0,"   By Ransdell Pierson  AbbVie Inc issued a cautious 2014 profit forecast, but said it expects U.S. approval this year for its potentially lucrative new all-oral treatment for hepatitis C, sending its shares up 3.4 percent.The company, before releasing fourth quarter earnings on Friday, released favorable data from four additional Phase III studies of its experimental treatment for the liver disease. AbbVie previously had said it expected approval of the treatment in early 2015.""The excellent hepatitis C safety and efficacy data published today is positive for the shares"" of AbbVie, Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said. But he noted that expenses for launching the medicines will now be incurred in 2014, which had not been expected.AbbVie's treatment is a combination of five oral medications that has been shown to knock out the hepatitis C virus in as soon as eight or 12 weeks of treatment, without serious safety issues.AbbVie's drugs have produced cure rates well above 90 percent in clinical trials, without the need to be taken with older standard drugs that cause harsh side effects and must be taken for longer periods. But the drugs, which are taken together, could face tough competition from a more convenient and highly effective once-daily pill against the hepatitis C virus being developed by Gilead Sciences Inc.""Overall, the hepatitis C Phase III results are good"" for AbbVie's drugs, ""but not as good as Gilead's,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said Friday in a research note. But Arfaei said AbbVie's drugs could capture peak annual sales of $2.8 billion, even if they only claim a 10 to 13 percent share of the hepatitis C market.AbbVie, spun off early last year from Abbott Laboratories Inc, said it earned $1.13 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $1.54 billion, or 98 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.Excluding special items, the company earned 82 cents per share, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Global revenue totaled $5.1 billion and was also in line with Wall Street expectations. AbbVie said it expects full-year earnings of $3.00 to $3.10 per share, excluding special items. That is below the average estimate of $3.16, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Sales of AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, the world's biggest-selling drug, jumped 13 percent in the quarter to $3.04 billion - more than offsetting lower sales for most of the company's other medicines.Sales of AndroGel, a gel that delivers the male hormone testosterone, fell 21 percent to $289 million in the quarter, while sales of HIV treatment Kaletra fell almost 9 percent to $228 million. Combined sales of TriCor and Trilipix, treatments for blood fats called triglycerides that are now facing cheaper generics, plunged 85 percent to $29 million. Humira represented 60 percent of total AbbVie sales in the quarter, underscoring the company's reliance on the injectable product and its need to introduce big-selling new drugs such as its hepatitis C medicines.Although Humira's U.S. patent lapses in late 2016, AbbVie officials have predicted it will take years longer for other drugmakers to develop their own biosimilar forms of Humira and win approvals for them.Company shares jumped 57 percent last year, on faith that Humira will not be fettered by generic competition for years, and that AbbVie will successfully develop new medicines for hepatitis C, blood cancers and other diseases that will spur continued earnings growth.Hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million people worldwide, and if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or the need for a new liver. Current treatments include use of interferon, an injectable drug that causes flu-like symptoms.AbbVie shares were trading at $49.93 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Phil Berlowitz)",2014-01-31,ABBV,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 10:53am EST","AbbVie sees 2014 approval of hepatitis drugs, shares rise",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-abbvie-results-idUSBREA0U16920140131?type=companyNews

Glaxo accused Abbott of raising Norvir's price by 400 percent in 2003, as part of an effort to harm competitors whose drugs were dependent on being used in combination with Norvir.

17,"   By Ransdell Pierson  A drug approved to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys significantly reduced relapses of multiple sclerosis in a late stage-trial sponsored by Biogen Idec and AbbVie Inc, but serious infections and potential liver toxicity continued to cloud the drug's future.The Phase III international study of the medicine, called daclizumab, involved more than 1,800 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the most common form of MS, which can lead to disability and paralysis. The companies disclosed partial results from the new trial on Monday. The study, called DECIDE, tested monthly injections of daclizumab against weekly injections of Biogen's blockbuster Avonex (interferon beta-1a) treatment for MS. Patients taking daclizumab, which is meant to tame the immune system by blocking a protein called the CD25 receptor, had 45 percent fewer annual relapses than those receiving Avonex. In addition, patients taking daclizumab had 54 percent  fewer new or enlarging brain and spinal lesions at week 96 of the study, compared to those taking Avonex; those results met a secondary goal of the study. The overall incidence of side effects was similar in both patient groups. But there was a two-fold higher incidence of serious infections among those taking daclizumab, at 4 percent, as well as a two-fold higher incidence of elevated liver enzymes - a potential marker for liver toxicity.Daclizumab would be a new approach to treating MS, if it is approved for the condition.Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said the decline in annual relapses seen with daclizumab was a bit less impressive than the reductions of 52 percent, versus Avonex, achieved in earlier trials by the oral medication Gilenya, which is made by Novartis AG. Gilenya had sales of $1.9 billion last year. ""Our first impression is that these results are good enough for (daclizumab) to be competitive"" with Gilenya and other oral treatments, Arfaei said in a research note.He predicted the Biogen/AbbVie drug could be introduced in 2016 and conservatively generate U.S. sales of $256 million by 2018.Biogen and AbbVie said they would discuss with health regulators the timing for potential marketing applications for daclizumab.  Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG introduced daclizumab in 1997 to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys, under the brand name Zenapax.

20,"   By Olivia Oran and Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) has recently approached London-listed Shire PLC (SHP.L) about a potential takeover, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the latest attempt by U.S. healthcare companies looking to acquire overseas rivals partly to lower their tax rates. AbbVie, which makes rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, has a market capitalization of around $86 billion, while Shire has a market capitalization of roughly $38 billion.The companies have held talks in recent weeks following AbbVie's takeover approach, but there is no guarantee the discussions will lead to a transaction, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Both parties have exchanged letters about a potential deal, the people said. It is also possible that other suitors will emerge for Shire, the people added.AbbVie said it does not comment on speculation and Shire could not be immediately reached for comment. Founded in 1986 in Britain, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008. With its tax base in Ireland, where effective corporate tax rates are among the lowest in the world, Shire, with a mid-sized market value, has been seen as a prime takeover target for U.S. drugmakers. Shire is weighing AbbVie's approach against the merits of remaining independent, as its chief executive Fleming Ornskov has only completed his first year on the job and has an alternative strategy of growing through acquisitions, one of the people said.Shire specializes in medicines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which account for around 40 percent of its sales. The firm also sells pricey drugs to treat rare genetic disorders and is building up a portfolio of treatments in ophthalmology and other specialty disease areas.AbbVie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, was founded last year as a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N). The company has been criticized for its overreliance on its top drug, Humira, which comprised over half of its revenue in the most recent quarter.  To lessen its reliance on Humira, the company is attempting to develop treatments for hepatitis C, cancer and other diseases.Shire had also been approached by Allergan Inc (AGN.N) in the months before the Botox maker itself became a takeover target for Valeant, Reuters previously reported.That approach did not lead to serious discussions between the two parties and there are currently no talks with Allergan, Reuters reported earlier this week.  U.S. pharmaceutical companies are in a race to keep up with rivals and are looking at lowering their tax rates in order to do so, in what is called as an inversion. Recent inversion deals have included medical device company Medtronic Inc's (MDT.N) $42.9 billion deal for Covidien this week, as well as Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) abortive $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.L).Some U.S. lawmakers are concerned that the deals erode government revenue by giving corporations another tax-avoiding loophole. Two bills in the U.S. Congress and a White House proposal would make inversions harder to do, but neither has gained much traction.

Saying its annual product sales are set to more than double by 2020 to $10 billion, Shire rejected the 46.26 pounds per share offer as failing to reflect its true value, despite the offer being at a 30 percent premium to its share price over the last month.But analysts and one large shareholder said the firm may struggle to resist a bid of over 50 pounds per share.""You can easily see other people coming for Shire now because it’s in a good space,"" one of Shire's 40 biggest shareholders told Reuters.""Their pipeline is fantastic, it’s growing at 20 percent so for them (Abbvie) to offer 46 quid for that sort of growth profile we think is not enough.

AbbVie's takeover offer proposed creating a new U.S.-listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain, where the government has also introduced tax breaks designed to encourage research and development. The approach marks the latest in a long line of mergers proposed by U.S. firms seeking to lower their tax rates, and comes less than a month after the collapse of Pfizer's (PFE.N) $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) which was also motivated in part by tax considerations.    Ireland's corporation tax rate currently sits at 12.5 percent, one of the lowest in the world, while Britain has been cutting its rate from 28 percent in 2010 to 21 percent this year and 20 percent from 2015, well below the U.S. headline rate of 35 percent plus local taxes.Tax advisers say the British system also enables international companies to lower their tax rates in other ways.

Shire's share price was up 15 percent at over 43 pounds by 1150 GMT, valuing the firm at over 25 billion pounds ($43 billion).

32,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Shire (SHP.L) flagged the promise of existing and new drugs on Monday as evidence that AbbVie's (ABBV.N) $46 billion offer undervalued the company, the latest British firm to be targeted by a U.S. group seeking lower taxes.Shire is taking a leaf out of AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) playbook by disclosing long-range internal forecasts - a tactic used successfully by its larger London-listed rival in fending off a $118 billion bid from Pfizer (PFE.N). Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that current products would generate sales of at least $7 billion by 2020, with $3 billion more coming from drugs still in the pipeline.Shire also said that in the medium term it expected sales of $6.5 billion by 2016. The company, best known for hyperactivity and rare-disease drugs, had said on Friday it was aiming to more than double sales to $10 billion by 2020 without giving details.Ornskov told Reuters that actual sales could be far above $10 billion, since the long-term forecasts did not include revenue from future deal-making or from two recent transactions.""M&A will clearly add growth to the profile,"" he said in an interview, noting that the London-listed company had done six deals since he took over 13 months ago. ""If I included that in the upside it would be way north of $10 billion.""Shire is a serial acquirer, buying rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov said further ""large"" deals were possible.As with AstraZeneca's earlier upbeat long-term forecasts, many industry analysts view Shire's $10 billion sales prediction as optimistic, with Credit Suisse saying its own estimates suggested sales of around $8 billion by 2020.Nonetheless, the confident performance may encourage AbbVie to dig deeper after the two companies confirmed a series of approaches following a Reuters report last week.  Analysts at Jefferies estimated the U.S. company could make the deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion, against AbbVie's most recent rejected cash-and-shares offer on May 30 of just over 46 pounds. Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday, ended 1.6 percent lower at 43.03 pounds.Key drugs that Ornskov expects to drive continued strong growth include its best-selling hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse, which is now also being tested as a treatment for binge eating, as well as a much-anticipated drug for dry eye disease called lifitegrast, which it sees as a potential $1 billion-plus seller.Shire is famous for drugs to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but Ornskov said it had become ""more and more a rare disease company"". The market had yet to catch up fully with the rapid growth and high margins this shift implied, he argued, pointing to the 99 percent total shareholder return achieved since he took over last May. INVERSION AVERSION Shire's strategy copies AstraZeneca's in another way, too, by highlighting the execution risks associated with AbbVie's plan to cut its tax bill through redomiciling in Britain for tax purposes - an industry-wide ploy that has sparked growing political concerns. Such so-called ""inversions"" by U.S. companies have moved centre-stage in the pharmaceuticals sector this year, with those firms still paying high tax rates anxious to strike deals that will help them compete with rivals now enjoying lower taxes.Whether Shire, long viewed as a likely takeover target, escapes the clutches of a larger predator is uncertain and the company is widely seen as more vulnerable to a takeover by AbbVie - or another company - than AstraZeneca.  That reflects both its smaller size, which makes it a more manageable target for a wider range of players, and the lack of attendant political issues in Britain, where the company has a relatively small workforce.Although established in Britain in 1986 and listed in London, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been resident in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008.Other companies that industry sources say have looked at Shire in the past include Allergan AGN.L, itself the target of a takeover approach by Valeant (VRX.TO). Banking sources suggest Shire could also appeal to groups such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O). Ornskov declined to comment on whether Shire had received approaches from companies other than AbbVie.One senior banker described Shire as a ""valued inversion target"" but he stressed that potential bidders still needed to demonstrate a tie-up also made strategic sense. For AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, Shire fits the bill in one important respect: it offers a way to reduce his firm's over-reliance on rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which accounted for 58 percent of the company's sales in the first quarter but which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. AbbVie itself raised in 2014 profit forecast on Monday, citing strong recent business performance.

39,"  (Adds company statements, case background)By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO, June 24 A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday refused to disturb an order extending landmark constitutional protections for gays and lesbians, an issue which arose when a gay man was excluded from jury service at a trial between AbbVie Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc.The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January had found that the man was improperly excluded because of his sexual orientation. The court's January opinion, from a three-judge panel, heightened constitutional protections judges in several Western states must now apply when evaluating laws that curtail gay rights.The court ordered a new trial between Glaxo and AbbVie, an Abbott Laboratories spinoff. AbbVie requested that the full court rehear the order for a new trial but leave in place the pro-gay rights language. On Tuesday, the 9th Circuit refused. AbbVie spokesman Dirk Van Eeden said the company was studying the latest decision. Glaxo spokesman Marc Meacham said the Glaxo was ""gratified that the court has once again ruled in our favor and sustained the order for a new trial.""The case involved Abbott's pricing of HIV medications, a contentious issue in the gay community. Glaxo accused Abbott of improperly increasing the price of one drug, Norvir, to help it preserve sales growth of one of its other HIV blockbusters, Kaletra. Norvir plays a key role in AIDS-fighting cocktails because it can boost the effectiveness of other drugs. Glaxo accused Abbott of raising Norvir's price by 400 percent in 2003, as part of an effort to harm competitors whose drugs were dependent on being used in combination with Norvir.Glaxo had sought $571 million, but after a four-week trial came away with only a $3.5 million jury award. The 9th Circuit currently has 29 full time judges, and three of them publicly dissented from the court's decision on Tuesday.Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court did not mandate higher constitutional protections for gays and lesbians in the manner decided by the 9th Circuit.What started as an antitrust dispute between drug companies ""has morphed into a constitutional essay about equal protection and sexual orientation,"" O'Scannlain wrote, adding that the 9th Circuit got the case ""egregiously"" wrong.The case in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is Smithkline Beecham Corp dba GlaxoSmithKline vs. Abbott Laboratories, No. 11-17357.

40,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV.N) said on Wednesday it wanted to move rapidly to clinch a takeover of Shire (SHP.L) as it set out the strategic rationale for buying the London-listed company, which has spurned its $46 billion offer. AbbVie called for talks and said it was willing to move ""quickly and cooperatively"" to get a deal, arguing it would create more value from Shire’s assets than the hyperactivity and rare diseases specialist could do on its own.One person familiar with the matter said AbbVie, which stands to cut its tax bill through the deal, could consider bidding more but first wanted to explain its case to Shire shareholders and hear their views on valuation.Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez and AbbVie's senior management plan to meet with U.S. investors in New York on Thursday and Friday, with further meetings planned for London next week, sources close to the situation said.Questioned by analysts, Gonzalez declined to rule out a hostile bid but said his preference was to engage with Shire's management to better understand the upbeat drug sales forecasts set out by the company on Monday.Gonzalez said he was ""even more interested"" in Shire after hearing its plans to more than double sales by 2020 - but he questioned some of the assumptions behind the bullish figures.Buying Shire for $46 billion would boost adjusted earnings per share ""materially"" in the first year following completion, growing to above $1 per share by 2020, AbbVie added - a comment some analysts said suggested it had plenty of room to increase its bid.Although the U.S. group insisted its proposal offered ""compelling"" immediate value, with significant future upside, many investors believe it will have to pay more than 50 pounds a share to get a deal done, rather than the 46.26 pounds implied in its last cash-and-shares offer.Shire said AbbVie's announcement provided no material new information and reiterated its belief that the offer fundamentally undervalued the company.   HIGHER OFFER? Barclays and Jefferies analysts said the U.S. company could make a Shire deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds and 65 pounds a share, respectively, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch put the theoretical takeout range at 50-62 pounds.Buying Shire would allow AbbVie to join a growing number of companies to move their tax base out of the United States and would give it an effective tax rate of around 13 percent by 2016, against 22 percent last year. The enlarged company would be managed from Chicago, listed in New York and incorporated in the British island of Jersey. It is the second attempt by a U.S. pharmaceutical company to buy a London-listed rival, after Pfizer's (PFE.N) $118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) failed last month.Despite criticism from Shire that the nature of the deal would create risks for shareholders, AbbVie said it had thoroughly assessed the tax and structuring aspects and believed the transaction was ""highly executable"". AbbVie's pitch comes as Shire won new ammunition for arguing its worth following a U.S. court decision backing patent claims on its top-selling hyperactivity drug Vyvanse.AbbVie is eager to buy Shire, both to reduce taxation by redomiciling in Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio. The U.S. company currently gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016.But Gonzalez needs to sell AbbVie's marketing clout and financial strength to Shire shareholders, since they would end up owning shares in the enlarged group. AbbVie has already raised its profit forecast for 2014, citing a strong business performance. AbbVie was created as a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and listed in January last year, since when Gonzalez said it had delivered a 64 percent total return to shareholders.SHIRE SHARES GAIN Shares in Shire, which surged on Friday after news of AbbVie's takeover offer emerged, hit a new all-time high of 46.63 pounds before slipping back to close 2.6 percent higher at 45.17 pounds, while the Stoxx Europe 600 drugs sector index .SXDP lost 0.8 percent. Shire's chief executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday he was happy for the company to be sold at the right price, if the board recommended it, as he set out a detailed case as to why AbbVie's offer fell short.Under British takeover rules AbbVie has until July 18 to announce a firm offer for Shire or walk away. The U.S. company said it reserved the right to introduce other forms of consideration and vary the cash-and-share mix of the bid.

The U.S. company - eager to buy Shire to cut its tax bill and diversify its drug portfolio - is weighing an increased bid, but plans first to talk to Shire shareholders to explain its case and get their feedback on valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter.

46,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Shire (SHP.L) flagged the promise of existing and new drugs on Monday as evidence that AbbVie's (ABBV.N) $46 billion offer undervalued the company, the latest British firm to be targeted by a U.S. group seeking lower taxes.Shire is taking a leaf out of AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) playbook by disclosing long-range internal forecasts - a tactic used successfully by its larger London-listed rival in fending off a $118 billion bid from Pfizer (PFE.N). Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said on Monday that current products would generate sales of at least $7 billion by 2020, with $3 billion more coming from drugs still in the pipeline.Shire also said that in the medium term it expected sales of $6.5 billion by 2016. The company, best known for hyperactivity and rare-disease drugs, had said on Friday it was aiming to more than double sales to $10 billion by 2020 without giving details.Ornskov told Reuters that actual sales could be far above $10 billion, since the long-term forecasts did not include revenue from future deal-making or from two recent transactions.""M&A will clearly add growth to the profile,"" he said in an interview, noting that the London-listed company had done six deals since he took over 13 months ago. ""If I included that in the upside it would be way north of $10 billion.""Shire is a serial acquirer, buying rare disease specialist Viropharma for $4.2 billion last November in its biggest deal yet - and Ornskov said further ""large"" deals were possible.As with AstraZeneca's earlier upbeat long-term forecasts, many industry analysts view Shire's $10 billion sales prediction as optimistic, with Credit Suisse saying its own estimates suggested sales of around $8 billion by 2020.Nonetheless, the confident performance may encourage AbbVie to dig deeper after the two companies confirmed a series of approaches following a Reuters report last week.  Analysts at Jefferies estimated the U.S. company could make the deal pay at a price of up to 55 pounds a share, or $55 billion, against AbbVie's most recent rejected cash-and-shares offer on May 30 of just over 46 pounds. Shares in Shire, which hit a all-time high on Friday, ended 1.6 percent lower at 43.03 pounds.Key drugs that Ornskov expects to drive continued strong growth include its best-selling hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse, which is now also being tested as a treatment for binge eating, as well as a much-anticipated drug for dry eye disease called lifitegrast, which it sees as a potential $1 billion-plus seller.Shire is famous for drugs to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder but Ornskov said it had become ""more and more a rare disease company"". The market had yet to catch up fully with the rapid growth and high margins this shift implied, he argued, pointing to the 99 percent total shareholder return achieved since he took over last May. INVERSION AVERSION Shire's strategy copies AstraZeneca's in another way, too, by highlighting the execution risks associated with AbbVie's plan to cut its tax bill through redomiciling in Britain for tax purposes - an industry-wide ploy that has sparked growing political concerns. Such so-called ""inversions"" by U.S. companies have moved center-stage in the pharmaceuticals sector this year, with those firms still paying high tax rates anxious to strike deals that will help them compete with rivals now enjoying lower taxes.Whether Shire, long viewed as a likely takeover target, escapes the clutches of a larger predator is uncertain and the company is widely seen as more vulnerable to a takeover by AbbVie - or another company - than AstraZeneca.  That reflects both its smaller size, which makes it a more manageable target for a wider range of players, and the lack of attendant political issues in Britain, where the company has a relatively small workforce.Although established in Britain in 1986 and listed in London, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been resident in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008.Other companies that industry sources say have looked at Shire in the past include Allergan AGN.L, itself the target of a takeover approach by Valeant (VRX.TO). Banking sources suggest Shire could also appeal to groups such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O). Ornskov declined to comment on whether Shire had received approaches from companies other than AbbVie.One senior banker described Shire as a ""valued inversion target"" but he stressed that potential bidders still needed to demonstrate a tie-up also made strategic sense. For AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, Shire fits the bill in one important respect: it offers a way to reduce his firm's over-reliance on rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which accounted for 58 percent of the company's sales in the first quarter but which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. AbbVie itself raised in 2014 profit forecast on Monday, citing strong recent business performance.

While AbbVie has yet to budge on price since Reuters first revealed its bid interest on June 19, it has stated that a deal at 46.26 would lift its earnings ""materially"" - a comment taken by analysts as a signal that it can afford to pay more.""I'm certainly expecting a revised offer - they are not going to come to the shareholders like this and then disappear,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities, who has a 52 pounds target for the shares.Shire shares were 0.8 percent higher at 45.81 pounds by 0825 GMT (4.25 a.m. EDT).   Sources familiar with the situation said Gonzalez was ready to consider bidding more but first wanted to explain his case direct to major Shire shareholders and urge them to put pressure on Shire to engage, while also getting to hear their views on valuation.AbbVie has already made clear it wants to start serious talks with Shire and gain access to its books to get more clarity on sales prospects for certain key drugs, although it has not ruled out going hostile. In contrast to Pfizer's (PFE.N) recent high-profile - and  unsuccessful - bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L), AbbVie's pursuit of Shire is much more low key, reflecting the U.S. company's publicity-shy nature and the lack of a big political dimension to the proposed takeover. Gonzalez has eschewed media interviews during his round of meetings with investors this week.""One of the challenges with the Pfizer situation was it was very high profile because of the size of the deal and the large infrastructure AstraZeneca has in the UK,"" Malik said. ""AbbVie is taking a more discreet approach.""Shire, while founded in Britain, is today managed out of Boston, headquartered in Dublin and has most of its sales in the United States, resulting in a minimal business footprint in Britain.AbbVie is eager to buy Shire, both to reduce taxation by redomiciling in Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio.

AbbVie has already made clear it wants to start serious talks with Shire and gain access to its books to get more clarity on sales prospects for certain key drugs, although it has not ruled out going hostile.In contrast to Pfizer's recent high-profile - and  unsuccessful - bid for AstraZeneca, AbbVie's pursuit of Shire is much more low key, reflecting the U.S. company's publicity-shy nature and the lack of a big political dimension to the proposed takeover.Gonzalez has eschewed media interviews during his round of meetings with investors this week.""One of the challenges with the Pfizer situation was it was very high profile because of the size of the deal and the large infrastructure AstraZeneca has in the UK,"" Malik said. ""AbbVie is taking a more discreet approach.""Shire, while founded in Britain, is today managed out of Boston, headquartered in Dublin and has most of its sales in the United States, resulting in a minimal business footprint in Britain.AbbVie is eager to buy Shire, both to reduce taxation by redomiciling in Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed up by 0.3 percent, or 17.80 points, at 6,690.17 points.Shire surged 5.9 percent on new signs that the company may have to engage with rival AbbVie to discuss the U.S drugmaker's $51 billion takeover bid for Shire. Merger activity also lifted Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco, after Imperial said it was in talks to buy some brands from Reynolds and Lorillard  as part of a merger plan confirmed by the two U.S. companies.Over the course of the week, the FTSE fell by 2.6 percent, its biggest weekly drop since April.Financial markets have been unsettled this week by problems with Portuguese bank Banco Espirito Santo, and IPR Capital director Steven Mayne backed selling or ""shorting"" any advances by the FTSE 100. ""Political and economic unrest could quickly move the market lower, so I would look to short any rallies,"" said Mayne.The FTSE's retreat since the start of July has pushed it down from peaks reached in late May, which took the index close to record highs.Some traders expect it to remain stuck in its recent trading range, between a high just below 6,900 points and lows around 6,600, through the next month.""I still think that 6,900 is achievable by the year end, but for the moment, it's a bit risk-off,"" said Novum Securities' technical strategist Adrian Slack.

63,"  (Corrects day of week in second paragraph)* Top-five shareholder urges Shire to talk to AbbVie* Other investors write to Shire board pushing case for deal* Shire yet to respond to AbbVie's latest $51 bln offerBy Anjuli Davies and Ben HirschlerLONDON, July 11 Some top investors in Shire  are urging it to engage with AbbVie to discuss the U.S. drugmaker's $51 billion takeover bid as a prolonged silence from the London-listed drugmaker adds to uncertainty over a possible deal.AbbVie, which wants to buy Shire to cut its tax bill and diversify its product line-up, raised its cash-and-stock offer for Shire to 51.15 pounds a share on Tuesday, though this value has since fallen to around 50 as AbbVie shares have slipped.""Based on the new bid, we think Shire should engage,"" one top-five Shire shareholder told Reuters on Friday.Shire shares were 1.2 percent up on the day at 46.55 pounds by 1415 GMT. Other Shire shareholders have also written to the company's board expressing their support for a deal and have called on Chairwoman Susan Kilsby to open talks with AbbVie's Chairman and CEO Richard Gonzalez, several people with direct knowledge of the situation said.They argue that 51 pounds is a good enough number for Shire to allow for due diligence, so that the two sides can negotiate a final deal price.But after rejecting three previous proposals from AbbVie, which it said fundamentally undervalued the company, Shire has still not responded publicly to the latest offer.Industry sources said the hyperactivity and rare diseases specialist was in constant communication with its shareholders and was weighing their feedback, but it remained unclear which path the Shire board would take. A number of investors said they believed a deal could be hammered out in a relatively short time - perhaps even over the coming weekend - given Shire has said it is happy for the company to be sold at the right price.But it is also possible that Shire could yet come out with a strongly worded rejection next week, which would give AbbVie little time to recover. Under British takeover rules AbbVie has until July 18 to announce a firm offer for Shire or walk away for up to six months.Officials at Shire and AbbVie declined to comment. CASE FOR INDEPENDENCE Shire was founded in Britain but is today managed out of Boston, headquartered in Dublin and generates most of its sales in the United States.Buying Shire would allow AbbVie to join a growing number of companies to move their tax base out of the United States and would give it an effective tax rate of around 13 percent by 2016, against 22 percent last year.Shire has made a strong case for independence, arguing that its product sales will double to $10 billion by 2020 as it moves into new disease areas.But many shareholders would rather get rewarded today and are nervous that a deal might slip through their fingers - as happened in May when Pfizer failed in its $118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca.AbbVie has also been actively lobbying Shire investors to get their support. The U.S. group said on July 8 that it and its financial adviser J.P. Morgan had met with, or spoken to, investors representing a majority of Shire's shares.Gonzalez went on to claim that major Shire investors were ""generally supportive of this transaction"" but was forced to retract this comment under strict British takeover rules because he did not give evidence of such support in writing.

AbbVie, which is based in suburban Chicago and makes top-selling arthritis drug Humira and other medicines, raised its cash and stock offer to about $51 billion on Tuesday, hoping to win over its reluctant target after three earlier offers were rejected.AbbVie is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its U.S. tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio. AbbVie  currently gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016.In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez refused to be drawn on the possibility of increasing his offer, but said he was leaving all options open. AbbVie's move on Shire is the second attempt by a U.S. drugmaker to buy a London-listed rival after Pfizer's $118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca failed last month over price.

Shire said it was ready to recommend the deal, the latest in a list of mergers proposed by U.S. firms seeking to cut their tax rates, and which comes less than seven weeks after the collapse of Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), also motivated in part by tax factors.Chicago-based AbbVie, which wants to buy Shire to cut its tax bill and diversify its product line-up, increased its offer to 53.20 pounds per share on Sunday, following a request from the Dublin-based group which had rejected four previous bids. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters had reported on Saturday that Shire, a maker of drugs for rare diseases, had asked AbbVie to sweeten its offer to near 53 pounds per share in order for it to recommend the deal. Shire said the new bid comprised 24.44 pounds in cash and 0.8960 new AbbVie shares for each Shire share and would result in Shire investors owning around 25 percent of the combined entity. ""The proposed offer seems a fair price that represents good value for both companies’ shareholders,"" said Mick Cooper, an analyst at Edison Investment Research. Shares in Shire, founded in 1986, hit a record high of 50.45 pounds in mid-morning trading.AbbVie is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its U.S. tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio. The U.S. group gets nearly 60 percent of its revenue from rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. Analysts at Barclays estimated the move would provide an estimated $1.3 billion tax savings by 2020, reflecting lower UK corporate tax rates.TAX SAVINGS  AbbVie has proposed creating a new U.S.-listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain, whose corporate tax rate is set to drop as low as 20 percent from 2015, well below the U.S. headline rate of 35 percent plus local taxes. The UK government has also introduced tax breaks designed to encourage research and development. ""We expect the majority of the tax savings to be realized within the first two years,"" Barclays analysts said. ""Strategically AbbVie acquires Shire's quality growth assets in platforms including rare diseases, neuroscience and ophthalmology, easing investor concerns about over-reliance on Humira and offering future growth opportunities.""Analyst Alistair Campbell at banking group Berenberg said there were few other British pharmaceutical companies that would suit a tax inversion takeover. ""The company has to be of a certain size, because around 20 percent of the shareholders post deal must be shareholders in the target company, so you can't go for small companies,"" he said. ""Glaxo (GSK.L) is too big, Astra has had an approach from Pfizer and Shire has now gone.""  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN.L), Europe's largest maker of artificial joints, has been seen as a possible contender, with U.S.-based Stryker Corp (SYK.N) forced to say it would not bid for the group after reports linking it with a deal circulated in May. Sweden's Meda AB MEDAa.ST rejected an improved takeover offer from U.S. generics firm Mylan Inc (MYL.O) in April, which could have helped reduce taxes. The approach for Shire, founded in Britain, has been far less controversial than the move for AstraZeneca. Headquartered in Dublin, it is managed from Boston, Massachusetts, and has most of its sales in the United States, resulting in a relatively small business footprint in Britain.Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov had said he was happy for the company to be sold at the right price, but like AstraZeneca in its defense against Pfizer, he had set out a detailed case as to why it was worth a lot more than AbbVie was originally offering.

AbbVie, which is based in Chicago and makes top-selling arthritis drug Humira, boosted its bid for Shire to 53.20 pounds per share on Sunday. Shire has rejected four previous bids.The people cautioned the deal could still take longer to complete and the deadline for an offer could be extended.  Under British takeover rules AbbVie has until July 18 to announce a firm offer for Shire, extend the deadline for an offer, or walk away. AbbVie is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its U.S. tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain - a tactic known as inversion - and to diversify its drug portfolio. AbbVie currently generates nearly 60 percent of its revenue from Humira, the world's top-selling medicine, which loses U.S. patent protection in late 2016. AbbVie's move is the second attempt by a U.S. drugmaker to buy a London-listed rival after Pfizer Inc's $118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca Plc failed in May over price. Reuters reported on Saturday that Shire had asked AbbVie to sweeten its offer to near 53 pounds per share so it could recommend the deal. Shire confirmed the news on Monday.

80,"   By Paul Sandle | LONDON  LONDON U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc bought Dublin-based Shire Plc on Friday in a 32 billion pound ($54.7 billion) deal that will allow it to slash its tax bill by relocating to Britain.The London-listed company, which makes expensive medicines to treat rare diseases, fought off four earlier bids from AbbVie until the U.S. firm raised its price to 52.48 pounds per share - made up of 24.44 pounds in cash and 0.8960 new AbbVie shares.Chicago-based AbbVie is buying Shire to cut both its U.S. tax bill and its reliance on arthritis drug Humira, the world's top selling medicine which loses U.S. patent protection in 2016. AbbVie, which generates nearly 60 percent of its revenue from Humira, had until Friday to announce a firm offer for Shire, extend the deadline or walk away under UK takeover rules.It now plans to create a company listed in New York, incorporated in Jersey, the Channel Islands, and tax-domiciled in Britain, which will pay an effective tax of about 13 percent by 2016, sharply lower than its current rate of about 22 percent, making the deal one of the biggest driven by the tactic known as tax inversion.America's Pfizer Inc tried to pull off the same trick earlier this year when it made a bid for Britain's AstraZeneca plc though its $118 billion deal was rejected.Calls for political action to stop tax inversion deals are growing in the United States. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew urged Congress this week to take steps to discourage companies moving their tax domiciles aboard, saying ""economic patriotism"" was needed.AbbVie's chairman and chief executive Richard Gonzalez said he thought the debate would be more appropriately shifted to tax reform and making companies more competitive in the global economy. U.S. companies cannot move overseas earnings back into the country for acquisitions or investment without losing part of it to the taxman. ""Companies like ours need access to our global cash flows to be able to make investments all around the world, but specifically to be able to make investments in the United States, and today we at a disadvantage versus many of our foreign competitors,"" he said.However, he added, tax cutting was not the main objective of the Shire deal.""It's not the primary rationale for this,"" he told analysts on a conference call, explaining that the combined group would have leadership positions in immunology, rare diseases, neuroscience, and metabolic and liver diseases, as well as a best-in-class product development platform, a stronger pipeline and better R&D capabilities.The merged group will also have more firepower for acquisitions, he said, particularly to bolster the rare disease business, the foundations of which were built on acquisitions by Shire. RAISED GUIDANCE Shire's board had said on Monday it was ready to recommend the higher offer from AbbVie, signaling the end of a lengthy courtship. AbbVie's agreed price represents a premium of about 53 percent to Shire's share price on May 2, the last business day before AbbVie's first offer, which was rebuffed by Shire.Shares in Shire, which will own about 25 percent of the combined group, closed 3.9 percent higher at 49.96 pounds, while AbbVie was up 2.1 percent to $54.65 at 1615 GMT.Gonzalez said Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov, whose tenure at the drugmaker was marked by earnings upgrade after earnings upgrade, would stay on, initially to help with integration and then to head a dedicated rare disease division.Separately, Shire raised its earnings guidance for the year on Friday, to low-to-mid 30 percent growth, from mid-to-high 20 percent growth. The company, which also produces hyperactivity drug Vyvanse, reported record revenue of $1.5 billion for its second quarter and a 42 percent jump in its preferred earnings measure of non-GAAP adjusted earnings per ADS to $2.67.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index, which had been in negative territory for much of the day, staged a late rally to close up by 0.2 percent, or 11.13 points, at 6,749.45 points on Friday.Global stock markets had slumped on Thursday after the shooting-down over eastern Ukraine of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with 298 people on board. World leaders demanded an international investigation into the plane crash, which could mark a turning point in the worst crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War if it convinces reluctant Europeans to get behind tougher sanctions on Russia long sought by the United States.However, a rally in Shire enabled the FTSE 100 to come off its earlier intraday lows. Shire rose nearly 4 percent, adding the most points to the FTSE, after U.S. rival Abbvie  agreed a $55 billion deal to take it over.Merger speculation also lifted ITV by 3.8 percent, after cable group Liberty Global's decision to buy BSkyB's  6.4 percent stake in ITV boosted prospects of a wider bid. In spite of the worries about the Ukraine conflict, some traders have said that corporate takeover activity, and the fact that equities offer better returns than bonds or cash, should enable stock markets to rally into the end of 2014.""The geopolitical situation is quite jittery at the moment, but everybody is looking at the dip as a buying opportunity,"" said Novum Securities' technical analyst Adrian Slack.Others, however, were more circumspect.""We were buying the dips up until the plane crash.

88,"   By Ransdell Pierson  AbbVie Inc, which last week announced plans to buy Dublin-based drugmaker Shire Plc for $55 billion, reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on surging sales of its Humira treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.Second-quarter sales rose 5 percent to $4.93 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $4.7 billion. The gains were mostly due to Humira, an injectable treatment whose global sales jumped 26 percent to $3.29 billion, AbbVie said on Friday.Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said Humira sales were $350 million above expectations, and he affirmed his rating of AbbVie as the top global pick in the pharmaceutical industry.  ""The scale of the Humira beat will surprise all,"" Holford said. But he noted that numerous other AbbVie products fell short in the quarter, including the Androgel testosterone drug, Kaletra medicine for HIV, and Lupron treatment for prostate cancer.Humira, the world's top-selling drug, now accounts for 67 percent of AbbVie's sales. Reliance on the medicine by the suburban Chicago company is a main reason it sought out Shire, which has an array of lucrative treatments for rare diseases.After buying Shire, AbbVie plans to locate the combined company in Britain, where taxes are lower. The maneuver, called tax inversion, is being used by many U.S. companies, especially drugmakers, and has come under fire from President Barack Obama and some members of Congress.  Humira sales were especially strong in the United States, where they rose 36 percent, helped by retail buying patterns.But Humira will take a breather in the third quarter, AbbVie predicted, with its U.S. sales growth tapering to the ""high teens"" percentage range.Humira, approved in 2002 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, is also used to treat other inflammatory conditions.Although Humira's U.S. patent lapses in late 2016, AbbVie has said it will take years for other drugmakers to develop and win approval for their own versions. Besides buying Shire, AbbVie is trying to lessen its dependence on Humira by attempting to develop treatments for hepatitis C, cancer and other diseases.AbbVie said it had earned $1.1 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with $1.07 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding writedowns and other special items, AbbVie earned 82 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 76 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.2 percent.

AbbVie and Calico said on Wednesday the initial funding would help Calico use its scientific expertise to create research facilities in the San Francisco Bay area. Each partner could ultimately invest an additional $500 million in the collaboration.""Calico expects to begin filling critical positions immediately and plans to establish a substantial team of scientists and research staff in the San Francisco Bay area,"" the companies said in a joint release. A year ago Google announced it was creating Calico, to be headed by Art Levinson, the former chief executive officer and guiding force behind Genentech, a cancer company considered by many to be the most successful biotechnology company in history. Levinson left after Genentech was bought by Roche Holding AG ROG.VX.Calico is run separately from Google, the world's largest Internet search company, and focuses on such issues as life-threatening diseases and problems affecting mental and physical agility due to aging.Google increasingly is placing itself at the intersection of medical science and technology. It also backs privately held 23andMe, which sells a $99 DNA test that provides customers ancestry-related genetic reports and uninterpreted raw genetic data. AbbVie said it was the first drugmaker to forge a collaboration with Calico. Under the deal, AbbVie will provide scientific and clinical development support and commercial expertise.The partners will share costs equally, and profits, if drugs are successfully developed.Calico will be responsible for discovering drugs and studying them in early stage trials during the first five years. It will continue for a 10-year period to advance its experimental drugs through Phase 2a studies, small mid-stage trials that establish a likelihood the drugs may work in larger studies.Under the deal, AbbVie will back Calico's early research and, following completion of Phase 2a studies, will have the option to manage late-stage trials and marketing. AbbVie was spun off in early 2013 from Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N), and sells Humira, a $13 billion-a-year treatment for rheumatoid arthritis which is the world's top-selling  medicine.Humira accounts for 60 percent of AbbVie sales, and the suburban Chicago company needs new drugs to lessen its heavy reliance on the product. It is developing drugs for arthritis, hepatitis C, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AbbVie in July agreed to pay $55 billion for Dublin-based Shire Plc (SHP.L), moving it into the lucrative arena of rare diseases, in a deal that will allow it to slash its tax bill by relocating to Britain.  Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie's chief executive, on Wednesday said the Calico deal will further diversify his company.

Google increasingly is placing itself at the intersection of medical science and technology. It also backs privately held 23andMe, which sells a $99 DNA test that provides customers ancestry-related genetic reports and uninterpreted raw genetic data.AbbVie said it was the first drugmaker to forge a collaboration with Calico. Under the deal, AbbVie will provide scientific and clinical development support and commercial expertise.The partners will share costs equally, and profits, if drugs are successfully developed. Calico will be responsible for discovering drugs and studying them in early stage trials during the first five years. It will continue for a 10-year period to advance its experimental drugs through Phase 2a studies, small mid-stage trials that establish a likelihood the drugs may work in larger studies.Under the deal, AbbVie will back Calico's early research and, following completion of Phase 2a studies, will have the option to manage late-stage trials and marketing.AbbVie was spun off in early 2013 from Abbott Laboratories Inc, and sells Humira, a $13 billion-a-year treatment for rheumatoid arthritis which is the world's top-selling  medicine. Humira accounts for 60 percent of AbbVie sales, and the suburban Chicago company needs new drugs to lessen its heavy reliance on the product. It is developing drugs for arthritis, hepatitis C, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.AbbVie in July agreed to pay $55 billion for Dublin-based Shire Plc, moving it into the lucrative arena of rare diseases, in a deal that will allow it to slash its tax bill by relocating to Britain.Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie's chief executive, on Wednesday said the Calico deal will further diversify his company. ""This collaboration demonstrates our commitment to exploring new areas of medicine.""Calico is attracting a growing stable of research heavy-hitters, including Hal Barron, a former chief medical officer and head of product development at Roche who is now Calico's research chief.Well known geneticist David Botstein is Calico's chief scientific officer, while remaining a professor at Princeton University. Cynthia Kenyon, a biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is a leading authority on aging genetics, left earlier this year to become Calico's vice president for aging research.

The move comes a day after Calico partnered with Roche's  rival AbbVie Inc to invest in new research operations for age-related diseases.Levinson, 64, is a former chief executive and guiding force behind Genentech, a cancer company considered by many to be the most successful biotechnology company in history. He stepped down as CEO after Roche bought out the remaining stake it did not already own in the U.S. group for $47 billion in 2009, but became a board member at the Swiss drugmaker.Fabian Wenner, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich said it was a shame Roche had not been able to keep hold of a person with extensive sector experience and a strong track record. ""Apart from Art, there's only one board member now with sector experience which is quite a loss for Roche in my view,"" he said. ""The fact the Calico partnered with AbbVie and not with Roche is not a good indicator.""Levinson, who is also chairman of Apple, has a high-calibre network and has already poached several heavy-hitters to join Google's nascent biotech company, including Hal Barron, Roche's former chief medical officer, who joined Calico last year.""We regret Art's decision but at the same time understand his reasons,"" said Roche Chairman Christoph Franz in a statement.Levinson was passed over for the role of Roche chairman in favour of Franz, a former CEO of German airline Lufthansa  who took up the job in March.

AbbVie lost 4.6 percent in pre-market U.S. dealings.Smith & Nephew and Swiss biotech group Actelion , two other perennial targets of bid speculation, fell 3.5 percent and 2.2 percent respectively. Investors had been expecting some action from the Obama administration to clamp down on tax-avoidance inversions but the steps announced on Monday were more far-reaching than anticipated, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.The new rules, effective immediately, will make new inversions more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding - but whether that will be enough to scupper deals that are pending or under consideration is not clear.The action follows months of political debate, with Democrats urging prompt legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the problem later, perhaps in 2015, as part of a broader overhaul of the loophole-riddled federal tax code.""Inversion deals now are clearly going to be very difficult to pull off,"" Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities, said.That could kill off prospects of Pfizer returning to bid for AstraZeneca at the end of November, when a six-month cooling-off period imposed by British takeover rules comes to an end and the U.S. group can publicly launch a new offer, Malik said. Other analysts were less certain. Andrew Baum of Citi said the Treasury move would have a limited impact on the economic case for a Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal - though the threat of additional measures could give the U.S. group pause - and he still expects Pfizer to return after the Nov. 26 deadline.Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are bound by rules that mean they cannot comment on deal prospects. However, the British firm said previously that the controversial tax issue was a big risk for investors that could cause major delays to any transaction.The Shire deal may still go ahead, since it is already in train, although AbbVie will likely lose upside from planned tax savings, making the picture uncertain. The transaction is due to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2014.""Shire has enough momentum in its business and a good enough pipeline that it would be attractive to AbbVie anyway,"" Malik said. ""The tax inversion was the icing on the cake.""Shire and AbbVie officials did not have any immediate comment on the latest developments. INVERSION SURGE Inversions have surged in the past year, pursued by healthcare companies in particular, although fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide is also in the midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with Tim Hortons.Medical technology group Medtronic, meanwhile, is working to close an inversion deal into Ireland with rival Covidien, while Mylan plans to buy certain Abbott Laboratories' drugs in developed markets outside the United States in another tax-cutting transaction.About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, but the pace has picked up, with half of those completed since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to a Reuters review.A key target of Treasury's actions is foreign profits held offshore by U.S. multinationals under a U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rule that defers taxation on such profits unless and until they are brought into the United States.One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from using ""hopscotch"" loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes when tapping such tax-deferred foreign profits. Another rule will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of profits by using ""decontrolling"" strategies that restructure foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled.Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of ownership that the former U.S. owners can have in an inverted company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the IRS, a move that will make it harder to do these deals.

105,"  Sept 24 Shire Plc, which is in the process of being acquired by AbbVie Inc, has agreed to pay $56.5 million to resolve allegations of making false claims in the marketing of its ADHD drug Adderall XR, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday.The settlement involved charges that Ireland-based Shire, between January 2004 and December 2007, promoted its extended release Adderall with claims of superiority over rival medicines that were not supported by clinical data, the Justice Department said.The company was also accused of promoting the drug for unapproved uses and of making other false claims not supported by data, such as that Adderall XR would prevent poor academic performance, loss of employment, criminal behavior, traffic accidents, and sexually transmitted disease. The settlement also resolves allegations that, between February 2007 and September 2010, Shire sales representatives  allegedly made false and misleading statements about the efficacy and abuse liability of its other attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medicine Vyvanse to state Medicaid formulary committees and to individual physicians.

Shire urged AbbVie to push ahead, pointing out that the U.S. drugmaker might have to pay a breakup fee of $1.64 billion were it to renege on its recommendation for the deal to shareholders.""The board of Shire believes that AbbVie should proceed with the recommended offer on the agreed terms,"" Shire said in a statement. And the British drugmaker waived a requirement that AbbVie give it three business days' notice before holding the board meeting.AbbVie's second thoughts on the deal surprised Shire investors, coming just weeks after AbbVie chief executive Richard Gonzalez, in the wake of the Treasury proposals, told employees of both companies he was ""more energized than ever"" about the transaction.Moreover, tax advisers had said the Treasury measures were unlikely to significantly impact most inversion deals.By domiciling the combined group in Britain, AbbVie would be able to cut its 22 percent tax rate to about 13 percent for the new company. Besides the tax advantage, Gonzalez said AbbVie was attracted to Shire's portfolio of lucrative drugs to treat rare diseases and other medicines in development.Buying Shire would also reduce AbbVie's reliance on arthritis treatment Humira, the world's top selling medicine, whose $13 billion in annual sales accounts for more than 60 percent of company revenue. Although Humira's U.S. patent lapses in 2016, AbbVie hopes it will take years for rivals to develop generic formulations. POLITICAL HEAT The number of tax-inversion deals, particularly in healthcare, have surged in the past year, putting pressure on the Obama administration to clamp down on corporate deals aimed at lowering tax bills.The U.S. Treasury proposed changes to tax regulations that would limit tax inversion, including a prohibition on ""hopscotch"" loans, which allow U.S. companies to access foreign cash without paying tax in the United States.Cenkos analyst Navid Malik said AbbVie, by calling for the board meeting, could be playing ""hardball"" to win better deal terms.""They could have put this out to try and get Shire back to the table to potentially renegotiate, but I don't think that will happen,"" he said. AbbVie, by walking away from Shire, would run the risk of finding itself a takeover target by a foreign acquirer with a cost-cutting bent, such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International , said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal.BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei maintained his ""Outperform"" rating on AbbVie, saying it could shrug off the hefty breakup fee if positive trends for the company are seen this year - including the launch of a hepatitis C drug and favorable data from trials of potential blockbuster treatments for endometriosis and cancer.Pfizer abandoned its bid for AstraZeneca in May after its offer was rejected but, under UK takeover rules, can make another run at its British rival in late November.Many analysts have speculated Pfizer might indeed re-approach AstraZeneca with a higher bid, in hopes of locating the combined company in tax-friendlier Britain.But Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan late on Tuesday said AbbVie's reconsideration of the Shire deal, presumably motivated in part by potential U.S. roadblocks for tax inversions, could dampen Pfizer's interest in AstraZeneca.HEDGE FUNDS BURNT Some of the world's top hedge fund managers, who had been building up ""long"" positions betting on future share price gains at Shire due to AbbVie's bid interest, faced getting burnt by AbbVie's decision.Data from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) showed that no fund had a major ""short"" position of more than 0.5 percent that marked a bet on Shire's shares falling in future.""We just don't know what's happened,"" said one hedge fund manager, who declined to be named.(Writing by Kate Holton; Additional reporting by Sarah Young, Anjuli Davies and Sudip Kar Gupta; Editing by Anna Willard, Giles Elgood and Gunna Dickson)",2014-10-15,ABBV,"Wed Oct 15, 2014 | 5:18pm EDT",UPDATE 6-AbbVie cools on $55 bln Shire deal after U.S. tax changes,http://www.reuters.com//article/shire-ma-abbvie-idUSL6N0SA0O520141015?type=companyNews

Many analysts have speculated Pfizer might indeed re-approach AstraZeneca with a higher bid, in hopes of locating the combined company in tax-friendlier Britain.But Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan late on Tuesday said AbbVie's reconsideration of the Shire deal, presumably motivated in part by potential U.S. roadblocks for tax inversions, could dampen Pfizer's interest in AstraZeneca.HEDGE FUNDS BURNT Some of the world's top hedge fund managers, who had been building up ""long"" positions betting on future share price gains at Shire due to AbbVie's bid interest, faced getting burnt by AbbVie's decision. Data from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) showed that no fund had a major ""short"" position of more than 0.5 percent that marked a bet on Shire's shares falling in future.""We just don’t know what's happened,"" said one hedge fund manager, who declined to be named.

Futures were little changed earlier in the day before dropping steeply in heavy trading, reflecting a recent jump in volatility in the equity markets.Aside from concerns about the global economy, Chicago-based AbbVie said it was reconsidering its $55 billion takeover of the company weeks after the U.S. government moved to curb deals designed to reduce tax, throwing the vitality of merger and acquisition activity into doubt.U.S.-listed shares of Shire tumbled 25.9 percent to $182.24 before the opening bell while AbbVie shares declined 4.1 percent to $51.90. ""This is the bottom line, the market is technically broken, expect this volatility because technically it needs to build a base again, so any news that would not necessarily have affected it as much will now affect it more - it's amplified,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.At 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT), investors will digest a trio of economic reports, including the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for October, as well as retail sales and the producer price index for September.Investors will also look to the latest earnings reports for signs of growth. Bank of America shares were up 0.7 percent to $16.64 in premarket after posting its third-quarter results.Later in the session at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT), business inventories for August are due, while the Federal Reserve's Beige Book on business activity across the nation is expected at 2:00 p.m. S&P 500 companies are expected to show earnings growth of 6.4 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, with revenue growth expected at 4 percent.Ebola-related stocks were the most active in premarket trading, after the Texas Department of State Health Services said a second healthcare worker, who had treated the first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, has tested positive for the disease.Lakeland Industries, a maker of garments to guard against hazardous materials, jumped 16.1 percent to $24.88 before the opening bell. Alpha Pro Tech, a maker of face masks, was up 21.1 percent to $8.91 in premarket, after rocketing 129 percent last week. Versar Inc, a project management company that has a hazardous waste segment jumped 15.5 percent to $4.85.* S&P 500 e-minis were down 16.5 points, or 0.88 percent, with 352,583 contracts changing hands.* Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 29 points, or 0.76 percent, in volume of 50,221 contracts.* Dow e-minis were down 111 points, or 0.68 percent, with 54,600 contracts changing hands.

123,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV.N) has pulled the plug on its plan to buy Dublin-based Shire (SHP.L), recommending shareholders vote against the proposed $55 billion takeover following new U.S. tax rules.Shire stands to be paid a break-up fee of about $1.64 billion, assuming AbbVie's shareholders follow the advice and reject the transaction.The reversal -- which had been anticipated after Chicago-based AbbVie said it was reconsidering the deal -- hands a major scalp to the U.S. Treasury, which has been fighting to make tax-avoiding acquisitions more difficult.That has hit the value of other potential takeover targets in Europe and cast a shadow over transactions that have yet to be completed. But AbbVie's retreat could spark fresh deal-making by Shire, which has a strong track record of acquisitions to fuel its fast-growing business and may now look around to buy other companies, with its firepower boosted by the break-up fee. The U.S. government's tax proposals are designed to make it harder for American firms to shift their tax bases out of the country and into lower cost jurisdictions in Europe.""The agreed-upon valuation is no longer supported as a result of the changes to the tax rules and we did not believe it was in the best interests of our stockholders to proceed,"" AbbVie's chief executive Richard Gonzalez said in a statement. AbbVie's move for Shire, a leader in drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and rare diseases, was announced in July amid a spate of deals in the pharmaceutical sector.Gonzalez said at the time that the acquisition, involving the creation of a new U.S.-listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain, was not just about tax.But the firm said on Thursday that the changes in the U.S. tax regime ""eliminated certain of the financial benefits of the transaction, most notably the ability to access current and future global cash flows in a tax efficient manner as originally contemplated in the transaction. This fundamentally changed the implied value of Shire to AbbVie in a significant manner.""Shire said it was considering the current situation and would make a further announcement in due course. News on Wednesday that AbbVie was cooling to the transaction hammered shares in Shire, sending them down 22 percent to where they were before the deal talks emerged in June, and the shares were down a further 12 percent at 3,525 pence by 1145 GMT. AbbVie's charge of heart has been a bombshell for some of the world's top hedge funds, which have lost out heavily on the Shire stock they were holding. SHAREHOLDER MEETING AbbVie said the withdrawal of its recommendation alone would not cause a lapse in the offer for Shire and it must convene a shareholder meeting before Dec. 14 to vote on the deal. A spate of so-called tax inversion merger deals, particularly in healthcare, prompted the U.S. move to change tax regulations, including placing a ban on loans that allow U.S. firms to access foreign cash without paying U.S. tax.AbbVie said the breadth and scope of the changes ""introduced an unacceptable level of uncertainty to the transaction"".The company also took a swipe at the ""unilateral"" nature of the U.S. government's move and complained about ""the unexpected nature of the exercise of administrative authority to impact longstanding tax principles"".AbbVie's second thoughts on the deal have surprised Shire investors, coming just weeks after Gonzalez, in the wake of the Treasury proposals, told employees of both companies he was ""more energized than ever"" about the transaction.Aside from the tax benefits, buying Shire offered AbbVie a way to reduce reliance on arthritis treatment Humira, the world's top selling medicine, whose $13 billion in annual sales accounts for more than 60 percent of company revenue. The episode has fueled doubts about whether Pfizer (PFE.N) will ever make another run at AstraZeneca (AZN.L), after abandoning a $118 billion bid in May. AstraZeneca shares fell 2.5 percent on Thursday, after losing ground on Wednesday.Shares in Britain's Smith & Nephew (SN.L) and Switzerland's Actelion ATLN.VX, also tipped as inversion targets, both fell a further 3 percent.Tax experts say inversions are still possible but the U.S. action has cut their appeal, suggesting they will only make sense if there is a compelling strategic fit between two firms.Two other U.S. drugmakers, Salix Pharmaceuticals SLXP.O and Auxilium Pharmaceuticals AUXL.O, have already called off smaller inversion deals this month.SHIRE'S OWN DEAL-MAKING Analysts are now looking ahead to Shire's strategy as an independent company once again and its own potential for making acquisitions -- or else becoming a target for another company.Before the AbbVie agreement, Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov had made clear he was interested in buying assets and Jefferies analysts said a standalone Shire could now be poised to aggressively target acquisitions.Shire itself might also be a target for other pharmaceutical companies less driven by tax considerations. Allergan (AGN.N), for example, which is fighting a bid from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRTX.O), has approached Shire in the past.

It was sole adviser to Abbvie and had been set to earn $45 million in fees, a substantial portion of which were to be paid on completion, according to Abbvie's deal prospectus. Shire's advisers  -- Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Citi (C.N), Deutsche Bank  (DBKGn.DE) and Evercore (EVR.N) -- were set to share a fee pool of between $70 and $90 million, according to estimates from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting. It is not known how much could still be payable to advisors. Bankers will typically earn about 10 percent of the fee total if a deal fails, according to the consulting firm.For example, British water company Severn Trent paid 19 million pounds ($30.4 million) in fees to its legal and financial advisers when it fended off a takeover bid by a Canadian-led consortium of investors in 2013.

The index's 4.6 percent fall over the past two days is the steepest since the height of the euro zone debt crisis in October 2011. It was the same type of crisis concerns that were rattling the market on Thursday, with Greek bonds and stocks plunging for two days now on concern about Athens's plan to exit its bailout more than a year ahead of schedule and the threat of early elections next year.A raft of weak global economic data recently has also hit global equities, which have climbed to high valuations as the U.S. Federal Reserve winds down its asset-buying programme.An MSCI index of UK shares was trading at 13.6 percent times its expected earnings before the rout started, its highest multiple since 2005, Datastream data showed.

130,"   By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Nishant Kumar | LONDON  LONDON Some of the world's best known hedge funds lost hundreds of  millions of dollars in the value of the stock they hold as Shire plunged after AbbVie's decision to reconsider its $55 billion bid for the British healthcare group.Data from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulatory body showed that no fund had a major ""short"" position of more than 0.5 percent, indicating that most hedge funds were confident of the deal's success.Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson's Paulson & Co along with Elliott Management, the investment arm of hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer, were among those that had built ""long"" positions after buying Shire shares.Shire's value plunged more than 20 percent on Wednesday from around $49 billion to $39 billion, wiping around $500 million from the value of Paulson's stake and $270 million off Elliott Management's stake, according to Reuters calculations.Chicago-based AbbVie was eager to buy Shire to reduce its U.S. tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain.""It seems Abbvie is getting cold feet due to changes in tax rules in U.S. and also perhaps ongoing correction in markets,"" said Amit Jain, co-founder of hedge fund Amagis Capital that held bets on the deal going through.The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled changes on Sept. 22 to the rules for so-called corporate ""inversions,"" which have become a cause of concern in Washington because of the threat posed to U.S. corporate income tax receipts.Shire's shares fell 2.5 percent the day after the tax changes were announced and the stock's latest slump has now wiped $13 billion off its market capitalisation. BOLD BETS LEAD TO 'ARBAGEDDON' Paulson had been steadily building a long position on Shire since June 23, when news of a potential deal first emerged.By Oct. 10, he had became the second-largest shareholder in Shire, owning 4.7 percent of the company, a stake worth 1.44 billion pounds ($2.29 billion) as of Oct. 14. Singer's Elliott Management had a 1.4 percent stake while Magnetar Financial, whose strategies include ""event-driven"" trading such as takeover bid situations, had a 2.8 percent stake.The hit to Shire's shares trended on Twitter under the banner of 'Arbageddon', signifying how merger arbitrage funds would have suffered from Shire's slump.SteppenWolf Capital chief investment officer Phoebus Theologites said there was a high chance that specialist 'merger arb' funds would have been burnt by the drop in Shire stock.""That’s the name of the game - you win some, you lose some. We discussed going long Shire last year, as a takeover target, and I nixed it on the basis that a macro fund has no place trading specials or risk arbs,"" said Theologites. One hedge fund with a position in Shire admitted being caught out by AbbVie's change of heart.""We just don’t know what's happened. One of these situations that is being held very closely.

131,"  * FTSE 100 steadies after 2.8 pct drop in previous session* Shire slumps again as AbbVie gets cold feet over deal* FTSE down around 8 pct since start of 2014By Sudip Kar-GuptaLONDON, Oct 16 Britain's top equity index steadied on Thursday after a sharp sell-off in the previous session that had taken it to a 15-month low, although healthcare group Shire slumped for the second day in a row. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up by 0.2 percent, or 14.21 points, at 6,225.85 points in early session trading on Thursday, recovering slightly after a 2.8 percent drop on Wednesday that sent it to its lowest level since July 2013.Shire slid 9 percent to 3,647 pence, adding to a 22 percent drop on Wednesday, after U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie  recommended that shareholders vote against its $55 billion takeover of Shire in the wake of a U.S. government move to curb deals designed to cut high taxes. ""The AbbVie deal does look dead in the immediate future. But Shire is still a quality business, and once the dust settles on this, I'd be looking to buy back into Shire shares at around 35 pounds,"" said Central Markets trading analyst Joe Neighbour.The FTSE 100 hit a peak of 6,904.86 points at the start of September, which marked its highest level since early 2000. However, the index has since lost ground and is down 8 percent since the start of 2014, as concerns have increased about the fragile state of the European economy given weak data coming out of Germany in the last two weeks.Darren Easton, director of trading at Logic Investments, said he was ""short"" the FTSE - betting on future falls - for the near-term.""We're still bearish in the short term,"" he said.Easton said the FTSE could drop down to the 6,050 level during October, but he expected the FTSE to then rally in December and get back up to the 6,600-6,800 point range.

136,"  (Adds details on Paulson shareholdings in Allergan and Shire, background)By Olivia OranOct 20 Allergan Inc shareholder Paulson & Co is urging the Botox maker to merge with specialty pharmaceutical company Shire Plc as an alternative to a deal with hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, according to two people familiar with the matter.The hedge fund, which earlier supported a deal with Valeant, told Allergan CEO David Pyott that it would now support a deal with Shire, the sources said. It was not immediately clear whether Allergan would pursue such a deal.Paulson had a 1.9 percent stake in Allergan, making it one of the company's top 10 shareholders, according to Thomson Reuters data as of June 30. Paulson was also Shire's third-largest shareholder, according to the data. Allergan and Paulson declined to comment. Shire, which makes drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and rare diseases, was not immediately available for comment.Paulson's move, which adds a new twist in the battle for Allergan, comes after Shire's $54 billion ""tax inversion"" deal to sell itself to AbbVie Inc fell apart after the U.S. government proposed new rules to make such transactions less attractive. Last week, AbbVie's board recommended that shareholders vote against the deal. The U-turn caused Shire's shares to plunge, with Paulson and other investors seeing the value of their holdings fall. Paulson had a 1.7 percent stake in Shire as of June 30, according to Thomson Reuters data.The sources said any deal between Allergan and Shire, which is based in Dublin, would not be structured as a so-called tax inversion. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts previously said a deal between Allergan and Shire could make sense because it would diversify the sales mix, expand Shire's geographic reach and preserve research and development programs.Allergan shareholders, including Paulson, have been looking at alternative strategies for the company as it tries to fend off Valeant. The Canadian company teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman in April to bid for Allergan.Valeant might raise its bid for Allergan and will not abandon its pursuit ahead of a Dec. 18 special meeting, Michael Pearson, CEO of the Laval, Quebec-based company, said on Monday.Some large Allergan shareholders have said they would prefer a deal with drugmaker Actavis Plc to a tie-up with Shire. Actavis plans to approach Allergan again about a potential merger, sources previously told Reuters.

137,"  (Removes extraneous word in paragraph 7)LONDON Oct 20 British drugmaker Shire  will lose its interim chief financial officer early next year to water supplier Severn Trent, the latest blow for Shire, whose proposed $55-billion acquisition by U.S. rival AbbVie  was aborted last week.Shire's James Bowling will leave the Dublin-based firm at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and become chief financial officer at Severn Trent to replace retiring CFO Mike McKeon.His departure hints at the disruption caused by AbbVie's on-off deal to acquire Shire, with the prospect of becoming part of a Chicago-based group prompting some Shire executives to look elsewhere for opportunities. AbbVie's move for Shire, a leader in drugs to treat attention deficit disorder and rare diseases, was announced in July amid a spate of deals in the pharmaceutical sector largely driven by tax savings. But AbbVie's U-turn after the U.S. government proposed new tax rules has now focused attention on Shire's future as an independent company and its own potential for making acquisitions, or else becoming a target once again.Bowling took over in the CFO role at Shire on an interim basis on March 1 when the finance director at the time, Graham Hetherington, stepped down. Shares in Shire were down 1 percent at 0737 GMT, while Severn Trent shares were flat.Severn Trent also said on Monday that it would cut three director posts with effect from Jan. 23, leaving two executive directors and six non-executive directors.

139,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (This story has been refiled from the Oct. 20 story to fix a typo in the headline)AbbVie (ABBV.N) Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez for three months led the charge to buy Dublin drugmaker Shire for $55 billion, only to walk away from the deal last week, but analysts and fund managers said he deserves credit for trying and should remain at the helm of the Chicago drugmaker. The merger could have been a defining triumph for Gonzalez, a quiet and low-profile manager who has been building an ambitious lineup of experimental drugs since his company was spun off in early 2013 from Abbott Laboratories. During his decades at Abbott, Gonzalez seldom emerged from the shadow of blustery Chief Executive Miles White, and the Shire deal gave him a rare burst of limelight.Investors were given no advance warning on Thursday, when  AbbVie recommended that its shareholders reject the Shire transaction, and it agreed to pay Shire a $1.64 billion breakup fee.""This came as a complete surprise both to investors and to Shire and they have a legitimate gripe about how AbbVie handled the communication,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. Although it could take AbbVie a long time to regain investor trust, Gal predicted investors will not hold Gonzalez, 60,  personally responsible for the collapsed Shire deal because circumstances changed in recent weeks.By buying Shire and relocating the combined company to Britain, AbbVie hoped to slash its corporate tax rate, in one of the biggest such ""tax inversions"" attempted by any U.S. company. And Shire's lucrative drugs for rare diseases and attention deficit disorder would have lessened AbbVie's reliance on its arthritis treatment Humira, the world's biggest-selling drug, whose $13 billion in annual revenue comprise almost 60 percent of AbbVie sales.AbbVie late on Monday said its board pulled out of the deal because of reinterpretations of tax law made on Sept. 22 by the the U.S. Treasury Department, which would have destroyed financial benefits of inversion deals. ""Treasury flipped it on its head, turning a very good deal into a very bad one,"" Glenn Tilton, an independent director of AbbVie, said in an interview on Monday.  Moreover, Tilton said Treasury left the door open for more changes in tax law, which would have posed additional risk to AbbVie and its shareholders. JOB SAFE FOR NOW Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, said Gonzalez' job looks safe, as long as he continues to spearhead development of experimental AbbVie treatments for hepatitis C, cancer, endometriosis, multiple sclerosis and other drugs that could be approved before Humira loses ground to generics in the next few years. ""Overall he's done a great job diversifying the company away from Humira,"" said Jonas, whose company sold its AbbVie shares last year. ""Their R&D portfolio is very strong."" But Jonas said AbbVie needs to remain on the hunt for other deals to bolster its drug lineup.In its agreement to buy Shire, AbbVie was likely unable to renegotiate the terms of the merger in the case of extenuating circumstances, such as changes in U.S. tax laws, because British Takeover Panel rules are very stringent and don’t allow for any amendments to a deal structure once it is announced. ""Some shareholders will be disappointed in (Gonzalez')  performance,"" said Marshall Gordon, an analyst with ClearBridge Investments, which holds 1 million shares of AbbVie. ""But I think he tried to put a good deal together and unfortunately the government changed the rules midstream in a way that was hard to predict.""Oliver Pursche, co-portfolio manager with Gary Goldberg Financial Services, however, said Gonzalez' survival is anything but assured. ""If AbbVie's stock rebounds and goes up, and Treasury gets Congress to enact legislation that would make inversions unattractive, Gonzalez will get some credit.

143,"  (Corrects typographical error in headline)By Ransdell PiersonNEW YORK Oct 20 AbbVie Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez for three months led the charge to buy Dublin drugmaker Shire for $55 billion, only to walk away from the deal last week, but analysts and fund managers said he deserves credit for trying and should remain at the helm of the Chicago drugmaker.The merger could have been a defining triumph for Gonzalez, a quiet and low-profile manager who has been building an ambitious lineup of experimental drugs since his company was spun off in early 2013 from Abbott Laboratories. During his decades at Abbott, Gonzalez seldom emerged from the shadow of blustery Chief Executive Miles White, and the Shire deal gave him a rare burst of limelight.Investors were given no advance warning on Thursday, when  AbbVie recommended that its shareholders reject the Shire transaction, and it agreed to pay Shire a $1.64 billion breakup fee.""This came as a complete surprise both to investors and to Shire and they have a legitimate gripe about how AbbVie handled the communication,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal.

The drug had third quarter sales of $2.8 billion even though it was only approved in December.Harvoni, approved this month by U.S. regulators, combines Sovaldi with another Gilead drug and is expected to dominate treatment of the liver disease that affects an estimated 3 million Americans.    Miller said Sovaldi's cost is particularly hitting state prisons and Medicaid, the insurance program for the indigent funded jointly by states and the federal government, because those populations have high rates of infection with the hepatitis C virus. Express Scripts said U.S. regulators by December could approve AbbVie's product, which combines three drugs into a single pill.""(We) are hoping they take a different approach when it comes to pricing,"" Miller said.But Adelle Infante, an AbbVie spokeswoman, said no price has  been disclosed for her company's drug, which does not yet have a name. The suburban Chicago drugmaker is hoping it will be approved this year. Gilead officials could not immediately be reached for comment.The AbbVie product, like Harvoni, would not need to be taken with interferon, a harsh injectable drug that for years had been part of a standard regimen for the disease, which can quietly harm or destroy the liver over a period of decades. Should the AbbVie drug be deemed clinically equivalent but less costly than Sovaldi and Harvoni, Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the Gilead drugs could be given lower priority on its drug formulary, or be removed from it. Express Scripts is the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager.

A few other AbbVie brands showed strong growth in the quarter, including thyroid hormone replacement drug Synthroid, whose sales rose 24 percent to $200 million.

AbbVie also presented data from another mid-stage study where patients infected with both genotype 1 hepatitis C and HIV viruses showed response rates of 93.5 percent and 90.6 percent  after 12 and 24 weeks post-treatment, respectively.AbbVie's treatments are co-administered with Ribavirin, a commonly used drug in the treatment of hepatitis C which comes with a harsh safety profile.Shares of AbbVie were up 0.11 percent at $63.72 and those of Enanta were down 0.20 percent at $44.05 in early trading.

165,"  * Event driven funds lose $3.3 bln in outflows in two months* Such funds gathered $10 bln until August on gains in 2013* Abandoned Shire-AbbVie deal led to loss for several fundsBy Nishant KumarLONDON, Nov 13 Hedge funds specialising in bets on mergers and acquisitions are starting to see investors withdraw funds, prompting them to take a more cautious approach after being caught out by more than 500 corporate deals globally failing this year.Part of a broader industry strategy aimed at making money from major corporate events, these deal-focused funds gained an average 13 percent in 2013, their best year since 2010, which helped them lure in a net $10 billion in new cash through August this year, data from industry tracker Eurekahedge showed.But a series of failed deals, including the collapse of a $55 billion tie-up between UK drugmaker Shire and U.S. peer AbbVie, has led to losses for some of the world's biggest proponents of the strategy, with investors pulling out $3.3 billion in the last two months alone.""The AbbVie/Shire break, in particular, has led to a far reaching de-risking exercise for many funds,"" said Pierre di Maria, head of event driven strategy at Cheyne Capital.""Those funds have reduced their gross exposure to deals in order to lessen their overall risk and to be able to face any upcoming redemptions,"" he added.The year had started well as a combination of low interest rates, weak global economic growth and companies flush with cash boosted M&A deals. As of Nov. 10, deal volume was up 47 percent year-on-year to $2.9 trillion, Thomson Reuters data showed.However, at the same time, deals worth $580 billion have been pulled, the most since 2008, trapping many funds on the wrong side of the so called ""merger arbitrage"" trade, which aims to eke out returns by capturing the spread between a company's market price and the price at which it may be acquired. BOLD BETS The recent blow from AbbVie pulling its bid for Shire -- after the U.S. government moved to curb deals designed to cut taxes -- has led to losses for the likes of Paulson & Co, Tyrus Capital and Elliott Management. ""The deal breaks have made managers more conscious of political risk and intervention within the M&A space,"" said Jeff Holland, a managing director at hedge fund investor Liongate Capital Management.While the Shire deal was only the fourth-biggest deal to fall apart this year, behind the abandoned 70 billion pounds ($110.4 billion) bid by Pfizer for AstraZeneca  in May, many funds had bet big on its success.That concentration was reflected in Shire's share price fall when the deal broke up -- 22 percent, about twice that of AstraZeneca when it went through a similar situation.Following the Shire deal collapse, merger arbitrage spreads, or the difference between a company's share price and the price at which it may be bought, on other deals widened by 2.5 percent on average as a number of hedge funds liquidated positions, presenting an investment opportunity for some, said Di Maria of Cheyne Capital, adding he had nearly doubled the size of his merger arbitrage portfolio. DEEP LOSSES Hedge fund manager John Paulson, who invested 1.44 billion pounds in Shire on Oct. 14, saw his Advantage fund lose 13.6 percent in October, according to an investor, while Elliott Associates said it may take legal action against AbbVie for scuttling the deal and losses.Another fund to take a hit was Tyrus Capital, which bet both on Shire's share price rising and AbbVie's share price falling. The $1.4 billion Tyrus Capital Event Fund ended October down about 6.5 percent, fund data obtained by Reuters showed.""This has raised questions about portfolio concentration of hedge funds on some risky M&A deals,"" said Philippe Ferreira, head of research at Lyxor Asset Management.""We are advising investors having a strong exposure to event driven to diversify their portfolios,"" he added.An index from Eurekahedge tracking event-driven funds fell 2.1 percent in October, its biggest monthly decline since 2011, highlighting their poor recent performance.Investors keen to capture merger arbitrage returns, which are less correlated to other strategies, but reluctant to shoulder the risk of losses from another big deal collapse, may also consider passive funds, which buy and sell stocks involved in deals but tend to be more diversified.Such a strategy has already outperformed the average active event driven hedge fund manager this year. The IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF, for example, has returned 3.4 percent this year and was flat in October.($1 = 0.6298 British Pounds)   (Editing by Simon Jessop and Mark Potter)",2014-11-13,ABBV,"Thu Nov 13, 2014 | 7:58am EST",Scuttled deals worth $580 bln put hedge funds on back foot,http://www.reuters.com//article/hedgefunds-ma-idUSL3N0T06V120141113?type=companyNews
166,"  LONDON European regulators recommended approval for two drugs made by AbbVie to treat hepatitis C, both of which belong to a new generation of medicines that have proved effective in treating a condition that is the most common cause of liver transplants in Europe.Dasabuvir, known commercially as Exviera, and a combination therapy called Viekirax, gave physicians additional treatment options with high cure rates, the European Medicines Agency said on Friday.The all-oral regimens for patients infected with the virus avoided the need for interferons, which are delivered by injection, the agency said.Sanofi's eliglustat, a medicine marketed as Cerdelga to treat the rare genetic disorder type 1 Gaucher disease that was approved in the United States in August, was also given the green light in Europe.  The European Medicines Agency said patients could take the drug orally, making it a convenient alternative to other treatments delivered by intravenous injection.Boehringer Ingelheim's lung-disorder drug nintedanib was also recommended for approval on Friday. The regulator gave the nod to Novartis' anti-inflammation drug secukinumab, or Cosentyx, to treat the most common form of the painful, unsightly skin condition plaque-psoriasis.Celgene's apremilast, known as Otezla, was recommended to treat both psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis associated with the skin disease psoriasis that cause joint pain, stiffness and swelling, and for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis itself. The drug was approved in the United States in March. Recommendations for marketing approval by the European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use are usually endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months.

167,"   By Bill Berkrot | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Shire PLC's (SHP.L) chief executive said he sees no urgency to spend the windfall the Dublin-based drugmaker received when AbbVie (ABBV.N) walked away from a $55 billion takeover bid earlier this year.AbbVie scuttled the so-called inversion deal in October after changes in U.S. tax rules aimed at preventing U.S. companies from redomiciling abroad to take advantage of lower corporate taxes.""It's very nice that we got almost $1.7 billion in breakup fee. I think that was well deserved,"" Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said in an interview following a presentation for analysts and investors in New York showcasing drugs Shire is developing.""Our investors want us to spend the money on driving growth and innovation and fulfilling patient needs, but I have no particular burning need to spend it immediately,"" Ornskov said. ""I and the board have already moved on. We're focused on Shire as an independent company. We got a good break fee that we can put to future use.""Ornskov was widely expected to leave the company had the AbbVie deal gone through. With that distraction behind, the CEO is focused on bringing to market drugs for rare diseases, particularly those aimed at treating the suffering of children. ""I feel like a really lucky guy,"" said the Danish pharma industry veteran, who became Shire CEO in April 2013. ""I work in field that's incredibly fulfilling. A lot of products that we are developing are targeted at the pediatric part of the population, and I would like to continue that mission with my team.""Ornskov called the company's goal of reaching $10 billion in annual sales by 2020 ""challenging but achievable."" That would be about double the company's annual revenue in 2013. The goal was based on $7 billion from existing products and $3 billion from the pipeline, but investors can expect revenue from future deals as well.""The goal was developed without thinking that we would be needing to do additional deals, but I can assure you that we will be doing additional deals before 2020,"" Ornskov said. ""That's in our DNA. It's how we grow our business, so that will be on top of this goal.""

175,"   By Caroline Humer  The largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager said on Monday it has lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount.Express Scripts' move reignited investor concerns that pharmaceutical companies will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.Gilead shares dropped 13 percent, or about $14.54, in Monday trading to $93.88, though it was still far above the $65 level reached in April, when insurers launched a major outcry over its multibillion-dollar hepatitis C business. Shares in major biotechnology companies such as Amgen, Biogen and Celgene fell more than 2 percent.Express Scripts opposed the $84,000 price tag of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi treatment since its approval a year ago. It said the $1,000-a-day pill, shown to cure hepatitis C in most patients, was unaffordable.Private insurers generally receive discounts of as much as 20 percent, but Gilead has resisted, bringing in $3 billion in quarterly revenue for Sovaldi this year. The company maintains that Sovaldi, and a next-generation version called Harvoni that was approved in October, will save the U.S. healthcare system the costs of caring for advanced liver disease in many patients.Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller said on Monday in an e-mailed statement that the company is continuing to negotiate with Express Scripts.AbbVie's Viekira Pak drug was approved on Friday by U.S. regulators and the company set a list price of $83,319. But it has agreed to a significantly lower price than Gilead for Express Scripts' National Preferred Formulary, a list of approved and covered drugs for 25 million Americans, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview.""This is unprecedented,"" Miller said, explaining that the pricing on specialty drugs of this type tend to be much closer even when a competitor enters the market. He did not provide a specific dollar figure, but said AbbVie had narrowed the price gap to resemble what Western European countries pay for  Sovaldi, which runs from $51,373 in France to $66,000 in Germany. WIDENING TREATMENT An estimated 3.2 million people in the United States have hepatitis C. Most insurance plans have paid for Gilead's drugs only for patients with advanced liver disease to limit their exposure to its cost. Express Scripts said the AbbVie agreement will allow it to extend treatment to all hepatitis C patients. Dr. Camilla Graham, co-director of the viral hepatitis center at Beth Israel Deaconess medical center in Boston, said she is hopeful other insurers will follow suit. ""My first thought when I saw this was 'Finally, we have a solution to this public health crisis,'"" Graham said. A significant portion of patients with hepatitis C receive medical care through government-paid programs, including Medicare for the elderly and disabled, Medicaid for the poor and the U.S. Department of Defense.State Medicaid agencies have also limited access to Gilead's Sovaldi, saying it is too expensive even after they receive a legally mandated 23 percent discount.Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said he is ""hopeful but cautious"" about the state agencies' ability to extract further rebates on top of the discount from Gilead and AbbVie.America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry's largest lobbying group, also hopes to see Gilead's prices drop now that there is competition in the market, said spokesman Brendan Buck.  EXCEPTIONS MADE FOR SOVALDI The AbbVie regimen consists of a cocktail of anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The regimen requires some patients also to take ribavirin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat.Express Scripts said starting Jan. 1, 2015, it would pay for the AbbVie drug only for patients who have genotype 1. Express Scripts will no longer cover Gilead's Harvoni, a one-pill treatment for patients with genotype 1 that costs $94,500 for a 12-week course.

178,"  (Adds Molina CEO quote)By Caroline HumerDec 22 The largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager said on Monday it has lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's  newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's  treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount.Express Scripts' move reignited investor concerns that pharmaceutical companies will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.Gilead shares dropped 13 percent, or about $14.54, in Monday trading to $93.88, though it was still far above the $65 level reached in April, when insurers launched a major outcry over its multibillion-dollar hepatitis C business. Shares in major biotechnology companies such as Amgen, Biogen  and Celgene fell more than 2 percent.Express Scripts opposed the $84,000 price tag of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi treatment since its approval a year ago. It said the $1,000-a-day pill, shown to cure hepatitis C in most patients, was unaffordable.Private insurers generally receive discounts of as much as 20 percent, but Gilead has resisted, bringing in $3 billion in quarterly revenue for Sovaldi this year. The company maintains that Sovaldi, and a next-generation version called Harvoni that was approved in October, will save the U.S. healthcare system the costs of caring for advanced liver disease in many patients.Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller said on Monday in an e-mailed statement that the company is continuing to negotiate with Express Scripts.AbbVie's Viekira Pak drug was approved on Friday by U.S. regulators and the company set a list price of $83,319.But it has agreed to a significantly lower price than Gilead for Express Scripts' National Preferred Formulary, a list of approved and covered drugs for 25 million Americans, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview. ""This is unprecedented,"" Miller said, explaining that the pricing on specialty drugs of this type tend to be much closer even when a competitor enters the market. He did not provide a specific dollar figure, but said AbbVie had narrowed the price gap to resemble what Western European countries pay for  Sovaldi, which runs from $51,373 in France to $66,000 in Germany.WIDENING TREATMENT An estimated 3.2 million people in the United States have hepatitis C. Most insurance plans have paid for Gilead's drugs only for patients with advanced liver disease to limit their exposure to its cost. Express Scripts said the AbbVie agreement will allow it to extend treatment to all hepatitis C patients.Dr. Camilla Graham, co-director of the viral hepatitis center at Beth Israel Deaconess medical center in Boston, said she is hopeful other insurers will follow suit. ""My first thought when I saw this was 'Finally, we have a solution to this public health crisis,'"" Graham said.A significant portion of patients with hepatitis C receive medical care through government-paid programs, including Medicare for the elderly and disabled, Medicaid for the poor and the U.S. Department of Defense.State Medicaid agencies have also limited access to Gilead's Sovaldi, saying it is too expensive even after they receive a legally mandated 23 percent discount.Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said he is ""hopeful but cautious"" about the state agencies' ability to extract further rebates on top of the discount from Gilead and AbbVie. America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry's largest lobbying group, also hopes to see Gilead's prices drop now that there is competition in the market, said spokesman Brendan Buck.EXCEPTIONS MADE FOR SOVALDI The AbbVie regimen consists of a cocktail of anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The regimen requires some patients also to take ribavirin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat.Express Scripts said starting Jan. 1, 2015, it would pay for the AbbVie drug only for patients who have genotype 1. Express Scripts will no longer cover Gilead's Harvoni, a one-pill treatment for patients with genotype 1 that costs $94,500 for a 12-week course. It will cover Sovaldi in cases where patients have other types of the disease.The AbbVie regimen is also not recommended for patients whose livers are not functioning and in people who have not benefited from using older treatments. An Express Scripts spokesman said the company will make exceptions for those patients to allow them to take Gilead's medications.Mario Molina, chief executive officer of Molina Healthcare Inc., a small Medicaid insurer in California that has criticized Gilead's high prices, said on Monday that he sees more competition on drug prices ahead.""I think that this is the beginning,"" Molina said, describing the move as ""a harbinger of things to come.""

182,"   By Natalie Grover  Data from Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc's hepatitis C drug trials showed the company could develop a shorter-duration treatment rivaling offerings from Gilead Sciences Inc and Abbvie Inc.The company said on Monday it would test a combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C drugs after they showed promise against the virus in separate studies.The biotechnology company's shares rose as much as 17 percent to $16.77, their highest in more than seven years.Data from the first study, testing a combination of Achillion's NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, and Gilead's blockbuster Sovaldi, showed signs that the virus disappeared within four weeks, following a six-week course of therapy.  Gilead's Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with the company's own NS5A inhibitor, achieves this response only after eight weeks of therapy.The main goal of Achillion's ongoing mid-stage study is to achieve a sustained virological response 12 weeks after therapy that would constitute a cure.The market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightening pace in recent years, with several companies working on producing newer drugs to treat the disease that affects about 150 million around the world.

185,"   By Bill Berkrot and Caroline Humer  CVS Health Corp, one of the largest U.S. managers of drug benefits, said it would give preferred status to the hepatitis C treatments from Gilead Sciences and cover a new competing treatment from AbbVie Inc only as an exception.The latest salvo in the battle to grab market share for new all-oral treatments for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus follows a move last month by CVS rival Express Scripts Holding that favored AbbVie's regimen after negotiating a price discount below what Gilead had been charging its commercial customers.Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, said it would cover AbbVie's Viekira Pak and exclude Gilead's Sovaldi and combination drug Harvoni. The decision had sent Gilead shares sharply lower at the time.On Monday, Gilead shares were up 2.5 percent following the CVS announcement, while AbbVie shares were down 2.2 percent.Gilead has come under intense criticism for the high price of its first-to-market all-oral treatment; Sovaldi costs about $1,000 per pill. Harvoni combines Sovaldi with another drug into a one-pill, once-a-day treatment with cure rates well above 90 percent. A 12-week course of treatment with Harvoni costs about $93,500, although some patients may need just eights weeks of therapy costing about $63,000.It was not yet known whether Gilead agreed to a substantially discounted price to secure CVS coverage. Gilead did not immediately return a call seeking comment.Express Scripts said it is still negotiating with Gilead on behalf of its plans. ""Our actions have changed how pharmaceutical innovation will be rewarded in the future,""  spokesman Brian Henry said.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said the CVS move ""removes near-term uncertainty for many investors who feared CVS would also strike a deal with AbbVie and put more pressure on Gilead.""AbbVie declined to say whether it was still in talks with CVS.CVS said the Gilead drugs would be exclusive on its standard commercial formulary, as well as those for exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Part D and Medicaid.

186,"  (Recasts with attribution from CVS; adds Express Scripts, analyst comment, background)By Bill Berkrot and Caroline HumerJan 5 CVS Health Corp, one of the largest U.S. managers of drug benefits, said it would give preferred status to the hepatitis C treatments from Gilead Sciences and cover a new competing treatment from AbbVie Inc only as an exception.The latest salvo in the battle to grab market share for new all-oral treatments for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus follows a move last month by CVS rival Express Scripts Holding  that favored AbbVie's regimen after negotiating a price discount below what Gilead had been charging its commercial customers.Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, said it would cover AbbVie's Viekira Pak and exclude Gilead's Sovaldi and combination drug Harvoni. The decision had sent Gilead shares sharply lower at the time.On Monday, Gilead shares were up 2.5 percent following the CVS announcement, while AbbVie shares were down 2.2 percent. Gilead has come under intense criticism for the high price of its first-to-market all-oral treatment; Sovaldi costs about $1,000 per pill. Harvoni combines Sovaldi with another drug into a one-pill, once-a-day treatment with cure rates well above 90 percent.A 12-week course of treatment with Harvoni costs about $93,500, although some patients may need just eights weeks of therapy costing about $63,000.It was not yet known whether Gilead agreed to a substantially discounted price to secure CVS coverage. Gilead did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Express Scripts said it is still negotiating with Gilead on behalf of its plans. ""Our actions have changed how pharmaceutical innovation will be rewarded in the future,""  spokesman Brian Henry said.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said the CVS move ""removes near-term uncertainty for many investors who feared CVS would also strike a deal with AbbVie and put more pressure on Gilead."" AbbVie declined to say whether it was still in talks with CVS.CVS said the Gilead drugs would be exclusive on its standard commercial formulary, as well as those for exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare Part D and Medicaid.""Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C,"" CVS spokeswoman Christine Cramer said in a statement.The recently approved AbbVie regimen has similarly high cure rates, but involves more drugs and pills per day.

195,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Hedge fund Mason Capital lost 12 percent in 2014, making for one of the industry's biggest declines, after the New York-based firm was hit by a failed merger of pharmaceuticals companies Shire and AbbVie, a person familiar with the firm said in Monday.The $9 billion hedge fund, which manages money for state pension funds and other wealthy investors, sold depressed Shire shares after the two companies called off their planned deal in October, the source said. The shares later rebounded. Mason ended October down 7 percent. In November, when many hedge funds recovered, it was nearly flat, gaining just 0.03 percent as a number of energy stocks in its portfolio were hit by falling oil prices. The average hedge fund gained 3.57 percent last year, data from research firm Hedge Fund Research show.One of Mason's clients is the state of Rhode Island's pension fund. According to the state's data, Mason Capital was its worst-performing global equity hedge fund in the last five years, even though it boasted a 22.8 percent return in 2013. Shire has since agreed to buy U.S. group NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc for $5.2 billion, the Dublin-based drugmaker' s biggest acquisition yet, as it seeks to strengthen its position in the lucrative field of medicines for rare diseases.

199,"   By Neil Unmack | LONDON  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Shire is gambling its AbbVie break fee on risky M&A. The Dublin-based pharma group has agreed to buy U.S. peer NPS to expand in lucrative rare drugs. The 51 percent premium is covered almost entirely by compensation from the collapse of Shire's sale to larger American rival AbbVie last year. That doesn't much mitigate the risk of doing a deal ahead of a key regulatory ruling.It's no surprise to see Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov back on the acquisition trail. NPS had been tipped as a target back before AbbVie launched a successful bid for Shire itself, only to be wrong-footed by a U.S. clampdown on tax-driven mergers.The strategic logic of buying NPS is hard to fault. The deal cements Shire's position as a specialist in rare-disease drugs, which target illnesses affecting less than 200,000 patients and so benefit from generous patents or tax incentives. Shire gets access to Gattex, for short-bowel syndrome, and Natpara, for hypothyroidism.The financial wisdom isn't so clear. Given the niche focus, cost synergies are scant. Shire says it could cut 25-35 percent of 2017 costs, or $100 million based on Deutsche Bank estimates. Taxed and capitalised, those would cover only half the premium. There are possible revenue synergies too if Shire can crank up sales of Gattex and develop Natpara.The snag is Shire is playing its chips just days before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration decides whether to approve Natpara. An advisory panel last year voted eight to five to recommend the drug, but worried about its side effects. The risk is that Natpara isn't approved after all, or safety concerns could limit its potential. Moving today may have helped Shire avoid a bidding war, or paying even more when uncertainty eases. And by reinforcing its position in the highly valued rare-disease sector, Shire may defend its premium rating, currently 18 times next year's forecast earnings. Yet with U.S. healthcare providers increasingly focused on costs, and some rare-disease treatments costing over $400,000 per year, the bet assumes that this area of medicine will escape the broader trends in the pharmaceutical industry.CONTEXT NEWS  - Dublin-based drugmaker Shire said it would acquire the shares of U.S. peer NPS Pharmaceuticals for $46 a share, or $5.2 billion.- The price is a 51 percent premium to NPS's undisturbed share price on Dec. 16, Shire said. - NPS Pharmaceuticals sells Gattex, a drug for treatment of short-bowel syndrome.

200,"  Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc closed down 6 percent on Tuesday, after a pharmacy benefit manager said it would cover both Gilead and rival AbbVie Inc's hepatitis C offering, renewing concerns of pricing pressure.Investors interpreted this as further discounting of hep C drugs, signaled by an increasing willingness by drugmakers to offer rebates, Sanford Bernstein's Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note.Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, dropped Gilead's hep C drugs in December in favor of AbbVie's newly approved alternative at a cheaper price.Meanwhile, CVS Health Corp, the second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, and health insurer Anthem Inc inked deals with Gilead to cover Harvoni.On Monday, St. Paul, Minnesota-based pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC, which serves over 25 million people, said it would cover both Gilead's Harvoni and AbbVie's Viekira Pak.  ""There has been a substantial reduction in the net price of both of these drugs just in the past few weeks, so sometimes it pays not to go first,"" said Peter Wickersham, Prime's senior vice president of Integrated Care and Specialty.While exact rebate rates will unlikely be disclosed we would hesitate to read too much into the claims from Prime, and we do not believe they alter expectations about hep C pricing, Porges said. ""It is possible that neither Gilead nor AbbVie felt the need to offer a deep rebate to Prime for exclusivity.""Prime is not known for exclusionary formularies in contrast with CVS and Express Scripts, and consequently, both drugmakers may have been less pressured with Prime than they were with CVS and Express Scripts, he said.  AbbVie's shares closed down 3.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

201,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Gilead Sciences Inc and AbbVie Inc are in a price war over their hepatitis C treatments that is driving costs lower and has changed the way drugmakers price new medicines, a top executive for pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts said on Thursday. Gilead's hepatitis C drug Harvoni, which can cure a majority of patients who take it, has a retail price of $94,500 and is now facing its first competition with AbbVie's Viekira Pak, which was priced about $10,000 lower, or at $83,319. Express Scripts was able to secure a discount that has brought the AbbVie price down to Western European levels for Gilead's hepatitis C treatment, Chief Medical Officer Steven Miller told Reuters. Such prices overseas range from about $51,000 to $66,000. The gap in price between Harvoni and Viekira has stayed about the same as both have fallen, Miller said.The dynamic will save Express Scripts customers $1 billion in 2015, with a total of $4 billion in savings across the United States when all payers and employers are included, Miller said. He expects over 170,000 people will be treated for the liver-destroying virus in the United States in 2015, up from 100,000 last year. ""This is the first time in the history of the pharmaceutical industry that someone has been able to create a price war,"" Miller said in an interview. Gilead set off a national debate about the affordability of drugs last year after it priced its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi at $84,000 per treatment, or about $1,000 per pill. That drug has been followed by a combination pill that is more expensive called Harvoni.  An estimated 3.2 million people in America have the virus, and many health insurers and payers said the cost of treating all of them would be unaffordable. Express Scripts Holding Co, the nation's largest pharmacy benefits manager, has been the most vocal critic of Gilead for its pricing. When U.S. health regulators approved AbbVie's Viekira Pak in late December, Express Scripts announced within days that it was dropping coverage of Gilead's treatments from its largest list of reimbursable drugs, except under certain medical exceptions. Express Scripts and its clients are reaping new savings as prices head lower from both Gilead and AbbVie, but that will not change Harvoni's place on its reimbursement list in the near future.""They cannot buy their way back onto the national preferred formulary at this time,"" Miller said of Gilead. Express Scripts' agreement with AbbVie spans multiple years but Miller declined to say how many. Beyond hepatitis C, other drugmakers are showing much more willingness to discuss pricing early on in the development of new treatments, Miller said. That includes more detailed talks on how many patients would most benefit from a new therapy.The industry is closely watching two new areas to see how the pricing dynamics will play out - PCSK9s for high cholesterol and PD-1s for cancer.

215,"   By Natalie Grover  Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc's experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc's Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment.Achillion's shares rose as much as 19 percent to $12.85 on Monday on investor's hopes that an all-Achillion combination could be as effective as Gilead's and AbbVie Inc's current therapies.The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally.The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination – a nucleotide analog inhibitor or ""nuke"" and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead's case – to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options.Gilead's regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the ""nuke"", needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. AbbVie's three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks.Achillion's ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy. The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday's data shows Achillion's NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said.The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair's Katherine Xu said. Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet.The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank's Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount.Harvoni's list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.

The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc  working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally.The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination - a nucleotide analog inhibitor or ""nuke"" and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead's case - to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options.Gilead's regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the ""nuke"", needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. AbbVie's three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks.Achillion's ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy.The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday's data shows Achillion's NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said.The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair's Katherine Xu said.Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet.The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank's Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount.Harvoni's list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.

217,"   By Supriya Kurane and Ben Hirschler  AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) is to buy Pharmacyclics Inc PCYC.O for about $21 billion, giving it access to what is expected to be one of the world's top-selling cancer drugs and expanding its reach in the profitable oncology field.The deal -- the latest example of a big drugmaker swooping on a biotech firm to refill its medicine pipeline -- confounds expectations that Pharmacyclics would sell out to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).AbbVie will pay $261.25 per share in cash and stock, a 13 percent premium to Pharmacyclics stock's closing price on Wednesday. Back in 2008 and 2009, the shares dipped below $1.The acquisition lessens Chicago-based AbbVie's dependence on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira that accounts for most of its revenue but is expected to start to see sales decline from 2017 or 2018.AbbVie failed last October to buy Dublin-based Shire Plc (SHP.L) for $55 billion after the United States took steps to deter such tax-lowering deals.Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas said the deal was positive for AbbVie as Pharmacyclics' blood cancer treatment Imbruvica would diversify the business beyond Humira. ""Imbruvica is not only complementary to AbbVie's oncology pipeline, it has demonstrated strong clinical efficacy across a broad range of hematologic malignancies,"" AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said in a statement.Pharmacyclics expects U.S. sales of Imbruvica to hit $1 billion this year and by 2020 worldwide sales are forecast to reach $5.8 billion, according to consensus analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis.AbbVie, which was spun out of Abbott Laboratories in 2013, said the deal would be ""highly accretive"" to its revenue and earnings by 2017. Sunnyvale, California-based Pharmacyclics co-markets Imbruvica with Johnson & Johnson. Besides Imbruvica, it has three product candidates in development.In a statement, J&J said: “We’re looking forward to continuing our collaboration with the team at AbbVie to further develop and commercialize this important therapy for patients and their health care teams.”Media reports had said J&J was close to buying Pharmacyclics. Novartis AG NOVN.VX was also interested in the company, a report said. The acquisition is the latest in a spate of big pharma deals this year as many companies are strengthening their portfolios as old drugs go generic.Last month, Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) agreed to buy Hospira Inc HSP.N for about $15 billion, and Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) agreed to buy Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd SLXP.O for about $10 billion.The deal, expected to close in the middle of the year, comprises about 58 percent cash and 42 percent AbbVie common stock. Pharmacyclics shareholders can opt for cash, AbbVie stock or a combination, AbbVie said.Morgan Stanley advised AbbVie, while Centerview and J.P. Morgan worked for Pharmacyclics.

218,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AbbVie Inc chief Richard Gonzalez fought two other drugmakers to ""the bitter end"" to buy Pharmacyclics Inc PCYC.O for its hot-selling Imbruvica cancer drug, but may have a harder time convincing investors it is worth $21 billion.Gonzalez, who took over as chief executive in early 2013, has come under closer scrutiny after AbbVie (ABBV.N) abandoned a $55 billion deal to purchase Shire Plc (SHP.L) last year due to new U.S. tax rules that wiped out much of the deal's rationale. Since then, some shareholders have questioned how the company will protect its best-selling drug Humira, for arthritis, against new rivals when it loses patent protection in late 2016. Others have criticized steep discounts AbbVie has offered on its new hepatitis C drug, to win coverage from U.S. health insurers.AbbVie announced the Pharmacyclics deal late on Wednesday, saying it would hurt company earnings this year and next, then boost profits from 2017 and beyond. Company shares fell almost 6 percent. ""AbbVie is taking a hit today because of the dilution and because they look a little desperate to do a deal,"" said Chris Pultz, portfolio manager for Kellner Merger Fund, an arbitrage fund that took a stake in Pharmacyclics on Thursday. ""AbbVie lost a little credibility"" by paying top dollar for Pharmacyclics, he said.     In a conference call, Gonzalez said Imbruvica will eventually bring the company $7 billion in annual sales - ahead of some Wall Street estimates - and boost a pipeline of experimental cancer drugs that AbbVie hopes will be worth more than $8 billion in combined sales each year.That made it worth fighting for Pharmacyclics, he said. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), a partner in developing Imbruvica, was widely reported as a second bidder, while the identity of a third suitor has not been confirmed.""It was a highly competitive multi-round process,"" Gonzalez told Reuters. ""We bid against two large, sophisticated pharmaceutical companies. And when disclosures come out, you'll see the spread (between bids). I don't think we'll look embarrassed."" Gonzalez said AbbVie became interested in Pharmacyclics about 18 months ago, but didn't actively pursue a deal until being informed in recent months that AbbVie was on a short list of favored suitors. Gonzalez met with Pharmacyclics CEO Bob Duggan in January, followed by three other trips to California's Bay Area, where the company is based. Bidding began about two weeks ago, he said. Gonzalez said Imbruvica would make AbbVie less reliant on Humira, a $13-billion-a-year blockbuster. AbbVie said it has also sought U.S. and European marketing approvals for an improved formulation that could battle cheaper biosimilar forms of Humira.""It's a fundamental change in the formulation of Humira,"" Gonzalez said in an interview. ""I wouldn't describe it as a tweak."" Asked if AbbVie intends to switch over current Humira patients to the new formulation, Gonzalez said such a strategy would make sense. Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum wrote in a research note that the new version of Humira would likely have an auto-injector that would cause less pain than regular needles and might not need refrigeration. Such improvements, he said, could lead 20 percent of current Humira patients to switch to the new product.

223,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AbbVie's $21 billion deal to buy Pharmacyclics shows big pharma's hunger for new drugs at a time when research at smaller biotechnology companies is driving some of the most promising advances in medicine.Competition for tomorrow's blockbuster drugs is now intense, inflating the cost of deals and pushing pharmaceuticals to center stage in overall mergers and acquisitions (M&A).So far this year, pharma deals have accounted for 10.5 percent of total M&A worldwide, up from a more traditional share of 3 to 4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.AbbVie's planned purchase of Pharmacyclics is the largest global pharmaceutical deal of 2015 to date and takes M&A activity in the sector to a six-year high.M&A transactions targeting biotech and pharma companies in 2015 have now reached $59.3 billion, a 94 percent increase over the same period a year ago and the highest volume for this stage in any year since 2009. For a graphic on pharma deals see link.reuters.com/tyc34w Across the industry, big drugmakers are eyeing medicines developed by nimble biotech firms as they seek to replenish portfolios that are being eroded as older products face loss of patent protection.Pharmacyclics gives AbbVie access to a blood cancer treatment called Imbruvica that is expected to be one of the world's top-selling cancer drugs, reducing its reliance on the ageing rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira.  ""This acquisition serves as a reminder that large pharma is willing to pay up for novel, quality products,"" said Maxim Jacobs, an analyst at Edison Investment Research.  The deal also signals AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez's readiness to chase other assets after a failed deal to buy Shire for $55 billion last year.In many ways, 2014 was the year of deals that didn't happen. Not only did AbbVie's plans for Shire unravel but Pfizer proved unable to land AstraZeneca after a $118 billion takeover fight. Yet both U.S. predators have now bounced back with alternative deals, with Pfizer agreeing to buy Hospira, a specialist in injectable drugs, for around $15 billion last month.Valeant Pharmaceuticals also agreed last month to acquire gastrointestinal drugmaker Salix Pharmaceuticals for more than $10 billion in another notable biotech transaction.

227,"   By Michelle Sierra and Karen Schwartz | NEW YORK, March 12  NEW YORK, March 12 The loan market received another boost this week as drugmaker Abbvie and semiconductor company NXP boosted U.S. M&A volume to $152.7 billion so far this year, including completed and deals in the pipeline.On the investment grade side, AbbVie is leading the charge backing its $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics with an $18 billion 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan from Morgan Stanley and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. The bridge loan, which is the largest financing so far this year, is in the market and is expected to be syndicated among the company's relationship banks.""It seems that most of the activity has been on investment grade as opposed to non-investment grade,"" a banker said. ""The capacity for investment grade is bigger particularly with the regulatory overhaul that's been going on.""Frontier Communications has lined up the second-biggest financing with an $11.6 billion bridge loan to fund its $10.5 billion acquisition of wireline assets from Verizon. The two deals have helped push investment grade M&A deal volume to $47 billion in 2015.The Abbvie bridge loan will fund the cash component of the acquisition alongside cash on AbbVie's balance sheet. The deal is expected to be replaced with bonds only.""Healthcare continues to be a hot sector. The Abbvie deal speaks to capacity for acquisition financing. It's a robust market for these type of deals,"" a second banker said. AbbVie, rated A by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 by Moody's, will pay $261.25 per share in cash and stock, a 13 percent premium to Pharmacyclics stock's closing price on March 4. Under the acquisition, Pharmacyclics shareholders have the option to be paid 100 percent cash, 100 percent stock or a mix of cash and stock.Leveraged lift NXP is separately backing its up to $40 billion merger with U.S.-based Freescale with $7 billion of loans, which have pushed leveraged M&A loan volume to $70 billion this year.The loans include a $3.25 billion five-year Term Loan B1 initially paying 325bp over Libor, stepping down to 300bp for net leverage of 2.0 times; a $3.25 billion seven-year Term Loan B2 initially paying 350bp over Libor, stepping down to 325bp for leverage of 2.0 times.There is also an up to $500 million five-year super senior revolver paying 200bp over Libor, stepping down to 175bp for leverage of 2.0 times and to 150bp for leverage of 1.5 times. The revolver also pays a 25bp commitment fee on undrawn amounts. Lead arranger and bookrunner Credit Suisse has initially committed 100 percent of the term loans and $112.5 million of the revolver.The term loans will be used to pay the cash consideration of the offer, refinance Freescale's existing credit facility, and backstop a consent process on Freescale's existing bonds.The revolver will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.The acquisition price puts Freescale's value at $11.8 billion, with a total enterprise value of $16.7 billion including debt. The companies said that they would finance the merger with $1 billion of cash on hand, $1 billion of new debt and around 115m of NXP ordinary shares.NXP is rated BB+ by Standard & Poor's and Ba2 by Moody's.

233,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, May 11 (IFR) - Apple, Shell and AbbVie blitzed the US bond market last week with a combined US$34bn of jumbo bond deals in just two days, bringing the week's tally to US$52bn, the fourth-largest of all time.AbbVie issued US$16.7bn to finance its acquisition of Pharmacyclics - it was the sixth-biggest bond deal ever - after attracting US$60bn of demand.The next day Apple issued US$8bn on US$21bn of demand and Shell US$10bn on US$23bn of orders.But bankers are warning borrowers planning to raise some US$80bn or more in May not to be dazzled by the US market's seeming resilience.New-issue concessions have bulged in the past week after wild swings in 10 and 30-year Treasuries and huge supply took their toll. Now there are fears that the bond market has reached a tipping point, and corporates may face rising funding costs from here on.""The real risk to the market over the course of a busy May for new issues is extreme volatility in Treasuries,"" said Jonny Fine, head of investment-grade debt syndicate in the Americas at Goldman Sachs.""We have gone from new-issue concessions of zero to 5bp in March to a weaker environment where NICs are 10bp-15bp. In the same period credit spreads have widened a little and Treasuries have increased a lot, so all-in costs of debt issuance have deteriorated.""The new-issue market has been able to recover from temporary gluts at various times this year. And, in the absence of Treasury volatility, it only took a few slow weeks to bring concessions snapping back in.Now, although investors still have cash to put to work, not knowing where rates are heading requires higher concessions, especially at the long end of the curve. It was no coincidence, then, that Apple paid 10bp in NICs and Shell 11bp-16bp on the day the 30-year Treasury yield pierced the 3% mark for the first time since December.FUNDAMENTAL With European government bonds backing up dramatically, commodity prices stabilising and US economic growth expected to improve, some think the Treasury market is undergoing a fundamental shift away from curve flattening, towards a period of steepening at the long end.""Many former entrenched trends are now over and the new long-term trends have begun,"" said William O'Donnell, head of US Treasury strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland.""We are going through the earliest phase of a 'term-risk tantrum'. What we have witnessed since the end of March is markets coming to grips with ongoing improvement in the US economy and maybe a nascent recovery out of Europe at a time when we are staring at record low European and US yields. It's making people have a complete re-think."" Fed Chair Janet Yellen also made comments during the week that bolstered that view.""She sent a signal to the market that stocks have gone too high and bond yields are too low at a time when the Fed could raise rates in September,"" said O'Donnell.Although yields tightened on Thursday, the wild swings saw issuers such as Anglo American pay new-issue premiums of as much as 19bp and most other borrowers that day paid double-digit concessions across maturities.ILLIQUID  Matters will be made worse by the illiquidity in the secondary market.""Larger new-issue premiums impact future bond pricing to a greater extent than we have seen in the past, due to the illiquidity in the secondary market,"" said Michael Shapiro, manager on Societe Generale's US bond syndicate.""The existing secondary curve can widen because of a larger new-issue premium and the result is wider pricing points when an issuer or one of its peers seeks to return to the market.""Borrowers are also likely to find that they can no longer determine what they will pay in the bond market based on what others are achieving.""There have been times when the concessions that various credits in different sectors paid have been uniform, but this is not one of those environments,"" said Fine.""It's more critical than at any other time for syndicate managers to really understand the difference between individual credits and sectors and how they are likely to be accepted by the bond market versus others.""Strong order books, however, have shown that demand is still there. And bankers and issuers hope that any reduction of demand for bonds from retail investors (put off by the damage done by wider Treasury yields to total returns) will be offset by insurance companies and pension funds coming in for higher-yielding paper.(This story originally appeared in International Financing Review, a Thomson Reuters publication)   (Reporting by Danielle Robinson; Editing by Matthew Davies)",2015-05-11,ABBV,"Mon May 11, 2015 | 10:26am EDT",Borrowers warned: Don't be fooled by high grade market resilience,http://www.reuters.com//article/investmentgrade-bonds-volatility-idUSL1N0Y20VA20150511?type=companyNews

244,"  (Adds analyst comment, ongoing studies in other blood cancers)By Ransdell PiersonAug 12 AbbVie Inc on Wednesday said its experimental treatment for a form of leukemia associated with a gene mutation met its main goal in a mid-stage trial and that the company would seek U.S. approval of the medicine, which analysts have said has blockbuster sales potential.AbbVie, developing the drug venetoclax with Switzerland's Roche Holding AG, said it would unveil data from the Phase II trial at an upcoming medical meeting and will seek U.S. marketing approval for the product this year.The drug was tested in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had a so-called 17p gene deletion that has been associated with aggressive cancer and survival of less than 2 to 3 years after diagnosis. The trial included patients with relapsed or advanced CLL, or those who had previously been untreated. Venetoclax achieved its target overall response rate in the study, meaning it reduced the number of cancer cells by at least a predefined margin, the drugmakers said.Brokerage Cowen and Co has predicted the medicine, if approved, could capture annual sales of $2 billion by 2020. It works by blocking BCL-2, a protein that prevents self-destruction of defective or cancerous cells in the body.""Venetoclax may help restore the natural process that allows these leukemic cells to self-destruct,"" Sandra Horning, Roche's chief medical officer, said in a release. Safety of the drug was similar to that seen in earlier trials, with no unexpected new issues, AbbVie saidThe FDA earlier this year granted ""breakthrough therapy"" status to the drug for previously treated CLL patients with the gene deletion, a designation that can help speed regulatory review. ""Given the mechanism of the drug, it represents a strong candidate to be used across a range of blood cancers,"" Deutsche Bank said in a research note on Wednesday. It is also being studied in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a slow-progressing blood cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Almost 15,000 new U.S. cases are diagnosed each year.About 3 to 10 percent of CLL patients have the 17p deletion when diagnosed, but it is found in 30 to 50 percent of patients who have relapsed or advanced disease, AbbVie said.Abbvie shares fell 1 percent in morning trading, amid a 1.5 percent decline for the broad stock market.

252,"  (Adds Perrigo lawsuit against Mylan, closing stock prices)By Caroline HumerSept 17 Generic and over-the-counter drugmaker Perrigo Co on Thursday urged its shareholders to reject Mylan NV's unsolicited $27 billion tender offer, saying it substantially undervalued the company.Mylan first proposed to buy Perrigo in April and, after being repeatedly rebuffed, launched a tender offer on Monday.It has said it would take control if more than 50 percent of Perrigo shares are tendered in the offer. That strategy is possible under takeover law in Ireland, where Perrigo has been incorporated since buying Irish drugmaker Elan in 2013.Perrigo also filed a lawsuit against Mylan in Manhattan federal court, seeking an injunction to block the closing of any tender offer unless Mylan corrects its alleged misleading statements to Perrigo shareholders about a potential merger. The lawsuit said Mylan overstated potential synergies, and falsely claimed power to delist Perrigo shares in an effort to strong-arm Perrigo shareholders into accepting the tender offer.Mylan, in a statement, said the lawsuit had no merit and was ""an attempt by Perrigo to further frustrate the tender process and to prevent their shareholders from tendering to Mylan in support of this compelling, value creating transaction."" Netherlands-based Mylan has offered $75 in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share, a combination now worth $188.55 based on Mylan's Thursday closing price of $49.37. Perrigo shares closed down $1.31 at $181.08.Joseph Papa, Perrigo's chief executive, said in an interview that he does not believe his company's shareholders will agree to swap their shares for Mylan shares, and that the deal premium of 13 percent was lower than in other pharmaceutical takeovers.""I canceled vacations this summer and I plan to spend more times with shareholders over the next 60 or so days to make sure they understand this is a bad deal,"" Papa said. Perrigo shareholders have until Nov. 13 to take part in the tender offer.Shareholders often wait until near the closing date before deciding to participate, so it is unclear if Mylan will succeed.Buying Perrigo would give Mylan over-the-counter consumer and nutritional products and a line of generic topical medicines.A takeover would be the latest in a string of recent multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical deals, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Ltd's $11 billion acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd and AbbVie Inc's  $21 billion offer for Pharmacyclics Inc.

But in Tuesday's filing, Mylan said Perrigo management including CEO Joseph Papa, sought to mislead its own shareholders into rejecting an offer ""that is, in fact, in their best interest.""Mylan said Papa for six weeks made public statements against the proposed deal without disclosing that he had in March made a ""conflicting purchase"" of more than $220,000 in Mylan stock.He then ""inundated"" shareholders with false statements about the proposed deal through an investor presentation and in media interviews, Mylan said. Mylan filed its counterclaims after earlier in the day saying that at the request of the Irish Takeover Panel, it would qualify a Sept. 8 statement that could itself be misleading and violate Irish takeover rules.Mylan had in that statement said that Perrigo's stock had been ""protected from the recent sell-off in the markets, solely as a result of our offer.""A spokesman for Perrigo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Mylan had no immediate comment. Netherlands-based Mylan has offered $75 in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share, a combination now worth $182.30 based on Mylan's Tuesday closing price of $46.65.

The trials tested the drug in patients who were not responding adequately to two commonly prescribed arthritis treatments, TNF inhibitors and methotrexate.""ABT-494 also offers a faster path to Phase 3 development with less uncertainty,"" company Chief Scientific Officer Michael Severino said in a statement.Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the immune system attacks the body's tissues, causing joint pain, swelling and stiffness.

258,"   By Bill Berkrot  U.S. health regulators on Thursday issued a warning of potential risk of serious liver injury for certain patients using AbbVie's hepatitis C treatments, Viekira Pak and Technivie, sending the drugmaker's shares down more than 10 percent.The Food and Drug Administration said AbbVie had identified cases of hepatic decompensation and liver failure in patients with liver cirrhosis who were taking the medicines.""Some of these events resulted in liver transplantation or death,"" the agency said in a posting on its website. It did not say how many deaths were reported.Shares of Gilead Sciences, which makes the top-selling rival hepatitis C treatments Sovaldi and Harvoni, rose 5.7 percent to $107.60. Shares of much smaller Enanta Pharmaceuticals, which helped develop the AbbVie drugs, plunged 40.6 percent to close at $23.90.Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund, called the liver toxicity warning a ""huge positive for Gilead.""The FDA said it is requiring AbbVie to include warnings about the risk of serious liver injury in the labels of its combination hepatitis C treatments.Since the approvals of Viekira Pak in December 2014 and Technivie in July 2015, at least 26 worldwide cases submitted to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System were considered possibly or probably related to Viekira Pak or Technivie, the agency said. ""Because post-marketing events are reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between treatment and these events has not been established,"" AbbVie spokeswoman Jackie Finley said in an emailed statement.She said the Viekira Pak and Technivie package inserts have been changed to say they should not be used in patients with a type of cirrhosis, which is advanced liver damage that can be caused by hepatitis. The new information also includes a recommendation for physicians to assess evidence of liver decompensation prior to treatment and during treatment in cirrhotic patients. In most of the cases, liver injury occurred within 1 to 4 weeks of starting treatment, the FDA said, adding that some  cases occurred in patients who should not have been using the medicines.""Patients taking these medicines should contact their health care professional immediately if they develop fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin, or light-colored stools, as these may be signs of liver injury,"" the FDA said.Gilead, which was first to market with the new treatments that virtually guarantee a cure for the serious liver disease without any of the side effects of older treatments, came under intense fire for the high price of its drugs, which were listed for about $90,000 for a course of treatment.With competition from Viekira Pak, pharmacy benefit managers were able to negotiate steep discounts by playing one drugmaker against the other.

259,"  (Adds Express Scripts comment)By Bill BerkrotOct 22 U.S. health regulators on Thursday issued a warning of potential risk of serious liver injury for certain patients using AbbVie's hepatitis C treatments, Viekira Pak and Technivie, sending the drugmaker's shares down more than 10 percent.The Food and Drug Administration said AbbVie had identified cases of hepatic decompensation and liver failure in patients with liver cirrhosis who were taking the medicines.""Some of these events resulted in liver transplantation or death,"" the agency said in a posting on its website. It did not say how many deaths were reported.Shares of Gilead Sciences, which makes the top-selling rival hepatitis C treatments Sovaldi and Harvoni, rose 5.7 percent to $107.60. Shares of much smaller Enanta Pharmaceuticals, which helped develop the AbbVie drugs, plunged 40.6 percent to close at $23.90.Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund, called the liver toxicity warning a ""huge positive for Gilead."" The FDA said it is requiring AbbVie to include warnings about the risk of serious liver injury in the labels of its combination hepatitis C treatments.Since the approvals of Viekira Pak in December 2014 and Technivie in July 2015, at least 26 worldwide cases submitted to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System were considered possibly or probably related to Viekira Pak or Technivie, the agency said.""Because post-marketing events are reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between treatment and these events has not been established,"" AbbVie spokeswoman Jackie Finley said in an emailed statement. She said the Viekira Pak and Technivie package inserts have been changed to say they should not be used in patients with a type of cirrhosis, which is advanced liver damage that can be caused by hepatitis.The new information also includes a recommendation for physicians to assess evidence of liver decompensation prior to treatment and during treatment in cirrhotic patients.In most of the cases, liver injury occurred within 1 to 4 weeks of starting treatment, the FDA said, adding that some  cases occurred in patients who should not have been using the medicines. ""Patients taking these medicines should contact their health care professional immediately if they develop fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin, or light-colored stools, as these may be signs of liver injury,"" the FDA said.Gilead, which was first to market with the new treatments that virtually guarantee a cure for the serious liver disease without any of the side effects of older treatments, came under intense fire for the high price of its drugs, which were listed for about $90,000 for a course of treatment.With competition from Viekira Pak, pharmacy benefit managers were able to negotiate steep discounts by playing one drugmaker against the other. Express Scripts Holding, the largest U.S. PBM backed Viekira, while CVS Health chose to favor Gilead's drugs.Express Scripts said it will evaluate the warning ""to determine if any additional action is required, especially for those with late-stage cirrhosis requesting coverage of Viekira Pak.""The PBM said it closely reviews all new clinical evidence and is able to rapidly respond to changes in drug labeling to ensure patients are well cared for.Express Scripts shares fell 4 percent, while CVS shares rose 1 percent.

267,"  * Enlarged group to be world leader in rare diseases* Deal offers $18 and 0.1482 Shire ADS per Baxalta share* Baxalta haemophilia business a potential product risk   (Adds closing share prices, termination fee)By Ben Hirschler and Paul SandleLONDON, Jan 11 Drugmaker Shire Plc  clinched its six-month pursuit of Baxalta International Inc  on Monday with an agreed $32 billion cash and stock offer, catapulting it to a leading position in treating rare diseases.The London-listed group, which first approached the U.S. company with an all-stock offer in July, won over the maker of treatments for rare blood conditions, cancers and immune system disorders after adding a cash sweetener.Shire's U.S.-traded shares fell 9 percent, however, as investors worry about a potential competitive threat from Roche to Baxalta's critically important haemophilia franchise, and on nerves over the price offered and a cost savings forecast that Jefferies analysts called ""somewhat disappointing.""The deal marks a strong start to mergers and acquisitions in healthcare in 2016 after the sector had its biggest deal-making streak in history last year, with global transactions totalling $673 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.It also highlights the appeal of medicines for rare diseases targeting small groups of patients for which drugmakers can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.""Together we will have the number one platform in rare diseases with a strong foundation for future growth,"" Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov told reporters, after unveiling his company's most ambitious acquisition yet.Shareholders will receive $18 in cash and 0.1482 Shire American depositary share per Baxalta share, implying a total value of $45.57 per share based on Jan. 8 prices. That is 37.5 percent above Baxalta's price on Aug. 3, before Shire went public with its interest. Illinois-based Baxalta, which was spun off last year from Baxter International Inc, rejected Shire's previous $30 billion all-stock offer in August, arguing it significantly undervalued the company.But Ornskov relentlessly pursued Baxalta, seeking to pressure it into agreeing to a deal by meeting with Baxalta's major shareholders over a period of months.That enabled it to sidestep a hostile deal in which it would have faced takeover defences including a ""poison pill"" that stopped unwanted suitors from buying more than 10 percent of the company and a hard-to-replace board.Shares of Baxalta closed down 2.3 percent at $39.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, giving back earlier gains.TAX BENEFITS  Shire had initially offered only stock due to concerns a cash element might jeopardise the tax-free status of Baxalta's spin-off from Baxter. However, Ornskov said he was confident that adding $18 in cash would maintain this tax-free status.""We came out without any doubt that this was not jeopardising the tax-free nature of the spin,"" Ornskov said.Together, the two companies said they expected to deliver double-digit sales growth with more than $20 billion in annual revenue by 2020.With annual operating cost synergies of more than $500     million, additional revenue synergies and tax benefits from Shire's Irish domicile, Shire said it expected the transaction to boost non-GAAP diluted earnings from 2017.Baxalta brings Shire a strong position in haemophilia treatments, although that could face a serious challenge by late 2017 or 2018 from Roche's experimental antibody ACE910 that received breakthrough designation - given to potentially important advances over current treatments - from U.S. health regulators. The Roche drug has a long half-life that could allow for less frequent dosing. ""A lot of people don't like the deal"" largely due to its  dependence on Baxalta's haemophilia franchise, said John Boris, analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.""They believe Shire is buying an asset that is going to be under pressure, so it may not reach the $20 billion revenue by 2020 target,"" Boris said.UBS analysts cautioned that Baxalta could actually dilute Shire earnings from 2019 to 2023 before being accretive again from 2024.Thanks to its base in Dublin, the combined company is expected to have an effective tax rate of 16 to 17 percent by 2017, down from around 23 percent for Baxalta, making the deal the latest transaction to result in lower tax rates.Ornskov has stepped up his acquisition efforts in the rare diseases space after a planned takeover by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc fell through last year. He bought NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in February and Dyax for $5.9 billion in November.Shire signed an $18 billion facility to help finance its latest purchase.Shire was advised by Evercore, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. Baxalta was advised by Goldman Sachs and Citi.According to Freeman/Thomson Reuters estimates, Shire's advisers could be in line for fees of $50 million-$60 million and Baxalta's may earn $70 million-$80 million.Baxalta said the termination fee on the Shire merger was equal to $369 million.(Additional reporting by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot in New York and Anjuli Davies in London; Editing by Keith Weir and Matthew Lewis)",2016-01-11,ABBV,"Mon Jan 11, 2016 | 5:29pm EST",UPDATE 4-Drugmaker Shire to buy Baxalta for $32 bln after 6-month pursuit,http://www.reuters.com//article/baxalta-ma-shire-idUSL8N14V2FI20160111?type=companyNews

274,"   By Bill Berkrot  Jan 14 U.S. patent officials on Thursday denied petitions by Amgen to review two formulation patents on AbbVie's Humira, a potential setback in Amgen efforts to market a biosimilar version of the world's top-selling prescription medicine.In June, Amgen, the world's biggest biotechnology company, asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the review, arguing that the patents should not have been granted in the first place for Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis drug with annual sales approaching $14 billion. In declining to review the patents, the agency said ""we determine, based on the Petition and the accompanying evidence, that Amgen has not shown a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on any of its challenges.""Amgen in November became the first company to file with U.S. health regulators seeking approval to sell a less expensive biosimilar version of the blockbuster medicine. Several companies are also developing biosimilar version of Humira. Amgen has said it expects the first of its several biosimilars in development to reach the market between 2017 and 2019. The company did not have an immediate comment on the ruling. AbbVie this week said it expects Humira sales to reach $18 billion by 2020. Based on its various patents, AbbVie said it does not expect competition from biosimilars until 2022.Unlike chemical medicines, biotech drugs are made from living cells so exact copies are not possible, thus the term biosimilar rather than generic as with copies of pills.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)  The Commerce Department issues advance (first estimate) U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product data. Economic growth likely braked sharply as businesses doubled down on efforts to reduce an inventory glut and unseasonably warm weather slowed consumer spending. There is a risk that the economy actually contracted, but given that some of the factors weighing on growth are temporary, activity is expected to rebound in the first quarter. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the report is likely to show that GDP increased at a 0.8 percent annual rate, after growing at a 2.0 percent rate in the third quarter. (0830/1330) Separately, the employment cost index is expected to show a solid increase in wage growth in the fourth quarter, at 0.6 percent after a similar gain in the third quarter. (0830/1330)  Chevron Corp, the second-largest U.S. oil producer, is expected to post a sharp drop in quarterly profit as tumbling commodity prices and extensive delays in new natural gas projects erode margin.  Payments network operator Mastercard Inc is expected to report a fall in fourth-quarter profit, hurt by a strong dollar, as markets outside the United States account for nearly 60 percent of its purchase volumes. Mastercard said in September it expected operating expenses for 2015 to grow in high single digits due to ramping investments in China and continued digital-related spending. Investors will look for the company's update on gas prices, foreign exchange headwinds and rebates.  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams participates in a panel before the Commonwealth Club, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Walter E. Hoadley Annual Economic Forecast event in San Francisco. (1530/2030)  AbbVie Inc is expected to report fourth-quarter profit and revenue above Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company in October forecast double-digit EPS growth through 2020. AbbVie had some good news earlier this month when U.S. patent officials denied Amgen's efforts to market a biosimilar version of its drug Humira, considered the world's top-selling prescription medicine. Investors will be looking for additional color on other patent challenges and biosimilar developers, and also how the FDA-mandated potential liver injury warning on AbbVie's hepatitis C drugs have impacted sales.      Honeywell International Inc, the maker of aircraft parts and climate control systems, is expected to report a higher fourth-quarter profit, helped by cost controls. The company, which counts Boeing Co and Bombardier Inc among its customers, has cut jobs and sold or merged businesses to reduce costs. However, a strong dollar and weak demand from oil and gas customers could affect revenue.      Colgate Palmolive Co, the world's biggest toothpaste maker, is grappling with a strong dollar that has reduced the value of sales from overseas. Colgate, which gets about 66 percent of sales from outside North America, has raised prices in markets like Latin America and Africa to cushion the impact of the dollar. However, that has led to a drop in unit volume in these regions. Colgate cut its full-year profit forecast in October to reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates, which generally have a double-digit impact on sales. Investors will look for any updates to the forecast and whether the company has other plans to offset currency impacts.      American Airlines Group Inc, the world's largest airline, reports fourth-quarter results and will issue guidance for early 2016. The airline is expected to discuss its decision to write off half a billion dollars of revenue trapped in Venezuela due to currency controls there, as well as increased competition in Latin America from its U.S. rivals.  U.S. refiner Phillips 66 is expected to report a higher profit in the fourth quarter, helped by lower crude prices. Refiners have been adding units, revamping old ones, and re-tooling processes to run more domestic crude amid robust gasoline demand.      Xerox Corp, best known for its printers and copiers, is set to report results below market estimates for the ninth straight quarter as corporate customers cut printing costs and consumers shift to mobile devices. Xerox, which has lost more than a third of its market valuation in the last one year, said in October that it would review its businesses and capital allocation options, but was not currently considering a sale of the company. Activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed a stake in the company and said he would look to get board representation and pursue strategic alternatives. Analysts will be looking for further details on the restructuring and any outlook.  The coal and natural gas producer Consol Energy is expected to report a fourth-quarter loss, compared with a year-ago profit, hurt by weak commodity prices. The company, which has shifted focus to natural gas production from coal mining, cut its 2016 capital budget for its oil and gas business earlier this month, citing falling commodity prices.  Canada's economy is expected to have grown by 0.3 percent in November, underscoring expectations that the fourth quarter was likely weak at best. The Bank of Canada recently forecast that the economy likely stalled in the quarter, not long after the country emerged from the mild recession in the first half of 2015. Producer prices likely fell 0.3 percent in December after dropping 0.2 percent the prior month. (0830/1330)  Brazil's primary public sector budget deficit likely widen sharply in December, the country's central bank is expected to report. According to a Reuters survey, Brazil is expected to post a hefty deficit of 65.15 billion reais, most likely its biggest overall gap ever, which again signals the difficult challenge Rousseff faces to rebalance the public accounts.

276,"   By Ransdell Pierson  AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) on Friday predicted slower growth this year in overseas sales of its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug and cut sales estimate for its new Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C, sending shares 4 percent lower.AbbVie reported slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, but revenue was shy of expectations for a second time in three quarters.Sales of Humira, the world's biggest-selling drug, jumped 10.5 percent to $3.72 billion in the quarter, accounting for almost two thirds of total company revenue.     Viekira Pak posted sales of $554 million, up from $469 million in the prior quarter. Sales of AbbVie's new Imbruvica leukemia treatment jumped to $343 million from $304 million in the third quarter.But sales of all three medicines came in slightly below Wall Street forecasts, renewing questions about the sustainability of AbbVie's most important products, said Vamil Divan, an analyst with Credit Suisse. ""Because this company is so leveraged to Humira, people worry that if something were to happen, the company's sales growth, earnings and cash flow could become challenged,"" Divan said. He added that new competitive threats to Viekira Pak and Imbruvica could also arise, and hurt company earnings. In a conference call with analysts, AbbVie officials said sales growth of Humira outside the United States will likely slow to the mid-single-digit range this year. They cited competition from a cheaper biosimilar form of rival arthritis drug Enbrel, which was approved late last year in Europe. AbbVie previously said Viekira Pak had potential to soon generate annual sales of $3 billion, but on Friday it forecast sales of $2 billion this year. It cited competition from Merck & Co's (MRK.N) Zepatier hepatitis C drug, approved on Thursday, and recent warnings of  liver risk from Viekira Pak that now appear on the drug's label.

281,"   By Deena Beasley  U.S. regulators on Thursday approved a new once-daily pill for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus made by Merck & Co Inc, which said it will sell the drug at a lower list price than its competitors.The list price for Zepatier will be $54,600 for a 12-week regimen, which Merck said it expects ""to be in the range of net prices"" for comparable treatments.Gilead Sciences Inc, which secured an early lead in the lucrative market for oral hepatitis C drugs with the $1,000-per-pill Sovaldi, currently sells an enhanced version of that drug as a single-tablet regimen called Harvoni at a list price of $94,500. AbbVie Inc followed in late 2014 with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie secured exclusive contracts with payers such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices. Gilead has continued to dominate the market with hepatitis C drug sales of more than $14 billion in the first nine months of 2015.The Food and Drug Administration approved Zepatier, with or without the older antiviral drug ribavirin, for patients infected with the most common form of hepatitis C, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. The new drug's FDA label says liver-related blood tests should be performed prior to starting therapy and at certain times during treatment.Clinical trials found that 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with Merck's Zepatier reduced the virus to undetectable levels, which is considered a cure, in more than 94 percent of patients, the FDA said in a statement.

283,"   By Ransdell Pierson   (This version of the story corrects that Zarzio is a version of Amgen's Neupogen, not Neulasta, and that Zarzio was priced at a discount to Neupogen, not Neulasta, in final two paragraphs)By Ransdell PiersonU.S. Food and Drug Administration staff members on Friday said  Celltrion Inc's biosimilar form of Johnson & Johnson's Remicade arthritis drug appeared ""highly similar"" to the widely used branded product.The news sent shares of J&J, whose annual Remicade sales of $6.5 billion are mostly in the United States, down almost 4 percent. It also hit AbbVie Inc and Amgen Inc, whose arthritis treatments work the same way.AbbVie, whose Humira is the world's top-selling drug, fell nearly 6 percent, and Amgen, maker of Enbrel, was down 3 percent. Pfizer Inc, which has teamed up with South Korea's Celltrion in marketing the biosimilar, rose nearly 1 percent.FDA scientists released their favorable report ahead of a  meeting Tuesday of an independent medical advisory panel to the agency. The panel will decide whether to recommend approval of Remsima to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel conditions like Crohn's disease. Celltrion and Pfizer want to sell Remsima in the United States as a cut-price copy of Remicade, or infliximab. Some analysts expect it to sell for a 25 percent discount.      ""The data submitted by Celltrion show that (Remsima) is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Remicade"" in treating rheumatoid arthritis and a related condition called ankylosing spondylitis, the FDA briefing paper said. It cited only ""minor differences in clinically inactive components.""Celltrion presented the FDA with clinical data on the use of Remsima against rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, but the FDA's staff said it is likely also safe and effective for other conditions Remicade treats, including Crohn's and ulcerative colitis.Raymond James analyst Chris Raymond said that broad interpretation of Remsima's likely effectiveness could signal its approval as a treatment for all diseases for which Remicade can now be marketed. ""As such, we remain cautious on Amgen shares,"" Raymond said.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said Remsima and one other Remicade biosimilar may be introduced in the United States in 2018. The branded J&J drug could lose half its sales by 2020, he added.    ""The biggest potential damage could be to J&J, which has U.S. rights to Remicade,"" said Conover. He predicted Pfizer would capture about $500 million in annual Remsima sales.  The FDA report did not hurt shares of Merck & Co, which sells Remicade overseas. But the stock slumped Wednesday after the company said biosimilar competition in Europe helped drive its fourth-quarter sales of Remicade down almost 30 percent to $396 million. Celltrion already sells Remsima in dozens of other countries.    Remicade, Humira and Enbrel work by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called Tumor Necrosis factor (TNF). Raymond said more than 60 other anti-TNF biosimilars are in development and could commoditize the drug class much sooner than thought.   Remsima would become the second approved biosimilar in the United States, following Novartis AG's September introduction of Zarzio. That drug is a version of Amgen's Neupogen, which boosts infection-fighting white blood cells in patients who have undergone chemotherapy.Novartis priced Zarzio at a 15 percent discount to Neupogen.

287,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Johnson & Johnson's Stelara psoriasis drug has shown effectiveness against Crohn's disease in a second late-stage trial, the company said on Friday, bolstering prospects of its approval for the additional use. The Phase 3 study showed Stelara induced remissions in moderate to severe Crohn's disease patients who had previously failed to benefit from TNF inhibitors, a leading class of medicines for the inflammatory bowel disease. Those treatments include J&J's own Remicade and AbbVie Inc's Humira.J&J presented the favorable data on Friday at the 11th Congress of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization in Amsterdam. In October, the company said Stelara was significantly more effective than placebo in another study of patients with moderate to severe Crohn's symptoms. Stelara is now awaiting U.S. approval as a treatment for the condition, based on results of that earlier trial.  The drug, which works by blocking two inflammation-causing proteins called IL-12 and IL-23, is one of J&J's biggest, with sales last year of almost $2.5 billion. It is approved in the United States for adults with moderate to severe psoriasis, an inflammatory skin condition caused by an overactive immune system.Crohn's is a chronic inflammatory condition in the gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss and fever.

After six weeks, 34 percent of patients receiving either Stelara dose achieved a target reduction in Crohn's symptoms, compared with 22 percent of those taking a placebo.Similar incidence of side effects and infections were seen in the Stelara and placebo patient groups, J&J said.

290,"   By Se Young Lee | SEOUL  SEOUL Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd, which aims to become a force in the fledgling biosimilar drugs industry, has filed a lawsuit against the originator of the world's best-selling drug, to stop it blocking the launch of its own version.The unit of South Korea's Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], along with partner and minority shareholder Biogen, filed suit in Britain on March 24 against AbbVie Inc, maker of rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, which generated sales of $14 billion last year.It is the company's first suit against a drug originator.Interest in biosimilars - lower-cost copies of complex biotech drugs - has soared in recent years as copies of some of the world's best-selling prescription medicines have hit the market.Unlike generic versions of simple chemical medicines, biotech drugs are made from living cells, so it is impossible to manufacture exact copies.The IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics says biosimilars could save healthcare systems in the United States and Europe's top five markets as much as 98 billion euros ($111 billion) by 2020.The South Korean conglomerate is hoping for big things from the unit - including a revenue target of 1 trillion won ($872 million) by 2020 - amid sagging profits at its electronics business, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the world's biggest maker of smartphones and televisions.Success in the endeavor is seen as key for de facto Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee, 47, to prove himself as steward of the family-run smartphones-to-insurance empire. His father, group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, has been hospitalized since a 2014 heart attack. PUSHBACK The composition patent for Humira loses its exclusivity in the United States in December 2016, and in Europe in October 2018, but Illinois-based AbbVie, which earned 61 percent of its 2015 net revenue from Humira, has been filing new patents in a bid to push back sales of biosimilars.In addition to Samsung Bioepis and Biogen, more than a dozen firms have challenged AbbVie’s strategy through patent authorities or the courts. ""We believe that AbbVie has been attempting to obstruct market entry of competing products by applying for a large number of overlapping patents around Humira, which could affect patient access to affordable medication,"" Samsung Bioepis told Reuters. ""We believe competition should take place in the market, and not through such misuse of the patent system,"" it added.AbbVie told Reuters it was aware of the lawsuit filed by Samsung Bioepis and Biogen.    “As we have said, we intend to defend our intellectual property,” it said. Samsung Bioepis, which brought its first drug to market late last year, has a pipeline of 13 biosimilars, versions of existing drugs with similar efficacy at much lower prices, and is initially focusing on six of them to get out in front of the market.The Samsung Group has a track record of moving fast. Late to enter the smartphone market, Samsung Electronics quickly rose to become the industry leader. The group is also one of the world's most active patent filers and has over the years tried to move beyond its image as a ""fast follower"". ""The first drug to hit the market takes the most market share, so this is the right strategy to go with,"" said Kang Yang-ku, analyst at HMC Investment & Securities.There are potentially rich pickings for early movers; more than 10 blockbuster biological drugs with combined yearly sales of $60 billion are on track to see their U.S. and European patents expire over the next four years, according to Allied Market Research.Biosimilars are a source of consternation for investors in firms such as AbbVie, however, as the cheaper copies threaten to undercut profits for the original drug makers.In December Bioepis began selling a biosimilar of Amgen's arthritis drug Enbrel in South Korea, and the drug has since launched in some European markets including Germany and Britain early this year. The European Medicines Agency on Friday also recommended the Bioepis copy of another blockbuster drug Remicade for approval in Europe.Samsung Bioepis is 91 percent-owned by Samsung Biologics, which manufactures biological drugs and is in turn mostly owned by Samsung C&T Corp and Samsung Electronics.

292,"   By Caroline Humer and Ankur Banerjee  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) walked away from their $160 billion merger on Wednesday, a major win for President Barack Obama, who has been pushing to curb deals in which companies move overseas to cut taxes.Pfizer said the decision was driven by new U.S. Treasury rules aimed at such deals, called inversions. The merger would have allowed New York-based Pfizer to cut its tax bill by an estimated $1 billion annually by domiciling in Ireland, where tax rates are lower.While the new Treasury rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of the provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger - Allergan's history as a major acquirer of other companies.Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on CNBC television that the new Treasury rule would not stop the company from doing other stock-based acquisitions as soon as this fall. The new Treasury rule takes into account the past three years of a company's deals.""It really looked like they did a very fine job at constructing a temporary rule to stop this deal and obviously it was successful,"" Saunders said. Saunders said that he would stay to run the standalone company with a focus on both deals and research and development. Allergan will also move ahead with plans for its $40.5 billion sale of its generic drug business to Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA). It expects the transaction to close by June.With the deal behind it, Pfizer said it would decide this year about whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines into a separate business. It had put off making that decision until 2019 after announcing its deal with Allergan last November.Pfizer will pay Allergan $150 million to reimburse expenses from its deal. Shares of Allergan, which fell 15 percent on Tuesday, were up 3.3 percent at $244.38 at mid-afternoon. Pfizer rose 4.7 percent to $32.84. Pfizer has new products coming and plenty of money that it could put to work with acquisitions, though not on the scale of Allergan, said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, which holds Pfizer shares. It is not clear that Pfizer should definitely split into two, he said.""It is true that these larger companies are a little unwieldy to manage,"" Funtleyder said, ""but there are plenty of strategies to keep them together and increase shareholder value.""     The decision to call off the deal came in part because Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage its deal with Allergan might have provoked new rules by the Treasury, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday.Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from deals that allow it.U.S. inversion rules have unraveled other mergers. U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) abandoned its $55 billion takeover of Ireland-domiciled peer Shire Plc (SHP.L) in 2014 after the Obama administration cracked down on inversions. AbbVie had to pay Shire a $1.6 billion break-up fee.

293,"   By Caroline Humer and Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. drug maker Pfizer Inc agreed on Tuesday to terminate its $160 billion agreement to acquire Botox maker Allergan Plc, in a major victory to U.S. President Barack Obama's drive to stop tax-dodging corporate mergers.The decision to end the biggest tax ""inversion"" ever attempted, which would have seen Pfizer slash its tax bill by redomiciling to Ireland where Allergan is registered, came a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.While these new rules did not name Pfizer and Allergan, one of their provisions targeted a specific feature of their merger; Allergan's previous history as a major acquirer of other companies. The subsequent demise of the deal allows Obama to claim a big win during his last year in office.Earlier on Tuesday, Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from tax-avoiding corporate ""inversions"", which lower companies tax bills by redomiciling overseas.""While the Treasury Department's actions will make it more difficult... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good,"" Obama said.Pfizer and Allergan will announce the termination of their deal on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified ahead of any official statement. Pfizer and Allergan declined to comment.Pfizer was concerned that any tweaks to salvage the inversion might have provoked new rules by the U.S. Treasury, and so was leaning earlier on Tuesday to end the deal, a source had earlier told Reuters.Pfizer will have to pay Allergan up to $400 million for its expenses as a result of terminating the deal, according to their merger agreement.Pfizer shares had ended trading in New York on Tuesday up 2 percent on hopes the company would walk away or renegotiate the deal in its favor. Allergan shares closed down 14.8 percent to their lowest level since October 2014. Several U.S. presidential candidates, including Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have seized on the issue in their campaigns.""We have so many companies leaving, it is disgraceful,""  Trump told reporters as he greeted voters in Waukesha, Wisconsin on Tuesday. Clinton and Sanders both expressed support for Treasury's plan.   Besides Pfizer-Allergan, other pending inversion deals that have not yet closed include the proposed $16.5 billion merger of Johnson Controls Inc with Ireland-based Tyco International Plc, Waste Connections Inc's  $2.67 billion deal with Canada's Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd, and IHS Inc's $13 billion acquisition of London-based Markit Ltd. In all these cases, the shares of the target companies fell only slightly. Johnson Controls and Tyco said they would respond after conducting a review of the new rules. Waste Connections and Progressive Waste Solutions said they expected the rules would impact less than 3 percent of the combined adjusted free cash flow in their first year after the deal. IHS and Markit said they believed the rules would not affect their adjusted effective tax rate guidance of a low to mid-twenties percentage range.THREE-YEAR RULE Under previous rules which still apply, Allergan shareholders needed to own at least 40 percent of the combined company for the two companies to enjoy the full tax benefits of an inversion, and more than 20 percent to have any inversion benefit at all. But a new 'three-year-look-back rule' issued by the Treasury on Monday made this much harder for Allergan, and appeared to take aim directly at it because of how the company was put together. The new rule does not allow stock accumulated through a foreign company's U.S. deals in the last three years to count towards the book value needed to meet the inversion threshold.This weighed on Allergan heavily because of its significant deals in this timeframe. These include the $66 billion merger of Allergan and Actavis Plc, the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories and the $5 billion takeover of Warner Chilcott. ""The serial acquisition portion of the regulations will cause Pfizer to be treated as an 'expatriated entity' (under the terms of its existing deal with Allergan),"" Robert Willens, a  corporate tax and accounting analyst, wrote in a note.SHEDDING GENERICS  In a second change to the rules, the Treasury also said it would seek to limit a practice known as earnings stripping that is often undertaken following, but not limited to, an inversion. The new Treasury rules would restrict related-party debt for U.S. subsidiaries in dealings that do not finance new investment in the United States. Without Allergan's new, fast-growing medicines, Pfizer may need to look for other companies with attractive products, such as U.S. drugmakers Biogen Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and AbbVie Inc, said Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director of brokerage H.C. Wainwright.Pfizer had planned to make a decision by 2016 whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines, but delayed the decision until 2019 after announcing its merger with Allergan. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover had said the decision could be moved to late 2017 or 2018 if the deal with Allergan collapsed.  Pfizer, which announced the deal in November, had said its tax rate would drop to about 17 or 18 percent after the deal, from around 25 percent. That would have represented more than $1 billion in annual cost savings.   The deal's collapse is also a blow to the investment banks involved. Guggenheim Partners LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Centerview Partners Holdings LLC and Moelis & Co stood to share $94 million in fees advising Pfizer had the deal closed, while Allergan would have paid its advisors, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley, $142 million in total, according to the latest estimates by Freeman & Co LLC.Bankers may now get paid only 10 percent of these amounts, according to Freeman.This is not the first time a tightening of the U.S. inversion rules have caused a merger to unravel.

303,"   By Ransdell Pierson  AbbVie Inc placed another big bet on new cancer drugs on Thursday with a $5.8 billion acquisition that could lessen its dependence on arthritis treatment Humira, the world's top selling drug.Shares of AbbVie rose 1.3 percent in afternoon trading. The suburban Chicago drugmaker said it would buy privately held Stemcentrx and its experimental treatment for small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 10 percent to 15 percent of all lung cancers and is notoriously difficult to treat. It brings AbbVie into the broad and lucrative arena of solid tumors, such as lung cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer. AbbVie's current drugs, including leukemia treatment Imbruvica, focus on blood cancers, a smaller group of patients.Companies with innovative cancer drugs, especially ones that spur the immune system to attack tumors, are attractive takeover targets. These life-extending new treatments can command extremely high prices that health insurers seem willing to pay for, unlike some other therapeutic categories where they are putting pressure on price.""The mantra to reimbursement is innovation, and AbbVie is heading down the right path"" by its widening focus on oncology, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. AbbVie last year bought Pharmacyclics Inc and its half-ownership of Imbruvica for $21 billion. It sells the drug with Johnson & Johnson. U.S. rival Bristol-Myers Squibb has been particularly successful with its oncology focus. It predicted on Thursday its earnings will jump as much as 29 percent this year, fueled by its new Opdivo treatment for melanoma and lung cancer. A similar new drug from Merck & Co also has a list price of $150,000.Also on Thursday, French drugmaker Sanofi announced its $9.3 billion offer to buy Medivation, which makes prostate cancer treatment Xtandi. Stemcentrx's drug, called Rova-T, is a toxic chemical that has been loaded onto an antibody. It targets a protein called DLL3 found in more than 80 percent of patients with the cancer. A biomarker is used to help select patients whose cancers express the protein.    Late-stage trials involving patients who have already failed to benefit from chemotherapy and radiation are under way and AbbVie expects the drug to be approved by 2018.""Oncology is an important growth driver and an area we plan to build a leading portfolio,"" Michael Severino, AbbVie's chief scientific officer, said in an interview.But he said AbbVie will remain heavily involved in arthritis, psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases that are treated by Humira, which generates $14 billion in annual sales. AbbVie's quarterly earnings results on Thursday demonstrated its reliance on Humira, for which sales jumped 15 percent to $3.58 billion, accounting for 60 percent of company revenue.    As sales of Humira rise by double-digit percentages each year, investors are growing ever more fretful because its main U.S. patent lapses in December. AbbVie says other patents will stave off introduction of cheaper biosimilar forms of Humira until at least 2022.     AbbVie said it would pay about $2 billion in cash for Stemcentrx and fund the remainder with stock. Stemcentrx shareholders may also receive up to $4 billion in cash if certain performance milestones are achieved.AbbVie, which expects the deal to close in the second quarter, lowered its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $4.62-$4.82 per share, from its earlier view of $4.90-$5.10.It said the deal would be dilutive this year and for several years to come.

323,"   By Ben Hirschler  Ablynx's hopes for a potential multibillion-dollar drug were boosted on Thursday by strong clinical trial results in rheumatoid arthritis, vindicating a $175 million bet placed on the product by U.S. pharma group AbbVie in 2013.Belgian drugmaker Ablynx, which produces so-called nanobody medicines derived from camel and llama antibodies, said that a 12-week Phase IIb trial showed that its experimental drug vobarilizumab produced clinical remission from disease in up to 41 percent of patients.Those results compared well with Roche's established product Actemra, which has to be given more frequently and has more side-effects. Shares in Ablynx jumped 15.1 percent to 13.27 euros by 0448 ET.""We're getting really stand-out data, which is great, and it is the first step for us in providing a data package to AbbVie, who will decide later in the year whether to take up their option and license the product,"" Ablynx CEO Edwin Moses told Reuters. Both the Roche and Ablynx drugs target a protein called interleukin 6, which is involved in the inflammation underlying rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Actemra had sales last year of $1.5 billion and Moses said that vobarilizumab also has blockbuster potential, assuming other clinical trials are positive.""If you look at the size of the opportunity, not just in RA but also in lupus and other possible inflammatory indications, you have to begin to think in the billions (of dollars) in terms of the sales opportunity,"" Moses said. AbbVie currently sells the RA treatment Humira, which is the world's top-selling prescription drug, but it is looking for new medicines to expand its portfolio to counter the impact of cut-price competition from biosimilar copies of Humira in the coming years.Ablynx's product could help to underpin the U.S. company's market-leading position in RA, though analysts at Jefferies said it is not yet clear if AbbVie viewed vobarilizumab as a must-have product. AbbVie signed a partnership deal worth up to $840 million for the Ablynx medicine three years ago, including a $175 million upfront payment. The remaining $665 million is payable in future milestones if AbbVie opts to license the drug and it proves successful.Ablynx will also be eligible to receive royalties on sales, assuming the drug makes it to market.Moses said that he expects AbbVie to decide whether to license vobarilizumab -- triggering a $75 million payment -- after it sees results from a second RA trial slated for August.

324,"  SEOUL Biosimilars maker Samsung Bioepis, part of South Korea's top family-run conglomerate Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], said on Monday it is seeking regulatory approval in Europe to sell its copy of AbbVie Inc's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira.Samsung Bioepis said in a statement the European Medicines Agency has accepted for review its application to sell its biosimilar of Humira, the world's best-selling drug that generated $14 billion in sales last year. The company did not say when it submitted the application for its Humira copy.Interest in biosimilars, a cheaper copy of complex biotech drugs, has soared in recent years as copies of some of the world's best-selling prescription medicines have hit the market.

331,"  Aug 5 AbbVie Inc said hedge fund Elliott Associates LP has sued the pharmaceuticals company alleging that it had made misrepresentations and omissions related to a failed attempt to buy Dublin-based Shire Plc .AbbVie's proposal to buy Shire in a $55 billion so-called tax inversion deal was called off in November 2014. Inversion deals are transactions in which the acquiring company moves its headquarters to its target's home base to take advantage of lower tax rates. Elliott Associates, a hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, had said in 2014 that it made money on its Shire position in the third quarter, but suffered a loss in the fourth quarter when the share price tumbled on news the deal would collapse. The case has been filed in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court, AbbVie said in a regulatory filing on Friday.

332,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Ankur Banerjee  Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), beating out numerous other bidders, said it agreed to buy U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc MDVN.O for $14 billion in cash, adding its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi to the company's growing oncology roster.Medivation shares jumped nearly 20 percent to close at $80.42, just shy of the offer price of $81.50 per share. Shares of Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, were down 0.4 percent at $34.84. The offer is a 55-percent premium to Sanofi SA's (SASY.PA) initial bid to buy Medivation for $52.50 per share in April, which pushed the San Francisco-based company to put itself up for sale. It represents a 118-percent increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition.   The planned purchase of Medivation, with its $2.2 billion-a-year Xtandi, is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard, older treatments. Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) $21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics. The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica.Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics.  Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation. The deal comes four months after Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) scrapped their $160 billion merger. Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio.The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in Pfizer's M&A strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal - to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs, especially lucrative cancer treatments.Pfizer, in a conference call with analysts, said it still plans to decide by year-end whether to split into separate companies selling either low-growth generics or patent-protected brand medicines.  ""The Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. But, he said, Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its branded-drug portfolio.A year ago, Pfizer paid $15 billion for Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big-selling injectable biotech drugs. That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business. Pfizer's biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance. The company is also trying to catch up with Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) in developing immuno-oncology drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi, although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab, experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively.Xtandi generated U.S. net sales of $330.3 million in the second quarter. Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T) owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States, where it generated sales of $240 million in the period. Read said Xtandi, which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments, could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists.""The product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle,"" Read predicted. Some analysts, including BMO's Alex Arfaei, said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation. But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given Xtandi's potential for earlier treatment in coming years.Reuters had reported that Pfizer, Merck, Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation.   ""Given the already very high price being discussed, the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi ...  we see a higher bid as very unlikely, but not impossible,"" RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement.     Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, it was a ""disciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders."" Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter.Shares of other cancer drug companies, including Incyte Corp (INCY.O) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O), also rose on Monday, as investors speculated about  more dealmaking in the sector. Pfizer's financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP providing legal counsel. J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore were Medivation's financial advisers, while Cooley LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal advisers.

Late-stage trial data showed Stelara induced remissions in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease patients who had previously failed to benefit from TNF inhibitors, a leading class of medicines for the inflammatory bowel disease.

343,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Natalie Grover  A slowdown in sales of AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) Humira arthritis treatment sent the drugmaker's shares 6 percent lower on Friday, highlighting the company's heavy reliance on the $15 billion-a-year medicine.Humira sales increased 11.3 percent in the third quarter,  compared with growth of 14.9 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, in the first and second quarters of 2016.  The drug, also used to treat Crohn's disease and psoriasis,  generated sales of $4.06 billion, about $130 million shy of Wall Street's expectations.Humira, the world's biggest-selling drug, accounted for about 63 percent of AbbVie's net revenue.""Humira looks more vulnerable, so there's a healthy skepticism in the stock market today,"" Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler said. ""Anything affecting Humira price-wise or demand-wise has a massive impact"" on investors. Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) on Thursday reported flat quarterly sales for its similar Enbrel arthritis drug and cautioned that discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers next year would likely negate wholesale price increases for the drug. AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, in contrast, said on a conference call on Friday that the company has concluded negotiations with insurers for coverage in 2017 and 2018 and encountered no significantly higher hurdles to net prices.Sales of medicines are affected by many factors, including changes in prices and the volume of prescriptions. AbbVie hiked its U.S. list price for Humira twice this year, by 9.9 percent on Jan. 21 and 7.9 percent on June 23, although rebates and discounts moderated the net price.Gonzales said Humira prescriptions grew over 13 percent in the quarter, accounting for much of its sales growth. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Humira's disappointing quarterly performance questions how long it can grow amid competition from other drugs, including looming cheaper biosimilar forms of Humira.    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September approved Amgen's biosimilar version of Humira. But AbbVie is trying to block its introduction, contending Humira's patents should protect it until at least 2022.On Thursday, Amgen said it would unlikely launch the biosimilar, Amjevita, next year, given the pace of litigation.  AbbVie reported quarterly net revenue rose 8.2 percent to$6.43 billion in the third quarter.

AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez, in contrast, said on a conference call on Friday that the company has concluded negotiations with insurers for coverage in 2017 and 2018 and encountered no significantly higher hurdles to net prices.Sales of medicines are affected by many factors, including changes in prices and the volume of prescriptions. AbbVie hiked its U.S. list price for Humira twice this year, by 9.9 percent on Jan. 21 and 7.9 percent on June 23, although rebates and discounts moderated the net price.Gonzales said Humira prescriptions grew over 13 percent in the quarter, accounting for much of its sales growth. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Humira's disappointing quarterly performance questions how long it can grow amid competition from other drugs, including looming cheaper biosimilar forms of Humira.    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September approved Amgen's biosimilar version of Humira. But AbbVie is trying to block its introduction, contending Humira's patents should protect it until at least 2022.On Thursday, Amgen said it would unlikely launch the biosimilar, Amjevita, next year, given the pace of litigation.  AbbVie reported quarterly net revenue rose 8.2 percent to$6.43 billion in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $6.39 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $6.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Excluding items, the suburban Chicago-based drugmaker earned $1.21 per share, edging past the Wall Street estimate by 1 cent.

351,"  Drugmaker AbbVie Inc said on Friday its experimental fixed-dose combination to treat certain hepatitis C virus patients achieved high sustained viral response (SVR) rates after eight weeks of treatment.The once-daily fixed-dose combination, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), was given to HCV patients without cirrhosis and who were new to treatment in three different studies. About 97.5 percent of these patients achieved a high SVR rate, which is the most widely used efficacy endpoint in clinical studies of hepatitis C, representing removal of HCV from the body. There were no adverse events during the eight-week regimen and patients across all major genotypes of chronic hepatitis C achieved high SVR rates.

355,"  U.S. biotech Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Tuesday its experimental biosimilar version of AbbVie Inc's top-selling autoimmune drug, Humira, met the main goal in a late-stage trial involving patients with a form of psoriasis.Humira, considered the world's biggest-selling medicine, generates $15 billion in annual sales and treats rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis, among other conditions.Biologics including Humira are manufactured in living cells, then extracted and purified. As they are more complex than traditional medicines and cannot be copied with precision, their knock-off versions are called biosimilars, rather than generics.Several companies are developing biosimilar versions of top-selling biotech medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. In September, Amgen Inc's Humira biosimilar was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - the first one to win U.S. regulatory nod for the drug. But AbbVie is trying to block its launch, contending that Humira's patents should protect it until at least 2022.In Momenta's trial, adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis received up to 48 weeks of treatment with Momenta's drug, called M923, Humira itself, or Humira alternating with M923. The percentage of patients that achieved at least a 75 percent reduction on an index of psoriasis severity was equivalent between M923 and Humira, meeting the main goal of the study.Momenta developed M923 in collaboration with Baxalta - which is now part of Shire Plc - but in September, Shire decided to end its biosimilars program, and is in the process of transitioning the drug to Momenta. Momenta's shares were up 7.9 percent at $15.00 in premarket trading on Tuesday.
