7,"  NEW YORK, March 14 Hess Corp will begin selling natural gas from its Tioga, North Dakota, plant this month, firing up the station weeks after severe weather delayed its expansion, the company said Friday.The plant's start-up may help boost oil production from the prolific Bakken shale after about 100 producing wells had to be shut earlier this year to minimize flaring due to the delays, the state Industrial Commission said this week.""Due to the unusually harsh winter weather, we're slightly behind our initial plans, but we expect to start selling residue gas this month,"" Hess spokesman John Roper said.The plant will be able to process 250 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) when it starts operating, nearly twice as much as its initial design. The station had been shut since late last year as Hess worked on the expansion. North Dakota flares nearly 36 percent of the natural gas it produces in the absence of adequate processing capacity and infrastructure to move the gas to market. The state produced more than 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day in January, according to data from regulators.The recent upgrade to the Tioga plant includes additions to ethane recovery, full fractionation and sales of natural gas liquids, according to Hess filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Hess had previously announced plans to begin selling gas from the Tioga plant in late February and start extracting and selling natural gas liquids in March.North Dakota's oil production rose by about 6,500 barrels per day to about 935,000 bpd in January, Department of Mineral Resources data showed on Thursday.

10,"   By Timothy Gardner | WASHINGTON, April 10  WASHINGTON, April 10 The United States could give Europe and Ukraine relief from energy dependence on Russia within months if it overturned the 40-year ban on most U.S. crude oil exports, the head of energy company Hess Corp.  said on Thursday.""There's something we can do today to help our allies now,   and that's give the green light to crude exports,"" Chief Executive Officer John Hess said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.He estimated that Europe and Ukraine could get relief from volatile oil prices in 90 days if the ban was overturned.Concern about Europe's dependence on Russian energy has risen after President Vladimir Putin's government annexed the Crimean peninsula. Europe gets 30 percent of its crude oil supply from Russia, and has been hesitant to impose sanctions on Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. In addition, Russia has hiked prices for natural gas it sells to Ukraine.U.S. exports of natural gas could also help diversify energy supplies in Europe, but not substantially for about four years as billions of dollars worth of infrastructure needs to be built before shipments can start.As one of the largest drillers in North Dakota's Bakken region, Hess could benefit from a lifting of the ban on crude exports, which the federal government implemented after the Arab oil embargo in the early 1970s. Hess is spending about half of its $5.8 billion energy exploration and production budget this year on drilling shale resources, mostly in the Bakken. Pressure is growing on the Obama administration to overturn the ban, but analysts say there is little chance he will do so in a midterm election year. There is no major legislation to reverse the ban, as lawmakers are hesitant to support a measure that could later be blamed for raising motor fuel prices.Hess played down the notion that reversing the ban could raise gasoline prices, saying that prices are set on global futures markets and that the United States already exports millions of barrels per day of oil products. Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser to former President Jimmy Carter, said sending U.S. crude to Europe  could be a ""good and practical"" idea to diversify its energy supply from Russia.But he cautioned against the idea, popular among many U.S. politicians, that surplus oil and gas from the U.S. energy boom could be used as tool to address wide geopolitical issues.""I'm not sure how transformative it's going to be, I think there's enormous potential, but ... there are still considerable areas of uncertainty,"" Brzezinski said.Strife in the Middle East and rapid developments in cyber warfare are two issues that could overshadow the U.S. energy revolution, he said.

Excluding one-time items, the company posted a profit of $1.38 per share.By that measure, analysts on average expected earnings of $1.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Hess produced 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in the first quarter, down from 389,000 boed a year earlier. For the second quarter, the company expects to produce 295,000 to 300,000 boed, excluding its weakened Libya operations. The New York-based company sold some acreage as well as its refining and retail gasoline businesses in the first quarter of last year, artificially boosting that period's results.Production during the quarter jumped in the company's Valhall field in Norway to 37,000 boed from 5,000 boed in the same period last year due to a redevelopment project. While North Dakota production fell in the first quarter as the company completed the expansion of its Tioga gas plant, the project is now finished, and Bakken production is currently in excess of 80,000 boed, Hess said.The company expects to produce about 80,000 to 90,000 boed of North Dakota oil in the second quarter.Executives said they are moving forward on a planned master limited partnership for their North Dakota pipeline assets, and expect the transaction to be completed by 2015. Hess would keep a majority stake in the MLP, executives said.Shares of Hess were up 0.9 percent at $88.85 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday on Wednesday.

15,"  (Recasts, adds background, comments from Hess, Enbridge, API)By Patrick RuckerWASHINGTON May 2 Few oil-by-rail shippers have heeded calls for information to prevent dangerous mishaps on the tracks, the U.S. Department of Transportation said on Friday as it named the three companies it said have cooperated.Testing data has so far been tallied from Exxon Mobil , Continental Resources Inc and Savage Companies, the agency said.Several other companies on Friday said that they would respond or had given data to DOT officials in North Dakota.""We have shared it with their people in the field, voluntarily,"" said John Roper, spokesman for Hess Corp.Regulators are eyeing North Dakota's energy patch, known as the Bakken, as the origin of several shipments such as this week's derailment in Lynchburg, Virginia, in which several tank cars jumped the tracks and burst into flames.Officials have warned since January that Bakken fuel might be more dangerous on the tracks than other conventional crude oil. Unresolved questions about its volatility have infused a broader debate about oil-by-rail safety. Crude oil can be transported in a standard tank car, but some industry officials have said Bakken fuel may be more similar to flammable gas like propane, which must be moved in sturdier equipment.The Department of Transportation this week sent to the White House's Office of Management and Budget a plan to improve tank car standards for trains carrying highly flammable materials. Details of those proposed rules have not been made public. FINES A fiery derailment last July that destroyed the center of Lac-Megantic, Quebec, killing 47 people, has been followed by several oil-by-rail mishaps in the United States.The DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration sent inspectors into the field last summer to examine the situation.""They've been out there at least five times fairly recently,"" said Larry Springer, spokesman for fuel transport company Enbridge, of PHMSA inspections in the Bakken. Officials fined three oil companies for wrongly handling Bakken fuel in February, but the $93,000 in penalties against Hess, Marathon Oil Corp and Whiting Petroleum Corp  have already been modified and may yet be reduced further.PHMSA has collected more than 80 fuel samples, and officials have said the DOT could offer preliminary findings soon on its review of Bakken fuel.One trade group, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), has tapped a third party to collect data from its members.The AFPM, voice for the refining sector, has said it hopes that arm's-length reporting will protect proprietary data while still satisfying regulators.DOT officials recently singled out the American Petroleum Institute, the leading voice for the oil industry, for failing to deliver on a January promise to share data. An API spokesman on Friday said the group was striving to answer officials' questions.Regulators have not received information from Plains All American, the midstream energy company whose 105-rail car shipment caught fire in Virginia this week, or other large shippers and terminal operators including  Hess, EOG, Musket and refiners such as Tesoro and Phillips 66 .

17,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault  Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) is poised to expand its growing Midwest and Gulf Coast fuel trading operation to the East Coast with Thursday's deal to buy Hess Corp's (HES.N) retail network and transport contracts.The purchase will give Marathon control of Hess's gasoline stations and access to pipelines, including the capacity to ship approximately 40,000 barrels per day on the sought-after Colonial Pipeline from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, according to the companies. The $2.9 billion deal is expected to close late in the third quarter.Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said the deal will ""further leverage"" the company's refining and logistics assets, ""providing an outlet for an incremental 200,000 (barrels per day) of assured sales from our refining system.""That likely means opening up new trading opportunities. Marathon's nearest refinery is nearly 500 miles east of New York City in Canton, Ohio, with few major pipelines in between. Shipping fuel north from its Texas and Louisiana plants should offer new opportunities for enterprising traders.""Marathon is not seen as a big, active, trader, so it will be interesting to see if that changes,"" said Robert Campbell, a New York-based analyst at consulting company, Energy Aspects.The purchase would allow Marathon to complement its diesel export business, bringing gasoline into New York Harbor as it sends distillate to Europe, he said.Marathon has shipped about 3.3 million barrels of distillate fuels out of the country in the past 12 months, sending shipments to destinations including Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, the Netherlands, and the Philippines, according to data compiled by Reuters. Marathon's exports trail those of integrated global oil companies like Shell and BP, and merchant traders like Vitol and Trafigura. ""Marathon will probably look at bringing blended product from the Bahamas into Florida and also move product out of the Midwest into Pennsylvania and PADD 1,"" Campbell said.A massive oil storage facility in the Bahamas may offer the chance for traders to use lower-cost ships to transport fuels to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast, where Marathon operates two major refineries. Shippers may use lower-cost foreign ships to transport oil through the Bahamas, bypassing regulations that require special ships for use between U.S. ports.The deal will not include the nearly 40 million barrels worth of petroleum product storage terminals up and down the Eastern seaboard that Hess sold last year to Buckeye Partners LP (BPL.N) for $850 million.It is not clear how the lack of company-owned storage terminals may affect Marathon's trading plans, although many owners - including Buckeye - typically lease out their tanks since they don't own their own retail outlets.

18,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault  May 22 Marathon Petroleum Corp is poised to expand its growing Midwest and Gulf Coast fuel trading operation to the East Coast with Thursday's deal to buy Hess Corp's retail network and transport contracts.The purchase will give Marathon control of Hess's gasoline stations and access to pipelines, including the capacity to ship approximately 40,000 barrels per day on the sought-after Colonial Pipeline from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, according to the companies. The $2.9 billion deal is expected to close late in the third quarter.Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said the deal will ""further leverage"" the company's refining and logistics assets, ""providing an outlet for an incremental 200,000 (barrels per day) of assured sales from our refining system.""That likely means opening up new trading opportunities. Marathon's nearest refinery is nearly 500 miles east of New York City in Canton, Ohio, with few major pipelines in between. Shipping fuel north from its Texas and Louisiana plants should offer new opportunities for enterprising traders.""Marathon is not seen as a big, active, trader, so it will be interesting to see if that changes,"" said Robert Campbell, a New York-based analyst at consulting company, Energy Aspects.The purchase would allow Marathon to complement its diesel export business, bringing gasoline into New York Harbor as it sends distillate to Europe, he said.Marathon has shipped about 3.3 million barrels of distillate fuels out of the country in the past 12 months, sending shipments to destinations including Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, the Netherlands, and the Philippines, according to data compiled by Reuters. Marathon's exports trail those of integrated global oil companies like Shell and BP, and merchant traders like Vitol and Trafigura. ""Marathon will probably look at bringing blended product from the Bahamas into Florida and also move product out of the Midwest into Pennsylvania and PADD 1,"" Campbell said.A massive oil storage facility in the Bahamas may offer the chance for traders to use lower-cost ships to transport fuels to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast, where Marathon operates two major refineries. Shippers may use lower-cost foreign ships to transport oil through the Bahamas, bypassing regulations that require special ships for use between U.S. ports.The deal will not include the nearly 40 million barrels worth of petroleum product storage terminals up and down the Eastern seaboard that Hess sold last year to Buckeye Partners LP  for $850 million.It is not clear how the lack of company-owned storage terminals may affect Marathon's trading plans, although many owners - including Buckeye - typically lease out their tanks since they don't own their own retail outlets.

It also provides a guaranteed market for the company's fuel, Marathon's Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said on a conference call on Thursday.Marathon Petroleum sells gasoline, food and drinks mainly through 1,480 Speedway convenience stores it owns and operates in nine states in the U.S. Midwest.

An MLP conversion has been extremely popular among pipeline and energy transportation companies for the past few years, with Kinder Morgan, El Paso Pipeline Partners LP  and others taking advantage of the tax structure.MLPs are not taxed at the U.S. federal level, lowering their cost of capital for parent companies, and typically have higher quarterly payouts than dividend-paying companies, making them appealing to stockholders. Hess had signaled for months that it was interested in forming an MLP for North Dakota assets. Hess posted net income of $931 million, or $2.96 per share, in the second quarter, compared with $1.43 billion, or $4.16 per share, in the year-ago period.Excluding one-time charges, the company posted a profit of $1.38 per share.By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.18 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's production dipped to 319,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 341,000 boe/d in the year-ago period.The drop was due to production curtailment in Libya because of ongoing violence in that country, as well as recent asset sales as the company streamlines its exploration and production operations.Still, production jumped in the company's North Dakota Bakken shale holdings by 23 percent to 48,000 boe/d. The Bakken has been one of Hess' most prolific production areas in recent years. The company opened 53 Bakken wells in the second quarter and slashed its well completion costs in the shale formation to $7.4 million, down 12 percent from the same period last year. Hess agreed in May to sell its chain of gas stations and related businesses for $2.87 billion to Marathon Petroleum Corp , a deal that helps Hess focus more on oil production.In June, Hess sold its 50 percent stake in an under-construction power plant in New Jersey to private equity firm Energy Investors Funds.

30,"  Oil and natural gas producer Hess Corp (HES.N) said it plans to form a publicly traded master limited partnership (MLP) comprising its pipeline and storage assets in North Dakota's Bakken oil shale field.The company's shares rose nearly 5 percent to $103.99 in light premarket trading on Wednesday.Hess said it expected the MLP to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the fourth quarter. [ID:nBwdp2bGa]An initial public offering will likely be launched in the first quarter of 2015, Hess said.Master limited partnerships (MLPs) have found favor with oil and gas producers as they pay no corporate taxes, lowering the cost of capital. Hess said the MLP would hold a natural gas processing plant, a crude oil truck, a pipeline terminal and a rail loading terminal in Tioga, North Dakota.The MLP will also include a propane storage cavern as well as related rail and truck loading and storage terminals in Mentor, Minnesota, the company said. Hess, which has been shedding downstream assets to focus on more profitable shale drilling in the United States, had said in April that it would retain a majority stake in the pipeline MLP.The company sold its retail and transport business for $2.87 billion to Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) in May.

Hess said it expected the MLP to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the fourth quarter.An initial public offering will likely be launched in the first quarter of 2015, Hess said.Master limited partnerships (MLPs) have found favor with oil and gas producers as they pay no corporate taxes, lowering the cost of capital.

Hess, which has been shedding downstream assets to focus on more profitable shale drilling in the United States, had said in April that it would retain a majority stake in the pipeline MLP.The company sold its retail and transport business for $2.87 billion to Marathon Petroleum Corp in May.Hess has also sold oil, gas and other assets outside its core U.S. exploration and production business, following pressure from activist investor Paul Singer's hedge fund Elliott Management LP.

36,"  * Facility could process U.S. light sweet crudes* PDVSA tries to sell most of its foreign refining assets   (Adds reaction from PDVSA, Duff & Phelps)By Marianna ParragaHOUSTON, Sept 17 Hess Corp and Venezuela's state-run PDVSA have found an interested buyer for their 350,000 barrel per day (bpd) Hovensa refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands, sources close to the deal told Reuters on Wednesday, confirming a local news report that could open the doors for the facility to run cheap U.S. crudes.Refining at the plant, owned 50 percent by Hess and 50 percent by PDVSA, has been halted since 2012 but its owners have been using it as a terminal.The operation would be part of a broader attempt by PDVSA to sell its foreign refining assets, including its unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum; its stake in Chalmette jointly owned with Exxon Mobil ; and a specialized network operated by Neste Oil. The Virgin Islands Daily News quoted Governor John deJongh Jr. as saying he would like to see the sale done before he leaves office in January.The Islands' government has been trying to find a buyer interested in restarting the facility since it was converted into a terminal in early 2012. It had set August as deadline to receive a proposal. That was later extended.Venezuela's PDVSA and Duff & Phelps, a financial advisory company hired by the Virgin Islands' governor, declined to comment. The company that submitted the offer, which was not identified, would want to reopen the facility as a refinery to run cheap U.S. light sweet crudes instead of heavier Venezuelan grades, deJongh reportedly told Senators.The United States is increasing shale crude output fast and the government is under pressure to lift a decades-old export ban that is prompting refining companies to run larger volumes of local crudes, while cutting imports. The deal has not yet been finalized, a source told Reuters, and an engineering assessment is expected to decide the crude it would run. The estimated cost of reopening the refinery is about $1.2 billion and it would take two years, the Virgin Islands Daily News said.The buyer was described by the newspaper as a U.S.-based company with the ability to raise capital but limited refining experience. Sources said it was a private equity firm.Cash-strapped PDVSA hired banking company Lazard to receive offers for its 749,000 bpd refining network in the United States, operated by Citgo, and the firm set late September as deadline in a potential $8-10 billion deal.Separately, PDVSA also tapped Deutsche Bank to explore a sale of its stake in the 192,500 bpd Chalmette refinery in Louisiana, after offering for sale since 2012 its stake in Nynas, a network of four refineries in Sweden, Scotland and England.Two sources close to PDVSA confirmed that Lazard is also managing offers for Hovensa.

Despite the higher output, Petroceltic slipped further into the red over the first half of the year, making a net loss of  $57.4 million compared with a loss of $16 million at the same time last year, due to exploration writeoffs of $64.3 million in Kurdistan, Romania and Egypt.

40,"   By Ernest Scheyder | BISMARCK N.D.  BISMARCK N.D. Hess Corp and other major North Dakota oil producers will tell the state's top energy regulators on Tuesday that existing field practices used to prepare Bakken crude for rail transport are safe and that tighter standards could actually do more harm than good.The comments, to be delivered at a special hearing of the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), come as federal, state and local officials grapple with how best to ensure the safe transport of the state's crude oil, which has been linked to a string of fiery crude-by-rail explosions, including one last year in Quebec that killed 47 people. The NDIC has asked companies, academics and others to testify about how any regulatory changes would affect the safety of Bakken crude oil, as well as producers' costs.""We believe Bakken crude oil is sufficiently prepared for transport in the field using conventional separation equipment already in place at well sites,"" Brent Lohnes, director for field and plant operations at Hess, said in prepared testimony for the NDIC, according to an advanced copy obtained by Reuters.More than 1 million barrels of crude are extracted each day from shale formations underneath North Dakota, making it the nation's second-largest oil producer after Texas.  Most of that crude, though, contains higher-than-average concentrations of ethane, propane and other combustible natural gas liquids (NGLs). Since most of North Dakota's crude is exported via rail lines that eventually wind through urban areas, treatment practices - including whether mandating the removal of all NGLs before shipment - have become a hot-button topic nationally.Representatives from Statoil also plan to testify at the hearing and echo comments from Lohnes, who is giving his testimony in conjunction with the American Petroleum Institute, the leading oil trade group. The NDIC, a three-person panel chaired by Governor Jack Dalrymple, is deciding whether to require construction of as many as 50 large-scale ""stabilizers"" to remove NGLs before oil is loaded onto railcars or into pipelines. Such equipment is widely used in Texas, though to build them in North Dakota would require yet another construction boom in a state growing weary of them.  The NDIC appears to be leaning toward a second option that would require existing field equipment be operated at specific temperatures and pressures to boost the amount of NGLs collected. Yet stabilization, Lohnes said, would just create another separate product - NGLs - for which there are few transport options besides rail, forcing an even-more potent material onto tracks. Also, mandating specific temperatures and pressures for existing equipment could cause damage that would decrease NGL collection, Lohnes said. On the federal front, the U.S. Government Accountability Office on Monday encouraged the Department of Transportation (DOT) to tighten its oversight of crude volatility testing. The DOT in July proposed safety rules for railcar design, but has not issued standards on whether NGLs should be removed from crude oil.

Hess Midstream Partners will initially hold Hess assets including a 30 percent interest in the New York company's natural gas processing plant in Tioga, North Dakota, and a 50 percent interest in its rail loading terminal and rail cars in Tioga, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. Additionally, other MLP assets will be a 50 percent stake in Hess' crude oil truck and pipeline terminal in Williams County, North Dakota, and all of its interest in a propane storage cavern and transportation facility in Mentor, Minnesota.

42,"  COPENHAGEN Oct 20 Denmark has received a record number of applications for oil and gas permits in its latest licensing round, including from A.P. Moller-Maersk's  oil unit, Royal Dutch Shell and Hess .The Danish Energy Agency said it had received 25 applications from 15 companies by Monday's midday deadline.The licensing round was restricted to the south-western end of Danish waters, but there were no specific areas or blocs involved. The licences will be awarded next year.Denmark is the smallest of the North Sea producers after Norway and Britain, but its 175,000 barrel per day production is significant for state coffers.""I am very pleased with the number of applications received in the licensing round, which confirms that oil companies are still confident interesting discoveries can be made in the Danish area,"" Energy Minister Rasmus Helveg Petersen said in a statement. It said it would launch the next licensing round in 2016.Oil and gas exploration and production from the Danish part of the North Sea is difficult due to geology characterised by chalk fields with high porosity but low permeability, meaning it is tough to coax oil out of the rock. For that reason, the recovery rate - the amount of oil lifted so far and the amount expected to be produced in the future using current technology - is low at 26 percent of Denmark's identified reserves.Denmark hopes progress with technology will raise that recovery rate significantly. For each percentage point increase in the recovery rate, the value of Denmark's oil output rises by 70 billion Danish crowns ($12 billion), the energy agency estimates.

44,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Alternative investment management group Oaktree Capital Management L.P. has purchased Hess Corp's (HES.N) share of proprietary energy trader HETCO, and will inject $500 million to fund the New York-based outfit's expansion into new commodity markets.The deal, the latest shareholder shake-up in the commodities trading industry, comes more than a year and a half after Hess launched the sale of Hess Energy Trading (HETCO), a small firm run by two former Goldman Sachs partners that trades physical oil, natural gas and other energy markets. Investors urged Hess Corp to divest the unit, saying it weighed on its balance sheet.The main founders of HETCO, Stephen Hendel and Stephen Semlitz, will remain with the company after the acquisition, they said in a statement. No financial details were released. Hess Corp has held a 50 percent stake in HETCO. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015.""Oaktree`s investment in HETCO will allow us to build on our existing successful activities in the energy space and expand our business across various commodities markets,"" Semlitz said in the statement. ""In particular, access to additional investment capital will provide us an incremental capability to strategically expand our reach and portfolio.""Oaktree becomes the latest private equity firm to jump into the commodity trading industry, which is undergoing a period of extraordinary flux as big global banks bow out of the sector.The group will provide working capital to HETCO and has committed up to $500 million of additional capital for potential new investments in the commodity space, the statement said. HESS SHEDS ASSETS Hess has been shedding assets since 2013, when activist shareholders including Elliott Management forced a reorganization of the board. Earlier this year, the company sold its network of East Coast gasoline stations and terminals that were not seen as key to its core mission of exploring and producing oil. HETCO, one of the last pieces to be sold, was established in 1997, and has grown to become a regular, if niche, player in many of the world's benchmark energy markets.An estimated 100-plus Hetco traders in seven offices from New York to London to Singapore generally focus on profiting from price discrepancies and trading gaps in the physical market for crude oil, refined fuels and natural gas, using fundamental analysis to spot arbitrage opportunities and big trades, according to industry executives who know the company and have traded with it for years, as previously reported by Reuters.Yet like many of its peers, Hetco has also engaged at times in traditional investment banking client activity, such as managing hedging programs. One of its biggest customers was Algeria's state-owned Sonatrach, according to its website. Net realized gains on trading activities amounted to $191 million in 2013 and $60 million in 2012, according to Hess Corp's annual filing.Wall Street banks like Deutsche Bank have halted trading in physical commodities, while JPMorgan has opted to sell its operations to Mercuria. The exit of large banks cleared out a pool of capital that had previously been active in investing in the space, paving the way for Oaktree and other alternative investment vehicles to get involved.

45,"  HOUSTON Oct 28 U.S. independent oil company Hess Corp. said on Tuesday it would proceed with the development of the $6 billion Stampede project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, one of the biggest energy investments announced during the current oil price slump.Hess, the operator of the deepwater project, has a 25 percent stake in Stampede. A unit of Chevron Corp, Norway's Statoil and Nexen Petroleum Offshore will also each hold a 25 percent stake.Hess said first production from the project is expected in 2018. By then, the market may well have recovered from a dip that has cut the price of barrels by more than 20 percent since June to around $80 each. Total estimated recoverable resources for Stampede, located about 115 miles (185 km) south of Fourchon, Louisiana, are estimated in the range of 300 million to 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. Gross processing capacity for the Stampede project is some 80,000 barrels of oil per day. By comparison, Chevron's massive Jack/St. Malo project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, approved in 2010, has a design capacity of 170,000 barrels of oil per day plus natural gas.

46,"  HOUSTON Oct 28 Venezuela's PDVSA and Hess Corp  have reached a tentative agreement to sell their 350,000-barrel-per-day Hovensa refinery to Atlantic Basin Refining, the U.S. Virgin Islands' governor said in a statement on Tuesday.The facility on the south shore of Saint Croix has been idle since 2012. The owners announced negotiations with a potential buyer in September, after they hired Lazard Ltd in November 2013 to manage the sale.A ""detailed operating agreement"" with the U.S. Virgin Island requires Atlantic Basin Refining, which was formed specifically to acquire the shuttered facility, to rebuild and restart it, employ local personnel and pay the government more than $1.6 billion over the life of the deal.The operational agreement would be for 22 years, renewable for two additional 10-year terms. Additional variable payments will also be required, depending on the refinery's profitability, Governor John de Jongh Jr. said in the statement. Owners of the refinery must take down Hovensa, which has been used as a terminal in recent years, and clean up the site if they do not restart the refinery or if they shut it down at any time in the future.""This will ensure that, whatever the circumstances, if there is not to be an operating refinery, we will not be left with an eyesore and a wasting asset,"" de Jongh said. Legislative approval is also required.The statement said an engineering analysis and a restart plan are probably take nine to 12 months, while construction and rehabilitation would take another 24 months and would cost more than $1 billion.

The price of Brent crude LCOc1 has fallen about 21 percent in recent months, prompting concern that drilling could slow. Hess bases its budget on Brent prices around $100 per barrel, though the commodity traded at about $87 on Wednesday.If prices fall too low, oil companies tend to stop drilling new wells and slow existing production in an effort to cut costs.

50,"  (Adds CEO quotes, updates stock)By Ernest ScheyderNov 10 Oil and gas producer Hess Corp  boosted its five-year production forecast on Monday, shrugging off the recent sharp drop in oil prices and touting development of shale formations and deepwater wells.The bullish forecast - executives said production could increase by double digits through the decade - sets an ambitious target and shows the company's confidence that oil prices will rebound from their more than 25 percent drop since June.Executives said production in North Dakota's Bakken shale formation, the jewel in the crown of the company's onshore production, is especially resilient. ""Even at current prices or below, there's still many areas for attractive investment in the Bakken,"" Chief Executive John Hess said at the company's annual investor day on Monday. ""We're positioned well to capitalize on growth"" at low oil prices.The company expects its production to grow 6 to 10 percent each year through 2018, an uptick from its previous forecast of 5 to 8 percent growth.The new estimates are based on Brent oil prices  around $90 to $100 per barrel, far above the roughly $83 Brent trades at today. Explaining the price forecast, Hess told investors he believes prices will eventually rebound. He also touted the company's use of different technologies and processes he said sets Hess apart. The company has found using sand proppant, rather than more-expensive ceramic proppant, works best in certain shale formations, a step that cuts costs, executives said.In North Dakota, Hess expects oil production to hit 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) by 2020, roughly double current levels. The company expects to drill more than 1,000 new Bakken wells in the next five years, bringing the total to 4,000. ""Our objective in the Bakken is to deliver the highest returns,"" President Greg Hill said at the investor day, which was broadcast over the Internet.Production in Ohio's Utica shale field is expected to nearly quadruple to 40,000 boe/d, executives said. It was the first time the company has forecast production in the nascent Utica field.Offshore, Hess forecast ""significant production growth,"" especially at its U.S. Gulf of Mexico Tubular Bells project, which it is working on with Chevron Corp.Shares of Hess closed 1.2 percent lower at $83.81 on Monday as oil price futures fell also.

Jan 26 Oil and natural gas producer Hess Corp cut its capital budget by 16 percent on Monday, saying it has balanced concerns about slipping crude prices with growth projects in places like North Dakota crucial to the company's future.The oil industry is grappling with a more-than 60 percent drop in crude oil prices since last June amidst global oversupply concerns, with many producers opting to sharply reduce spending and hope for a price rebound.In that context, the decision by Hess to only cut 16 percent of its budget was a far-less dramatic step than peers. Continental Resources Inc, for instance, slashed its 2015 budget by nearly 50 percent. Hess, which operates in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Denmark and Norway, among other places, plans to spend $4.7 billion this year.The single-largest expenditure for the company's capital budget this year will again be in North Dakota's Bakken shale formation, considered one of the largest oil reserves in the world. Hess, already the state's third-largest oil producer, will spend $1.8 billion there this year, down from last year's $2.2 billion. Executives plans to open 210 North Dakota wells this year compared with last year's 238.Hess holds most of its North Dakota acreage by production, an industry designation that means it's not required to drill new wells to hold leases with landowners. Given that, the company can afford to wait out low oil prices. ""Hess has some of the best acreage in the Bakken, and we will continue to drill in the core of the play which offers the most attractive returns,"" Hess President Greg Hill said in a statement.New York-based Hess also plans to drill new wells in Ohio's Utica shale formation, as well as offshore wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Norway, Guyana, Malaysia and Thailand.Hess said it plans to finish drilling in the oil-rich Kurdistan region of Iraq as well.Shares of Hess have lost 28 percent of their value in the past six months, closing Monday at $71.65 per share.

60,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Obama administration's new rules governing fracking on federal lands drew swift criticism from all sides on Friday, with green groups calling the measures ""toothless"" and the energy industry slamming ""unnecessary"" regulation of a drilling process that has brought the United States to the cusp of oil and gas self-sufficiency.Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a controversial technique that involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into a well to extract oil or gas. The new federal rules include beefed-up measures to protect ground water, one of the main health and safety concerns arising from the drilling process. Within minutes of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposal being released, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) and Western Energy Alliance filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Wyoming on grounds that the rulemaking was based on ""unsubstantiated concerns"" over safety.  The rules also require energy companies to reinforce boreholes to prevent water leakage, and to reveal chemical ingredients that are injected into the ground under high pressure to extract crude oil and gas. Although only about 10 percent of fracking occurs on federal lands, the Obama administration is hoping the rules will become a model for industry standards, especially in states that so far lack fracking rules.Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said the standards were a  long-overdue update to U.S. rules for drilling on federal lands, outmoded since the widespread emergence of horizontal drilling in the past 10 years. She said they were ""good for the public and good for industry.""The administration has characterized the BLM action as a step towards balancing public health and safety concerns with regulatory certainty that should allow energy companies to proceed with responsible production.Industry groups and Republicans warned the rules would slow down the U.S. ""energy renaissance."" The new standards require companies to submit detailed information about every proposed operation, including the location of faults and fractures, the depths of all usable water and the depth of estimated volume of fluid to be used.Companies would disclose the components of the fracking fluids they use on an industry-run website called FracFocus.“A duplicative layer of new federal regulation is unnecessary,"" said Eric Milito, a director at industry lobby group the American Petroleum Institute. ""We urge the BLM to work carefully with the states to minimize costs and delays created by the new rules to ensure that public lands can still be a source of job creation and economic growth.""Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso called the BLM rules ""a solution looking for a problem"" since his and other western states already have regulations. 'TOOTHLESS' Madeleine Foot, a policy analyst at The League of Conservation Voters, praised some safety requirements in the rules, but said telling companies to use the industry-run website FracFocus failed to increase transparency about fracking practices. Other environmentalists contended the rules failed to match administration rhetoric on combating the high-carbon industries that contribute to carbon change. ""Today's toothless fracking rules are just the latest sign that 'one step forward, two steps back' is beginning to cement as President Obama's historical legacy on climate change,"" said Karthik Ganapathy, a spokesman for 350.org, an environmental activist network.Both 350.org and the Sierra Club, one of the country's largest green groups, have argued for the government to eliminate fracking on federal lands. Jewell said the BLM had received comments for the standards from over 1.5 million groups and individuals. The rules have been in the works for nearly four years.Brian Deese, Obama's special adviser on climate change and the environment, said the federal government has an obligation to set ""rules of the road"" regarding fracking.""But ultimately this is an issue that is going to be decided in state capitals and in localities as well as in the industry. ""We’re going to see ... a conversation that will play out across the country, where it should be,"" Deese said.

63,"   By Catherine Ngai | NEW YORK  NEW YORK World oil prices could be $5 to $15 a barrel lower than forecast next year if oil-related sanctions against Iran are lifted, the U.S. government's energy agency said on Tuesday.In its monthly report, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. oil production growth was slowing even more quickly than it expected a month ago, while demand was higher than earlier forecast. But the agency left its price forecasts unchanged, putting Brent at $59 this year and $75 a barrel next year - with downside risks from Iran's return.“A lifting of sanctions against Iran should a comprehensive nuclear agreement be concluded could significantly change the forecast for oil supply, demand, and prices,"" EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski said in a statement. The agency said that Iran is believed to hold at least 30 million barrels of crude in storage, and that the nation could ramp up crude production by at least 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of 2016. Analysts have also said production would likely recover next year if sanctions are eased.The comments come on the heels of a framework accord last week to curb Iran's nuclear program, giving negotiators until June 30 to hammer out a comprehensive agreement. Upon verifying compliance, Iran - once the world's fifth-largest oil producer - could put supply back into the market. Meanwhile, the EIA cut its U.S. crude oil production growth forecast for 2015 to 550,000 bpd, versus 700,000 bpd in its March forecast, while the 2016 growth forecast was lowered to 80,000 bpd from 140,000 bpd a month ago. “U.S. crude oil production is expected to peak this year in the second quarter and then decline in the third quarter, before picking up again toward the end of this year as projected higher crude prices in the second half of 2015 make drilling more profitable,"" Sieminski said. Since June, crude prices have been effectively fallen by more than 50 percent on oversupplied markets and lackluster demand, resulting in falling rig counts and major capital expenditure cuts.

66,"  (Adds earnings call quotes; updates stock movement)By Ernest ScheyderWILLISTON, N.D., April 29 Oil and natural gas producer Hess Corp posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday that beat Wall Street's expectations, as cost cuts helped offset plunging crude oil prices .The company kept producing at a prolific pace, however, most notably at its powerhouse Bakken wells in North Dakota.Worth nearly a third of the company's daily oil output, the Bakken is where executives have constantly slashed spending, relying on what they tout as geological prowess and technological enhancements to pump 70 percent more oil than the same period last year. ""Our Bakken team continues to drive costs lower,"" Chief Executive John Hess told investors on a conference call, highlighting a 9 percent drop in the cost of each well.Hess and other executives stressed that cost cuts came from efficient operations and renegotiated contracts with vendors - which they say have saved $550 million so far this year - and downplayed any link to save cash amid cheap oil prices.Indeed, Hess cut its 2015 capital budget by $300 million, now planning to spend $4.4 billion this year, saying, effectively, that it would bank the savings by convincing Halliburton Co and others to charge less. The strategy relies heavily on the Bakken wells to continue pumping at a constant pace or else Hess runs the risk of contributing to a steep drop in U.S. crude output later this year, concerns which top industry leaders shared with Reuters last month.""I'd like to see a little more visibility on how the Bakken is going to behave before we update our (production) guidance,"" Greg Hill, the president of Hess, told investors. New York-based Hess posted a net loss of $389 million, or $1.37 per share, compared with a net income of $386 million, or $1.20 per share, in the year-ago quarter.Excluding a charge to write down the value of a well in Iraq's Kurdistan region and other items, the company posted a net loss of 98 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected a net loss of $1.06 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Production rose 14 percent to 361,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The average selling price Hess received for its crude oil during the quarter dropped 55 percent to $44.78 per barrel.Shares of Hess rose 0.3 percent to $76.97 in midday trading.

70,"   By Mike Kentz  NEW YORK, May 26 (IFR) - A rally in oil prices that has pushed WTI spot levels above US$60 has drawn a spate of hedging activity as producers look to lock in 2016 cashflows.California Resources Corporation, Cenovus Energy, EP Energy, EQT Corporation, Marathon Oil, Hess Corporation, Gulfport Energy, and Whiting Petroleum all initiated new hedges or added to existing hedges in the first quarter on the back of a US$10 rally from early January.Several - most notably higher-rated firms such as Marathon and Hess - do not traditionally hedge at all, according to market participants. Most have locked in prices for future delivery at just above US$60 through to 2016 in an attempt to assure funding lines ahead of any potential summer slowdown.""Increased hedging activity is a sign these firms view the outlook for the market as constructive enough to put down some protection - in a way it is almost a necessary pre-cursor to a pick-up in spending and/or production,"" said Ryan Todd, E&P equities analyst at Deutsche Bank.""Once the value of futures contracts used for hedging moves back into a range that's reasonable, it presents an opportunity to lock in cashflow ahead of when lenders revisit the revolvers the E&P firms have in place. Having a strong outlook for the business, even if it does cap the upside, goes a long way in shoring up the risk of a lack of funding.""Futures contracts referencing the expected price of delivery in 2016 - used for hedging or as a hedging benchmark by most corporations - broke through the US$65 range in early May when spot touched US$62.The breakthrough above these key thresholds allowed some firms to lock in future rates of sale above US$65, essentially a coup for producers wary of dips back down below US$50 that would test profitability and bring future funding capabilities into question.Such a dip below US$50 had occurred in March, causing a similar but perhaps more frantic rush for protection (see ""New oil lows revive hedging"", IFR 2075 p63). The more recent activity comes primarily from smaller firms that are prepping an eventual ramp-up in production once prices overcome weak fundamentals layered into the market through last autumn's price collapse.""Demand is increasing, notably in gasoline, I think most of the market expects that eventually we'll break through to the upside - but in the meantime producers are taking a realistic view on the commodity,"" said David Leben, director in the commodity derivatives group at BNP Paribas.""It's reflective of a move to lock in favourable economics and support the portfolio before they get ready to ramp production back up."" NOT SO FAST Analysts say the activity is a positive sign for the market overall but is only one piece of the puzzle that will determine survival for more leveraged firms.""Hedging trends overall will not have a material impact on activity levels and production trends,"" said Brian Gibbons, E&P analyst at CreditSights.""Activity levels and production trends will be driven by improved economics at lower price points due to lower capital and operating costs and efficiency gains."" Investment-grade credits that hedged in the first quarter - Marathon, HESS, Devon, and Pioneer - have above average leverage for their respective credit ratings, according to Gibbons, with the exception of Pioneer, which has a massive capex programme it hopes to keep afloat.But the rest of the high-grade market has abstained from hedging, a turnround from the days of US$100-plus prices when firms such as Anadarko, Apache and EOG Resources were near-fully hedged.All three let protection fall off in 2015, exhibiting a bullish directional view and balance sheet confidence that they hoped would allow them to weather dips and participate fully in upside swings.""It is unusual to see some of these firms un-hedged, but it shows they think they have the financial wherewithal to handle the environment,"" said Craig Breslau, managing director in the oil trading group at Societe Generale.Bank derivative desks expect a wider range of firms to lock in future rates if WTI prices break to new highs.""I think there is still a lot of pent-up hedging demand and if we break through new highs you're going to see a lot more firms come in. That selling pressure I think will put almost a soft cap around the US$70 level for the foreseeable future as producers take that price as soon as it hits,"" said Breslau.A version of this story appears in the May 23 version of IFR magazine, a Thomson Reuters product.

Hess said the assets included in the joint venture are a natural gas processing plant, a crude oil truck, a pipeline terminal and a rail loading terminal in North Dakota.The MLP will also include a propane storage cavern as well as related rail and truck loading facility in Mentor, Minnesota.Hess, which will retain control of the midstream assets' operations, expects the MLP's net income at $145 million to $155 million for the year ending March 31.The company also expects capital expenditures to be funded by the joint venture for the same period to be $325 million to $350 million.Hess' shares were up about 6 percent at $69.57 on the New York Stock Exchange.

91,"   By Anna Driver and Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Hess Corp (HES.N), a U.S. oil company with operations in North Dakota's Bakken Shale, said on Tuesday that it planned to cut capital spending by 40 percent this year, the latest company to scale back due to the sharp downturn in crude prices.The New York-based company plans to spend $2.4 billion in 2016, down from $4 billion last year.The move comes on the heels of industry-wide cuts last year that ranged from about 20 percent to 50 percent. Despite those steps, many operators managed to lift output as they devised new ways to coax more oil from rock.    Hess and many peers have been known to use derivatives to hedge prices on a chunk of their output, but the budget cut comes as the energy industry grapples with how best to respond to crude prices that are lingering around $30 per barrel, a level where many oil and gas producers cannot profitably operate, according to numerous analysts.At that level, U.S. oil companies are expected to slash 2016 budgets by an average of 38 percent, according to a report from Bernstein Energy analysts   Halcon Resources Corp (HK.N), which operates in North Dakota and Texas, last week slashed its 2016 budget by 55 percent, saying it will operate only one drilling rig this year and ramp down production in response to low prices.On the other end of the spectrum, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N), which is known for its aggressive hedging program, said earlier this month it would spend between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion this year.  Though Pioneer will fund its 2016 budget in part from a $500 million asset sale, the modest increase from $2.2 billion in 2015 makes the company a relative outlier at a time when most companies are trimming capex by amounts similar to last year's drastic cutbacks.Despite its own cut, Hess will continue to invest in growth projects, Chief Operating Officer Greg Hill said.""We have significantly decreased our 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures, and we plan to reduce activity at all of our producing assets,"" he said.The company forecast average 2016 production at between 330,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, unchanged from the outlook it provided in October.

Excluding one-time items, the company lost $1.40 per share. By that measure, analysts expected a loss of $1.48 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Hess stressed that for 2016 it has enough cash to fund both its capital budget and dividend, which will cost about $2.5 billion, less than the company's $2.7 billion in cash reserves. ""We don't need any cash flow from operations to fund the capital budget or dividend,"" John Rielly, Hess' chief financial officer, said on the conference call.Oil and gas production inched up to 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, from 362,000 boepd, a year earlier. In North Dakota's Bakken Shale, Hess plans to cut the number of drilling rigs it operates to two. By contrast, the company ran 14 Bakken drilling rigs as recently as 2014.""We believe it is prudent to manage the business assuming (oil) prices will stay lower for longer,"" Greg Hill, the company's operating chief, said on the conference call.

97,"   By Ernest Scheyder | DENVER, March 10  DENVER, March 10 Hess Corp still plans to bring roughly 80 North Dakota oil wells online this year despite volatility in crude prices, confident its approach is the best long-term use of capital and staff.The strategy, which differs from peers in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, highlights the myriad ways companies are deploying technology, cash and workers to try to survive the more than 60 percent drop in crude prices since 2014.Hess first announced plans in January to operate two drilling rigs in North Dakota this year, a drop from 2015 but still more than some peers.For Hess, the decision was born of its use of a manufacturing process developed by automaker Toyota Motor Corp  to cut costs and boost production. As part of that process, Hess has kept hiring oilfield service contractors, confident that by maintaining relationships in a time of low prices it can reap benefits if or when prices rise. ""A key risk we see now is maintaining the capability we have now to complete new wells, and we don't want to lose that,"" Gerbert Schoonman, head of North Dakota operations for Hess, said in an interview on the sidelines of the DUG Rockies conference in Denver on Thursday.The strategy is in contrast to Whiting Petroleum Corp  and other North Dakota oil producers that have stopped fracking new wells to save cash. ""You have to believe in a very steep increase in oil prices to delay these completions, and we don't,"" Schoonman said.Hess operates globally in shale and traditional oil deposits, unlike most of its North Dakota peers that operate only in the United States. The geographic diversity helps boost margins. Whiting, for instance, generates most of its profit in North Dakota, which crimps profit. Whiting Chief Executive Jim Volker said on Thursday that he expects banks to trim his company's credit line by more than $1 billion in early May.While Hess did cut North Dakota spending for 2016 and boosted deepwater allotments, Schoonman said that was a reflection of his unit's ability to ramp up production should prices rise. Hess completed 219 wells in North Dakota last year for instance, planning on 64 percent fewer this year.""We see North Dakota as a big growth area for Hess,"" he said. ""When oil prices rise, we will return to big growth in the Bakken again.""

112,"  (Adds Houlihan Lokey confirmation of departure in paragraph 3)By Michael FlahertyNEW YORK, June 1 Elliott Management, the $27 billion hedge fund, has hired a Houlihan Lokey banker as part of its activist team, as the group expands its reach across a broad range of sectors.Geoffrey Sorbello, a Houlihan director who specializes in shareholder activism, contested M&A and proxy contests, joined New York-based Elliott on Tuesday, according to an email seen by Reuters.Elliott declined to comment. A Houlihan spokesman confirmed Sorbello's departure but would not discuss further details, in accord with bank policy. Sorbello will remain based in New York and report to Jesse Cohn, Elliott's senior portfolio manager, according to a person familiar with the matter. Cohn has played a major role in the hedge fund's activist campaigns in the technology sector, including via its stake in Qlik Technologies, which prompted the data analytics company to put itself up for sale.Elliott's hiring of Sorbello, who previously worked at proxy solicitation firm Okapi Partners and proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), shows how the hedge fund is seeking to strengthen its activist strategy, which comprises a relatively small portion of the massive hedge fund's market activity. While the bulk of Elliott's activism has focused on the tech space lately, Elliott has broadened its reach across multiple sectors, including oil and gas, retail and other industries.Ares Capital Corp agreed to buy smaller rival American Capital Ltd on May 23 for $3.4 billion, after Elliott took a large stake in ACAS and pushed it to ditch a spin-out plan and instead explore a sale. The current auction of outdoor retailer Cabela's was the result of an Elliott campaign. Elliott's three largest equity holdings are data storage company EMC Corp, which is in the process of being bought by Dell Inc, oil company Hess Corp and aluminum maker Alcoa Inc, according to a quarterly filing.Elliott is among the largest and most active hedge funds in the activist arena - part of a growing crowd of investors pushing for leadership and strategy changes across Corporate America. Last year saw more than 500 activist campaigns, the most ever recorded, according to Thomson Reuters data.The wash of campaigns has led to several high profile moves among activist advisers in the last few years, including where advisers moved to investment banks tasked with defending dissident investors, or, as in Sorbello's case, advisers moving to an internal role at an activist.
