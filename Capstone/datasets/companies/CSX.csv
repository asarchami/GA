Jan 13 No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific Corp believes major railroad mergers are not in the interest of the rail industry or customers and is working behind the scenes to make sure none take place, the company's top executive said on Wednesday.""We don't want Class I railroad mergers to happen,"" chief executive Lance Fritz told Reuters when asked about Canadian Pacific's unsolicited bid for U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern Corp. ""We'll do everything in our power to make them not happen.""Fritz, who was in the Chicago suburb of Lombard to address a meeting of the Midwest Association of Rail Shippers, said Union Pacific has been talking to state and federal legislators across its network, its customers and regulators including the Surface Transportation Board about why mergers would be bad for business.""I think we're doing a fair job of helping them understand our perspective,"" Fritz said. ""I think (the chance of a merger happening is) slim because I want it to be slim and we're working hard to make it slim."" He said a merger would create problems in Chicago where all major U.S. railroads interconnect and stressed a flurry of mergers in the 1990s created huge service issues.Union Pacific has also talked to other major railroads about the potential impact of a merger, though those conversations are limited by law.Canadian Pacific in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern. Norfolk Southern has spurned the Canadian railroad's interest, setting the scene for a potentially lengthy proxy battle. A number of customers and legislators have written to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) opposing the proposed merger.That opposition could significantly harm Canadian Pacific's case if a merger reaches the STB for a review. Customers are concerned a merger would lead to others among North America's remaining railroads, resulting in an anti-competitive duopoly. According to its own rules, the STB must consider the potential for other mergers.The No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, has said publicly if the STB agrees to consider a Canadian Pacific and Norfolk Southern merger, increasing the potential for a union, it could in turn bid for Norfolk or No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp.Fritz said a merger would ""increase the pressure enormously"" on other railroads to consolidate, but declined to say what action Union Pacific would take.""We'll evaluate that should it occur and do the best thing for our shareholders,"" he said.

10,"   By Nick Carey and Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Archer Daniels Midland Co has filed a lawsuit against Canadian Pacific over service disruptions in 2013 and 2014 at crop-processing plants in North Dakota and Minnesota, alleging they stemmed partly from cost-cutting and the Canadian railroad's pursuit of merger partners.  Chicago-based ADM, one of the world's largest grain traders and processors, filed suit against CP in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois last Friday, seeking damages ""resulting from one of the worst and most persistent railroad service failures experienced by ADM in many years.""But that same day, the railroad filed a claim against ADM in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota seeking payment of overdue charges.Railroads have long served as the lone, dependable way to move grain across the northern U.S. Plains, where there are no commercially-navigable rivers.    In early 2014, after months of worsening delays crippled the U.S. farm transportation system, farmers in the Upper Midwest held the largest grain stocks in years.A CP spokesman said ADM's claim stems from that harsh winter, adding it would ""defend itself vigorously against ADM's frivolous allegations."" ADM refers in its lawsuit to damages of ""several million dollars,"" but it is potentially embarrassing as it highlights key benefits CP has touted in its bid for Norfolk Southern Corp. CP in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer for Norfolk Southern.The Norfolk, Virginia-based railroad has rebuffed CP's advances. CP claims a deal would result in cost savings of more than $1.8 billion annually.  While some rail customers back the bid, many like package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp oppose it. Opponents say cost-cutting initiatives would cause service disruptions.Since septuagenarian railroad legend Hunter Harrison became CP chief executive in 2012, Wall Street has cheered its efforts to trim costs.But ADM's lawsuit claims service disruptions at its facilities in Enderlin and Velva, North Dakota, plus Red Wing, Minnesota stem partly from CP ""engaging in imprudent cost-cutting initiatives."" ADM blamed the problems on ""diversionary management activities"" at CP ""pertaining to potential rail merger/acquisition partners.""In late 2014, CP also offered to buy No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp, but was rebuffed.The lawsuit also alleges CP did not allow ADM to use alternative rail providers ""to mitigate its service deficiencies."" CP has promoted the idea of ""open access,"" allowing rail customers to use alternatives in similar situations.

16,"   By Nick Carey and Allison Lampert | CHICAGO/MONTREAL  CHICAGO/MONTREAL Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) Chief Executive Hunter Harrison on Monday said the company would consider using cash once planned to acquire rival Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) for a potential buyback, dividend, or combination of both.In a phone interview from Chicago, Harrison also said he didn't believe that CP's decision to abandon its $28 billion bid for Norfolk Southern signaled the end of future consolidation among North America's major railroads. ""It's just the timing,"" he said. Some analysts have speculated that Kansas City Southern (KSU.N) could be a candidate for a deal, and the regulatory barriers might be lower than in the CP-Norfolk Southern scenario. But CP's Harrison said on Monday that Kansas City, which he called expensive, was ""not a good fit."" The proposed CP-Norfolk Southern deal was criticized by some customers concerned about higher costs and reduced service, and would have been subject to scrutiny from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), which rewrote its merger rules following a flurry of big deals in the 1990s and has not approved a combination since 1999.  ""I think the reaction to this potential merger shows that regulators, politicians and many of the most important rail customers had no appetite for a deal,"" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Mark Levin. ""It's hard to see any mergers happening in the near future.""Harrison said CP has a positive relationship with its customers, even ones that opposed the merger. ""Nothing in the merger talks created any tension,"" he said.Harrison attributed CP's decision to abandon its bid to multiple factors including recent remarks by the departments of justice and defense, along with political pushback.  On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department urged the STB to reject a voting trust arrangement Canadian Pacific had proposed as part of its bid.A day earlier the U.S. Department of Defense said the proposed deal could adversely affect national defense. CP had touted cost savings of more than $1.8 billion annually from the deal, saying it would create a transcontinental railroad that would provide more efficient, cheaper rail service. Harrison said he did not envisage making further cuts at CP to deliver those savings, because the majority of synergies would have come from Norfolk Southern.This latest failure followed the recent collapse of other mega transactions, such as pharmaceutical firm Pfizer Inc's (FE.N) $160 billion takeover of rival Allergan PLC (AGN.N), which ran into antitrust problems.CP shares rose 3.9 percent in New York Stock Exchange trading on Monday.  Billionaire investor William Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management is Canadian Pacific’s biggest owner with 13.9 million shares, had pushed hard late last year for the deal that people familiar with it said was initiated by Harrison. While Ackman’s fund has been performing poorly this year, posting a roughly 24 percent loss, he named Canadian Pacific as one of the firm’s few winners for 2016 on a conference call with investors last week. A Pershing Square spokesman declined to comment on Monday. Right from start, many analysts said CP's merger bid was a long shot because of the regulatory hurdles at the STB. The climb for CP's bid grew steeper as major customers, elected officials and government agencies spoke out against a deal or against the structure of CP's proposal.  Customers including package delivery companies FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) opposed the bid out of fears that CP's plans to cut costs would hurt rail services.UPS is the largest customer of the major U.S. railroads. ""UPS is comfortable with the current structure of the North American rail network,"" spokesman Dan McMakin said. ""We believe that an attempt to integrate differing operating philosophies would be unduly disruptive.""A previous bid by CP for No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp (CSX.O) failed last year.Rival railroads had also spoken out against a deal. ""The opposition to this deal shows that unless the whole industry gets behind consolidation, it's not going to happen,"" said independent railroad analyst Anthony Hatch.CP shares were last up 3 percent at C$180.62.

17,"  (Adds comments from CEO, background, stock price)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, April 13 No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp  said on Wednesday its expects ""mid-to-high single digit"" freight volume declines in the second quarter due largely to slumping coal demand, but its top executive said there are signs America's industrial economy may avoid a recession.""During the fourth quarter, there was a risk of an industrial recession,"" chief executive Michael Ward told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""I wouldn't say it's recovering, but the industrial economy does seem to be healing.""""That side of the business remains a challenge, but it does seem to be stabilizing,"" he added. Ward spoke to Reuters the day after the company posted a lower net profit in the first quarter that met market expectations.He pointed to the Purchasing Managers' Index for March, which rose to 51.8, as a sign of hope for the sector. A reading over 50 generally indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding.During a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, executives said they expected coal freight volumes to drop 25 percent in 2016 compared with the prior year. The company had previously expected coal volumes to drop 20 percent this year. All the major U.S. railroads have been hurt by falling demand for coal, as utilities have switched to burning cheaper and cleaner natural gas amid low energy prices while the strong U.S. dollar has hurt coal exports.Ward said the company's assumptions do not include the possibility of a hot summer season in the United States, which would boost demand for air conditioning and thereby increase the use of coal by utilities. The company also sees ongoing strong U.S. auto sales and rising housing demand as positives for its full-year outlook.The Jacksonville, Florida-based company has not yet given earnings guidance for 2016. But the CEO said despite a greater anticipated drop in coal volumes, cost-cutting and productivity gains should result in savings of $250 million that will offset that lost revenue.""We're going to keep turning over every rock ... to help us on the productivity side,"" Ward said.CSX shares were up 4.3 percent at $26.06 in early afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

22,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A CSX freight train derailed in northeastern Washington on Sunday, spilling hazardous material near a subway station and disrupting commuter rail and long-distance Amtrak passenger trains but causing no injuries, authorities said. Thirteen rail cars were strewn across the tracks at the derailment site in the early morning incident, District of Columbia Fire Department photos showed.A ruptured tank car likely leaked several hundred gallons of sodium hydroxide, a caustic substance used to produce household products including paper and detergent, before the leak was plugged, Deputy Fire Chief John Donnelly told a news conference.The fire department did not order evacuations around the site of the accident, which happened about 3 miles (5 km) from the White House near the elevated Rhode Island Avenue station.Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said it would take some time for CSX (CSX.O) and emergency workers to clear the overturned cars and clean up the spill. ""There's nothing running on that track tomorrow,"" Bowser said. She added that no cause for the accident had been determined, but a federal investigation into the derailment had begun.The derailed train was traveling from Cumberland, Maryland, to Hamlet, North Carolina. It was made up of three locomotives and 175 rail cars.Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham said the Chicago-to-Washington Capitol Limited long-distance trains would terminate in Pittsburgh, with Washington passengers given alternate transportation until the area was cleared.  Amtrak's electrified Northeast Corridor trains were not affected, as they use a different set of tracks.The Maryland Transit Administration said its MARC Brunswick Line commuter trains on Monday from Martinsburg, West Virginia, to Washington would likely terminate at Silver Spring, Maryland.The station was shut down and Red Line subway trains were not allowed through the area on Sunday. A spokesman for the region's Metro transit system said service would be restored as soon as the hazardous materials were cleared from the area and safety tests conducted on the Metro rails. The chemical spill could stir controversy over CSX transporting hazardous materials through the heart of the U.S. capital. Over the past five years, some District residents and community groups opposed a major CSX construction project to rebuild and expand a 112-year-old rail tunnel in central Washington, fearing it would encourage more freight traffic through the city and increase chances of a chemical spill.Construction on the $170 million project has begun after several unsuccessful court challenges.

26,"  (Adds details of results, stock move, company comment, background, byline)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, July 13 CSX Corp, the third-largest U.S. railroad, on Wednesday posted a lower second-quarter net profit that beat expectations as lower costs partly offset a 34 percent drop in coal volumes.The railroad's shares rose more than 4 percent on the news which came before the market closed.Like all the other major railroads, CSX has been hit by weak commodities prices, especially for coal. This has led to sharp declines in shipments that industry experts call a ""freight recession."" U.S. railroads have raced to cut costs by furloughing workers, mothballing locomotives and streamlining operations. On Wednesday the Association of American Railroads said that through July 9, freight on all U.S. railroads was down 7.7 percent in 2016 from the year-ago period.Overall freight volumes at CSX were down 9 percent from the year-ago quarter, the company said in a statement. All freight classes declined except for automotive, which rose 1 percent, and minerals, up 13 percent.Coal has traditionally been a high-margin business for U.S. railroads. But low fuel prices have prompted utilities to switch to cheaper natural gas, while coal exports have been hurt by the strong U.S. dollar. CSX cut costs by $183 million, or 9 percent, during the quarter.""CSX continued to drive strong customer service and network efficiency in a challenging market, which is expected to persist throughout this year,"" Chief Executive Michael Ward said in the statement. The Jacksonville, Florida-based company posted net income of $445 million, or 47 cents per share, down nearly 20 percent from $553 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts had on average had expected earnings per share of 44 cents.Revenue totaled $2.7 billion, down from $3.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.CSX shares closed up 4.4 percent at $28.21, before paring gains to 3.7 percent in extended trading.

33,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. stocks ticked up on Wednesday, just enough for the S&P 500 and Dow industrials to set record highs, with investors expecting upbeat earnings to keep the rally going.Following three days of strong gains on the back of economic data, focus has turned to Thursday's meeting at the Bank of England, expected to turn to quantitative easing as it tries to shield the economy from the fallout of Britain's vote last month to leave the European Union. Continued support from monetary policies across the developed world and strong economic data in the United States have given investors a reason to bid growth-sensitive sectors of the stock market. This turn to cyclical stocks could help take the rally beyond the current record highs.""The bias is to extend the current rally mainly because (U.S. economic) data that we've gotten so far has been supportive,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.He said the BOE and bank earnings will take the focus this week and the sectors more likely to post revenue surprises during the current earnings season are consumer discretionary, healthcare, industrials and materials. ""New records came just before we started earnings and strong earnings are going to be essential. Fundamentals are going to be the basis for the market to move forward.""While second-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are currently expected to fall 5 percent, the typical beat would indicate the first quarter marked a bottom for the earnings contraction. Most on Wall Street expect growth to resume in the second half of the year.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.45 points, or 0.13 percent, to 18,372.12; the S&P 500 ticked up 0.29 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,152.43 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 17.09 points, or 0.34 percent, to 5,005.73. The S&P and Dow closed at record highs.It was the more defensive sectors that buoyed the S&P 500 after having lagged over the past few days.

The company said coal, which has long been a large and lucrative piece of business for major U.S. rail companies, continued its slide with volumes down 21 percent and revenue off 20 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30.Railroads have been hoping for a bottom to the slide in coal that began in late 2014, as low energy prices encouraged utilities to switch to burning cheaper natural gas.

In addition, a strong U.S. dollar has hurt coal exports.

The railroads need a long, cold winter to reduce inventories. CSX executives told analysts on Thursday that fourth-quarter earnings should be ""flat to slightly down"" with freight volumes to be relatively flat.

The railroad has restored service in Florida and Georgia, and on its main line through South Carolina and North Carolina, using generators. Some branch lines in both states, however, remain closed and some may be out of action for up to two weeks as flood waters slowly recede, he said.
