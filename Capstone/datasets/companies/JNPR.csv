The hedge fund also suggested addition of new directors to the company's board. A Juniper spokeswoman told Reuters in an email that the board and management team have been comprehensively analyzing the company's priorities for some time and are finalizing the review ""with a sense of urgency.""""We look forward to presenting the details of our integrated operating plan as we finalize them in the coming weeks.

19,"  FRANKFURT/HELSINKI Finland's Nokia is considering buying U.S.-based Juniper Networks to merge into its telecommunications network gear business, German's Manager Magazin Online reported, citing unidentified sources.Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) Chief Executive Rajeev Suri traveled to the United States late last year to discuss with Juniper's management closer cooperation and a possible merger that would strengthen NSN's weak U.S. business, the online magazine said on Thursday.Juniper has a stock market value of $13.7 billion, making it a major takeover target for Nokia, but Manager Magazin said Nokia could use Juniper's $3.1 billion cash to help finance the purchase.NSN will be Nokia's primary operation after the sale of its devices and services business to Microsoft in a 5.4 billion euro ($7.4 billion) deal, which is expected to close by the end of next month.Nokia had indicated it is looking at a number of options as part of its strategic review to be completed in March.A source familiar with NSN's strategy said no such deal was imminent. Analysts have said, however, that NSN and other smaller network equipment players are likely to pursue M&A because high costs of developing better mobile broadband infrastructure puts players with bigger research and development budgets at an advantage.NSN and Juniper are already in a partnership to develop and sell network equipment to carriers.Nokia's former Chief Executive Stephen Elop, who will return to Microsoft after the deal closes, was COO of Juniper for about a year from early 2007. Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold said a deal with Juniper was unlikely, with a failed joint venture focused on enterprise switching and present partnerships having ""not amounted to much.""Nokia would have to offer ""at least"" 10-20 percent premium to where Juniper's stock is trading now, Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson said.

20,"  * Juniper to return $3 bln to shareholders in 3 years* To start quarterly dividend of $0.10 from 3rd quarterFRANKFURT/HELSINKI Feb 20 Finland's Nokia  is considering buying U.S.-based Juniper Networks  to merge into its telecommunications network gear business, German's Manager Magazin Online reported, citing unidentified sources.Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) Chief Executive Rajeev Suri travelled to the United States late last year to discuss with Juniper's management closer cooperation and a possible merger that would strengthen NSN's weak U.S. business, the online magazine said on Thursday.Juniper has a stock market value of $13.7 billion, making it a major takeover target for Nokia, but Manager Magazin said Nokia could use Juniper's $3.1 billion cash to help finance the purchase.NSN will be Nokia's primary operation after the sale of its  devices and services business to Microsoft in a 5.4 billion euro ($7.4 billion) deal, which is expected to close by the end of next month.Nokia had indicated it is looking at a number of options as part of its strategic review to be completed in March.A source familiar with NSN's strategy said no such deal was imminent. Analysts have said, however, that NSN and other smaller network equipment players are likely to pursue M&A because high costs of developing better mobile broadband infrastructure puts players with bigger research and development budgets at an advantage. NSN and Juniper are already in a partnership to develop and sell network equipment to carriers.Nokia's former Chief Executive Stephen Elop, who will return to Microsoft after the deal closes, was COO of Juniper for about a year from early 2007.Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold said a deal with Juniper was unlikely, with a failed joint venture focused on enterprise switching and present partnerships having ""not amounted to much.""Nokia would have to offer ""at least"" 10-20 percent premium to where Juniper's stock is trading now, Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson said. He added that a deal was unlikely as Nokia lacked the wherewithal and synergies.

26,"   By Danielle Robinson  The company, which last week announced a three-year US$3bn capital return to shareholders under pressure from Elliott Management Corp, came to market with a new US$350m 4.5% 10-year bond offering.Normally such a large capital return program for a company the size of Juniper would be of concernn to bond investors.Solving its problems with Elliott and getting a one-year standstill agreement from the hedge fund, however, was crucial to the success of the deal, led by Barclays and Goldman Sachs.""Bond investors hate not having clarity, so if a borrower gives them that, then they will be fine, because then they can work out valuation,"" said one market participant.Juniper (Baa2/BBB) announced the no-grow US$350m deal in the low 200s, a level that garnered orders just shy of US$3bn. That compared with similarly rated triple-B tech companies trading in the high 100s, and Cisco's US$1bn 3.625% March 2024s - issued on Monday as part of a US$8bn trade - trading at 88bp.Although Cisco is higher rated at A1/AA-, investors and analysts found it hard to ignore the difference in spread. ""Cisco is clearly in a superior financial position relative to Juniper, as it is 10 times the size of Juniper and holds far more cash relative to its debt load,"" Morningstar said in an analyst note.""However, we believe the difference in spread between the two firms' bonds should only be about 50 basis points,"" it said.""We pegged fair value on the new Cisco 10-year bonds at +75 basis points, which would imply a fair value on the Juniper issue of +125 basis points."" At 187.5bp Juniper came about 12.5bp inside of the G+200bp level on its outstanding 4.6% March 2021s.Keeping the deal small also helped elevate its already considerable scarcity value as a bond issuer.The US$350m will complement the cash on hand Juniper is setting aside for immediate capital return requirements, a source close to the issuer said.The capital return program includes a US$2bn share buyback, US$1.2bn of which has been accelerated.",2014-02-27,JNPR,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 5:33pm EST",Investors flood Juniper bond with orders,http://www.reuters.com//article/juniper-bonds-idUSL1N0LW2T020140227?type=companyNews

48,"   By Lehar Maan and Abhirup Roy | Sept 8  Sept 8 U.S. network gear makers are bracing for slower revenue growth in the second half of the year as telecom operators, their main customers, postpone spending until the dust settles on several big mergers.Telecom giants AT&T Inc and Sprint Corp are taking time to decide whether to upgrade existing wired networks or roll out 4G networks, forcing gear makers to cut expectations for what is usually the stronger half of their year.Ciena Corp and Finisar Corp last week joined their peers in forecasting a weak current quarter, citing delays on closing sales to customers in North America. Analysts say a slowdown could last two or three quarters.AT&T is set to buy DirecTV for $48.5 billion and Deutsche Telekom AG is seeking buyers for T-Mobile US Inc after the collapse of a sale to Sprint - which itself was bought last year by Japan's Softbank Corp.""When deals get done, when operators come together, typically the vendors experience a pause,"" said Simon Leopold, analyst at Raymond James. Most affected by the slowdown in orders will be those network gear makers with the greatest exposure to the telecoms business, such as Ciena, Juniper Networks Inc and JDS Uniphase Corp.Others, including F5 Networks Inc, have been spared the brunt of the slowdown in telecom spending as they get a large chunk of their revenue from enterprise customers, who are still spending to upgrade networks and guarding data from hackers. Shares of F5 Networks and Aruba Networks Inc, another company with greater exposure to enterprise customers, rose 11 percent and 21 percent respectively between the end of June and Friday's close.In contrast, shares of Juniper, Ciena and JDS Uniphase have fallen between 5 percent and 11 percent in the same period.At least 11 brokerages cut their price target on Juniper's stock after the company reported results in July, while at least 10 raised their target on F5 Networks after the company reported. Mergers between U.S. telecom companies were affecting spending decisions, which in turn could delay some of Ciena's projects, Chief Executive Gary Smith said on a post-earnings conference call last Thursday .U.S. network gear makers have grown accustomed to strong results in the final two quarters of the calendar year, riding high on a decade-long trend among telecom operators of spending big in the second half.The reverse will be true this year. Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie said telecom operators would spend about 45 percent of their budget in the second half versus 55 percent in a typical year.""The investor position is relatively cautious for the next couple of quarters,"" said UBS Equities analyst Amitabh Passi.

50,"   By Blaise Robinson | PARIS  PARIS Shares in telecom gear maker Alcatel-Lucent ALUA.PA fell 7 percent on Friday, extending a recent slump, after U.S. rival Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) became the latest technology company to issue a warning on sales.Juniper cut its third-quarter sales target late on Thursday, reflecting what it called lower-than-anticipated demand from service providers, particularly in the United States. ""Juniper has mentioned that U.S. telco operators have invested less than expected,"" a Paris-based trader said. ""This is clearly a negative read-across for Alcatel's core segment and this should not reassure investors on the company's capacity to improve core business.""Alcatel stock has lost about 20 percent this week, hurt by mounting worries over the outlook for the sector, which has prompted hedge fund short sellers to increase their bets on further losses. According to data from Markit, 11 percent of Alcatel shares are out on loan, up from 6.6 percent at the end of 2013, making it one of the most shorted stocks across Europe.Alcatel's decline on Friday echoed similar losses across the tech sector, with Infineon shares (IFXGn.DE) down 5.5 percent and STMicroelectronics (STM.PA) down 4.8 percent after a sales warning from U.S.-based Microchip (MCHP.O). Microchip said it believes an industry correction has begun and that more bad news is on its way from other chip makers. The company cut its forecast for fiscal second-quarter sales, after experiencing subdued demand in September, especially in China, a month that is normally part of the peak production season for devices ahead of the year-end holidays. The company is seen as an early indicator of demand in the global semiconductor industry because it is a highly diversified supplier of electronic components to some 80,000 customers and because it recognizes revenue when its distributors book sales to customers rather than simply when Microchip itself ships its products.""Microchip noted that it was disappointed with the level of business activity and that sales in September did not materialize according to expectations,"" another Paris-based trader said.

Elliott Management owns a 9.07 percent stake in Juniper Networks as of Nov. 5, according to Thomson Reuters data.Officials at Juniper Networks and Elliott Management were not immediately available for comment. Juniper's Chief Executive Shaygan Kheradpir resigned in November, following a board review of his conduct in a negotiation with a customer. The firms are in talks as a one-month window opens in late January for investors to nominate new directors to the board, the Journal said.

70,"  The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing a breach at network gear maker Juniper Networks Inc on suspicion that a foreign government might be responsible for inserting rogue code that could enable spying, CNN reported on Friday,  citing unnamed U.S. officials.    Juniper on Thursday said it discovered two security issues that can affect products or platforms running the ScreenOS software. It released an emergency security patch, advising customers to update their systems and apply the patched releases with ""the highest priority."" (juni.pr/1msg7WM)CNN reported that U.S. officials are concerned because hackers who took advantage of the flaw could access the network of companies or government agencies that used the Juniper product. The breach is believed to be the work of a foreign government because of the sophistication involved, U.S. officials told CNN.

Technology companies have fiercely resisted limiting the use of encryption or providing special government access, saying it is technically unfeasible and undermines customer privacy.Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton on Saturday called for greater collaboration between Silicon Valley and government codebreakers, as the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, renewed questions about the potential use of encryption by violent extremists.

It is unclear how the Juniper vulnerability was planted or by whom. The company used a cryptography standard developed and promoted by the National Security Agency. But Microsoft Corp  researchers determined in 2007 that the technology was flawed because the output of its random number generator could be predicted, enabling the system's designers or others to break the encryption.Many researchers believe files released by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden show the flaw was a deliberate effort by the spy agency to maintain eavesdropping capabilities.

79,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Juniper Networks Inc said late on Friday it would stop using a piece of security code that analysts believe was developed by the National Security Agency in order to eavesdrop through technology products.The Silicon Valley maker of networking gear said it would ship new versions of security software in the first half of this year to replace those that rely on numbers generated by Dual Elliptic Curve technology.The statement on a blog post came a day after the presentation at a Stanford University conference of research by a team of cryptographers who found that Juniper's code had been changed in multiple ways during 2008 to enable eavesdropping on virtual private network sessions by customers.  Last month, Sunnyvale-based Juniper said it had found and replaced two unauthorized pieces of code that allowed ""back door"" access, which the researchers said had appeared in 2012 and 2014. The 2014 back door was straightforward, said researcher Hovav Shacham of the University of California, San Diego, allowing anyone with the right password to see everything.The 2012 code changed a mathematical constant in Juniper's Netscreen products that should have allowed its author to eavesdrop, according to Shacham and his fellow investigators.  Juniper's initial patch had gotten rid of that constant in Dual Elliptic Curve and replaced it with the version it had been using since 2008.But the academics who studied the code said that while Juniper had not disavowed the 2008 code, it had not explained how that constant was picked or why it was using the widely faulted Dual Elliptic Curve at all.Still another curve constant, quietly provided by the NSA and required for some federal certification, was exposed in documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden as a key to the back door. Until now, the most influential adopter of Dual Elliptic Curve was believed to be RSA, part of storage company EMC, which Reuters reported received a $10-million federal contract to distribute it in a software kit for others.Though the academic team looking at Juniper has not named a suspect in the 2008, 2012 or 2014 changes, 2008 was one year after veteran cryptographers raised questions about Dual Elliptic Curve.A very advanced adversary could have seen how to manipulate Dual EC and in theory managed to insert code through a cooperative or unsuspecting Juniper employee, but the company had not advertised the fact that it was using the formula at all. A more logical suspect, said expert Nicholas Weaver of the International Computer Science Institute, was the NSA, which might have been displaced later by other countries' agencies or top-level hackers in 2012 and 2014.The NSA did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Juniper said it was continuing to investigate. hereIt declined to answer questions from Reuters about the revisions.

The company said in December ScreenOS had been compromised by hackers using a so-called back door in the software.Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican who heads the committee's technology subcommittee and formerly worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, said his initial goal in pursuing the probe was to determine whether government agencies, many of which use Juniper gear, had been compromised by the hackers.But Hurd, a key player in the investigation, said the committee would also probe the origins of the breach. If it turns out that a back door was included at a U.S. government agency's request, he said, that should help change the policy debate. The earliest Juniper back door identified by researchers used a technique widely attributed to the NSA.The NSA did not respond to a request for comment. Juniper declined to comment.U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have long lobbied in vain for legislation that would require technology companies to provide back doors in equipment that use encryption technology. They say they need such access to conduct authorized wiretaps and other types or surveillance. The technology industry has fiercely opposed any such  policy, arguing that back doors could be exploited by criminals or foreign intelligence services. The debate has heated up in the wake of recent attacks by Islamic militants, who make heavy use of digital communications networks.""How do we understand the vulnerabilities that created this problem and ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen in the future?"" Hurd said. ""I don't think the government should be requesting anything that weakens the security of anything that is used by the federal government or American businesses.""Juniper said in December it had found two unauthorized pieces of code inserted into ScreenOS that would have allowed whoever planted them to read email sent over supposedly secure connections known as virtual private networks, or VPNs. After outside researchers picked apart the software patches Juniper issued to fix the problem, they concluded that one back door had been inserted in 2014 and one in 2012. The 2012 version, though, merely changed the formulation of a piece of software known as a random number generator, which is part of most encryption products.The random number generator used in the Juniper products, known as Dual Elliptic Curve, has long been suspected by security professionals of containing a back door engineered by the U.S. National Security Agency.

U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have long lobbied in vain for legislation that would require technology companies to provide back doors in equipment that use encryption technology. They say they need such access to conduct authorized wiretaps and other types or surveillance.The technology industry has fiercely opposed any such  policy, arguing that back doors could be exploited by criminals or foreign intelligence services. The debate has heated up in the wake of recent attacks by Islamic militants, who make heavy use of digital communications networks.""How do we understand the vulnerabilities that created this problem and ensure this kind of thing doesn't happen in the future?"" Hurd said. ""I don't think the government should be requesting anything that weakens the security of anything that is used by the federal government or American businesses."" Juniper said in December it had found two unauthorized pieces of code inserted into ScreenOS that would have allowed whoever planted them to read email sent over supposedly secure connections known as virtual private networks, or VPNs. After outside researchers picked apart the software patches Juniper issued to fix the problem, they concluded that one back door had been inserted in 2014 and one in 2012. The 2012 version, though, merely changed the formulation of a piece of software known as a random number generator, which is part of most encryption products.The random number generator used in the Juniper products, known as Dual Elliptic Curve, has long been suspected by security professionals of containing a back door engineered by the U.S. National Security Agency. Those suspicions were largely confirmed by leaks from former agency contractor Edward Snowden. Juniper said this month it would remove Dual Elliptic Curve entirely in future versions of its products.Juniper has not said how the code got there in the first place. It sells into defense and intelligence agencies, however, and major customers could have requested that the code be modified as part of a contract, former employees told Reuters this month. That is how Dual Elliptic Curve made it into a software kit distributed by security company RSA.The NSA is a logical suspect for the 2008 code insertion, said security researcher Nicholas Weaver of the International Computer Science Institute, while the offenders in both 2012 and 2014 are more likely to have been other countries.
