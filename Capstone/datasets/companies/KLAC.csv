0,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO KLA-Tencor Corp (KLAC.O) reported higher fiscal second-quarter revenue that met analysts' expectations as chipmakers implementing cutting-edge technology bought more process control tools.Buoyed by booming mobile device sales, leading contract manufacturer TSMC (2330.TW) has been preparing new cutting-edge manufacturing lines, boosting demand for KLA-Tencor's products, which are used to measure the effectiveness of complicated manufacturing processes and reduce defects.Top PC chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) has also been setting up and testing its new 14 nanometer lines, due to start production this quarter. KLA-Tencor said in a release on Thursday its second-quarter revenue was $705 million, compared to $673 million a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were expecting second-quarter revenue of $705 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company reported second-quarter net income of $139 million, or 83 cents a share, compared with $107 million, or 63 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share was 85 cents in the second quarter. That compared to 80 cents expected by analysts.Last week, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated to produce 14 nm chips would remain closed due to slow demand for PC chips. But it said other factories at the site would be updated for 14 nm production. Also this month, Intel said it expects capital spending this year to be flat compared to 2013.Shares of KLA-Tencor rose 0.77 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.20 percent at $63.53.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-01-23,KLAC,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 4:57pm EST",KLA-Tencor's second-quarter revenue meets expectations,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-klatencor-results-idUSBREA0M1WQ20140123?type=companyNews

5,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Chip gear maker KLA-Tencor Corp said on Tuesday its bookings in the fiscal fourth quarter were close to $895 million or $900 million, higher than expected and helped by demand from contract chip manufacturers.KLA-Tencor said at an event with investors that in the quarter, which ended in June, contract manufacturers, known as foundries, accounted for two-thirds of its business. While bookings topped expectations, Chief Executive Rick Wallace struck a cautious tone about demand, which tends to be lumpy due to a dwindling number of major customers. ""This is a quarter where we believe we're in a bit of a pause right now in the industry,"" Wallace told analysts. ""Bookings that we got, while strong, were really for foundry, and more for delivery and revenues that we'll see in calendar '15."" The company will provide its full quarterly report later in July.

Chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, Intel and Samsung Electronics are using new manufacturing technology that produces more efficient chips but they are also wrestling with a cooling smartphone market and uncertainty about future demand for their components. Samsung on Tuesday issued unexpectedly weak quarterly earnings guidance, putting it on track for its worst results in two years.Top chip maker Intel is also struggling with slow demand for personal computers.

21,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the ratings for KLA-Tencor  Corporation (KLA-Tencor), including the 'BBB-' long-term Issuer Default Rating  (IDR), on Rating Watch Positive. The action follows the company's announcement  of a planned merger with Lam Research Corp (Lam).  Fitch's rating actions affect $3.7 billion of total debt, including an undrawn  $500 million revolving credit facility. A full list of current ratings follows  at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Watch Positive reflects Fitch's expectations for increased scale and value  within the semiconductor equipment supply chain as a result of combining the  market and technology leader in wafer processing and process control. The deal  also meaningfully strengthens the company's free cash flow (FCF) profile and  provides a credible roadmap for debt reduction and returning credit protection  measures to solid investment grade levels within two years after the deal  closes. Fitch believes the transaction further entrenches the combined company's  importance to customers in solving increasingly complex problems (including  FinFET, multi-patterning, 3D NAND) and enabling the continuation of Moore's Law,  the observation that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles  every two years. The deal occurs at a time when industry consolidation is  picking up, threatening to weaken semiconductor equipment players' bargaining  power with customers. The deal adds Lam's $6.5 billion to $7 billion of revenues to KLA-Tencor's  roughly $3.5 billion to $4 billion, albeit at lower profit margins. The company  believes the combination expands the addressable market and will yield $600  million of annualized revenue synergies by 2020. On a combined basis and pro  forma for $250 million of annualized cost synergies exiting fiscal 2018, Fitch  estimates operating EBITDA margin in the upper 20s (versus a range of high 20s  to low 40s through the cycle presently) and more than $1 billion of recurring  annual FCF.  KLA-Tencor and Lam announced a merger in a deal valuing KLA-Tencor at $10.6  billion. Lam will fund the deal with $5.6 billion of Lam shares, $3.9 billion of  new senior debt, and $1.9 billion of available cash. The company will use a  portion of this cash to repay KLA-Tencor's outstanding term loan at closing  (roughly $600 million by mid-2016). The deal has been approved by both  companies' Board of Directors and requires customary regulatory and shareholder  approvals. Lam and KLA-Tencor expect to close the merger in mid-2016. Pro forma for the debt issuance and term loan repayment, as well as Lam's  repayment of $450 million of senior notes in May 2016, Fitch estimates $8.6  billion of total debt. Fitch expects voluntary debt reduction and operating  EBITDA growth will drive total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) to 2.5x  by the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 from roughly 3.5x at closing. Upon  achieving targeted leverage, Fitch expects the company will resume share  shareholder returns with annual FCF. The ratings on KLA-Tencor continue to be supported by:  --The company's technology leadership resulting in strong market share positions  in the process control market for semiconductors and a growing mix of less  volatile services revenues;  --Secular long-term growth trends, including increased technological complexity  and shortened life cycles for semiconductor products (Moore's Law) and increased  outsourcing to foundry partners; --Solid annual free cash flow (FCF) through a typical cycle, driven by strong  profitability and minimal capital intensity. Lower receivables and inventory  support FCF in a downturn, as was the case in fiscal 2009 when KLA-Tencor  generated positive FCF despite a 40% sales decline.  Fitch's ratings concerns focus on:  --KLA-Tencor's need for substantial ongoing investments in R&D and sales and  marketing, each of which Fitch believes will continue to represent 10% - 20% of  revenues (although capital spending for semiconductor equipment makers is  comparatively low) to maintain technology and market leadership; --Substantial customer concentration with expectations for ongoing customer  consolidation, particularly at the leading edge;  --The highly cyclical demand patterns associated with the semiconductor  equipment market. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for KLA-Tencor's include: --Solid mid-cycle revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a combined basis; --The achievement of $250 million of annualized cost synergies exiting fiscal  2018, resulting in mid-cycle operating EBITDA margin in the high 20s; --More than $1 billion of recurring annual FCF ($250 million of aggregate cash  charges related to achieving cost synergies in fiscal 2017-2018) that is 100%  used for voluntary debt reduction; --Repayment of Lam's $450 million of senior notes due May 2016 at maturity and  use of net proceeds to repay remaining KLA-Term Loan (approximately $600  million) at the merger's closing, resulting in $8.6 billion of total debt; --The company will limit shareholder returns to Lam's current dividend and stock  buybacks offsetting dilution from option exercises until total leverage is 2.5x  in fiscal 2018.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch expects a one-notch upgrade, provided the merger closes as currently  contemplated, including management's commitment to using FCF for debt reduction  and achieving total leverage near 2.5x. Fitch would remove the Watch Positive and stabilize the ratings if the merger  does not close or Fitch anticipates the company will sustain total leverage  closer to 3x. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes KLA-Tencor's liquidity on a standalone basis was solid as of  September 30, 2015 and supported by: --$2.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which Fitch  believes was located in the U.S.; --An undrawn $500 million RCF. $250 million to $750 million of annual FCF also supports liquidity. Total debt at Sept. 30, 2015 was $3.2 billion and Fitch believes consisted of: --$250 million of 2.375% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2017; --$250 million of 3.375% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2019; --$500 million of 4.125% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2021; --$1.25 billion of 4.650% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2024; --$250 million of 5.65% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2034;  --Approximately $700 million of term loans. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates KLA-Tencor as follows: --IDR 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured term loan 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB-';  --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-'.

41,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has removed KLA-Tencor Corporation  (KLA-Tencor) from Rating Watch Positive and affirmed the ratings including the  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is now  Positive. Fitch's actions affect $3.6 billion of total debt, including the $500  million undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF). A full list of ratings follows  at the end of this release. Fitch's actions follow KLA-Tencor's termination of its merger agreement with Lam  Research Corporation (Lam), as the Positive Watch incorporated Fitch's  expectation that it would upgrade KLA-Tencor's ratings to 'BBB+' upon  consummation of the transaction. The affirmation at 'BBB-' reflects the  company's still elevated total leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) on a  standalone basis, while the Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations for  continued deleveraging over the next 12-24 months from a combination of  voluntary debt reduction, which the company articulated it will make a priority,  and profitability growth.  On Oct. 6, 2016, KLA-Tencor announced the termination of its merger agreement  with Lam due to the U.S. Department of Justice advising KLA-Tencor and Lam it  would not continue with a consent decree the parties had been negotiating. The  deal would have combined technology and market share leaders in the process and  process control segments of the semiconductor capital equipment industry,  consolidating leading edge technology and research and development (R&D)  platforms critical to the continuation of Moore's Law.  Fitch believes credit protection measures remain consistent with a 'BBB-' rating  following the company's leveraged recapitalization in fiscal 2015. Fitch  estimates total leverage of 2.8x for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, versus  3.8x for the prior fiscal year, due mostly to profitability growth but also a  $117.5 million prepayment on the term loans. Solid revenue growth, driven by  increasing complexity of yield challenges and higher profitability from  operating leverage and restructuring actions drove solid FCF of $381.7 million  (Fitch defined as after dividends), enabling debt reduction with domestic cash  flow. Fitch expects continued solid top-line performance through the cycle, driven by  secular trends and likely share gains over time, given competitive advantages  related to KLA-Tencor's R&D scale, installed base, and cumulative intellectual  property (IP) portfolio. Profitability should remain cyclical, given operating  leverage and sales mix variance, but structurally higher due to restructuring.  In the near term, operating EBITDA margin should compress to the mid-30% range  from a Fitch estimated 37% for fiscal 2016, due to restarting stalled projects  and rebuilding certain administrative organizations depleted in anticipation of  the merger.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Commitment to Technology Leadership: Fitch believes KLA-Tencor's commitment to  maintaining technology leadership has resulted in R&D scale advantages,  significant installed base and substantial cumulative IP. The company's  technology leadership should continue to drive strong and growing market share  positions in the process control market for semiconductors and higher mix of  less volatile services revenues;  --Secular Growth Trends: Fitch believes secular long-term growth trends will  drive low-single-digit revenue growth for the semiconductor capital equipment  industry. Ever-increasing technological complexity (including FinFET,  multi-patterning, 3D NAND), short life cycles for certain semiconductor markets  products and increased outsourcing to foundry partners will drive demand,  although within a cyclical context; --FCF Through the Cycle: Fitch expects $250 million to $500 million of annual  FCF through a typical cycle, driven by strong profitability from operating  leverage in an upturn, working capital liquidation in a downturn, and  structurally minimal capital intensity. Fitch also expects positive FCF in a  severe downturn, as KLA-Tencor demonstrated by generating positive FCF in fiscal  2009, despite a 40% sales decline.  --Substantial R&D Intensity: Fitch expects KLA-Tencor's R&D intensity will  remain significant and represent 17%-18% as a percentage of revenue. In the  short term, the company can flex investments, but Fitch believes R&D is largely  fixed over the longer term and is critical to maintaining its pace of  innovation. KLA-Tencor spends more in annual R&D than the revenue of many of its  competitors, which has resulted in substantial cumulative R&D and a meaningful  competitive advantage.  --Substantial and Growing Customer Concentration: Fitch expects spending on the  leading edge, which continues to be exponentially costly, will remain  consolidated and has the potential to consolidate further. Fitch believes  KLA-Tencor will continue to derive a significant amount of revenue from  capital-spending leaders driving Moore's Law (Intel Corp., Samsung, and Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited), resulting in top-line volatility.  However, consolidation among customers below the top 3 could exacerbate  volatility and constrain KLA-Tencor's pricing power. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for KLA-Tencor include: --Low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth through the cycle, supported by  secular trends, growing backlog, expectations for share gains and growing  services business. Fitch expects mid-single-digit revenue growth in the near  term, supported by strong orders exiting fiscal 2016, although industry  forecasts for negative semiconductor growth in calendar 2017 could result in  more cautious capital spending; --Operating EBITDA margins contract to mid-30% range in fiscal 2017, due to  increased R&D and general and administrative (G&A) investments following the  merger termination, offsetting higher revenue levels. Through the cycle, Fitch  expects operating EBITDA margins will range from the low- to mid-30% range; --Dividends grow 10% annually, while share repurchases are limited to offsetting  dilution;  --KLAC uses domestic annual FCF, which Fitch estimates at $100 million to $150  million based upon sales mix and historical domestic liquidity patterns, to  repay the term loan, resulting in total leverage in the company's target range  of 2x-2.5x in the fiscal 2018-2019 period. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions could occur if: --KLAC continues using FCF for debt reduction, resulting in Fitch's near-term  expectations for mid-cycle total leverage below 2.5x;  --Fitch expects mid-cycle operating EBITDA margin above 35%, reinforcing the  company's technology leadership and pricing power within the context of  escalating investment levels to support Moore's Law. The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if: --Operating performance underperforms meaningfully due to competitive concerns,  resulting in FCF below Fitch's expected forecasted range of $250 million to $500  million;  --KLAC fails to use FCF for debt reduction resulting in total leverage sustained  near 3x. LIQUIDITY Fitch expects liquidity will remain adequate and as of June 30, 2016 was  supported by: --$2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, although  $1.7 billion was located outside the U.S.;  --Undrawn $500 million RCF expiring Nov. 2019. Fitch also expects $250 million to $500 million of annual FCF to support  liquidity. Total debt at June 30, 2016 was $3.1 billion and consisted of: --$250 million of 2.375% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2017; --$250 million of 3.375% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2019; --$500 million of 4.125% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2021; --$1.25 billion of 4.65% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2024; --$250 million of 5.65% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2034; and  --$576 million term loans due 2019, for which there are no scheduled payments in  fiscal 2017-2018, since KLA-Tencor made $117.5 million of principal prepayments  in fiscal 2016.
