That gives weight to the opinion of most central bank officials who agreed that economic growth would climb to a healthier pace and the labor market would strengthen, according to minutes from the Fed's April 28-29 meeting.Fed officials believed it would be premature to raise rates in June, even though most felt the U.S. economy was set to rebound from a dismal start to the year.Data measuring the growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector in May is due at 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT) and 15 minutes later the National Association of Realtors data is expected to show that sales of used homes increased last month.""There is a malaise in the market as investors re-adjust their expectations of a Fed hike,"" said Andrew Barber, chief market strategist at Eagleview Capital in Delaware.
