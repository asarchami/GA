12,"   By Nicola Leske, Nadia Damouni and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Anti-virus and security software maker Symantec Corp, which recently fired its chief executive amid declining sales and fierce competition, is in the process of hiring banks to help advise on strategy and defend against possible activist investors, according to several people familiar with the matter.The $14 billion company, best known for its Norton anti-virus software, has been interviewing top Wall Street banks in recent weeks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, the people said on Friday.JPMorgan, which helped Symantec in the past when the company was the target of potential activism, is expected to land a role as Symantec's financial adviser, although a mandate has yet to be finalized, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions are not public.Symantec has decided to hire a bank as it is worried that its recent turmoil and management shake-up could potentially attract activist investors, the people said. Such investors buy shares in a company with the aim of making management changes.Some of the large activist funds have already started examining the company as a potential target, the people added.A representative for Symantec declined to comment on specifics but said Symantec commonly hired financial advisers to help the company with its business. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.A number of well-known technology companies, such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co and Yahoo Inc, have been targeted by activist investors in recent years as the sector undergoes rapid change and old technology companies sit on large piles of cash. Symantec is currently searching for a new CEO after it surprised the market on March 20 by firing Chief Executive Steve Bennett, who was on the job for less than two years.Bennett had been brought in to turn around the faltering company in July 2012, but the board felt he was not moving quickly enough. Revenue continued to shrink amid fierce competition from smaller, more nimble rivals such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Check Point Software Technologies, the people said.Symantec's shares have lost 17.5 percent over the past 12 months, compared with a 1.5 percent rise in the NASDAQ Composite Index. The stock dropped as much as 14 percent on March 21, the day after news of the CEO departure.""We believe the recent price action of Symantec could attract the interest of activists who could nominate new board members, which could be supported by existing holders,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg said in a research note on Thursday. Activist investors circled the company in the past.In 2010, the company faced pressure from investors, including Ralph Whitworth's Relational Investors LLC, which pushed the software company to split its storage and security businesses, Reuters reported at the time.Whitworth, who had a position in Symantec and met with company management to discuss strategy, decided not to launch a public campaign after stock prices rebounded later in 2010.A recurring theme with Symantec among investors and analysts is whether the company should look at selling itself, or unlock value by separating its businesses. Symantec entered the data storage business with its $13.5 billion acquisition of enterprise storage company Veritas in 2005, a move widely seen as not having reaped the expected benefits.Last year, speculation also swirled that Symantec might offload Altiris, an IT management and software business it bought in 2007 for $830 million.Analysts have said that Symantec would benefit more from selling off assets within its consumer, storage and server businesses than looking to sell the whole company, which would be unlikely due to its size.Based on a sum of the parts, Symantec could be worth $27 a share, or $19 billion, RBC's Hedberg said. The shares are currently trading around $20 on the Nasdaq.""Overall, we think Symantec would benefit from a focus on enterprise security and compliance where the company could differentiate through additional M&A,"" Hedberg said.He added that while private equity could be an option, the company's current market and a control premium would make it a very large transaction and thus very unlikely.(Reporting by Nicola Leske, Nadia Damouni and Soyoung Kim; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Dan Grebler)",2014-04-04,SYMC,"Fri Apr 4, 2014 | 5:24pm EDT","Exclusive: Symantec to hire banks for advice, activism defense - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-symantec-idUSBREA331KM20140404?type=companyNews
13,"   By Nadia Damouni and Nicola Leske | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The abrupt firing of Symantec Corp Chief Executive Steve Bennett last month is attracting activist investors and private equity firms to the U.S. security software maker, in a development that could potentially lead to its breakup or sale, sources familiar with the situation said.Activist investors, including ValueAct Capital, are examining the company's prospects and may decide to build up stakes to agitate for change, the sources said. ValueAct declined to comment.At the same time, a number of private equity firms, including Bain Capital, Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle Group LP, have started assessing the possibility of a leveraged buyout of all or parts of Symantec, the sources said. Bain did not respond to requests for comment, while the rest of the private equity firms declined to comment.Symantec, best known for its Norton antivirus software, is worth about $14 billion at its current stock price. It declined to comment.Some private equity firms have approached Symantec in recent weeks to discuss deal possibilities, but the sources said there are no serious conversations going on for now. They cautioned that it was too early to tell if those conversations will get any traction.It was also not clear whether any activist had built up a stake in the company. Sources said at least two major activist investors had decided against building up positions in the company because they thought there were limited profits to be had from it.Before the company enters into a dialogue with any potential buyers, Symantec's board and management, led by interim CEO Michael Brown, are trying to chart a business plan and find a full-time chief executive, the sources said.Symantec has hired executive search specialist Russell Reynolds Associates to look for a new CEO, a source close to the matter said. Russell Reynolds declined to comment.Earlier this month, sources had said that Symantec was close to hiring JPMorgan Chase & Co for advice on strategy and to defend against potential activist investors. JPMorgan has since been enlisted as its financial adviser, the sources said. The bank declined to comment.Symantec's board is expected to discuss options for the company at a meeting this month ahead of the release of company earnings scheduled for May 8, the sources said.The external interest, including from typically vocal parties such as activist shareholders, in the company means that Symantec may have to act quickly.Symantec, which also offers data storage products, has seen revenue growth turn negative in recent quarters, unlike the rest of the security software market, which is growing at least 10 percent to 15 percent annually.The slowdown is partly due to eroding PC sales, affecting demand for its software, which often comes bundled with new computers. It has failed to gain a strong footing in the market for mobile security. It has also been lagging smaller, more nimble rivals such as FireEye Inc, Palo Alto Networks Inc and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd that are focused on network security, one of the hottest areas in that market.Symantec's shares have lost about 17 percent over the past 12 months, compared with a 26 percent rise in the S&P 500 Systems Software index. The stock dropped as much as 14 percent on March 21, the day after news of Bennett's departure. He was the second Symantec CEO in two years to have been shown the door.SUM OF PARTS Analysts have said that Symantec would benefit from selling off assets within its consumer, storage and server businesses. They calculate that its individual businesses could add up to $25 to $28 per share, giving it a value of around $16 billion to $19 billion.Symantec's stock was trading close to $20 on Tuesday.Although some analysts said the company would be too large for a private equity firm to buy, the sources said buyout shops are examining that possibility. Since buying the entire company would require an equity check of $4 billion to $5 billion, they might look to pool resources, the sources said.Private equity firms are also looking at the possibility of breaking up Symantec into smaller pieces, some of which may also be attractive to industry peers, according to the sources.The storage business, for example, could be attractive to companies such as NetApp Inc and IBM Corp, one of the sources said.NetApp was not immediately available for comment. IBM declined to comment.Symantec's desktop management unit Altiris, which it bought in 2007 for $830 million and was considered tangential to its main business, could also be a potential asset divestiture, analysts have said.Separating some of the businesses to sell may not be easy, however, as they have been integrated into the company and may have a low cost basis, which would trigger a hefty tax bill, the sources said.(Additional reporting by Soyoung Kim and Greg Roumeliotis; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Lisa Shumaker and Jonathan Oatis)",2014-04-15,SYMC,"Tue Apr 15, 2014 | 4:34pm EDT","Exclusive: Turmoil at Symantec luring activists, buyers - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-symantec-strategy-idUSBREA3E1CK20140415?type=companyNews

26,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON  BOSTON China has excluded U.S.-based Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) and Russia's Kaspersky Lab from a list of approved anti-virus software vendors, according to a Chinese media report suggesting Beijing is expanding efforts to limit use of foreign technology.The state-controlled People's Daily reported the news early Sunday on its English Twitter feed, saying that the government's procurement agency ""has excluded Symantec & Kaspersky"" from a list of security software suppliers.A second tweet said that government procurement office had approved the use five anti-virus software brands, all from China: Qihoo 360 Technology Co QIHU.N, Venustech, CAJinchen, Beijing Jiangmin and Rising.Officials with Symantec could not be reached for comment. Kaspersky spokesman Alejandro Arango said: ""We are investigating and engaging in conversations with Chinese authorities about this matter. It is too premature to go into any additional details at this time.""  The report comes after Beijing late last week updated a public website that lists technology vendors whose goods are approved use for use by the nation's massive central government. It was not immediately clear if agencies were being advised to avoid other non-Chinese products.The report is the latest sign that Beijing is intent on promoting use of domestic information technology products after leaks from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden raised concerns about foreign surveillance programs. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have also risen this year after the United States indicted Chinese soldiers on cyber espionage charges. Symantec last month said it was in talks with authorities following reports that China had banned use of one of its products, data loss prevention software.

33,"   By Gerry Shih | BEIJING, Sept 4  BEIJING, Sept 4 U.S.-based Symantec Corp  has continued to do business with Chinese government agencies despite media reports last month suggesting that China has blacklisted the firm's security software in favour of domestic products, said a top executive.Adrian Jones, a former Oracle executive who was named Symantec's senior vice president for the Asia region in June, dismissed reports of a government ban as ""noise"", saying he expected positive sales growth in China this year, potentially outpacing the country's economic expansion.""We still have GDP growth of 6 to 7 percent a year, so if we can grow more than that, double that, that'd be great,"" Jones said in an interview at Symantec's Beijing offices this week. ""I expect good growth in China this year.""Symantec's status in China came under scrutiny in August after the state-owned China Daily newspaper reported that the government's central procurement office had removed foreign vendors from its list of approved antivirus software due to security concerns. Jones said the company had not received ""any official notice that we're banned from anything"", and had maintained business deals with a broad array of state-owned firms including nearly all of the country's telecom providers ""in some shape or form.""Symantec, the world's fourth-largest software firm, does not break out its China revenues, but said last month that its Asia-Pacific and Japan sales picked up slightly on a quarter-to-quarter basis after falling steeply for four consecutive quarters in part due to poor performance and currency fluctuations in Japan. Revenues in Asia, which were down 2 percent year-over-year, represented $300 million out of the company's $1.74 billion in quarterly sales.Jones reiterated the company's forecast for flat revenue growth worldwide this year, but said he expected to expand the footprint in Greater China, where Symantec now employs 1,400 employees, or 7 percent of its global workforce, in nine cities. As a whole Symantec has been roiled by management turmoil amidst slumping revenues. In March, Symantec replaced its chief executive for the second time in less than two years, prompting talk among activist investors and private equity firms of a potential breakup or sale.The company meanwhile has taken criticism for failing to quickly roll out new products in the face of competition from smaller firms like Fireye Inc and increasingly Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd, the Beijing-based company that went public in New York in 2011 and is considered a fast-growing rival in the Chinese market.Jones said the rising Chinese contenders offer piecemeal solutions for areas such as antivirus software but still cannot offer comprehensive service that covers a large corporation's mobile devices, emails, information storage and network security.""People may say we haven't done enough innovation, but we've got 12 products between now and the end of the year that we're launching,"" Jones said.

40,"   By Soham Chatterjee and Arathy S Nair  Norton antivirus maker Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) will split into two publicly traded companies, one selling security software and the other providing data management, potentially making itself more attractive to suitors.Symantec's revenue growth has lagged the rest of the security software market in recent quarters, with slowing PC sales hurting demand for the company's software, which often comes bundled with new computers.The Mountainview, California-based company has also failed to establish a strong foothold in the mobile security market.Symantec's split essentially reverses its $13.5 billion acquisition of storage company Veritas Software a decade ago and follows a trend of companies splitting themselves to focus on faster growing businesses.""Symantec has been a headache name for tech investors over the last decade. It's nice to see the board make a decision that strategically makes sense for the company and its investors,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.Symantec's break-up comes during a banner year for spinoffs. More than 60 spinoffs are expected to be completed this year, more than in any year since 2000, according to Spin-Off Research, a subscription service for hedge funds and institutional investors.

Online auction company eBay Inc (EBAY.O) said last week it would spin off its electronics payment service PayPal. A number of potential buyers, including Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and NetApp Inc (NTAP.O), will likely show interest in  each of the companies Symantec splits into, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski said in a note.FBR's Ives said the ""cash-cow"" storage business could attract interest from private equity players. ""Post split, you have two companies, one focused more on cash flow and one focused more on revenue. So, put together, can it help revenue? I think it can, certainly, but you have to execute,"" investor Tim Ghriskey told Reuters.Symantec's security business generated revenue of $4.2 billion in fiscal 2014, while the data management business, which provides data backup, recovery and management services, generated $2.5 billion.Michael Brown will continue as chief executive of Symantec and Thomas Seifert as chief financial officer, the company said.    Brown took over as interim CEO in March after his predecessor, Steve Bennett, was fired.  The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of December 2015, Symantec said.

41,"  (Adds analyst, investor comments, background)By Soham Chatterjee and Arathy S NairOct 9 Norton antivirus maker Symantec Corp  will split into two publicly traded companies, one selling security software and the other providing data management, potentially making itself more attractive to suitors.Symantec's revenue growth has lagged the rest of the security software market in recent quarters, with slowing PC sales hurting demand for the company's software, which often comes bundled with new computers.The Mountainview, California-based company has also failed to establish a strong foothold in the mobile security market.Symantec's split essentially reverses its $13.5 billion acquisition of storage company Veritas Software a decade ago and follows a trend of companies splitting themselves to focus on faster growing businesses.""Symantec has been a headache name for tech investors over the last decade. It's nice to see the board make a decision that strategically makes sense for the company and its investors,""     FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. Symantec's break-up comes during a banner year for spinoffs. More than 60 spinoffs are expected to be completed this year, more than in any year since 2000, according to Spin-Off Research, a subscription service for hedge funds and institutional investors.Hewlett-Packard Co said on Monday it would separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations.Online auction company eBay Inc said last week it would spin off its electronics payment service PayPal.A number of potential buyers, including Cisco Systems Inc  and NetApp Inc, will likely show interest in  each of the companies Symantec splits into, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski said in a note. FBR's Ives said the ""cash-cow"" storage business could attract interest from private equity players.""Post split, you have two companies, one focused more on cash flow and one focused more on revenue. So, put together, can it help revenue? I think it can, certainly, but you have to execute,"" investor Tim Ghriskey told Reuters.Symantec's security business generated revenue of $4.2 billion in fiscal 2014, while the data management business, which provides data backup, recovery and management services, generated $2.5 billion. Michael Brown will continue as chief executive of Symantec and Thomas Seifert as chief financial officer, the company said.Brown took over as interim CEO in March after his predecessor, Steve Bennett, was fired.The spinoff is expected to be completed by the end of December 2015, Symantec said.Shares in the new data management business will be distributed tax-free to existing Symantec shareholders.

43,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Oct 10 (IFR) - The investment-grade bond market has been slammed with another wave of bondholder-unfriendly news, with spin-off announcements from Hewlett-Packard and Symantec and activist pressure on EMC Corp to follow suit.The three tech companies saw spreads on some of their bonds quoted anywhere from 15bp to 40bp wider this week, as investors scrambled to re-evaluate their views on the credits, while at the same time wrestling with a broad sell-off in asset classes.The flurry of break-up news has demonstrated how rapidly the investment-grade bond market is becoming a minefield of deteriorating credits and event risk.""We have found where new risk lies, and it's among some of the biggest names in the investment-grade market,"" said Scott Kimball, senior portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida & Habacht, and part of BMO Global Asset Management.""In just the past few weeks the risk profile for eBay has materially changed, as it has for AbbVie and Hewlett-Packard.""Last week, eBay gapped out as much as 37bp on news that it would spin off PayPal and turn what is left of the company into little more than a debt-raising cash cow for shareholders.Investors are struggling with the conflicting demands of picking credits based on fundamentals, but still needing to put record amounts of inflows to work.Close to US$7bn poured into investment-grade bond funds for the week ended October 8, taking the year's total inflow to US$65.2bn. At the same time, however, M&A activity, including spin-offs, is at its highest point since 2007. Investors have found themselves holding credits in an illiquid market that have suddenly gone from a good idea to a bad one.""Companies like eBay, Hewlett-Packard and some of the healthcare names are moving away from addressing the strength of their capital structure in order to put more emphasis on corporate structure, and they're doing it even if they have to throw bondholders under the bus,"" said Kimball.According to S&P there have been 57 spin-offs by non-financial corporates in the US so far this year, about a 73% increase over the 33 in 2012 and compared with 44 in 2013.Since August last year, S&P has lowered or placed on CreditWatch negative about 30% of those companies that initiated spin-offs this year, and raised the rating on only 16% of them. ""Spin-offs often come at a price to creditors because they weaken the business profile of the parent entity or reduce cashflow without a corresponding reduction in debt,"" S&P wrote.HURTFUL TIMES Recent weeks have been especially hurtful to bonds.Symantec's 3.95% 2022s gapped out by 40bp to 199bp on news that it intends to separate its core personal and enterprise security businesses from its storage and data back-up divisions. EMC Corp saw its 3.375% 2023s widen about 15bp, to 130bp, after activist investor Elliott Management Corp sent its first letter to the data storage products maker, urging it to spin off its prized VMware virtualisation software unit or pursue other merger opportunities.Hewlett-Packard's 2041s were 34bp wider at 228bp on the week after announcing it would split in two, with one half, HP Inc, holding its printing and computer businesses and the other, HP Enterprise, having the servers, storage financing and networking business.HP was vague about key issues that would affect the credit rating of both parts. It said it wanted both new companies to be rated investment-grade, but would not give much detail on how its cash and debt would be split up.""What we are hearing from investors is that no one really knows what the two new companies will look like and so they are hesitant right now to make a call,"" said Jordan Chalfin, senior technology analyst at CreditSights.No matter how HP splits up its cash and debt among the two new entities, there are credit negatives for both, said Chalfin. ""HP Inc will be focused on returning cash to shareholders, whereas Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will be more focused on M&A,"" he said.Still, others also see opportunities.Ryan Preclaw, credit strategist at Barclays, believes spin-offs can often provide investors with good investment opportunities.""Investment-grade ""RemainCo"" surviving entities from spin-offs have outperformed the US Corporate index by almost 100bp in the 18 months following the announced split of their companies,"" he wrote recently. He sees value in HP's shorter-dated bonds such as the 2018s and 2019s, which are likely to be tendered.

JPMorgan Chase & Co has been advising Symantec on the potential split as well as the possible sale of the entire company, according to the sources.Symantec, EMC and JPMorgan declined to comment, while NetApp could not immediately be reached for comment.Earlier on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources, that Symantec had, ""in recent weeks"", contacted private equity firms and possible industry bidders about buying Veritas.

58,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Joseph MennApril 14 When a cyber security breach hits the news, those most closely involved often have incentive to play up the sophistication of the attack.If hackers are portrayed as well-funded geniuses, victims look less vulnerable, security firms can flog their products and services, and government officials can push for tougher regulation or seek more money for cyber defenses.But two deeply researched reports being released this week underscore the less-heralded truth: the vast majority of hacking attacks are successful because employees click on links in tainted emails, companies fail to apply available patches to known software flaws, or technicians do not configure systems properly.These conclusions will be in the minds of executives attending the world's largest technology security conference next week in San Francisco, a conference named after lead sponsor RSA, the security division of EMC Corp.In the best-known annual study of data breaches, a report from Verizon Communications Inc to be released on Wednesday found that more than two-thirds of the 290 electronic espionage cases it learned about in 2014 involved phishing, the security industry's term for trick emails.Because so many people click on tainted links or attachments, sending phishing emails to just 10 employees will get hackers inside corporate gates 90 percent of the time, Verizon found.""There's an overarching pattern,"" said Verizon scientist Bob Rudis. Attackers use phishing to install malware and steal credentials from employees, then they use those credentials to roam through networks and access programs and files, he said. Verizon's report includes its own business investigations and data from 70 other contributors, including law enforcement. It found that while major new vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed  are being used by hackers within hours of their announcement, more attacks last year exploited patchable vulnerabilities dating from 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.Another annual cyber report, to be released on Tuesday by Symantec Corp, found that state-sponsored spies also used phishing techniques because they work and because the less-sophisticated approach drew less scrutiny from defenders.Once inside a system, however, the spies turned fancy, writing customized software to evade detection by whatever security programs the target has installed, Symantec said.""Once I'm in, I can do what I need to,"" said Robert Shaker, an incident response manager at Symantec. The report drew on data from 57 million sensors in 157 countries and territories. Another troubling trend Symantec found involves the use of ""ransomware,"" in which hackers encrypt a computer's files and promise to release them only if the user pays a ransom. (Some 80 percent of the time, they do not decrypt the files even then.)The new twist comes from hackers who encrypt files, including those inside critical infrastructure facilities, but do not ask for anything. The mystery is why: Shaker said it is not clear whether the attackers are securing the information for resale to other spies or potential saboteurs, or whether they plan on making their own demands in the future.RSA CONFERENCE  At next week's RSA Conference, protecting critical infrastructure systems under increasing attack will be a major theme. Another theme will be the need for more sharing of ""intelligence"" about emerging threats - between the public and private sectors, within the security industry, and within certain industries.While many of the biggest breaches of the past two years involved retailers, the healthcare industry has figured heavily in recent months. Former FBI futurist Marc Goodman said that both spies and organized criminals are likely at work, the former seeking leverage to use in recruiting informants and the latter looking to cash in on medical and insurance fraud.Verizon's researchers said that to be most effective, information-sharing would have to be essentially in real time, from machine to machine, and cross multiple sectors, a daunting proposition.Another section of the Verizon report could help security executives make the case for bigger budgets. The researchers produced the first analysis of the actual costs of breaches derived from insurance claims, instead of survey data.Verizon said the best indicator of the cost of an incident is the number of records compromised, and that the cost rises logarithmically, flattening as the size of the breach rises.According to the new Verizon model, the loss of 100,000 records should cost roughly $475,000 on average, while 100 million lost records should cost about $8.85 million.Though the harder data will be welcome to number-crunchers, spending more money cannot guarantee complete protection against attacks.The RSA Conference floor will feature vendors touting next-generation security products and anomaly-spotting big-data analytics.

""For shareholders, it's tax free, which is a huge advantage for them."" Reuters reported last week that Symantec had been exploring a sale of its Veritas information management and storage unit or of the whole company. But interest from potential buyers has been limited because of a tax burden associated with splitting the company.The company is planning to start trading as two companies by Jan 4, 2016. Symantec will separate its business focused on corporate and consumer security software, which had $4.2 billion in revenue last year, from Veritas, which is smaller, with about $2.5 billion in revenue.

The Reuters report said Symantec had been looking into a sale of Veritas for several months and had approached NetApp Inc, EMC Corp and several private equity firms to gauge their interest.Shareholders have been pushing for a break-up with Veritas, which Symantec acquired in 2004 for $13.5 billion, for many years, Chief Financial Officer Thomas Siefert said. ""It didn't surprise them, it was a 'finally' type of statement,"" he said, referring to shareholders' reaction to the spinoff. Brown, who took over as Symantec CEO in 2014 after joining the company as a Veritas board member in 2004, will remain in his role.

Symantec has been seeking buyers for Veritas for several months but interest from potential buyers had been limited because of a tax burden associated with splitting the company. Symantec had been planning separate its business focused on corporate and consumer security software, which had $4.2 billion in revenue last year, from Veritas, which has about $2.5 billion in revenue. It announced the tax-free spinoff last October.Investor pressure has been building on legacy technology companies such as Symantec to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses, whether it's through corporate breakups or divestitures.In addition to Symantec, Hewlett-Packard Co and eBay Inc have announced major breakups and spinoffs, and more could be on the way.

72,"   By Nivedita Bhattacharjee | MUMBAI, July 15  MUMBAI, July 15 Global cybersecurity company TaaSera launched its India business on Thursday, joining a growing number of cybersecurity firms eyeing India as a growth frontier amid an expected doubling of online crime in the country.Silicon Valley-based TaaSera said India, host to some of the world's biggest IT service companies, was vulnerable to cybercrimes on account of its growing economic progress.Increasing smartphone use, online transactions and the government's ""Digital India"" initiative are opening up opportunities in an industry that is worth $77 billion globally.The number of cyber crimes in India may reach 300,000 in 2015, almost double the level of last year, according to an ASSOCHAM-Mahindra SSG study conducted this year.That compares better than the number of reported instances in developed nations. A PWC study of 2014 said the average number of security incidents detected in each of the 500 organisations they surveyed in 2013 was 135 about per organization.However, industry experts say the number of crimes reported in India is not a good measure for comparison, given the absence of disclosure laws.""The point is India does not have public disclosure as law, unlike in the United States and many parts of the western world,"" said Ranndeep Chonker, director of global solutions at FireEye. ""A lot of information about such breaches gets swept under the carpet.""U.S.-based FireEye Inc, which works with both the government and companies, said it was on track to spend $50 million on its India R&D centre for the five years to 2018. ""The amount of breaches in the western world is maybe two times, or three times, of that in India. But India is the IT back office of the world. If that image suffers, of our capabilities of IT and ITES, there's a lot to lose,"" Chonker said.The global IT security market is estimated to be worth $77 billion in 2015 and growing at more than 8 percent annually, according to Indian industry body NASSCOM.The group recently tied up with security company Symantec Corp to train Indians to deal with cyber threats. They want to increase the number of trained cyber security professionals in the country to a million from 63,200.""The threats today are not national, they are global,"" said TaaSera chief executive C. Scott-Hartz.""There are attacks coming from all over the world but there are particularly significant financial attacks coming out of Russia. Significant attacks on government facilities coming out of China. That is true for both of our countries,"" he said, referring to the United States and India.

The deal, the biggest U.S. leveraged buyout this year, will give Symantec much-needed funds to compete in the cyber security market with companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Kaspersky Labs.Shares of Symantec, which also reported weak quarterly results on Tuesday, fell as much as 6 percent.Symantec has been facing headwinds as weak PC sales hurt demand for its security software, which comes bundled with computers.

84,"   By Koh Gui Qing  Antivirus software maker Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) said on Tuesday it will receive $1 billion less in cash for its data storage unit Veritas from Carlyle Group LP (CG.O), cutting the price of the biggest leveraged buyout of 2015 after debt backing the deal failed to sell. Citing unspecified ""uncertainties"" since the deal was struck in August, Symantec said that the purchase price was reduced to $7.4 billion ""in a difficult environment"" from the $8 billion it originally agreed to in August. Neither Symantec nor Carlyle would comment on the exact reasons for the reduction. However, the renegotiation came after banks struggled to syndicate a $5.6 billion debt package backing the deal, amid turmoil in the leveraged finance markets.Veritas' performance deteriorated since Symantec inked its deal with Carlyle last summer, giving Carlyle more ammunition to renegotiate, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. The deal was still expected to close on Jan. 29. Under the revised terms, Veritas will retain $400 million in offshore cash, versus the $200 million originally agreed. Symantec will keep a $400 million equity interest in Veritas and receive $6.6 billion in cash, translating into $5.3 billion in after-tax proceeds. That amount is $1 billion less than originally agreed.Veritas is a provider of backup and recovery software. Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc warned in November that pricing pressures, the shift to cloud-based storage and other alternative storage platforms could result in Veritas underperforming the overall market.

92,"   By Freya Berry | BERLIN  BERLIN As anxiety over a slowing global economy grows, private equity players are looking to swoop on distressed assets but are fearful that funding could dry up.A record number of delegates from private equity firms and investors turned out this week for four days of networking at SuperReturn in Berlin, the industry's main annual gathering. At first glance a number of glitzy afterparties suggested the good times were continuing to roll as they have in the years following the financial crisis.But faced with upheaval in global asset markets, political uncertainty and a tougher debt environment, the sense was that the music could soon stop.  ""It's not doom and gloom among the GPs (general partners),"" one large investor said, referring to the private equity companies whose job it is to buy businesses.""But they're not popping the champagne. People are trying to get fundraising done now before the environment changes,"" he added.  The plunge in oil and gas prices weighed on the minds of many. One executive who was raising money for a major oil investment vehicle told Reuters that the fund was considering cutting its target size due to caution from potential investors.He said this was frustrating at a time when a mass of assets are coming to the market as energy companies seek to cut their losses.    And the oil price plunge is also being felt in efforts to raise money for investment.""Saudi Arabia is dead,"" for fundraising, one placement agent said. DEBT TROUBLES  Funds said that a backlog in U.S. debt markets was limiting deal flow. Private equity firms often takes on debt to help boost their firepower and potential returns when they sell out, typically four to six years later.But concerns over record asset price multiples, and the hefty debt packages that they entail, are finally starting to tell. There were just 51 leveraged buyout deals globally last year, the lowest since 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data. The biggest leveraged buyout of 2015, Carlyle's (CG.O) $8 billion purchase of backup software provider Veritas from Symantec Corp (SYMC.O), saw its price cut to $7.4 billion after banks struggled to syndicate a $5.6 billion debt package backing the deal.   Debt-to-EBITDA multiples for the United States and Europe slipped last year, averaging 5.51 times EBITDA, against 5.85 times the year before. That was the first time multiples have come down since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Those funds that can find capital were positioning themselves for an expected boom in distressed asset investments, spurred by the collapse in oil prices and slowing global growth.""Any market dislocation is a good opportunity. Companies exposed to the energy supply chain ‎where the market reaction has been overdone, like some services plays, are attractive,"" James Brocklebank, Managing Partner at buyout firm Advent International, told Reuters.  Other big hitters said lessons from the 2008-2009 financial crisis meant they had a clearer strategy of how to play the distressed asset market. ""One of the great lessons from the recession is to buy your or someone else's distressed debt back and make a lot of money,"" said David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of Carlyle (CG.O).Others looking at opportunities outside the distressed sectors saw a survival-of-the-fittest dynamic in the rest of the market, hoping that a tougher fundraising environment and thinner debt markets would help winnow out rivals. ""We're feeling more bullish. The pricing seems to be getting better because leverage is tighter, so the competition is not so intense,"" Joseph Landy, co-Chief Executive at U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus, told Reuters.

99,"   By Dustin Volz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Hackers who stole $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank have been linked to another cyber attack, this time on a bank in the Philippines, in addition to the 2014 hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, cyber security company Symantec Corp said in a blog post on Thursday.If confirmed, the Philippines incident would represent the fourth known cyber attack against a bank involving fraudulent SWIFT messages. SWIFT, as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is known, this week urged banks to bolster their security, saying it was aware of multiple attacks.Banks use secure SWIFT messages for issuing payment instructions to each other.Symantec said it had identified three pieces of malware that were used in limited targeted attacks against financial institutions in Southeast Asia. (symc.ly/1sRNHc7) Symantec said the attackers were able to infiltrate the bank's computers but there was no evidence of money being stolen. One of the malicious programs has been previously associated with a hacking group known as Lazarus, which has been linked to the devastating attack on Sony's Hollywood studio in 2014. The U.S. government publicly blamed the Sony hack on North Korea.""There is a pretty hard connection now to the Sony attacks and the actor behind them"" and the Bangladesh heist, Eric Chien, technical director at Symantec, said in an interview.Chien said that if North Korea was responsible for the hacks on banks via the SWIFT messaging network it would represent the first known episode of a nation-state stealing money in a cyber attack. Security firm BAE Systems earlier this month said it had uncovered evidence linking malicious software used in the Bangladesh heist to the Sony hack.Policymakers, regulators and financial institutions around the world are stepping up scrutiny of the cyber security of the SWIFT payments system after thieves in February used it to make fraudulent transfers totaling $81 million out of the Bank Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Symantec and other researchers have also linked the hack to a failed attempt to use fraudulent SWIFT messages to steal from a commercial bank in Vietnam.In addition, Reuters reported last week that Ecuador's Banco del Austro had more than $12 million stolen from a Wells Fargo account due to fraudulent transfers over the SWIFT network.The emergence of new possible instances of compromise is not entirely surprising as banks conduct more reviews, SWIFT spokeswoman Natasha de Teran told Reuters.""Many may turn out to be false positives, and or have nothing to do with SWIFT messages, but it is key that these reviews take place and banks' environments are secured,"" she added.

(symc.ly/1sRNHc7)The initial success of the group that attacked the Bangladesh Central Bank and the Philippines bank could prompt more attacks, Symantec said in the post.

He said the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter, would be accretive immediately.

Symantec's previous CEO, Michael Brown, left in April after the company reported disappointing quarterly results. Blue Coat had been preparing an initial public offering for later this summer.

118,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT A previously unknown hacking group variously dubbed ""Strider"" or ""ProjectSauron"" has carried out cyber-espionage attacks against select targets in Russia, China, Iran, Sweden, Belgium and Rwanda, security researchers said on Monday.The group, which has been active since at least 2011 and could have links to a national intelligence agency, uses Remsec, an advanced piece of hidden malware, Symantec researchers said in a blog post (symc.ly/2aTHoOm).Remsec spyware lives within an organization's network rather than being installed on individual computers, giving attackers complete control over infected machines, researchers said. It enables keystroke logging and the theft of files and other data.Its code also contains references to Sauron, the all-seeing title character in The Lord of the Rings, Symantec said. Strider is the nickname of the fantasy trilogy's widely traveled main character Aragorn.Separately, Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab has labeled the same group using the Remsec spyware as ""ProjectSauron"" (bit.ly/2b0YtqV). The newly discovered group's targets include four organizations and individuals located in Russia, an airline in China, an organization in Sweden and an embassy in Belgium, Symantec said.  Kaspersky said it had found 30 organizations hit so far in Russia, Iran and Rwanda, and possibly additional victims in Italian-speaking countries. Remsec targets included government agencies, scientific research centers, military entities, telecoms providers and financial institutions, Kaspersky said.""Based on the espionage capabilities of its malware and the nature of its known targets, it is possible that the group is a nation state-level attacker,"" Symantec said, but it did not speculate about which government might be behind the software.Despite headlines that suggest an endless stream of new types of cyber-spying attacks, Orla Fox, Symantec’s director of security response said the discovery of a new class of spyware like Remsec is a relatively rare event, with the industry uncovering no more than one or two such campaigns per year. Remsec shares certain unusual coding similarities with another older piece of nation state-grade malware known as Flamer, or Flame, according to Symantec.Kaspersky agreed that the same group it calls ProjectSauron appears to have adopted the tools and techniques of other better-known spyware, including Flame, but said it does not believe that ProjectSauron and Flame are directly connected.Flamer malware has been linked to Stuxnet, a military-grade computer virus alleged by security experts to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran’s nuclear program late in the last decade (reut.rs/2b2FA8z).

120,"  Symantec Corp shares could gain 25 percent or more following steps to cut costs and a recent acquisition that could propel the company's business in the hot cybersecurity market, a Barron's report said on Sunday.Barron's said Symantec, an early pioneer in antivirus software with its Norton brand, boosted its prospects of gaining a larger share of the cybersecurity market with its June agreement to buy Blue Coat Systems Inc [PRJCBB.UL].The company will be able to sell Blue Coat's web and cloud protection services to its existing base of more than 370,000 business clients as demand to block hacking attempts grows, the newspaper said.Plus, the newest Norton software is ""industry-leading,"" the newspaper said, citing Andrew Nowinski, an analyst for investment bank Piper Jaffray. Nowinski predicts the company's earnings will grow 12 to 14 percent from fiscal 2019 to 2021 as Symantec's consumer business benefits from a shift to a subscription model. More than $92 billion will be spent on tech security this year, up from $84 billion in 2015, according to data Barron's attributed to research firm Gartner Inc.Plans to trim its workforce by 10 percent and cut $550 million in costs by the end of Symantec's 2018 fiscal year will also help boost the company's earnings under new CEO Greg Clark, according to the report. Symantec shares have already risen 40 percent this year, closing at $23.72 on Friday, but the article quotes Franklin Templeton portfolio manager Christian Correa as saying he sees ""no reason the stock can't be in the low $30s"" within 12 to 18 months.

121,"   By Lauren Hirsch and Liana B. Baker  ForeScout Technologies Inc has interviewed investment banks in recent weeks to hire underwriters for an initial public offering that could value the U.S. network security company at as much as $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.ForeScout's IPO plans are a further sign of a rebound in the IPO market in the United States. Not a single U.S. technology company went public between January and late April due to stock market jitters.The IPO could come later this year, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. A representative for ForeScout declined to comment. Based in San Jose, California, ForeScout provides software to companies that allow them to see in real time every single device connected to their networks and ensure this is done securely. Founded in 2000 by Israeli entrepreneurs, its products are used by over 2,000 companies and government organizations.  ForeScout's IPO would come as similar offerings have failed to live up to their promise, amid fierce competition in the sector. Shares of peers FireEye Inc and SecureWorks Corp, which went public earlier this year, continue to trade below their IPO prices.ForeScout CEO Mike DeCesare said earlier this summer that the stock performance of SecureWorks' shares had prompted the wider cyber security industry to reevaluate its IPO plans. However, some cyber security companies have also sold themselves for top dollar. Blue Coat Systems Inc, which had been planning to go public earlier this year, was sold by private equity firm Bain Capital LLC to Symantec Corp in a $4.65 billion cash deal last month.So far this year, there have only been 13 technology IPOs, raising $1.9 billion, less than half the $4.6 billion raised last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Still, the window may be cracking open. Last week, eight IPOs priced, raising a total of $1.3 billion. Two of these IPOs were technology companies, including ad tech company Trade Desk Inc, which priced its $84 million IPO at the high-end of its indicated range. ForeScout has raised a total of $121 million in eight rounds of funding. It most recently raised $76 million at a $1 billion valuation in January. Its investors include Accel Partners, Amadeus Capital, Meritech Capital Partners and Pitango Venture Capital. (Reporting by Lauren Hirsch in New York and Liana B.

123,"   By Jim Finkle  Cyber-security firm Symantec Corp said on Tuesday that a second hacking group has sought to rob banks using fraudulent SWIFT messages, the same approach that yielded $81 million in the high-profile February attack on Bangladesh's central bank. Symantec said that a group dubbed Odinaff has infected 10 to 20 organizations with malware that can be used to hide fraudulent transfer requests made over SWIFT, the messaging system that is a lynchpin of the global financial system. Symantec's research provided new insight into ongoing hacking that has previously been disclosed by SWIFT. SWIFT Chief Executive Gottfried Leibbrandt last month told customers about three hacks and warned that cyber attacks on banks are poised to rise. SWIFT and Symantec have not identified specific victims beyond Bangladesh Bank. Symantec said that most Odinaff attacks occurred in the United States, Hong Kong, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.Symantec said it would share technical information about Odinaff with banks, governments and other security firms. The company in May said it believed the Bangladesh heist was carried out by a group known as Lazarus, which was also responsible for attacks on SWIFT customers in Southeast Asia as well as the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment.  The U.S. government has blamed North Korea for the Sony attack. Symantec researcher Eric Chien said his firm has not confirmed that North Korea was behind Lazarus, but that the high level of sophistication of its work suggests involvement by a nation state. Odinaff, on the other hand, appears to be a financially motivated criminal group, not a nation state, he added. SWIFT spokeswoman Natasha de Terán said that the messaging cooperative's customer security intelligence team had sent a warning about Odinaff's activities to its members in the early summer.That warning included technical indicators to help thwart potential attacks and a description of the group's habits,  Terán said.   Symantec said it believed that Odinaff is linked to Carbanak, a hacking group that has been targeting banks and merchant point-of-sale systems since at least 2014.  The two groups employ similar tactics in carrying out attacks and have used the same IP addresses to connect to their servers, according to Symantec.

Symantec's security software often comes bundled with personal computers. As a result, the company has suffered as consumers use mobile devices more than traditional computers. While Norton remains profitable, its sales have been falling.   ""(Norton) had been declining with the declines in PC market share. This acquisition brings $660 million in revenue to the consumer business and returns it to longer sustainable growth,"" Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark said in an interview.Reuters was first to report earlier on Sunday that Symantec was in the lead to acquire LifeLock. Symantec's purchase of LifeLock is in line with its efforts to diversify its offerings. In August, it bought Blue Coat Inc, which helps firms maintain security over the internet, in a $4.65 billion deal. Clark previously held the top job at Blue Coat, and made the switch after the deal closed. Based in Tempe, Arizona, LifeLock offers services such as monitoring new account openings and credit-related applications in order to alert consumers about unauthorized use of their identity. It also works with government agencies, merchants and creditors to remediate the impact of identity theft.Fran Rosch, executive vice president of Norton Business Unit, said that Symantec had dabbled in identity security but had nowhere near Lifelock's 4.4 million members.  ""We had to extend our value proposition. It was a no brainer for us to get back to growth,"" Rosch said.Symantec expects to finance the transaction with cash on balance sheet and $750 million of new debt. The Mountain View, California-based company has been moving away from what is sees as more commoditized services, selling its data storage business Veritas in January to private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) for $7.4 billion. Technology-focused firm Silver Lake Partners has also made a $1 billion investment in the company in two parts this year. Symantec said the LifeLock deal is not expected to have a material impact on its financial results next year, and reaffirmed its fiscal year 2017 and 2018 guidance. The deal also represents a victory for activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, which had pushed LifeLock to explore its options.Symantec was advised by Citigroup (C.N) and JP Morgan (JPM.N), along with Bank of America (BAC.N), Barclays Plc (BARC.L), and Wells Fargo (WFC.N).
