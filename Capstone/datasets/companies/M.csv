()* The federal government warned that crude oil from the Bakken Shale in North Dakota may be more flammable than other types of crude. ()* Cox Enterprises Inc, the closely held media conglomerate, has bought back a stake in AutoTrader Group Inc  in a deal that implies a value of about $7 billion for the online auto marketplace. () * Sales of gold coins are booming even as the metal's price is falling, a testament to gold's continued appeal for small investors and collectors despite its first bear market in more than a decade. () * U.S. passenger airlines are bracing for the start of new federal regulations on Saturday that will guarantee their pilots more rest time and restrict the hours they can put in behind the cockpit controls. ()* When Mathew Martoma's insider-trading trial begins next week, federal prosecutors will arrive armed with what they believe is one of the strongest cases to emerge from their decade-long investigation into SAC Capital Advisors LP. Lawyers from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan are expected to call two doctors who will testify that they passed inside tips on pharmaceutical drug tests to Martoma, a former portfolio manager at the large hedge fund.

Its shares rose 5 percent after the bell.Macy's said comparable sales, which include online sales and sales at stores open at least a year, rose 3.6 percent in November and December, roughly the same pace as in the third quarter, when it easily outperformed rivals from Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) and J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) to Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) in terms of sales growth. Data firm ShopperTrak on Wednesday said holiday season sales at stores rose 2.7 percent across the industry.

The retailer also announced plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 1.4 percent of its U.S. workforce, but said it expects to add positions for its growing online business, leaving overall staffing levels unchanged at around 175,000. Its shares rose 5 percent after the bell.Macy's said comparable sales, which include online sales and sales at stores open at least a year, rose 3.6 percent in November and December, roughly the same pace as in the third quarter, when it easily outperformed rivals from Kohl's Corp  and J.C. Penney Co Inc to Target Corp  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc in terms of sales growth. Data firm ShopperTrak on Wednesday said holiday season sales at stores rose 2.7 percent across the industry.Macy's, which also operates the high-end Bloomingdale's chain, forecast a profit of $4.40 to $4.50 per share for next fiscal year, while analysts were only expecting $3.87, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. Macy's expects comparable sales to grow 2.5 percent to 3 percent next fiscal year, which starts in February. The job cuts were part of a new cost-cutting plan that is expected to save the retailer about $100 million annually. That would include combining some store districts and some jobs at its central office.Macy's expects to incur charges of between $120 million and $135 million this quarter for the cost-cutting plan. In addition to benefitting from brisk luxury sales that lifted business at Bloomingdale's, Macy's has been able to gain an advantage over rivals Penney and Kohl's by using hundreds of its stores to help it fill online orders. It was also more aggressive in wooing shoppers on a more modest budget during the holiday season, helping it compete in the most discount-driven season since the recession.Going into the fall and holiday season, Macy's increased its selection of lower-priced items and boosted advertising and in-store signage during sales events to tout its least-expensive merchandise. Macy's, which caters to a middle-class clientele, offers a broad range merchandise, from $10 cotton T-shirts to Louis Vuitton handbags.At least one analyst said Macy's appeared likely to have been able to offer discounts to shoppers during the holidays without sacrificing its gross profit margin.""We are encouraged by the strength in sales early in the quarter, which were likely at high margin,"" Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe wrote in a note.",2014-01-09,M,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 10:26pm EST","UPDATE 1-Macy's posts strong holiday season sales, gives upbeat 2014 outlook",http://www.reuters.com//article/macys-results-idUSL2N0KJ0H520140109?type=companyNews

32,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO, April 7  CHICAGO, April 7 Go for the most famous companies when you are investing, and you are likely to pay the highest price possible because most investors place a premium on the biggest-name stocks. But take a look at the roughly 1,500 companies that make up the mid-cap market, and you could be making a pretty solid investment this year.Mid-caps, with market values between $1 billion and $15 billion, are often the least visible choices in investing. They are big enough to have mature management teams, yet may not carry the same downside risk as a mega-cap or a small company. They may be able to grow more robustly than mega-caps because of their size. And as market valuations have climbed for both mega- and small caps, mid-caps offer returns that are right down the middle of the plate.The S&P MidCap 400 index returned 23.2 percent for the 12 months through April 4 compared to 22 percent for the S&P 500 index of big stocks and 29 percent for the small-company S&P 600 index.To gain a broad sampling of mid-caps, you'd need an index fund like the iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF. The fund invests in a wide basket of mid-cap companies like Keurig Green Mountain Inc, Affiliated Managers Group Inc  and Trimble Navigation Ltd.The iShares fund gained 32 percent last year, roughly tracking the S&P 500. It's up 0.78 percent year to date through April 4. The fund charges 0.25 percent for annual expenses.A worthy alternative to the iShares fund is the SPDR S&P Mid-cap 400 ETF, which is up 2 percent year to date through April 4. It edged the S&P 500 last year by just under 1 percentage point and also charges 0.25 percent annually for management expenses. For a more focused and active mid-cap strategy, consider the Baron Partners Retail Fund, which owns companies like Arch Capital Group Ltd, ITC Holdings Corp and Hyatt Hotels Corp. Its strategy is to hold stocks long term with a goal of finding companies whose market value could increase 100 percent within four subsequent years.The Baron fund, coming off a stellar 2013, in which it gained nearly 48 percent - beating the S&P 500 by 15 percentage points - is up almost 4 percent year to date through April 4. It costs 1.38 percent annually to own. According to S&P Capital IQ's MarketScope Advisor, ""The fund is relatively concentrated, with just 26 holdings and more than two-thirds of assets invested in its top-10 holdings."" While it's much more expensive than an index fund, its performance may be justified on the return side.If you're looking for bargain-priced mid-caps, turn to the Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF. The fund holds undervalued stocks like Macy's Inc, Delphi Automotive PLC  and Western Digital Corp. It charges 0.10 percent annually and is up nearly 4 percent year to date through April 4. It gained nearly 38 percent last year, besting the S&P 500 by more than 5 percentage points. CRYSTAL BALL How will mid-caps do this year? There are no guarantees their bull run will continue, but should the U.S. economy continue on its upward trajectory, mid-cap performance may hold up. The companies tend to be slightly more resilient to economic softness and will benefit from improvements in hiring, economic output, retail sales and the housing market. So far, the signals are all green for mid-caps. Growth in U.S. gross domestic product was revised up to 2.6 percent for the fourth quarter of last year by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That compares to 1.4 percent for the same quarter a year earlier.Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen affirmed the central bank's ""extraordinary commitment"" to boosting the economy. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since late 2008 and is expected to continue that policy through this year. The jobless rate is down to 6.7 percent from a post-meltdown high of 10 percent. Inflation is hovering around 2 percent.What's more important than short-term economic news is taking the long view on mid-caps. They do well over the long run when there's sustained economic growth, showing a pronounced advantage over the more popular mega-caps - even during downturns.For the past 10 years, for example, a broad-basket mid-cap fund like the iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 posted a nearly 10 percent annualized average rate of return. That compares to 7 percent for the S&P 500. Keep in mind that period includes the meltdown year of 2008.But the mid-cap advantage fell behind the S&P 500 over the past three years by 2 percentage points, so to achieve the outperformance over big stocks you need to buy and hold mid-sized companies for the long term. The mid-cap return premium - at least in recent years - occurs when large company prices are at their most volatile.

Analysts on average expect a profit of $4.48 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The forecast could be conservative as Macy's continues to benefit from selling more brands and investments in e-commerce, said Brian Sozzi, chief executive of Belus Capital Advisors. The company has also remodeled many stores, including its flagship store at Herald Square in Manhattan and launched initiatives such as ""Buy Online Pickup in Store"" and ""Click and Collect"" to boost sales.""If you got the product right in April when the weather was good and people wanted to come back to the mall, you will probably have a somewhat decent start to the second quarter,"" Sozzi said.Macy's namesake stores sell everything from clothing to home goods to a mainly middle-class clientele. The company raised its dividend to 31.25 cents per share from 25 cents and increased its stock buyback program by $1.5 billion to about $2.5 billion.""Macy's focus on improving the merchandise assortment while enhancing the customer experience both in stores and online will likely continue to drive strong results,"" Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe wrote in a note to clients.Macy's net income rose 3.2 percent to $224 million, or 60 cents per share, in the three months to May 3. Revenue fell 1.7 percent to $6.28 billion.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 59 cents per share, on revenue of $6.46 billion.Comparable-store sales fell 1.6 percent.

Throughout 2014, investors have been using market pullbacks as opportunities to add to their positions.* Poland's foreign minister eased some concerns about ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, saying the threat of Russia invading Ukraine had receded amid reports an aid convoy that Moscow is sending to eastern Ukraine would cross the border under the aegis of the Red Cross. Still, Ukraine denounced the convoy as an act of Russian cynicism and said it would not be allowed to cross the border. * Russia's dollar-denominated RTS index jumped 1.4 percent and the Market Vectors Russia Exchange-Traded Fund  was up 1.2 percent to $24.30 in premarket trading.* Investors monitored the situation in Iraq, where the new prime minister-designate won endorsements from the United States and Iran, as well as Shi'ite militia and army commanders long loyal to Nuri al-Maliki, the previous prime minister, who has refused to step aside.

51,"   By Siddharth Cavale and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Weak results from the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Macy's Inc (M.N) are the latest sign less affluent U.S. consumers are still pinching their pennies and the trend appears to be hurting upmarket retailers as well.A number of large U.S. retailers who cater to low and middle income consumers reported disappointing quarterly comparable sales this week, pointing to a cutback in spending and a shift in preferences to stores nearer to home.""Consumers are still concerned about cost of living and employment...overall we are seeing no changes in the consumer than what we have seen in the last few quarters,"" Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on Thursday.Wal-Mart cut its profit forecast for the year, citing higher healthcare and online investment costs, but also cautioned that  heavy discounting would continue into the holiday season to draw in its shoppers, many of whom depend on government assistance. Even department store operator Macy's, which caters to a more affluent clientele, lowered its same-store sales forecast for the year. The weak sales and margin data illustrate the effects of a slowly improving job market, volatile fuel prices and government food stamp cuts, Joseph Agnese, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ told Reuters.""Even though the job market has picked up, income growth is very weak. We are adding jobs but average earnings aren’t growing very rapidly,"" Robert Brusca, chief economist at consulting firm Fact and Opinion Economics, said in a phone interview.Amid the general gloom, one surprising glimmer of hope came from struggling department store chain J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), which reported a 5 percent rise in quarterly sales and a narrower loss.   SPENDING RESTRAINT Even McDonald's Corp (MCD.N), which sells burgers and fries for as little as a dollar, has struggled to grow sales at established restaurants in the United States since November 2013. Same-restaurant sales at home fell 3.2 percent in July. The Labor Department's monthly employment report showed more than 200,000 jobs created for the sixth straight month in July.But, Brusca said, a lot of the jobs are being added in low-income brackets.Spending would be much greater if wages increased for the people already employed, he said. American workers, on average, earned $24.45 an hour in July, up only a penny from June, the Labor Department's data showed.Over the last year, wages have grown just 2 percent, in keeping with where they have been stuck since late 2009. Before then, hourly earnings typically rose 3 percent or 4 percent a year.""Consumer sentiment is the highest since 2007, but consumer optimism isn't translating into spending,"" Guy LeBas, analyst at Janney Capital Markets told Reuters.The restraint is hurting retailers in the ""affordable luxury"" space such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N) and Kate Spade & Co's (KATE.N), which have had to fall back on discounts to push their handbags and other accessories. Kate Spade shares lost nearly a quarter of their value on Tuesday after the retailer said gross margins were being hit by intense competition, particularly in its low-end Kate Spade Saturday brand. Michael Kors's quarterly margins were squeezed by increased discounting to clear inventory and watchmaker Fossil Inc (FOSL.O) announced lower profits as declining mall traffic, a problem for many retailers, took its toll.The rise of e-commerce has played a role in the weakness of brick and mortar retailers as well, although Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is struggling to reap a bottom-line boost from its surging sales. Price cuts have now become a necessity for many retailers as well, to be able ""to compete with the aggressive department store promotions"" and get customers ""to purchase in an otherwise stagnant fashion environment,"" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note.In addition to McDonald's, the U.S. consumer's reluctance to spend has also hit some of the country's more upscale ""fast-casual"" eateries, where many chains have been feeling the squeeze even as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) has prospered.Noodles & Co (NDLS.O), a full-service restaurant chain, on Wednesday slashed full-year sales forecasts, in part for a drop in frugal customers visiting its restaurants. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc's (RRGB.O), also a fast-casual chain, fell 18 percent on Thursday, reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales and profit citing intense and ""non-sustainable discounting"" from rivals.

Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, reported flat same-store sales in the United States on Thursday, while department store Macy's cut its full-year same-store sales forecast.

68,"  WASHINGTON U.S. consumer credit increased by the smallest amount since November and growth for the prior month was revised lower, giving a cautious signal about the pace of economic expansion.Total consumer credit rose $13.5 billion to $3.25 trillion in August, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. The figure for July was revised down to show a gain of $21.6 billion.Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer credit to increase $20 billion in August. The weak reading could bolster the view that economic growth downshifted in the third quarter from the pace clocked in the prior three months. Most economists see the economy expanding at around a 3 percent annual rate in the June-August period, which would be slower than in the second quarter but faster than average growth over the last few years. The slowdown in credit growth in August was due primarily to a $207.5 million drop in revolving credit, which mostly measures credit card use. Non-revolving credit, which includes auto loans as well as student loans by the government, increased $13.7 billion.

87,"   By Barbara Goldberg | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Millions of Americans were thankful just to arrive at their Thanksgiving feasts on Thursday after a snowstorm dumped up to 20 inches of snow on Eastern states, causing flight delays and power outages.Snow flurries drifted over Thomas the Tank Engine, Snoopy and other giant helium balloons in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, where police reported the disorderly conduct arrests of at least seven protesters who had vowed over social media to throw the event into disarray to show outrage over the racially charged Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri.The demonstrators were arrested on Sixth Avenue and 37th Street. They had been allowed to cross the parade route but then tried to disrupt the procession, knocking over police barricades and breaking windows, said a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department. Skies were expected to clear throughout the East Coast, which was slammed overnight by a wet snowstorm that wrought havoc with holiday travelers and cooks.""Paw Paw, West Virginia - that's where the jackpot was for snowfall amounts,"" said meteorologist Andrew Orrison of the National Weather Service, noting the tiny town was buried under 20 inches (51 cm) of snow. Oatmeal-like wet snow piled as high as 15 inches (38 cm) in the town of Savoy in the Berkshire Mountains in western Massachusetts and 14.6 inches (37.1 cm) in Warrensburg in the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York.Heavy snow snapped tree limbs which damaged lines, causing hundreds of thousands of power outages from Maine to Virginia, utilities said, and the damage could takes days to repair. Public Service of New Hampshire said 140,000 customers were without power and Central Maine Power Company said on Thursday it was working to restore power to 86,213 households. U.S. flight schedules were upended for a second day during the year's busiest travel period, with 56 flights canceled and 403 delayed on Thursday, according to FlightAware.com. On Wednesday, more than 700 U.S. flights were canceled and about 4,400 were delayed, it said.More than 46 million Americans are expected to make trips between Wednesday and Sunday, travel group AAA said, with more than 89 percent traveling by car.Cooks able to fire up their ovens prepared traditional pumpkin pies, stuffings and roasted turkeys, with a small but growing number preparing heritage turkeys linked to the country's early settlers. Plumbers from coast to coast, meanwhile, girded for one of their busiest days of the year, when some harried cooks dump the grease from their roasted birds down the drain, inadvertently clogging household pipes and having to call for help.It is a Thanksgiving tradition that for years has resulted in a 50 percent increase in calls on the Friday after the holiday to Roto-Rooter, the biggest U.S. plumbing and drain cleaning service, compared to a normal Friday, said company spokesman Paul Abrams.

92,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. economic growth was likely stronger in the third quarter than previously reported, according to data on Wednesday that  showed spending on services expanding at a brisk clip.The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, showed services outlays increased much more vigorously than the government had assumed in its second estimate of gross domestic product published in November.""This increased services spending suggests there is greater traction in the economy than was previously assumed and that despite global growth concerns, domestic demand is exhibiting solid forward momentum,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.Economists said the data suggested third-quarter consumer spending could be raised by at least two-tenths of a percentage point from a 2.2 percent annual rate when the government publishes its third estimate later this month. That combined with data on wholesale inventories and construction spending could see third-quarter GDP revised up to at least a 4.6 percent annual pace from the 3.9 percent rate reported last month.""This upward revision implies slightly stronger momentum for services consumption heading into the fourth quarter, but is of little significance to our forecast for fourth-quarter GDP growth,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Fourth-quarter growth estimates are currently converging around a 2.5 percent pace. The QSS, which provides a comprehensive count of service sector revenues, is frequently a source of GDP revisions. It showed broad-based increases in services spending during the third quarter, with big gains in healthcare, legal and software. According to economists, the QSS data showed the government had underestimated healthcare spending by about $3.8 billion. With the introduction of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare restructuring law at the start of this year, healthcare spending has been particularly tough to estimate.Growth estimates could shift again on Thursday, with the release of business inventory data for October, especially if September's figures are revised.

93,"   By Nathan Layne  U.S. retail sales rose 5.5 percent from the day after Thanksgiving through Christmas Eve as solid demand for women's apparel, jewelry and casual dining offset surprisingly sluggish sales of electronics, MasterCard said in its holiday spending report.The report, which tracks spending by combining sales activity in MasterCard's payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms, offers an early look into how the holiday season shaped up. Official government data and results from retailers will not be available until next month.The results of the MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse report are the latest sign that a stronger economy boosted spending during the holiday season. An improving jobs market, with unemployment at a six-year low, and falling gasoline prices are among the factors helping to spur spending.The National Retail Federation, the industry's main trade body, is forecasting that retail sales will increase 4.1 percent during November and December, the biggest jump since 2011. The MasterCard report highlighted how uneven the gains are, with some surprising winners and losers. Casual dining and lodging were among the strongest categories, posting double-digit and nearly double-digit year-on-year sales growth, respectively, from ""Black Friday,"" the day after Thanksgiving, through Dec. 24.  The results reflected a growing consumer preference for ""experience"" over goods, Sarah Quinlan, a senior vice president at MasterCard, said. The ""economy is very strong but they are spending in a different way,"" she said in an interview.Contrary to some experts who predicted a strong showing for electronics, the category was among the weakest, with sales ""basically flat"" from Black Friday to Dec. 24 and in negative territory when looking at sales starting on Nov. 1, according to the report. Brian Sozzi, head of Belus Capital Advisors, still thinks Best Buy Co Inc, the country's largest electronics retailer, had a strong holiday season. A flat sales performance for the industry as a whole may simply point to volume sales of PCs and other products marked by steep price declines, he said.Based on his visits to Best Buy stores, Sozzi said higher-end televisions, headphones and watches sold well. ""All of the pricier stuff for them moved and moved very aggressively to the point where the last couple of days before Christmas Eve the shelves were basically bare,"" he said. Quinlan said apparel overall showed single-digit growth, and women's apparel had mid-single-digit growth since Black Friday. She said it was not clear if the growth would translate into profits, echoing warnings by many analysts worried by heavy discounting in apparel this year.Sozzi said one likely winner of some of that apparel demand was J.C. Penney Co Inc, which he said was doing brisk sales of trendier women's items, as well as athletic apparel.Other strong categories noted in the MasterCard report were furniture, which Quinlan said highlighted growing consumer confidence in the economy, and jewelry, with sales growth in the mid-single digits from Black Friday through Christmas Eve.

94,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dec 29 Major U.S. retailers including Target Corp and Toys 'R Us have begun allowing shoppers to collect online purchases at their brick-and-mortar stores, but a study shows the option often saves little, if any, time over in-store shopping.According to a small study to be released on Tuesday by retail-intelligence firm StellaService, in-store pickup saved shoppers just 96 seconds on average compared with searching for items on their own. In a few cases, in-store pickup took longer.In-store pickup is one of many services being tested as retailers try to use their stores as mini-shipping hubs to get items to shoppers more quickly. It comes in response to competition from the No. 1 U.S. online retailer, Amazon.com Inc , which has streamlined its delivery service.The StellaService study, based on 44 visits to stores in the South run by 11 retailers, is one of the most comprehensive studies so far of the in-store pickup service. The results show that retailers have no uniform approach to the issue. ""It's amazing just how much simpler the process would have been if someone had just put up a sign,"" said Ty McMahan, senior director of content for StellaService, adding that retailers are spending ""tens of millions of dollars"" on these initiatives.Shoppers spent an average of 5 minutes and 24 seconds in a store when trying to pick up their online orders. Those who did not use the in-store pickup feature spent an average of 7 minutes in the store, according to the study. But in-store pickup saved just 30 seconds at Target and Toys 'R Us. At Macy's Inc, StellaService shoppers were not quite sure where to go. In-store pickup took 8 minutes and 30 seconds, while those who walked in spent 5 minutes at a Macy's store.By contrast, in-store pickup took only 2 minutes at Office Depot Inc, compared with 4 minutes for those who walked in. Home Depot Inc and Nordstrom Inc were the only other retailers that were slower at in-store pickup. Macy's and Home Depot could not be immediately reached for comment.Nordstrom said one of the reasons they offer in-store pickup for online items is to guarantee customers that it will be there for them if they make a visit to the store.""We are always looking at ways to improve the service for our customers,"" Nordstrom spokeswoman Brooke White said.

""Macy's and Bloomingdale's websites, apps and fulfillment systems performed exceptionally well in the holiday season,"" Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said. The restructuring is expected to save about $140 million per year beginning 2015. Macy's would record charges of about $100 million to $110 million in the fourth quarter. Macy's said it would hire about 1,500 associates this year at the direct-to-consumer fulfillment center in Oklahoma which will start functioning in April. The company said in 2013 that it would build a $170 million fulfillment center in Tulsa County to ship more orders to customers in the central and southern United States.The store closures announced on Thursday include three stores in Ohio and three in California.Macy's operates about 840 stores, including 13 Bloomingdale's outlets, according to its latest quarterly filing. The company also said it would create a team to explore opportunities for a Macy's off-price business.Macy's narrowed its fourth-quarter comparable sales growth forecast for owned stores to 1.9-2.4 percent from 1.8-2.8 percent.The company's shares were down about 3 percent after closing at $67.81 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

112,"  March 18 American Express Co will team up with seven companies, including Macy's Inc, AT&T Inc  and Exxon Mobil Corp, to launch a loyalty program this spring, the Wall Street Journal reported.The program, called Plenti, will operate like drugstore-rewards programs and let customers earn points by making purchases at the participating companies, which also include Rite Aid Corp and Hulu, the Journal said.For example, users will be able to pay for their purchases at Rite Aid using the points they earn on paying their AT&T bills. AmEx, which will operate the program and collect fees from partner companies, expects to launch it in May, the newspaper said. The company operates similar programs in Poland, Germany and Italy.

It raised interest rates for over 1 million of its cardholders for the first time in more than five years last month.American Express runs co-branded contracts with Delta Airlines Inc, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc  and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, among others.

119,"   By Nadia Damouni, Mike Stone and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Several hedge funds have asked U.S. department store company Macy's Inc (M.N) to consider options for its real estate, including selling some major sites and then leasing them back,  according to several sources close to the matter. The push is in line with real estate decisions by some other major retailers that have been beneficial to their stock prices.Hudson's Bay Co (HBC.TO), the parent of Lord and Taylor and Saks Inc, said in February it would form two real estate joint ventures, paving the way for it to sell some of its property assets. Shares of Hudson's Bay have risen almost 50 percent over the last 12 months.Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) also said in April it plans to spin off 254 stores into a real estate investment trust next month, which it estimates will raise $2.5 billion and alleviate some liquidity concerns. Shares of Sears are up 27 percent since the beginning of the year, providing a much needed boost to a retailer that has lost $7 billion over the last four years. These moves have emboldened several hedge funds to buy stakes in Macy's in recent months and hold conversations with management about following a similar strategy, the sources said.Macy's and its financial advisers are listening to the ideas of its shareholders, the sources said. The company, though, remains more interested in trimming its real estate portfolio at the margins, as it did last year when it sold its Sunnyvale and Cupertino locations in Northern California, they added.Macy's management believes that pursuing a sale-leaseback strategy in which it would sell its retail space and then rent it back would burden it with significant lease expenses that would erode its profitability and weaken its finances, according to three of the sources.  A Macy’s spokesman said in an emailed statement: ""We look at all of our stores so we can get the best economic and operational equation in each location. We analyze each store's situation and are always looking to maximize the value of the company.""CROWN JEWELS Some investors have suggested that Macy's sell its best-known asset, its flagship Herald Square location in New York, to raise cash so that it can pay a higher dividend to shareholders or buy back shares. Hudson's Bay mortgaged the land beneath Saks' 5th Avenue flagship store in Manhattan for $3.7 billion in 2014. The Canadian retail group paid $2.9 billion for all of Saks in 2013.However, such a move is highly unlikely as Herald Square is one of New York’s top tourist attractions and a large part of Macy’s identity and brand, the sources said.  Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade has also appeared in movies from Miracle on 34th Street to TV show Seinfeld. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1978. A number of prominent hedge funds have recently acquired stakes, though it is unclear which have approached Macy’s management with real estate proposals.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital Inc bought 1.7 million shares in Macy's in the first quarter, although the position is expected to remain passive, a source close to the matter said.Hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, which often takes activist positions in companies, has also traded in Macy's stock in the past few months, according to people familiar with the matter. Greenlight and Jana declined to comment.  Macy's is no stranger to activist investors shopping for hidden value. Carl Icahn took a large position in Macy’s then parent company Federated Department Stores Inc in 2006. Icahn pushed for the company to unlock its real estate value, but ended up exiting the stock several months later.     During Macy's first quarter earnings call on May 13, Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet addressed the company's real estate strategy, suggesting that some estimates valuing its assets have been done ""over simplistically."" According to its last annual report, Macy's property has a book value of $7.8 billion. Macy's owns 447 of its 823 stores as well as several offices. ""We are studying closely with our key banking partners all the various transactions that have happened lately and all the possible strategies, the pros, the cons of how you would do it, etc., etc., to see what is right for us,” Hoguet said on the call.Shares of Macy's, which have risen around 11 percent over the last 12 months, are slightly below the broader S&P Retail index over the same period. The company boosted its dividend by 15 percent to 36 cents during the first quarter of 2015 which is the fifth dividend increase in the past four years. During the quarter, Macy’s also increased its share repurchase program by $1.5 billion. In the past seven years, shares of Macy’s have risen 280 percent under long term CEO Terry Lundgren’s watch. Both Lundgren and the Macy's board, which includes former Hilton CEO Stephen Bollenbach, are highly regarded in the retail industry, the sources said. Meanwhile, other activists that have sought to effect major structural change within large retailers have been thwarted or suffered losses. Pershing Square Management's Bill Ackman failed to convince Target Corp (TGT.N) to shed its stores into a real estate investment. Ackman also stepped off the J.C. Penney (JCP.N) board in 2013 after an unsuccessful two-year attempt to remake the department store into an upscale retail chain.

128,"   By Barani Krishnan  U.S. retail chain Macy's is a cheap stock trading more than 70 percent below value, and its highly-prized real estate assets could be spun off, investment firm Starboard Value said on Wednesday after announcing it had taken a stake in the company.Macy's was trading at just over $70 a share when it should  be above $125 given the high value of its enterprise, Starboard Chief Executive Jeffrey Smith told the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference in New York.Shares of Macy's jumped more than 5 percent after Smith disclosed for the first time Starboard's holding in the retailer, outlining the company's hidden value.Smith said on the surface Macy's looked ""fairly valued"", appearing like its peers with respect to valuation, operating margins and performance.But closer scrutiny reveals the company has a sizable real estate portfolio that currently makes up more than 70 percent of its $29 billion enterprise value. Macy's flagship Herald Square store in New York alone was  worth $4 billion, by Starboard’s estimate, while properties in San Francisco and Chicago were worth more than $1 billion. With another 400 mall locations worth about $13 billion, Macy's had a real estate value of about $21 billion, Smith said.""We believe there is an opportunity to create two companies - the Macy's operating business as well as the real estate company,"" Smith said. ""We believe you can accomplish this goal while maintaining the dividend, and actually making it safer, and maintaining the credit rating.""      Macy's credit card earnings was another huge positive for the company, bringing in earnings of $8.5 billion, Smith said.""We think Macy's should be worth more than $125 a share, and buying it is a cheap proposition,"" Smith added.By early afternoon, Macy's stock traded at $72.14, up 5.4 percent. Asked if he would take an activist role in pushing for change at Macy's to boost shareholder value, Smith said his first choice was to work with the retailer's management.""We are willing to do whatever is necessary to increase value for shareholders. Of course, it's a lot easier to work with the management, especially if you start seeing them make changes in the right direction.""

130,"   By Nandita Bose and Mari Saito | CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO  CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO Macy's Inc (M.N) is expanding same-day delivery to several new U.S. markets this summer, one of the most aggressive pushes by a brick-and-mortar retailer in an area dominated by e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN.O), according to a Macy's official.    Macy's, the nation's largest department store chain, already offers same-day delivery services in eight markets. By partnering with Deliv, an Uber-like startup that uses a fleet of contract drivers to pick up online orders from stores and malls,  the retailer has found a cost-effective way to expand, said the Macy's official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.      The official said that the initial plan is to offer the service in several more markets but there nay be additions later this year, and that could take it ahead of Amazon – which currently offers same-day delivery in 14 markets. Currently, Macy's is offering the service in Houston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Washington D.C., Chicago, Los Angeles and New Jersey. It couldn't be immediately ascertained which ones were being added.    The department store company's efforts come as the ""last mile"" - the final portion of a package's journey that takes it from a retailer's warehouse or store to the customer's front door - becomes the next battleground for retailers trying to increase online sales. Macy's has one possible advantage over Amazon in that it has 886 stores as of May 2 in the U.S. from which to source products for delivery – meaning the packages often have less distance to travel - against 50 fulfilment centers and smaller distribution facilities run by Amazon.    But fast shipping is costly and most retailers who offer it currently lose money on the service, warn logistics experts. For example, analysts estimate that Amazon loses $1 billion to $2 billion a year on its U.S. Prime service, which promises delivery within anything from one hour to two days. Amazon's net shipping cost rose to $4.2 billion in 2014, up from $3.5 billion a year earlier. Macy's spokesman Jim Sluzewski confirmed the retailer's plans to expand the service this year but declined to give further details.Faster delivery also becomes a differentiating factor when new online retail sites like Jet.com, which launched on Tuesday,  promise to offer cheaper prices than Amazon. The startup, which will charge $49 a year for membership, claims its consumers can get the lowest price on anything they buy online, with the trade-off of being relatively slow delivery service.              ""RACE TO THE BOTTOM""      Even as Macy's rushes to extend fast delivery, many other traditional retailers are far more cautious. The costs of same-day delivery and ambivalence from many customers remain concerns, analysts say.    Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) has offered same-day delivery for $15 since 2011, but the service is still only available in three markets: Seattle and Bellevue in Washington state, and La Jolla in California.    A January survey of 5,118 online shoppers by UPS and Comscore found that 85 percent of people surveyed were willing to wait five days or more for their delivery.         ""The thing that's so perplexing about this last mile and same day is that the consumers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping over speed,"" said Satish Jindel, a logistics consultant and president of SJ Consulting Group.     That could change, said David Bell, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and if consumers became accustomed to same-day service, the result would be an expensive ""race to the bottom for retailers"" who would not be able to compete with Amazon on the delivery cost.     Macy's does not disclose how many items it has available for same-day delivery, and Deliv will not say how many items it carries for Macy's.     Amazon has more than a million products available for same-day delivery. Macy's charges its customers $5 for same-day delivery, but it is unclear how much of its costs that covers. Deliv says its rates for retailers are in line with the average $8 ground delivery cost of carriers such as UPS and FedEx, but it was unclear whether that's what it charges Macy's or whether it takes a loss to offer the service to Macy's.""It's very hard to compete with Amazon, but traditional retailers have an advantage in that they already have all of their inventory in place five miles from 90 percent of their purchasing population at their stores,"" said Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli.""This is one of those opportunities to out-Amazon Amazon,"" she said.    Although Macy's does not break out details of its online sales or shipping costs, analysts assume the company is losing money on the service once additional costs are taken into account, including finding the product, getting the package ready for delivery, and restocking expenses.    ""Only the biggest of retailers that are capable will be able to afford these operations,"" said Jarrett Streebin, the CEO of EasyPost, a shipping startup. He estimated costs per package could reach $20 or more with additional logistics processes and staffing to handle the orders. ""Who's willing to pay the bill?"" he asked. (Editing by Stephen R.

131,"  (Adds details)July 22 The National Retail Federation, the biggest U.S. retail association, cut its forecast for retail sales growth in the country this year, citing an unexpected slowdown in growth in the first half of the year.The NRF now expects U.S. retail sales to grow 3.5 percent in 2015, lower than the 4.1 percent growth it forecast in February. NRF said sales grew 2.9 percent during the first half of 2015 and are expected to grow 3.7 percent over the next five months."" ... A  deflationary retail environment has been especially challenging for retailers' bottom lines,"" NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement. (bit.ly/1IecmqW)Kleinhenz said the weak first half sales were due to bad weather through most of the winter, the West Coast ports disruptions and a stronger dollar among other factors.Even recent government data points to weak sales. U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in June, recording the weakest since February, as households cut back on purchases, according to the latest data from the Commerce Department. NRF Chief Executive Matthew Shay also blamed Washington for lackluster consumer spending. "" ... Too much time has been spent crafting rules and regulations that almost guarantee negative consequences for consumers and American businesses alike.""Retailers across the board recorded sluggish sales in the first half of the year, with apparel retailers among the worst hit. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, said its customers were preferring to pocket savings from tax refunds and lower gas prices than spend.Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp said gasoline price deflation ate into domestic sales, while department stores such as Macy's Inc and Kohl's Corp  took a hit from unusual weather and port disruptions.The stronger dollar through most of the year so far also hurt domestic sales. Macy's and Tiffany & Co said the strong dollar meant that tourists spent less. However, home improvement giant Home Depot Inc  capitalized on the storms and winter months with better-timed promotions that boosted sales and profit.Households seemed to be spending more on services than on goods, Kleinhenz said.NRF's calculations include general retail sales and non-store sales, and exclude automobiles, gas stations and restaurants.The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index, which includes auto parts makers and restaurants, had risen nearly 10 percent this year up to Tuesday's close.

Macy's has one possible advantage over Amazon in that it has 886 stores as of May 2 in the U.S. from which to source products for delivery - meaning the packages often have less distance to travel - against 50 fulfilment centers and smaller distribution facilities run by Amazon.But fast shipping is costly and most retailers who offer it currently lose money on the service, warn logistics experts. For example, analysts estimate that Amazon loses $1 billion to $2 billion a year on its U.S. Prime service, which promises delivery within anything from one hour to two days. Amazon's net shipping cost rose to $4.2 billion in 2014, up from $3.5 billion a year earlier.Macy's spokesman Jim Sluzewski confirmed the retailer's plans to expand the service this year but declined to give further details.Faster delivery also becomes a differentiating factor when new online retail sites like Jet.com, which launched on Tuesday,  promise to offer cheaper prices than Amazon. The startup, which will charge $49 a year for membership, claims its consumers can get the lowest price on anything they buy online, with the trade-off of being relatively slow delivery service. ""RACE TO THE BOTTOM"" Even as Macy's rushes to extend fast delivery, many other traditional retailers are far more cautious. The costs of same-day delivery and ambivalence from many customers remain concerns, analysts say.Nordstrom Inc has offered same-day delivery for $15 since 2011, but the service is still only available in three markets: Seattle and Bellevue in Washington state, and La Jolla in California. A January survey of 5,118 online shoppers by UPS and Comscore found that 85 percent of people surveyed were willing to wait five days or more for their delivery.""The thing that's so perplexing about this last mile and same day is that the consumers overwhelmingly prefer free shipping over speed,"" said Satish Jindel, a logistics consultant and president of SJ Consulting Group.That could change, said David Bell, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, and if consumers became accustomed to same-day service, the result would be an expensive ""race to the bottom for retailers"" who would not be able to compete with Amazon on the delivery cost. Macy's does not disclose how many items it has available for same-day delivery, and Deliv will not say how many items it carries for Macy's.Amazon has more than a million products available for same-day delivery.Macy's charges its customers $5 for same-day delivery, but it is unclear how much of its costs that covers. Deliv says its rates for retailers are in line with the average $8 ground delivery cost of carriers such as UPS and FedEx, but it was unclear whether that's what it charges Macy's or whether it takes a loss to offer the service to Macy's.""It's very hard to compete with Amazon, but traditional retailers have an advantage in that they already have all of their inventory in place five miles from 90 percent of their purchasing population at their stores,"" said Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli.""This is one of those opportunities to out-Amazon Amazon,"" she said.Although Macy's does not break out details of its online sales or shipping costs, analysts assume the company is losing money on the service once additional costs are taken into account, including finding the product, getting the package ready for delivery, and restocking expenses.""Only the biggest of retailers that are capable will be able to afford these operations,"" said Jarrett Streebin, the CEO of EasyPost, a shipping startup. He estimated costs per package could reach $20 or more with additional logistics processes and staffing to handle the orders. ""Who's willing to pay the bill?"" he asked.   (Editing by Stephen R.

139,"   By Nandita Bose and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Macy's Inc's (M.N) plan to open a virtual store on Alibaba offers a cheap way into China, but as the latest in a long list of initiatives to spur growth it could spread management thin.On Wednesday, Macy's said it has formed a joint venture in China with Hong Kong-based Fung Retailing that will start by selling products on Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd's (BABA.N) Tmall Global marketplace.The deal comes in the wake of Macy's plans to open off-price stores in the United States that will sell clearance products, start new stores that will sell luxury beauty products, and offer same-day delivery services in more U.S. markets than Amazon (AMZN.O).Macy's also is expanding a new loyalty program, localizing store assortments and trying to improve store service.""No one could accuse Macy's of being a company that stands still,"" said Neil Saunders, chief executive of retail industry research firm Conlumino. ""However, the question remains, Is the company biting off more than it can chew and is it spreading its management and investments too thinly?""     The China venture takes Macy's focus outside the United States, where the company has almost all its operations. Several analysts said Macy's U.S. strategic initiatives are taking longer than expected to deliver and that pursuing several opportunities simultaneously is hurting the company's ability to execute.  Sterne Agee CRT Research analysts wrote in a note that China and other strategies, including the plans for discount stores and to sell beauty products, muddy a clear strategy and raise the risk profile of the business.""What was once a clean retail story has become far more complex (and controversial) with negative comps and an assortment of unproven sales drivers,"" they wrote. Macy's chief executive, Terry Lundgren, said the joint venture with Fung Retailing offers a controlled way to build gradually. It will invest $25 million in the next 18 months.""The best idea is to test multiple things as opposed to putting all of your eggs in one basket,"" Lundgren said in an interview. ""Which(ever) of these platforms works the best, that's where we'll invest aggressively."" Macy's struggles to increase its sales have pushed the retailer to look for new avenues of growth. Sales at existing stores increased 1.4 percent in 2014, down from 2.8 percent in 2013 and 4 percent in 2012. On Wednesday it lowered its full year sales forecast for 2015 primarily because of a weaker-than-expected performance in the first half.Ken Murphy, vice president and portfolio manager at Standard Life Investments, which holds Macy's shares, said the China entry is ""definitely not a must have"" for Macy's as it looks for growth avenues but he thinks the virtual store model tested by the retailer has few risks. Virtual storefronts are becoming a preferred route for U.S. retailers to enter China cheaply. Several early entrants including Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Best Buy Co (BBY.N) left the country after building stores that failed to take off. ""I am glad I didn’t enter (China) earlier,"" Lundgren said. ""If I had entered earlier, I'd probably would have gone forward with physical stores, but because we've become so strong with our online presence, it makes more sense to enter with ecommerce presence.""(This story has been refiled to fix spelling of company name in headline) (Editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler)",2015-08-13,M,"Wed Aug 12, 2015 | 9:21pm EDT","As Macy's eyes China, some see need for more focus at home",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-alibaba-macys-focus-analysis-idUSKCN0QI03620150813?type=companyNews

152,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 11 (Fitch) An unseasonably warm autumn is leading out credit  default swap (CDS) spreads for Macy's, Inc. to levels not seen since 2012,  according to Fitch Solutions in its latest CDS case study snapshot. Five-year CDS on Macy's widened out 16% over the past week and are now trading  140% wider than they were at the start of the year. As a result, the cost of  credit protection on Macy's debt is at its widest levels since July 2012. After  pricing consistently in 'BBB+' space for much of the past year, CDS on Macy's  are now treading in below investment grade territory. 'In addition to the unseasonably warm weather slowing down winter clothing  sales, souring market sentiment for Macy's is likely coming from weaker foot  traffic at department stores,' said Director Diana Allmendinger. 'Earnings  announced this morning were disappointing with some of the decline attributed to  a slowdown in tourist markets, though digital growth is up.' Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

160,"  (In Nov. 11 story, corrects spelling of Michael in paragraph 4)* Seeks partnerships or joint ventures for flagship properties* 3rd-quarter same-store sales take unexpected fall* Shares down nearly 14 percentBy Nandita Bose and Sruthi RamakrishnanNov 11 Warm weather, low spending by tourists and a pileup of unsold inventory prompted Macy's Inc to cut its full-year forecast on Wednesday, raising wide concerns about the retail sector's financial health.Macy's in a quarterly report also said it would not create a real estate investment trust for its stores, disappointing some investors and helping to push down shares 14 percent for the day.The long spell of warm weather in September and October, which hurt sales of cold weather apparel like coats and jackets, could also affect retailers like Urban Outfitters Inc, while a drop in spending by tourists is likely to impact Tiffany & Co and Hudson's Bay Co, which runs chains like Saks Fifth Avenue, said Oliver Chen, analyst with Cowen Equity Research.Analysts also expect slowing sales of accessories like handbags, shoes and cosmetics to hurt brands including Fossil Group and Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. Urban Outfitters shares ended down 7.4 percent, Tiffany & Co closed 3.37 percent lower and Michael Kors and Fossil both fell over 4 percent.Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said on a conference call he was not happy with the company's performance in the quarter ended Oct. 31.Sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.6 percent in their third straight quarterly decline. Analysts on average had expected 0.2 percent growth, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Macy's said it expected same-store sales to fall by 1.8 percent to 2.2 percent for the year ending in January.The company cut its full-year profit forecast to $4.20 to $4.30 per share, excluding special items, from a prior range of $4.70 to $4.80. ""We are disappointed that the pace of sales did not improve in the third quarter, as we had expected,"" Lundgren said.Macy's slide in sales has lasted several quarters and Lundgren said the company would increase the focus of its turnaround plan, including product mix in stores and more experimentation with online sales.""We are wary of a drop in traffic but remain confident of the measures management is taking to fix some of its core problems,"" said Efrain Levy, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ who reiterated his ""hold"" rating on the stock. REAL ESTATE Activist investor Starboard Value had urged Macy's in July to consider spinning off its real estate assets, valuing them at about $21 billion. The investor had said a REIT would trade at a higher multiple than the stores.""We and our board concluded there was not enough value to be created from the establishment of a REIT at this time,"" Lundgren  said.Instead, he said, Macy's would focus on forming potential partnerships or joint ventures for its four major flagship properties in New York's Herald Square, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago, and downtown Minneapolis.

161,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Mounting inventory at Macy's Inc (M.N) portends a tough holiday quarter for U.S. department store operators as they compete with home improvement and electronics retailers for the attention of thrifty customers.Inventory was up 4.6 percent at the end of October - 3.1 percent on a comparable basis - after the warmest fall quarter in 25 years hit sales of winter clothing and footwear. A strong dollar also kept many tourists away from Macy's biggest stores.""We will need to liquidate this inventory in the fourth quarter so that we can maintain the flow of fresh new merchandise,"" Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said on a call after Macy's reported third-quarter results.A surprise drop in comparable sales for Macy's set alarm bells ringing in the department store industry, sending shares of Kohl's Corp (KSS.N), J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) down on Wednesday.All three are scheduled to report results this week, although analysts said J.C. Penney and Nordstrom are likely to fare better than Macy's, Kohl's could disappoint.A survey by Sterne Agee CRT showed that, in October, more consumers used savings from lower gasoline prices to pay down debt than bought discretionary items. Those still spending are buying more electronics than clothing and cosmetics, a shift identified by Chief Executive Terry Lundgren as contributing to a third straight quarterly decline in Macy's stores open at least a year.Macy's, whose flagship Herald Square store covers an entire Manhattan block, said it would need to discount to clear fall season inventories. Analysts said Kohl's was likely to follow suit, as weather is also a big factor in its sales.""Unless you enter the fourth quarter very clean ... it puts into jeopardy the most important quarter of the year,"" said Dan Hess, chief analyst at research firm Merchant Forecast. With November also expected to be the warmest in decades, some stores are hanging Christmas decorations later than usual, a subliminal message to shoppers to hold off on gift-buying until more of the fall season stock is cleared.""There's a danger to hanging the tinsel too early,"" said Hess.But the factors that weighed on Macy's should not affect J.C. Penney and Nordstrom to the same extent, analysts said. J.C. Penney gave a sneak preview of its performance in the August-October quarter, saying comparable sales rose 6.4 percent, which would be the biggest same-store sales jump in more than nine years.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Charles Grom said sales were being boosted by a greater number of the popular Sephora beauty outlets within J.C. Penney stores, as well as an improved assortment of home, children's and private-label goods.Nordstrom's broad fashion spectrum, from the priciest designer apparel to more affordable clothing, would help it to clear inventories quicker than some rivals, analysts said.

171,"  BOSTON Jan 19 David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital hedge fund ranked among last year's worst performers, told investors on Tuesday that he has made new bets on stocks including battered retailer Macy's and is currently concentrating on delivering better returns.The fund, which lost 20.2 percent last year, spent $45.69 a share for its Macy's position, a far cheaper price than the $70 where the company was trading last year, Einhorn said in a letter sent to investors and seen by Reuters. Einhorn wrote ""it wouldn't surprise us if a private equity firm teamed up with a REIT to buy the company and unlock the value privately.""  The fund manager also explained what contributed to this terrible 2015, where the fund lost money every quarter and bet that Netflix and Amazon, two of the best performing stocks, would fall.

172,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Macy's Inc (M.N) plans to open Backstage off-price stores within some existing Macy's, betting that the benefit of bringing new customers into stores outweighs the risk of diluting the company brand and undercutting sales of full-price items.Macy's on Tuesday reported a drop in quarterly sales that was less than feared and said it plans to open Backstage stores within 15 Macy's this year.  It will add one more standalone Backstage store this year to the five it has opened since September.Macy's Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said the new Backstage brand would test entry into the booming market for discount stores, which offer up to 80 percent off regular prices.Standalone Backstage stores created so far have not undercut, or cannibalized, sales at nearby Macy's, she said, adding that the new plan could do so.""When you open it in-store, the capital is less, but then there is also more cannibalization of the existing store,"" she said on a conference call with analysts following the earnings release.  But the Backstages will pull customers into Macy's, she said. ""We believe this could be an exciting way to drive traffic to our Macy doors, and to offer some price points and categories - for example, home decor or baby gear, toys, et cetera - that we don't currently carry at Macy's.""Some analysts said, however, that Macy's risked muddying its brand and undermining sales of full-price items.Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino, said the move could be ""quite dangerous,"" undermining Macy's efforts to sell at full price.  ""Macy's is very unclear about where it wants to go, what kind of brand image it wants to project,"" Saunders said.Macy's offers more discounts than chains such as Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), which will make it more difficult to distinguish Macy's from Backstage, said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar.Macy's does not break out sales for the Backstage business  but said it was ""in the very early test stages."" Operating a low-margin business within Macy's stores, which are often in high-rent areas, could also be expensive, analysts warned. ""If you look at a TJX (TJX.N) or a Ross (ROST.O), the model works because they put the stores in cheaper real estate areas,"" Weishaar said.However, putting Backstage in less productive Macy's stores, could help boost traffic there, said Dan Hess, chief analyst at research firm Merchant Forecast.

176,"   By Ramkumar Iyer  Upscale jeweler Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) reported a better-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter as it raised prices and benefited from lower prices of diamonds, gold and silver.Shares of the company, which became a household name due to the 1961 Hollywood classic ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", rose as much as 4 percent in morning trading on Friday. Weakness in the global economy and a strong dollar have hurt Tiffany and other luxury retailers such as Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), Neiman Marcus Group and Macy's Inc-owned (M.N) Bloomingdale's as tourists shy away from buying high-end items.  Tiffany's reluctance to offer promotions also prevented it from attracting local shoppers looking for deals, especially in the holiday season. The company warned that it expected profit per share to fall by 15-20 percent in the current quarter and by 5-10 percent in the second quarter, based on the trends seen so far. However, earnings are expected to start growing from the second half of the year ending January 2017, Tiffany said.  The company will launch more new products and it has been pretty successful with recent product launches, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ""Also, expectations were low and the stock's been beat up,"" he said, suggesting that Friday's rise in Tiffany's shares was a relief rally after a fall of 18 percent in the past 12 months. The jeweler's gross margin rose to 63 percent in the fourth quarter from 60.8 percent a year earlier as raw material, labor and marketing costs declined.  However, sales fell 5.6 percent to $1.21 billion, the fifth straight quarter of decline. Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 10 percent in the Americas, a bigger drop than the 9.4 percent analysts had expected, according to Consensus Metrix. Tiffany sales have also slowed in Greater China as fewer Chinese tourists visit Hong Kong, one of its most important markets in the region, Mark Aaron, vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call. In Europe, sales to tourists are expected to fall due to sociopolitical uncertainties, Chief Executive Frederic Cumenal said. Tiffany's net income declined 17 percent to $163.2 million, or $1.28 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31.Excluding items, the company earned $1.46 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Tiffany's shares were up 2.7 percent at $72.02 in late morning trading.

183,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Macy's Inc (M.N) reported a much bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales and slashed its full-year forecast, underscoring U.S. department stores' uphill struggle against slumping demand for apparel.The dismal forecast from the retailer pushed its shares down nearly 14 percent to a more than 4-year low, and also weighed on shares of rivals on Wednesday.Macy's forecast cut reflects increased pessimism on the consumer's willingness to shop for apparel and accessories over the balance of the year, Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell wrote in a note.Apparel sales were also hurt by unseasonably cool weather in late March and early April, when retailers usually launch spring collections.Macy's, whose profits have been shrinking for more than a year, said it would intensify cost cutting and monetize unproductive real estate.""They need to find a way to bring the shopper in the store, to have product that's emotionally exciting to the consumer, differentiated product that's not available elsewhere,"" Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Richard Jaffe said. Jaffe said 40 percent of Macy's merchandise is exclusive, while the rest is available at competitors and at lower prices.Macy's said it was working to boost sales by rolling out more of its Backstage off-price stores and launching exclusive product ranges, including a clothing and accessories line in partnership with singers Elton John and Lady Gaga.However, the company said it does not expect these initiatives to improve sales in the current quarter. Macy's will need to take decisive corrective action if it is to avoid becoming a retail irrelevance, Conlumino CEO Neil Saunders wrote in a note.    Shares of rivals Kohl's Corp (KSS.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), which are all expected to report results this week, were down about 2-7 percent.   Macy's same-store sales fell a steeper-than-expected 5.6 percent in the first quarter, while net sales declined 7.4 percent to $5.77 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $5.93 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, Macy's earned 40 cents per share, 4 cents above the average analyst estimate.Macy's said it now expects comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to fall 3-4 percent in the year ending January, from a 1 percent fall forecast earlier.The company also reduced its full-year profit forecast to $3.15-$3.40 per share from $3.80-$3.90.Macy's stock had lost 44 percent of its value in the past 12 months through Tuesday.

186,"   By Noel Randewich  U.S. stocks dropped on Wednesday and the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst day since February as feeble quarterly reports from Walt Disney, Macy's and Fossil undermined confidence across the consumer sector.The consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD fell 1.98 percent, notching its worst day in three months, with all but three of its 88 components losing ground.The biggest drag on the Dow, Disney (DIS.N) dropped 4.04 percent after it posted a rare earnings miss.Department store Macy's (M.N) tumbled 15.17 percent to its lowest since 2011, while watch maker Fossil (FOSL.O) sank as much as 34 percent to a 2009 low after the two companies slashed their full-year forecasts.Adding to gloom in retail stocks, Office Depot (ODP.O) slumped 40.39 percent and Staples (SPLS.O) dropped 18.34 percent. The two terminated plans to merge after a U.S. federal judge ordered the deal temporarily halted because of concerns it would reduce competition. All of the 10 major S&P sectors fell except for utilities .SPLRCU, which gained 0.24 percent.The S&P 500's decline undid gains from a rally the day before driven by Amazon.com (AMZN.O), the online seller that has caused so much trouble for Macy's and other traditional stores in recent years.  ""There is no pricing strength, there is no income growth and you have Amazon staring you in the face soaking up a lot of orders,"" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W.

187,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 11 Investors heavily discounted U.S. retailers on Wednesday after a series of disappointments in the sector, including a weak forecast from Macy's Inc.Macy's stock dropped as much as 14 percent to $31.82, the lowest level since December 2011, after the company reported a much bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales and slashed its full-year forecast.The stock helped lead a 1.5 percent decline in the S&P 500 retail index.The selling spread quickly in the sector as worries about the outlook for brick-and-mortar retailers mounted. Shares of Fossil Group fell 28.1 percent to $28.83, also following results and a weaker-than-expected forecast.Nordstrom was down 6.4 percent at $45.72, Tiffany & Co fell 5.5 percent to $66.82 and Target Corp  shed 4.9 percent to $76.11. In another blow, Office Depot Inc and Staples Inc  shares sank after a federal judge late Tuesday granted a request to stop their planned merger because of antitrust concerns.The retail industry has suffered from competition from Amazon.com and other online retailers as consumers' spending patterns have changed.""You heard one after another during the earnings season talk about the difficulties - they're cutting, they're closing stores,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. ""The fact of the matter is there have been questions about retail spending, and valuations overall in consumer discretionary were rich."" Last week, teen apparel chain Aeropostale Inc  filed for bankruptcy after years of losses.The retail weakness further dampens the outlook for the consumer discretionary sector, which after putting in the best performance of any Standard & Poor's 500 sector last year is up just 1.2 percent but still among the most expensive sectors relative to earnings. Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said retail stores may need to build up their online businesses or find a niche in order to boost sales.Macy's is trying to make money from its unproductive real estate.Without new strategies from companies, shares may need to sell off more to make prices attractive again to investors, he said.Macy's, which is down 8.5 percent for the year so far, trades at 9.7 times its forward earnings estimates, while Nordstrom Inc, down 8.2 percent for the year, trades at 14.9 times forward earnings, Thomson Reuters data show.By comparison, the S&P 500 is valued at about 16.7 times the forward earnings of its components.

188,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Macy's Inc (M.N) reported a much bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales and slashed its full-year forecast, underscoring U.S. department stores' uphill struggle against slumping demand for apparel.The dismal forecast from the retailer pushed its shares down nearly 14 percent to a more than 4-year low, and also weighed on shares of rivals on Wednesday.Macy's forecast cut reflects increased pessimism on the consumer's willingness to shop for apparel and accessories over the balance of the year, Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell wrote in a note.Apparel sales were also hurt by unseasonably cool weather in late March and early April, when retailers usually launch spring collections.Macy's, whose profits have been shrinking for more than a year, said it would intensify cost cutting and monetize unproductive real estate.""They need to find a way to bring the shopper in the store, to have product that's emotionally exciting to the consumer, differentiated product that's not available elsewhere,"" Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Richard Jaffe said. Jaffe said 40 percent of Macy's merchandise is exclusive, while the rest is available at competitors and at lower prices.Macy's said it was working to boost sales by rolling out more of its Backstage off-price stores and launching exclusive product ranges, including a clothing and accessories line in partnership with singers Elton John and Lady Gaga.However, the company said it does not expect these initiatives to improve sales in the current quarter. Macy's will need to take decisive corrective action if it is to avoid becoming a retail irrelevance, Conlumino CEO Neil Saunders wrote in a note.    Shares of rivals Kohl's Corp (KSS.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), which are all expected to report results this week, were down about 2-7 percent.   Macy's same-store sales fell a steeper-than-expected 5.6 percent in the first quarter, while net sales declined 7.4 percent to $5.77 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $5.93 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, Macy's earned 40 cents per share, 4 cents above the average analyst estimate.Macy's said it now expects comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to fall 3-4 percent in the year ending January, from a 1 percent fall forecast earlier.The company also reduced its full-year profit forecast to $3.15-$3.40 per share from $3.80-$3.90.Macy's stock had lost 44 percent of its value in the past 12 months through Tuesday.

Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) joined Macy's Inc (M.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) in reporting a drop in total sales in a quarter marked by weak demand for apparel - at their stores, at least.The department store operator also reported a surprise drop in sales at stores open at least a year, the first fall in six quarters for a company that has been a bright spot in a sector struggling with a shift in spending patterns.J.C. Penney's shares fell as much as 13 percent in premarket trading, but recovered most of that after the market opened as investors focused on the company retaining its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth and adjusted profit. ""JCP is making the right investments in home and appliances to try to mitigate consumer malaise toward apparel,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell wrote in a note, adding that the company had multiple drivers to return to sustainable comparable sales growth, unlike other retailers.Investors were also encouraged by the fact that the 0.4 percent fall in same-store sales reported by J.C. Penney was not as steep as those suffered by its rivals.    Shoppers are increasingly spending more on purchases such as electronics, homes, travel and cars than on apparel, a major source of revenue for department stores.Current spending trends are likely to continue in the near term, J.C. Penney's chief financial officer, Ed Record, said on a call with analysts.Chief Executive Marvin Ellison also cited warmer-than-expected weather in February as a negative factor.""Our over-reliance on apparel hurt us in times during the first quarter when weather patterns were not conducive to apparel sales,"" Ellison said. However, the company said sales started picking up in the last two weeks of April and early May.U.S. retail sales in April recorded their biggest increase in a year as Americans stepped up purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods, the Commerce Department reported on Friday.And sales at clothing stores surged 1.0 percent, the biggest increase since May 2015, the data showed.J.C. Penney's shares were down about 1 percent at $7.70 in morning trading. BIG MISS ON SAME-STORE SALES The 0.4 percent fall in sales at J.C. Penney stores open at least a year came as a shock. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected a rise of 3.3 percent.Still, Penney outperformed Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) on that measure. Same-store sales at Macy's, the biggest U.S. department store operator, fell 5.6 percent while those at Kohl's dropped 3.9 percent and Nordstrom's slipped 1.7 percent.J.C. Penney's net loss more than halved to $68 million, or 22 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 30.      But net sales fell 1.6 percent to $2.81 billion, the first drop in five quarters. Sales also missed the average analyst estimate of $2.92 billion.J.C. Penney cut its forecast for gross margin growth for the year ending January 2017 to 10-30 basis points from 40-60, as online sales increase and it starts to sell low-margin appliances at more stores.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Graphic: U.S. department store earnings    (tmsnrt.rs/1O2dOCo)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr and Sriraj Kalluvila)",2016-05-13,M,"Fri May 13, 2016 | 1:11pm EDT",UPDATE 5-J.C.

196,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In their great hunt for the consumer dollar, mutual fund managers are leaving the mall. Instead, they are buying shares of specialty retailers, such as work-gear maker Duluth Holdings Inc, handmade-crafts site Etsy Inc, and QVC-shopping network parent Liberty Interactive Corp - all strongly outperforming more mainstream stores as well as the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index.Now, with April notching the largest jump in consumer spending in nearly seven years, fund managers say they expect the rally in specialty retailers to continue because they are the most likely to withstand competition from Amazon.com Inc and have lower fixed costs than department stores in a time of rising wages.In contrast, shares of department stores such as Macy's Inc, and mall-dependent apparel retailers like Gap Inc, have plummeted as they report weak earnings and struggle to attract customers.  ""The biggest headwind for retailers is that there are too many malls and too many places to shop. The ones that we like are going into under-served markets or have some other competitive advantage to their peers,"" said Chris Terry, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management whose funds added new positions in Etsy and in Duluth in the first quarter.  Overall, department store sales per square foot are down nearly 20 percent since 2006 thanks to online shopping, according to real estate research firm GreenStreet Advisors. There are approximately 1,100 enclosed malls in the United States, and GreenStreet estimates that ""several hundred"" of them could close over the next decade. FOCUS ON STRONG BRANDS There are no indexes that track offbeat or niche retailers as a separate group, but the success on Wall Street of some companies in this space is clear.  Duluth and Lululemon Athletica each saw jumps of 10 percent or more in the number of funds owning them in the first quarter, while fund ownership of Macy's dropped 24 percent from the quarter before, according to Morningstar data.Shares of Duluth are up 82 percent for the year through Wednesday, and shares of Etsy are up 13.8 percent over the same time, compared with a 1.2 percent gain in the S&P 500 Retailing index. Apparel companies that have proven that they can be a draw without the support of a mall environment remain attractive, said George Maris, a portfolio manager at Janus. He began buying shares of yoga-apparel company Lululemon Athletica Inc in the first quarter after he saw a block-long line of customers waiting to enter a sale at a standalone store near his Denver office. ""In a very difficult consumer apparel environment, they are finding tremendous demand,"" he said.  Bob Burnstine, president of $4.9 billion fund manager Fairpointe Capital said it had bought shares of Liberty Interactive, parent of shopping network QVC. This was in large part because the company invests heavily in online retailing and focuses on impulse purchases and infomercial-style television advertising that drive customer loyalty.Susan Bao, co-portfolio manager of the $10.4 billion JP Morgan US Large Cap Core Plus fund, said she fears fickle consumer tastes and avoids apparel retailers. But she concedes that the right store in the right niche will reward investors, and cites Lululemon as a potential winner.""In retail, you have a pure stockpicker's market because these companies are either going to be haves or have-nots,"" she said.

As CEO, he plans to expand Macy's beauty business, particularly through the Bluemercury salon chain it acquired last year.As Macy's head of merchandising from 2009 to 2014, he focused on building Macy's accessories business, and handbags and watches remain among the retailer's top traffic drivers.

""We think a new perspective and leadership could be invigorating,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar wrote in a note, although she said the company's troubles were not the result of poor leadership.Macy's, like other department stores, has been hit by falling apparel demand and a strong dollar that has discouraged tourist spending, as well as growing competition from off-price retailers such as TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) and online-only retailers such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O).Lundgren launched a raft of measures over the past few quarters to counter falling sales, including shutting stores, opening off-price outlets. It also signed a joint venture with Alibaba (BABA.N), a move in particular that raised concerns that Macy's might be spreading itself too thin.The company has also tried to strike real estate partnerships, following pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP.

212,"  An Amazon.com Inc shopping event that the online retailer billed as its largest ever had a bumpy start on Tuesday, with some customers unable to add discounted items to their shopping carts and rival retailers aiming for a cut of the buying frenzy.The glitch, which affected Amazon's U.S. and UK websites, sparked outrage on social media with the hashtags #PrimeDay and #PrimeDayFail trending in the United States.Amazon said it resolved the issue, in which users faced problems adding some ""Lightning Deals"" products to their carts.""#PrimeDay is giving me nothing but add-to-cart fails. Nice job @amazon. Another #PrimeDayFail,"" Twitter user Prero Design (@PreroDesign) said in a post. The snag was a blow to a company that takes pride in its stable technology infrastructure. BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said the glitch potentially indicated a flood of demand for products on Amazon. The one-day sale for members of Amazon's $99-per-year Prime subscription service had been expected to generate up to $1 billion in sales, more than double the $400 million in extra sales made during last year's inaugural Prime Day, according to Citi analysts.But by mid-day Tuesday, U.S. sales remained in line with Amazon's 2015 Prime Day, according to a report from e-commerce software company ChannelAdvisor. Sales for the United Kingdom were up 11 percent from last year as of 12 p.m. EDT.Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, said the UK results ""could be indicative of where we end up,"" with more deals for U.S. customers scheduled to launch this afternoon. Still, the results are expected to pale in comparison with the more than $14 billion of total value of goods transacted during Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Singles' Day shopping festival in China in November.Amazon.com Inc shares were down 0.7 percent at the close of trading, while broad stock market indices were up 0.7 percent. Amazon devices such as the Echo voice-enabled speaker, Fire TV and Fire tablet were available at big discounts as were a host of other products from high-end televisions to shoes and toys.Several other U.S. retailers appeared to attempt cashing in on the hype surrounding Amazon's Prime Day event, by offering their own online midsummer promotions.Wal-Mart Stores Inc launched free shipping with no minimum order threshold on all items, touting products ""at or lower than Amazon's prices."" Gap Inc, Macy's Inc, Target Corp and others marketed midsummer sales as well.

213,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon's long shadow is falling on retailers previously thought immune to the threat of e-commerce, forcing U.S. fund managers to rethink their approach to consumer stocks by focusing on companies whose businesses cannot be upended by the online giant.At the core of the problem: Amazon.com Inc, once thought of as a place to buy books and household goods, is on track to become the largest apparel retailer in the United States by 2017, according to estimates from Cowen and Co, displacing department store operator Macy's Inc. Amazon's push into higher-end clothing over the last three years only adds to its dominance in e-commerce overall, with a nearly 40 percent market share, one that is larger than the next 21 retailers combined - a group that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc, according to research firm Slice Intelligence. Amazon shares hit a record high on Monday, day ahead of its Prime Day sales event. By market value, the company surpassed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ""Retail is a landmine and you just don’t know who is going to be disrupted by Amazon. You are seeing money rotate into names where people feel comfortable with companies that won’t be Amazon'ed away,” said Scott Moore, a portfolio manager at Buffalo Funds.  More has shifted his portfolio from traditional department stores and into companies such as Home Depot Inc, whose bulky, heavy items are hard to ship profitably, he said. Overall, actively managed large-cap funds now hold more restaurant, home improvement, and leisure stocks - all sectors in which Amazon does not yet compete -  than at any other time in the last five years, according to Morningstar data, while they have steadily cut holdings of apparel and department stores over the same period. The number of large-cap funds that own shares of Amazon, meanwhile, has risen 15 percent over the last three years.  Susan Bao, a co-portfolio manager of the $9.9 billion JP Morgan Large-Cap Core fund, said she no longer holds traditional retailers such as Macy's or Target Corp, and does not expect to do so again. Instead, she is focusing on companies such as cruise-ship operator Carnival Corp, which should benefit from an improving jobs market. ""This is one of companies that's going to do better when the consumer is in better shape that's also Amazon-proof,"" she said. Shares of Carnival are down 13.8 percent year to date, in part because of fears of the Zika virus, while Amazon's stock is up 10.8 percent over the same time.  Fund managers who are bullish on department stores say that Amazon will likely continue to dominate the retail industry even as Macy's and others expand their online businesses. Lawrence Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said that he expects Sears Holding Corp to fold ""within the next calendar year,"" sending more shoppers to rivals such as JC Penney Company Inc at a time when the company is in the middle of a corporate turnaround that has helped it produce solid same-store sales growth.

222,"  U.S. retailers are taking a cautious view of the holiday selling season this year - if their temporary hiring plans are anything to go by.Macy's Inc, which operates the namesake Macy's and Bloomingdale's department store chains, said on Tuesday it would hire 83,000 temporary workers for the holiday quarter, a 2 percent decline from last year.Retailers are keeping sales expectations and inventories low - and hiring light - ahead of the holiday season, to avoid a repeat of the last holiday quarter, when unusually warm weather led to weak sales and a lot of unsold goods.Target Corp said last week it would hire 70,000 in-store workers for the holiday period, unchanged for the fourth straight year. Kohl's Corp said on Monday it would hire more than 69,000 extra workers for the period, same as last year.U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers' biggest challenge in recent years has been tackling the growth of online retailers, specially Amazon.com Inc, which offer the same products at lower prices and have made shopping more convenient. Large store chains have invested in growing their online business, but that has hurt margins.Online sales are expected to take a bigger slice of holiday shopping this year, putting more pressure on big-box and department stores, said Neil Saunders, chief executive officer of research firm Conlumino. ""Against this backdrop of subdued growth and potentially lower margins it is not surprising that the big retailers are being cautious. They do not want to over commit on the cost front and that means keeping tight control of inventory and of staffing,"" he said.Macy's, whose sales have declined for six straight quarters, is the worst hit among the big retailers and has been shutting stores to cut costs. Last month, the company announced plans to close 100 stores by early 2017. It said in September last year it would shut 35-40 stores in early 2016. Macy's said on Tuesday it operates about 880 stores.Macy's has forecast full-year comparable sales to fall 3-4 percent, while Kohl's expects full-year sales to be flat or rise only 1 percent.

Macy's said on Tuesday that about 15,000 of its seasonal hires this year would be employed at its fulfillment centers that support the company's omnichannel sales - an increase of 3,000 from last year.The company will hire about 1,000 workers at its customer service centers and more than 1,000 to support the Macy's annual Thanksgiving Day Parade and other events, it said.(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)",2016-09-20,M,"Tue Sep 20, 2016 | 9:49am EDT","Macy's joins Kohl's, Target in keeping holiday season hiring flat",http://www.reuters.com//article/macys-employment-idUSL3N1BW3LW?type=companyNews

Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), reporting on Friday, were up 7.7 percent.Kohl's Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said he was encouraged by a strong back-to-school season and sales during October.Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren was also upbeat.""Our third-quarter top-line results were better than the first half of the year and our sales-driving initiatives continue to gain traction,"" he said.Macy's, which also formed a partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to look at ways it can cash in on the value of its real estate, said total sales for the full year would be better than the 2 percent decline it had previously estimated. ""The trends we saw in the third quarter give us confidence that we can deliver our expectations for the fourth quarter and our guidance for fiscal 2016,"" Lundgren said in a statement.Strengthening trends in Macy's apparel businesses, coupled with initiatives related to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) watches, handbags from Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N) and others, will help performance in the current quarter, he added.Macy's said that Brookfield would have exclusive rights to create pre-development plans for about 50 Macy's real estate assets, including owned and leased stores and associated land. UNDER PRESSURE The partnership, which is for up to two years, is the latest move by Macy's to squeeze more value from its vast real estate holdings across the United States.The company, under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP, is already exploring options for its flagship stores, including its famous Herald Square store in New York.Macy's has also said it plans to close about 100 stores, or about 14 percent of the total, representing annual net sales volume of about $1 billion. U.S. department store operators have been struggling to grow in the face of intense competition from online retailers, especially Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).Macy's net sales fell 4.2 percent in the latest quarter while Kohl's sales dropped 2.3 percent.Macy's same-store sales on an owned plus licensed basis fell 2.7 percent - but that was better than the 3.4 percent fall expected by analysts polled by consultancy Consensus Metrix.Kohl's same-store fell 1.7 percent, more than the 1.4 percent analysts had expected.But while Macy's net profit fell 85 percent, mainly due to a pension-related charge, Kohl's profit rose 21.7 percent. Both retailers have been closing stores and looking for other ways to cut costs as shoppers spend more on pricey things such as holidays and home improvement items and less on apparel, which accounts for most of their sales.Macy's sales have also been hit by a strong dollar, which has affected tourist spending at the company's U.S. stores, which include Bloomingdale's.Unlike Kohl's, Macy's has been focusing on its huge real estate holdings as a way to shore up its business.Since the beginning of 2015, the retailer has announced or completed asset sales with anticipated proceeds of more than $800 million.In its latest deals, Macy's said on Thursday it had signed a contract to sell its Union Square Men's building in San Francisco for $250 million and its downtown Portland, Oregon store for $54 million.Under the deal with Brookfield, the asset manager will create plans for real estate assets mostly in or near malls.""While we might close stores in some of these locations, it is more likely that we will create value with surplus land or through improvements alongside an existing store,"" Macy's Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said on a call with analysts.""This (partnership) should give us insight into the potential of our total portfolio,"" she said.Macy's said it now expected full-year comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to decrease 2.5-3.0 percent this year, an improvement on its prior forecast for a fall of 3-4 percent.Up to Wednesday's close of $38.38, Macy's shares had risen 9.7 percent this year.

Macy's shares ended up 5.6 percent and Kohl's closed 11.5 percent higher after executives noted that sales trends are likely to improve in the current quarter.Nordstrom raised its fiscal 2016 outlook to $2.85-$2.95 per share from $2.60-$2.75 to incorporate the better-than-expected third-quarter results.The retailer's third-quarter comparable sales rose 2.4 percent after drops in the previous two quarters as part of its anniversary sale, Nordstrom's largest annual event, shifted into the third quarter.Kohl's Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said he was encouraged by a strong back-to-school season and sales during October.Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren was also upbeat.""Our third-quarter top-line results were better than the first half of the year and our sales-driving initiatives continue to gain traction,"" he said.
