0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 16 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.34% return-on-asset (ROA) during the fourth quarter of 2013 (4Q'13),  according to Fitch Ratings. PNC's results benefitted from a release from  mortgage repurchase reserves, lower provision expenses, and a modest improvement  in spread income. However, these gains were partially offset by higher expenses.  The release of mortgage repurchase reserves was from previously disclosed  agreements with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the quarter, resolving  repurchase obligations related to loans sold between 2000 and 2008. Fitch views  these settlements favorably as it addresses a great deal of legacy  mortgage-related risk. With regard to core mortgage results, mortgage  originations fell 32% on linked-quarter basis. While better than other banks  reporting to date, the decrease for PNC was still expected given the drop-off in  refinancing activities.  PNC also reported a large increase in its estimated Tier 1 common ratio (CET1)  under Basel III, an estimated 9.4% CET1 ratio at year-end 2013, up 70 basis  points (bps) from prior quarter-end. PNC attributed the increase to lower  deductions from quantitative limits and improved AOCI from changes related to  pension assets, offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets. Fitch views the  improvement favorably as it places PNC's capital ratios much closer to peer  averages. Further, the company is well above its current guideline of between 8%  and 8.5%, likely paving the way for a higher capital request under 2014 CCAR  than the year before.  PNC reported a modest increase in spread income and a significant increase in  noninterest income, primarily due to the aforementioned mortgage repurchase  reserve release. Excluding this release, noninterest income was flat on a  sequential basis.  Lower mortgage revenues from smaller net hedging gains on mortgage servicing  rights were offset primarily by higher asset management revenues, driven by  stronger equity markets and growth. Also impacting linked-quarter comparisons,  PNC reported an $85 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Visa shares in 3Q'13.  PNC reported a 5% increase in noninterest expenses from higher incentive  compensation, a $50 million contribution to PNC Foundation, and higher legal  accruals, including the previously disclosed residential mortgage fair lending  joint settlement with the CFPB and DOJ. This fine related to legacy National  City Bank activities. Legal-related charges continue to weigh on results for the  large banks, though at much smaller level for PNC and the other large regional  banks in comparison to the money center banks.  PNC reported a 9bps decline in the net interest margin due to higher balances of  interest-bearing deposits at banks in anticipation of new regulatory  requirements, namely the October 2013 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) proposal.  PNC has not publicly disclosed its estimate of the LCR. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the net interest margin  (NIM), PNC's core NIM declined 7bps on a linked-quarter basis to 3.10%, which is  likely somewhat below the average for the large regional banks.  Credit quality continues to generally improve for PNC, and the company reported  still low net charge-offs (NCOs) of just 39 bps during 4Q'13. PNC's NCOs can be  a bit lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, ranging from 39 bps this quarter to 99 bps  in 1Q'13. Reported nonaccrual assets also declined 4% on a sequential basis.  Quarterly earnings benefitted from a loan loss reserve release with NCOs  exceeding provision expenses, though at only 5% of pre-tax income, it is not  considered to be a driver of quarterly earnings growth.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 16 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.35% return on asset (ROA) during the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14),  supported by lower expenses and credit costs, offset by lower repurchase reserve  releases and seasonality in fee income, according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch views  these results as consistent with PNC's credit profile, with ratings that remain  among some of the highest in the world.  Similar to other banks reporting to date, spread income declined during the  quarter, reflecting two fewer days and lower purchase accounting accretion  (PAA). PNC reported a sizeable 12 basis points (bps) decline in the net interest  margin (NIM) due to lower asset yields and less PAA. PNC expects that net  interest income will be down modestly in 2Q'14 relative to this quarter.  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the NIM, PNC's core NIM  declined 8 bps a linked-quarter basis to 3.02%, below the average for the large  regional banks. Although PNC's margin continues to compress, PNC loan growth is  solid and the company has good revenue diversity, with noninterest income  comprising 42% of revenues during the quarter, insulating the company somewhat  from a very challenging interest rate environment.    Noninterest income declined 12% on a linked-quarter basis mainly reflecting a  much lower mortgage repurchase reserve release and seasonal declines in fee  income. This was partially offset by a $62 million pre-tax gain on the sale of  Visa shares. PNC reported a sizeable 10% decrease in noninterest expenses from a continued  focus on expense management, as well as lower compensation costs, pension and  benefit costs. Last quarter's expenses also included a $50 million contribution  to PNC Foundation, and higher legal accruals, including the previously disclosed  residential mortgage fair lending joint settlement with the CFPB and DOJ. This  fine related to legacy National City Bank activities.  Credit quality continues to improve for PNC, and the company reported still low  net charge-offs (NCOs) of just 38 bps during 1Q'14. PNC's NCOs can be a bit  lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, ranging from 38 bps this quarter to 99 bps in  1Q'13. Reported nonaccrual assets also declined 5% on a sequential basis.  Quarterly earnings benefitted from a loan loss reserve release with NCOs  exceeding provision expenses, though at only 6% of pre-tax income, it is not  considered to be a driver of quarterly earnings. PNC continued to enhance its liquidity position in anticipation of new  regulatory requirements, namely the October 2013 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  proposal. PNC has not publicly disclosed its estimate of the LCR, though the  loan to deposit ratio is 89% at March 31, 2014. While Fitch expects this ratio  could rise as loan growth resumes to more normalized levels, Fitch expects PNC  will manage its liquidity position in a conservative manner, as it has  historically done so.  PNC also reported a further increase in its estimated fully phased-in Tier 1  common ratio (CET1) under Basel III, up 30 bps to an estimated 9.7% CET1 ratio  at March 31, 2014. PNC attributed the increase to growth in retained earnings  and higher AOCI, partially offset by higher risk-weighted assets. PNC received  no objection to its capital plan under CCAR, and performed well under the  regulatory stress testing relative to other large regional banks, with a minimum  tier 1 common ratio of 8.1% after proposed capital plans, which is a very strong  ratio in light of the onerous stress test.

5,"   By Nate Raymond and Aruna Viswanatha | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON May 29 The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan is investigating at least five banks over whether they overcharged the government for expenses incurred during foreclosures on federally backed home loans, filings and interviews show.PNC Financial Services Group Inc, PHH Corp, MetLife Inc, Santander Holdings USA Inc and Citizens Financial Group Inc, the U.S. unit of Royal Bank of Scotland , have all disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that they've received subpoenas. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office is seeking information on claims on foreclosed loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to records reviewed by Reuters.The subpoenas, coming years after the height of the foreclosure crisis, seek information about banks' foreclosure-related expenses, which generally include court filings and posting or mailing legal notices.""You've got a lot of people trying to clean up the servicing industry, but the truth is we are seeing the same servicing problems over and over,"" said Ira Rheingold, director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates in Washington. ""It was built into the model to charge as many fees as they could.""At least one of the subpoenas sent to a bank specifically asks about expenses by New York law firms, one person familiar with the matter said.The probe is being conducted pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, according to Citizens Financial, which on May 12 became the most recent bank to disclose receiving a subpoena. Passed in response to the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s, the law has become a key tool of the Justice Department in pursuing cases against banks. An earlier investigation by Bharara's office of the improper approval of FHA-insured loans relied on FIRREA as well as another law, the False Claims Act, and resulted in $1.1 billion in settlements with JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc and Flagstar Bancorp. In another case being pursued under FIRREA, Bharara's office has been seeking $2.1 billion from Bank of America Corp after a federal jury last year found it liable for fraud over defective mortgages sold by its Countrywide unit to Fannie and Freddie.About 10 percent of the loans serviced by large U.S. servicers between 2009 and 2012 were either delinquent or in foreclosure, according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. The total amount of the loans is between $6 trillion and $7 trillion.Representatives for Bharara, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees FHA, Fannie Mae, and Fannie and Freddie's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, declined comment. Freddie Mac spokesman Brad German said the company is aware of the investigation and ""cooperating fully."" PNC, Citizens, Santander, and MetLife declined comment. PHH didn't respond to requests for comment.PROBE OF LAW FIRMS In their SEC disclosures, three banks said they received subpoenas in May 2013. While the disclosures do not provide much detail on the scope of the probe, two banks, PNC and MetLife, said federal authorities are looking at foreclosure-related costs incurred by law firms. MetLife said the Justice Department is looking at its supervision of those expenses. Similar expenses are the subject of the separate probe by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, who is examining whether at least five local law firms misrepresented costs on a foreclosure and ultimately passed them on to prospective purchasers, investors, and taxpayers, in violation of Colorado consumer protection laws, according to court filings.Foreclosures generally cost between $1,000 and $3,000, depending on the state and type of foreclosure, with the bulk going to legal fees. Other expenses, including posting and mailing notices, court filing costs and title searches, add to the total bill.The law firms under investigation in Colorado allegedly represented expenses that were much higher than their actual costs, in some cases by hundreds of dollars. One firm charged $150 for posting a notice on the door of a property in foreclosure, even though the market rate for that service was about $25, according to the allegations.Another allegedly represented court filing costs between $42 and $224 more than it was actually paying.Since October 2011, FHFA has directed Fannie and Freddie to require mortgage servicers to select law firms that meet certain criteria. Previously, the two companies, which together own or guarantee about 60 percent of all U.S. home loans, had directed servicers to use only lawyers that appeared on a list of firms approved by them.

6,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 16 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.31% return on asset (ROA) during the second quarter of 2014 (2Q'14),  supported by strong fee income growth and lower credit costs, offset by higher  expenses and a continued decline in spread income. Reflecting a still uneven  economic recovery and a competitive lending environment, PNC grew loans only  1.4% on a linked-quarter basis, with commercial loan growth offset by continued  deleveraging in certain consumer asset classes. Fitch still views the quarter's  results as consistent with PNC's credit profile, with ratings that remain among  some of the highest in the world.  Reflecting an ongoing trend, spread income declined during the quarter,  reflecting lower loan yields and securities balances, and a reclassification of  certain commercial facility fees as noninterest incomes. Excluding the  reclassification of these fees, spread income was down 1.6% in 2Q'14. PNC also  reported a sizeable 14 basis points (bps) decline in the net interest margin  (NIM) due to lower asset yields and actions taken to improve liquidity, with 5  bps attributed to the reclassification of these fees.  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the NIM, PNC's core NIM  declined 10 bps a linked-quarter basis to 2.92%, below the average for the large  regional banks. Although PNC's margin continues to compress and below peer  levels, PNC has good revenue diversity, with noninterest income comprising 44%  of revenues, insulating the company somewhat from a very challenging interest  rate environment.    Noninterest income increased 6% on a linked-quarter basis mainly reflecting fee  income growth, in part due to the commercial facility fees classification  change. PNC reported additional gains on the sale of VISA shares in 2Q'14, with  $54 million in securities gains this quarter, down slightly from $62 million  last quarter. Excluding these items, core noninterest income was up 5% in 2Q'14  on a sequential basis.   PNC reported a 3% increase in noninterest expenses due to seasonally higher  personnel expenses and incentive compensation costs, as well as increased  marketing costs. PNC expects that expenses may be up low single digits in 3Q'14  relative to 2Q'14.  Credit quality continues to improve for PNC, and the company reported very low  net charge-offs (NCOs) of just 29 bps during 2Q'14. Reflecting the continued  improvement in credit quality, provision expense declined 23% during the  quarter. Quarterly earnings once again benefitted from a loan loss reserve  release with NCOs exceeding provision expenses, though at only 5% of pre-tax  income, it is not considered to be a driver of quarterly earnings. PNC continued to enhance its liquidity position in anticipation of new  regulatory requirements, namely the October 2013 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  proposal. PNC continued to maintain higher deposit balances with the Federal  Reserve, and higher borrowed funds balances. Borrowed funds have increased 23%  from a year-ago, with most of the issuance completed at the bank-level. PNC has  not publicly disclosed its estimate of the LCR. PNC also reported a further increase in its estimated fully phased-in Tier 1  common ratio (CET1) under Basel III standardized approach rules, up 30 bps to an  estimated 10% CET1 ratio at June 30, 2014. The increase was due to growth in  retained earnings and higher unrealized securities gains, partially offset by  higher risk-weighted assets and share repurchases.

8,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed PNC Financial Service  Group, Inc.'s (PNC) Issuer-Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook  remains Stable. The affirmation reflects PNC's strong risk-adjusted earnings  profile, stable and diverse business model, and its consistency of performance  through time.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS (VR) & SENIOR DEBT PNC's ratings were affirmed at 'A+/F1' and primarily reflect its strong  risk-adjusted earnings profile, stable and diverse business model, and  consistent performance through time.  PNC's earnings exceed the large regional peer average both now and through the  financial crisis, supported by high levels of non-interest income, a good  funding profile, and manageable credit costs. Fitch notes that although PNC's  core margin continues to compress and is below peer levels, PNC has good revenue  diversity, helping to insulate the company from a very challenging interest rate  environment. PNC enjoys a funding advantage relative to many of its peers, and  benefits from a strong deposit franchise, ranking in the top five in terms of  deposit market share in 80% of the 17 state footprint it operates in.  PNC's ratings are also supported by its consistent track record, which is  attributed to a moderate risk appetite. Legacy PNC generally avoided subprime,  Alt-A mortgage lending, higher risk home equity and credit cards. Fitch views  PNC's management team very favorably, possessing the appropriate level of depth  and expertise, as well as a consistent approach to identifying, monitoring and  mitigating risk. Fitch notes that most of its recent earnings volatility and  elevated litigation costs are related to its acquisition of National City  Corporation. Absent this acquisition, many of its litigation and mortgage  repurchase-related charges would likely have been avoided, and PNC would have  fared very well through the financial crisis. Fitch notes that PNC's loan loss experience is more consistent and better than  peer averages. While NPAs remain elevated for PNC, actual NCOs consistently  track below peer averages. PNC's level of reserves to total loans was the second  highest of the large regional peer group at June 30, 2014, which Fitch views as  prudent given above average loan growth, and relatively higher credit risk in  its securities portfolio than its peer group.   PNC's capital profile compares well to other large regional banks and considered  solid relative to its risk profile. PNC performed very well under the two most  recent CCAR stress tests. Given its advanced-approach institution status, PNC  will face volatility in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to  interest rate movements, needing an associated capital buffer. As such, Fitch  expects that PNC will manage capital conservatively over the near- to  intermediate-term.  These rating strengths are somewhat offset by some tail risk related to  mortgage-related issues including pending and potential litigation which Fitch  has very little visibility into, and future risk related to home equity  end-of-draws. Fitch notes that PNC has reported one of the largest increases in  its reasonably possible legal losses in excess of amounts accrued (RPL) RPL  among the large regional banks from a year ago. While visibility into ultimate  legal risk is very limited, this proxy for possible legal risk would suggest PNC  is still facing elevated litigation costs over the near term. Fitch views home equity reset risk as an industry concern, though somewhat of a  more acute issue for PNC than its other large regional bank peers given the  relatively large home equity book. PNC has approximately $6.6 billion of home  equity lines of credit (currently paying interest only) resetting to fully  amortizing loans over the next few years, potentially at a higher interest rate  environment. PNC discloses that the performance of those borrowers that enter  the repayment period is significantly worse than those still in the draw period,  with 8% of borrowers more than 30 days past due at June 30, 2014. While this  warrants close monitoring, PNC's reserves and capital should be sufficient to  withstand higher levels of related delinquencies, losses and modifications.  Further, PNC has been monitoring this risk for several years now, and it is  incorporated into the loan loss reserves. Since the HELOCs set to convert  relatively evenly over the next several years, this should allow PNC to  restructure or provision without any overwhelming burden on one particular year.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT As PNC is one of the highest-rated large regional banks, an upgrade is currently  viewed as unlikely over the near term. However, a sustained and meaningful  improvement in earnings that exceeds peer averages, without compromising the  company's risk parameters, which sustains a strong capital profile could lead to  ratings momentum over the long-term. PNC's ratings are underpinned by the stability in its strategic direction and  risk appetite. To the extent that PNC were to veer away from its historical  competencies, Fitch would evaluate any new strategic direction or increased risk  taking for rating implications. Viewed as also unlikely, there may be negative  ratings pressure if PNC were to report meaningful deterioration in asset  quality, coupled with weaker profitability metrics, or aggressive capital  management.  Fitch considers PNC's stake in BlackRock as providing an overall benefit to the  credit profile, since BlackRock's fees add an additional source of revenues to  the earnings mix. PNC may attempt to monetize some of its ownership in BlackRock  over time given the concentration risk that resides with such a large holding in  one company. BlackRock contributed approximately 10% of consolidated income in  1H14, and provided nice revenue diversification. As such, Fitch would monitor  any divestiture closely for ratings impact, as PNC's risk-adjusted earnings  profile is one of the key rating drivers.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   PNC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should PNC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for PNC given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that PNC may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  PNC has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, PNC is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  PNC's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by PNC and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from PNC or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by PNC and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in PNC's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of PNC's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with PNC's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to PNC's  business strategy and financial profile. These entities include: PNC Funding  Corp and National City Credit Corp, whose IDRs would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in PNC's IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of PNC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in PNC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of PNC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from PNC's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS PNC's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by PNC and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in PNC's long- and short-term IDRs.  Fitch has affirmed the followings: PNC Financial Services Group Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'; --Senior unsecured at 'A+'; --Subordinated at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'.

9,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 15 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.25% return on asset (ROA) during the third quarter of 2014 (3Q'14),  supported by solid fee income growth and lower credit costs, partially offset by  a continued decline in spread income. Fitch Ratings views the quarter's results  as consistent with PNC's credit profile, with ratings that remain among some of  the highest in the world. PNC's ratings were recently affirmed at 'A+' during  the Oct. 7, 2014 large regional bank periodic review.  Reflecting a still uneven economic recovery and a competitive lending  environment, average loans were flat from the prior quarter. Some of the decline  in spread income was attributed to a higher liquidity position as PNC increased  total borrowings in preparation for the phase-in requirements of the LCR. PNC  disclosed that it would be well above the 80% minimum on Jan. 1, 2015.  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the net interest margin  (NIM), PNC's core NIM declined 14 basis points (bps) on a linked-quarter basis  to 2.78%, well below the average for the large regional banks. Most of the  decline was attributed to increased balances at the Federal Reserve. Although  PNC's margin continues to compress and remains below peer levels, PNC has good  revenue diversity, with noninterest income comprising 45% of revenues,  insulating the company somewhat from a very challenging interest rate  environment.    Noninterest income increased 3% on a linked-quarter basis mainly reflecting fee  income growth, from higher asset management revenue, corporate service fees, and  deposit service charges. PNC reported additional gains on the sale of VISA  shares in 3Q'14, with $57 million in securities gains this quarter, up slightly  from $54 million last quarter. PNC has indicated that it intends to continue to  monetize its ownership of VISA shares, and as quarter-end 2014, still has  approximately $560 million of unrealized gains.  PNC reported relatively flat noninterest expenses, and has already met its  full-year 2014 savings goal of $500 million in expense savings. PNC expects that  expenses may be up low single digits in 4Q'14 relative to 3Q'14. Credit quality continues to improve for PNC, and the company reported very low  net charge-offs (NCOs) of only 16 bps during 3Q'14, an unsustainably low level  for the company and supported by net commercial loan recoveries. Reflecting the  continued improvement in credit quality, provision expense declined 24% during  the quarter. New non-performing loan (NPL) inflows fell to just $380 million  during the quarter, well below the amount a year ago or last quarter. Reserves  at 1.7% of loan losses will likely remain above the large regional bank peer  average.  PNC also reported a further increase in its estimated fully phased-in Tier 1  common ratio (CET1) under Basel III standardized approach rules, up 10bps to an  estimated 10.1% CET1 ratio at Sept. 30, 2014. The increase was due to growth in  retained earnings, partially offset by share repurchases.

13,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 16 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.23% return on asset (ROA) during the fourth quarter of 2014 (4Q'14) and  1.28% for the full year. Quarterly earnings were supported by decent loan and  deposit growth, growth in fee income, and a still benign credit environment.  Fitch Ratings views the quarter's results as consistent with PNC's credit  profile, with ratings that remain among some of the highest in the world. PNC's  ratings are primarily supported by the consistency of performance over time. PNC reported revenue growth of 3%, mainly attributable to the sale of its  Washington DC regional headquarters building, and additional gains on the sales  of VISA shares. PNC reported $36 million in VISA-related gains in 4Q'14, down  from $57 million last quarter.  Excluding these two items, core noninterest income increased 2% on improved M&A  advisory fees, partially offset on lower earnings on PNC's equity investment in  BlackRock and a drop in mortgage results. At Dec. 31, 2014, PNC's economic  interest in BlackRock was 22%.  While spread income fell slightly due to lower purchase accounting accretion  (PAA), core net interest income increased 1%, supported by commercial loan  growth, partially offset by continued pressure on loan yields and higher bank  borrowings and senior notes used to enhance PNC's liquidity position. Excluding the impact of PAA on the NIM, PNC's core NIM declined 6 bps on a  linked-quarter basis to 2.72%, well below the average for the large regional  banks. Although PNC's margin continues to compress and remains below peer  levels, PNC has good revenue diversity, with noninterest income comprising a  healthy 47% of reported revenues in 4Q'14, insulating the company somewhat from  a very challenging interest rate environment.  Expenses ticked up 8% on a linked-quarter basis mainly reflective of a  charitable contribution to the PNC Foundation, higher legal and residential and  mortgage compliance costs, and increased fixed asset write-offs. Excluding the  elevated expense items outlined above, core expenses rose 2%, in line with peers  reporting to date. PNC expects that expenses may be down high single digits in  1Q'15 relative to 4Q'14.  The credit environment remains quite benign, and while NCOs increased 44% in  nominal terms (reflecting higher recoveries last quarter), NCOs remained low at  just 23bps in 4Q'14. However, Fitch notes that even with the uptick in credit  losses, NCOs are likely at unsustainably low levels for the company and the  industry. PNC indicated that its through the cycle loss expectations are between  50bps and 60bps. With regard to energy exposure, PNC disclosed it has a total of $2.9bn in  outstandings to the oil and gas sector, or approximately 2% of the total  commercial lending portfolio. PNC also reported that just $300m in loans in its  oil & gas services portfolio of $1.3 billion were to sub-investment grade  borrowers.  PNC reported its estimated fully phased-in Tier 1 common ratio (CET1) under  Basel III standardized approach rules fell 10bps to an estimated 10% CET1 at  YE2014. The slight decline was due to growth in retained earnings, partially  offset by growth in standardized approach risk-weighted assets. In Fitch's view,  PNC, and its similarly-sized regional bank peers, will not be subject to any  capital surcharge under the proposed rules announced in early December.  PNC also disclosed that its estimated pro forma Liquidity Coverage Ratio was  100% and 95% at the consolidated and bank levels, respectively, at year-end  2014. This more than exceeds the minimum phased-in requirement of 80%, which  became effective for Advanced Approach banks on Jan. 1, 2015.

17,"   By Michael Flaherty | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Senator Richard Shelby attached his financial regulation relief bill to an appropriations markup on Wednesday, which passed a subcommittee vote, acting on a threat he issued previously if Democrats failed to offer a fair compromise.The Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, which aims to ease bank regulations and enforce greater transparency on the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators, passed the Senate Banking Committee in May with no support from Democrats.During the bill's drafting, Shelby said he could move the proposal through the Senate's appropriations arm if Democrats were not willing to hash out support. Shelby acted on that threat on Wednesday.The bill, however, is unlikely to win the support from Democrats needed to bring it to a floor vote in the Senate. The biggest beneficiaries of the bill would be small U.S. lenders subject to greater regulation under the Dodd-Frank reform act. Large regional banks such as PNC Financial Services Group with assets between $50 billion to $500 billion would also benefit, as they may no longer be subject to stricter Fed regulations if the proposal is signed into law. The ball also proposes significant changes to the Federal Reserve system.With Democratic support yet to surface, President Barack Obama is highly unlikely to sign the bill should it ever get to the Senate floor for a vote. On Wednesday, Shelby attached his bill to a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee mark-up of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which won approval. Shelby's appropriations tactic could give the financial regulation relief bill a better chance of passage, even though the move has already irked Democrats who fear that it goes too far in weakening supervision of the banking industry.

KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's strong earnings profile, stable and  diverse business model, and its consistency of performance through time. PNC's  earnings remain solid, and compare well with other large regional banks.  Earnings have benefited from diversified sources of non-interest income,  well-controlled core expenses and lower credit costs.  PNC's net interest margin (NIM) still benefits from purchase accounting  accretion (PAA), which added approximately 14 basis points (bps) to the margin  in the second quarter of 2015 (2Q15). Including the PAA, PNC's NIM still lags  many of its peers. Somewhat offsetting this dynamic, PNC generates a higher  relative proportion of earnings from non-interest income than the other large  regional banks. Noninterest income accounted for 46% of revenues in the first  half of 2015 (1H15), as compared to the peer average of 38%. PNC benefits from  asset management, corporate banking and consumer service fees, as well as its  22% ownership in BlackRock.  Noninterest income has also been aided by gains on the sale of the company's  Visa shares, which have averaged over $40 million a quarter over the last year,  or around 3% of quarterly pre-tax income. As of June 30, 2015, the unrealized  gain on PNC's Visa shares totaled roughly $600 million, providing the company  with the opportunity to likely sell down its holdings, and realize further  gains.  PNC's capital profile is considered solid, and roughly in line with other large  regional banks. PNC reported its estimated fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1  ratio (CET1) under Basel III standardized approach rules was 10% at June 30,  2015, well above the 7% threshold. Given its advanced-approach institution  status, it will face volatility in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)  due to interest rate movements, necessitating the need for an associated capital  buffer, which Fitch expects the company to maintain.   Although PNC is subject to the advanced approach, it will not be subject to  systemically important surcharge. Fitch also notes that PNC once again did well  under annual regulatory stress testing, with modest declines in starting and  ending capital ratios.  PNC's liquidity is good. At June 30, 2015, its loan to deposit ratio was 86%,  roughly in line with peers'. While Fitch expects this ratio could rise as loan  growth resumes to more normalized levels, we would expect PNC to manage its  liquidity position in a conservative manner, as it has historically done so. The  company also has access to a diversified array of funding sources. Fitch  believes PNC has sufficient sources of cash at the parent to maintain acceptable  levels of liquidity for the foreseeable future. PNC disclosed that its estimated pro forma liquidity coverage ratio was in  excess of 100% at both the consolidated and bank levels at quarter-end. This  more than exceeds the minimum phased-in requirement of 80%, which became  effective for Advanced Approach banks on Jan. 1, 2015.  The credit environment remains quite benign, and net charge-offs (NCOs)  decreased again, to only 13bps in 2Q15. Fitch notes that NCOs at this level are  unsustainable for the company and the industry. Given the commercial make-up of  PNC's loan portfolio, comprising 64% of loans, loan losses can be a bit lumpy  from quarter to quarter. However, PNC has historically reported lower loan  losses than peers, with less volatility when viewed over many years. This also  mitigates our concerns regarding PNC's relatively higher balance of  nonperforming assets (NPAs) than peers.  PNC has indicated that its through the cycle loss expectations are between 50bps  and 60bps. Given PNC's relatively stronger earnings profile, the company should  be able to provision at higher levels, without materially impacting earnings.  PNC exposure to the energy sector is very manageable. At June 30, 2015, PNC  reported $2.6 billion of oil and gas outstandings, which were down 10% from last  quarter. This represents less than 2% of total loans. PNC reported an increase  in commercial NPAs, but overall NPAs balances continue to improve.  Fitch views home equity reset risk as an industry concern. PNC has approximately  $4.1 billion of HELOCs (currently paying interest only) resetting to fully  amortizing loans in the next few years, potentially under a higher interest rate  environment. The performance of those borrowers that enter the repayment period  is significantly worse than those still in the draw period, with 3% of balances  30 to 89 days past due at June 30, 2015, and another 5% more than 90 days past  due, as compared to just 0.26% past due for the entire home equity portfolio.  While this warrants close monitoring, PNC's reserves and capital should be  sufficient to withstand higher levels of related delinquencies, losses and  modifications.  Fitch considers PNC's stake in BlackRock as providing an overall benefit to the  credit profile, since BlackRock's fees add an additional source of revenues to  the earnings mix. PNC may attempt to monetize some of its ownership in BlackRock  over time given the concentration risk that resides with such a large holding in  one company. At June 30, 2015, PNC had a significant unrecognized pre-tax gain  of $5.7 billion (excluding any liquidity discount or deferred tax liability).  BlackRock contributed 13% of consolidated income in 1H15, and provided nice  revenue diversification.  In June 2015, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) terminated the mortgage  servicing consent order against PNC, which is viewed favorably, and  representative of PNC's sound risk management infrastructure. Some of PNC's  peers were deemed to not have met all the requirements yet.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES PNC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a+' for loss  severity. PNC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while PNC's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of PNC Bank, N.A. are rated one notch higher than  PNC's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  PNC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of PNC Funding Corp are equalized with PNC's IDR reflecting  Fitch's view that it is core to PNC's business strategy and financial profile.  Fitch is withdrawing the ratings of National City Credit Corp. as the entity no  longer exists, and there is no outstanding debt.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR PNC has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, PNC is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With a long-term IDR of 'A+', PNC remains one of the highest rated banks in the  world. There is currently a low likelihood that PNC's ratings would be upgraded  over the near term. However, over time, upwards ratings migration would be  predicated on a superior earnings profile relative to peers, maintenance of  capital at appropriate levels, and consistent through the cycle asset quality  measures.  Conversely, a meaningful deterioration in asset quality, coupled with weaker  profitability metrics, or more aggressive capital management could lead to a  negative rating action, although Fitch currently views a downgrade as unlikely.  PNC is more exposed to home equity reset risk than its peers. While Fitch's base  case is that deterioration in this portfolio will not lead to outsized losses,  PNC's ratings may be vulnerable under a more stressful scenario in which  reserves prove inadequate and its mitigation plans for addressing the end of  draws are not effective.  BlackRock's operations are relatively low risk, with little balance  sheet-related risk. That said, any strategic missteps or operational errors at  BlackRock could create earnings volatility on PNC's profit and loss statement  since this ownership typically accounts for more than 10% of consolidated  earnings. A complete divestiture of its ownership of BlackRock would be  evaluated for any rating implications depending on the intended use of the  proceeds, and plans to generate the foregone recurring revenues. However, Fitch  views PNC's ability to fully monetize its ownership as limited, at least in the  near term, though we expect some incremental sales may occur.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for PNC and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to PNC's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to PNC's  long-and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should PNC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of PNC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in PNC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of PNC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from PNC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since PNC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.   FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: PNC Financial Services Group Inc. --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'; --Senior unsecured at 'A+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Subordinated at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'.

21,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 23 (Fitch) (This is a correction of a release published Oct. 5,  2015.  It corrects the short-term rating for PNC to 'F1' in the first sentence,  which was stated as 'F1+' in the original release.) Fitch Ratings has affirmed PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.'s (PNC) ratings at  'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation reflects the strong  earnings profile, stable and diverse business model, and its consistency of  performance through time.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.

The notice of appeal, filed on Wednesday with the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, came after a federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, last month denied PNC's motion for a new trial, rejecting the bank's argument that the jury was prejudiced by several errors made by the court.

25,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 15 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported $989  million in net income for 2Q16, up 5% on a linked-quarter basis, for an ROA of  1.11%. On a year-over-year basis, net income fell 5.3%. The results are in line  with Fitch Ratings' expectations for the company, which remains very highly  rated. Results reflected strong fee income growth during the quarter and lower  credit costs, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses and margin  compression.  PNC reported strong fee income growth, up 16% on a linked-quarter basis, from  higher client activity and seasonality. This is in line with PNC's prior  guidance of an increase between 10% and 12%. There were broad-based improvements  across all categories. PNC reported higher M&A advisory fees, securities  underwriting activity, loan syndication fees, mortgage banking and  payment-related fees. PNC also reported $51 million in negative valuation  adjustments primarily associated with private equity investments under the  Volcker Rule. The company has indicated it will continue to wind down its  portfolio of nonconforming investments as the Volker Rules goes into full effect  in July 2017.  The provision for loan losses declined 16% reflecting lower-energy-related  provisioning. PNC reported some improvement in problem asset levels and  consolidated lower loan losses. NCOs during the quarter remained low at 26bps  during the quarter. Fitch expects loan losses for PNC and the industry will  deteriorate from unsustainably low levels.  Non-interest expenses increased approximately 3.5% on a linked-quarter basis due  to higher variable compensation costs, which were partially offset by the  release of residential mortgage foreclosure-related reserves of $24 million in  2Q16. PNC continues to invest in technology and business infrastructure, and  disclosed that approximately 18% of the branch network now operates under the  universal model, as part of PNC's retail branch transformation strategy.  Spread income declined slightly due to a decline in purchase accounting  accretion, as well as lower core net interest income. Lower securities yields  and higher borrowing costs were partially offset by higher loan balances. The  net interest margin (NIM) declined 5bps to 2.70% during the quarter, while the  core NIM, excluding purchase accounting accretion, declined 2bps to 2.63%.  Loan growth was modest during the quarter at just 1%, with growth in large  corporate and real estate loans offset by lower home equity and education  balances. Compared to 2Q15, total loan growth was modest as well due to the  company's declining consumer exposure. PNC grew its commercial real estate  balances by a significant 16.3% over the last year, mainly in permanent lending  given continuing disruptions in the CMBS market. PNC reported some further deterioration in the energy portfolio. However,  energy-related provisions were $48 million during 2Q16, as compared to $80  million last quarter, while non-performing loan balances were fairly stable at  $293 million or 10% of outstanding related loans. PNC's exposure to the energy  sector is on the lower end of the large bank universe. At June 30, 2016, PNC  reported $2.7 billion of oil and gas outstandings, or less than 2% of total  loans.  PNC reported its estimated fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1)  under Basel III standardized approach rules was a solid 10.2%, up roughly 10bps  from the prior quarter. PNC received no objection to its capital plan under  CCAR, which included an 8% increase in the common dividend to $0.55 a share, and  $2 billion in share repurchases.  PNC also disclosed that its estimated pro forma Liquidity Coverage Ratio was in  excess of 100% at both the consolidated and bank levels at quarter-end, above  the phased-in requirement of 90% on Jan. 1, 2016.

29,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed PNC Financial Services  Group, Inc.'s (PNC) ratings at 'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The  affirmation reflects PNC's strong earnings profile, stable and diverse business  model, and its consistent performance through time.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT PNC's rating affirmation reflects the company's strong earnings profile, stable  and diverse business model, and its consistent performance through time. PNC's  earnings remain solid and compare well with other large regional banks. Earnings  have benefited from diversified sources of non-interest income, well-controlled  core expenses and lower credit costs.  Fitch also views PNC's company profile as strong, buttressed by its solid  deposit market shares, as well as diverse business model, with particular  strengths in corporate banking, middle-market M&A advisory, and wealth  management. Fitch characterizes PNC's risk appetite as generally superior to most large  regional banks. The stability of PNC's results through the cycle is a useful  indicator of risk appetite. PNC has both an earnings profile and asset quality  performance that have outperformed peers and also demonstrated less volatility  over the past 10 years. This is an important rating consideration and lends  support to these institutions' higher ratings. PNC's capital profile is considered appropriate, particularly in light of its  risk profile. PNC has been one of the most consistent banks in the U.S., both  from an earnings standpoint and PNC's historical loan losses. At June 30, 2016,  PNC's transitional CET1 was 10.64%, slightly below the peer median. PNC has yet  to exit parallel run, but it is anticipated the standardized approach will  remain the binding constraint. Given its advanced-approach institution status,  it will face volatility in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to  interest rate movements, necessitating the need for an associated capital  buffer, which Fitch expects the company to maintain. PNC has yet to publicly  state a CET1 target number, though Fitch expects the large regional banks to  have long-term targets of between 8% and 9.5%.  PNC's liquidity remains good. At June 30, 2016, its loan to deposit ratio was  84%, one of the lowest in the peer group. While this ratio could rise as loan  growth resumes to more normalized levels, Fitch would expect PNC to manage its  liquidity position in a conservative manner, as it has historically done so. The  company also has access to a diversified array of funding sources.  PNC disclosed that its estimated pro forma Liquidity Coverage Ratio was in  excess of 100% at both the consolidated and bank levels at quarter-end. This  more than exceeds the minimum phased-in requirement of 90%, which became  effective for Advanced Approach banks on Jan. 1, 2016.  Holding company coverage is also considered solid with approximately $4.8  billion in cash and short-term investments at the parent to cover $1.9 billion  in maturities over the next 12 months, as well as ongoing interest expenses,  common dividends, and preferred dividends. This does not even include $1.3  billion in bank dividend capacity. PNC continues to have good access to the  capital markets.  The credit environment remains quite benign, with just 27bps of loan losses in  1H16. Given the commercial make-up of PNC's loan portfolio, comprising 66% of  loans, loan losses can be a bit lumpy from quarter to quarter. However, PNC has  historically reported lower loan losses than peers, with less volatility when  viewed over many years.  Over the past 12 months, PNC has reported relatively modest loan growth both in  absolute and relative terms. The loan mix has shifted somewhat over the past two  years to a greater percentage of lower-yielding, but also lower loss content  commercial loans, as PNC shrinks its home equity and education portfolios. PNC  disclosed in public commentary last year how competitive lending particularly in  the C&I space had become, prompting the company to slow lending in this area.  The bank has grown C&I loans by just 2% over the past 12 months, as compared to  the peer average of 8%. Given Fitch's concerns regarding competition  particularly in C&I lending since the financial crisis, this is viewed as  prudent.  However, CRE lending has been relatively robust over the past year. PNC  disclosed that it grew commercial real estate balances by a significant 16% over  the last year alone, mainly in permanent lending given continuing disruptions in  the CMBS market. Fitch expects that the inherent credit risk in this newly  originated book of loans will be acceptable given PNC's historical track record  and sound underwriting practices. Nonetheless, Fitch will monitor this growth  for any deterioration upon further loan seasoning.  PNC exposure to the energy sector is on the lower end of the large bank  universe. At June 30, 2016, PNC reported $2.7 billion of oil and gas  outstandings and around $0.5 billion of coal outstanding balances, or combined  roughly 1.5% of total loans. PNC reported some further deterioration in the  energy portfolio in 2Q16. However, it is anticipated that any related loan  losses will present an earnings headwind, and not erode capital. PNC has approximately $3.3 billion of HELOCs (currently paying interest only)  resetting to fully amortizing loans in the next few years. The performance of  those borrowers that enter the repayment period is significantly worse than  those still in the draw period, with 3% of balances 30 to 89 days past due at  June 30, 2016, and another 5% more than 90 days past due, as compared to just  0.29% past due for the entire home equity portfolio. While this warrants close  monitoring, PNC's reserves and capital should be sufficient to withstand higher  levels of related delinquencies, losses and modifications. Further, home equity  loan losses remain very low, at just 24bps in 1H16, also an improvement from  last year.  Fitch considers PNC's stake in BlackRock as providing an overall benefit to the  credit profile, since BlackRock's fees add an additional source of revenues to  the earnings mix. PNC has been looking to monetize its ownership in BlackRock in  a tax efficient manner given the concentration risk that resides with such a  large holding in one company, but to this point, has been unable to find  anything that has been executable. At June 30, 2016, PNC had a significant  unrecognized pre-tax gain of $5.3 billion (excluding any liquidity discount or  deferred tax liability). BlackRock contributed 13% of consolidated income in  1H16 and provided revenue diversification.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES PNC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR for loss severity.  PNC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times for loss  severity and three times for non-performance, while PNC's trust preferred  securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two times for  non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles  and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of PNC Bank, N.A. are rated one notch higher than  PNC's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  PNC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR PNC has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, PNC is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With a long-term IDR of 'A+', PNC remains one of the highest rated banks in the  world. There is currently a low likelihood that PNC's ratings would be upgraded  over the near term. However, over time, upwards ratings migration would be  predicated on a superior earnings profile relative to peers, maintenance of  capital at appropriate levels, and consistent through the cycle asset quality  measures.  Conversely, a meaningful deterioration in asset quality, coupled with weaker  profitability metrics, or more aggressive capital management could lead to a  negative rating action, although Fitch currently views a downgrade as unlikely.  BlackRock's operations are relatively low risk, with little balance  sheet-related risk. However, any strategic missteps or operational errors at  BlackRock could create earnings volatility on PNC's profit and loss statement  since this ownership typically accounts for more than 10% of consolidated  earnings. A complete divestiture of its ownership of BlackRock would be  evaluated for any rating implications depending on the intended use of the  proceeds and plans to generate the foregone recurring revenues. However, Fitch  views PNC's ability to fully monetize its ownership as limited, at least in the  near term, but expects some incremental sales may occur.  Based on public commentary PNC has made regarding the regulatory environment,  Fitch does not expect PNC to be an active acquirer over the near term. Rather,  Fitch expects PNC to continue to execute on its strategy in the Southeast  markets, Chicago, and St. Louis, with initiatives to improve penetration and  growth in these markets. Any sizeable acquisition would be evaluated for any  rating implications.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for PNC and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to PNC's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to PNC's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should PNC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since PNC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: PNC Financial Services Group Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'; --Senior unsecured at 'A+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Subordinated at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'.
