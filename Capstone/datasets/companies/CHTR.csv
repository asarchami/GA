0,"  Jan 6 Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said Liberty Media Corp Chairman John Malone's offer to buy out the remaining stake in satellite radio company Sirius XM  was ""ludicrous"" and called for activist investor Carl Icahn to take notice.Nader, a Sirius shareholder, said on Monday that Liberty's $3.68-a-share bid was below the $4 where the company was trading a few weeks ago.Shares of Sirius climbed 6.5 percent to $3.80 in morning trading.""I am sure that I along with other shareholders in Sirius XM will be interested in a legal challenge to John Malone's company for lowballing Sirius XM's shareholder value,"" Nader said in a statement. ""Carl Icahn - take notice and interest.""It was not immediately clear how many Sirius shares Nader owns. Nor was it clear whether Icahn is a shareholder of the company, although he is known to take an active role at corporations in which he owns stakes, such as Apple Inc . A spokeswoman for Liberty Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Liberty Media, which owns a majority stake in Sirius, launched a buyout offer to the company's minority shareholders on Friday. The timing raised eyebrows since Liberty is also in pursuit of Time Warner Cable Inc. Taking full control of Sirius, which is expected to generate $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year, gives  Liberty the financial flexibility for other deals, its executives said.Liberty owns a large stake in cable company Charter Communications Inc.Meanwhile, Sirius' rival online streaming music service, Pandora Media Inc, said the number of active listeners rose 13 percent to 76.2 million in December. Shares of Pandora rose almost 10 percent to $30.30.

1,"   By Liana B. Baker and Nicola Leske | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Charter Communications Inc formally offered on Monday to acquire larger rival Time Warner Cable for $37.3 billion, signaling the start of what is likely to be a contentious battle for control of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.Charter, the No. 4 cable operator, proposed paying $132.50 per share - barely higher than where Time Warner Cable shares closed on Monday - consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock.Monday's offer is the boldest sign yet that cable billionaire and dealmaker John Malone thinks that new managers could do a better job running the company, which has fallen behind and underinvested in taking on competitors and on digital technology.Including debt, the deal is worth $62.35 billion. Time Warner Cable shareholders would get 45 percent ownership in the combined company.Charter said on Monday that it held discussions with Time Warner Cable, which is led by Chief Executive Officer Rob Marcus, but the company wanted a higher bid and talks have not been constructive.

""The purpose of going to the public is to talk to Time Warner shareholders and to ask them to consider how valuable this deal is and to ask management and the board to engaged,"" he said.Rutledge admitted that a hostile offer in the friendly cable industry where companies do not directly compete with each other is ""unusual"" but he said Monday's letter was necessary because talks have not progressed over the past six months.He said financing was in place and banks could sign commitment letters ""in a matter of days.""""Putting Charter and Time Warner Cable together makes it a premier asset,"" Rutledge said. Charter stock was up 1.3 percent in after-hours trading while Time Warner Cable shares were up 1.8 percent at $135.Rutledge declined to give an estimate on potential cost savings from a deal but said they were ""significant"" and they had told Time Warner Cable what they were. Reuters has previously reported that Liberty management had told investors that synergies could be as high as $700 million.Rutledge said Malone's Liberty Media Corp wants to retain its 25 percent ownership stake in Charter and has the option to invest equity in the deal.

Rutledge said he was not in talks with Comcast to get the No. 1 provider involved in the bidding process. ""This is Charter bidding for Time Warner.

On Monday, Charter took its approach public and proposed paying $132.50 per share, consisting of around $83 per share in cash and its own stock, in a deal valued at $37.3 billion that Time Warner Cable's board rejected.Annual synergies from a deal would grow to $750 million from $500 million over time, Charter said.

Charter also said it was aiming to secure committed bridge financing of $3.5 billion and would have to pay $600 million in fees, interest and expenses.Charter explained in its 30-page presentation how it would accelerate Time Warner Cable's customer and cash-flow growth, increase its margins and roll out higher Internet speeds. Time Warner Cable did not have an immediate response.Charter, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, said it can use its tax assets, about $7.8 billion in loss carry forwards to reduce a merged company's operating earnings and tax payments.

""This was Charter sending notice that they won't overpay."" Charter CEO Rutledge wouldn't comment on whether the company would consider a higher offer, and said the company would be disciplined about raising the bid.The letter was necessary, he said, because talks with the board had not progressed in the past six months.

12,"  By Soyoung Kim, Nicola Leske and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK Jan 15 A number of Time Warner Cable  shareholders would support a merger with Charter Communications Inc if Charter raises its current bid for the larger rival to $41 billion or more, according to people close to the matter.Charter on Monday formally offered to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 a share, or $37.3 billion, based on shares outstanding. Time Warner Cable's board swiftly rejected that bid as ""grossly inadequate"" and said it was open to a sale at $160 per share.Several large shareholders, including at least two of the company's top 10 investors, would back a sale to Charter in the $145 to $150 per share range - or roughly $41 billion to $42  billion - the people said on Wednesday.The shareholders told Charter and Time Warner Cable that they would not accept Charter's current offer, said the people close to the matter, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media.""(Time Warner Cable) has had a dialogue with the top holders. It's just a matter of price and $132.50 won't get it done,"" said one Time Warner Cable shareholder who asked not to be identified.A Time Warner Cable spokeswoman said in a statement ""our shareholders are confirming our position that the Charter proposal is grossly inadequate."" A Charter spokesman declined to comment.The price Time Warner Cable shareholders would seek also depends on how much cash Charter would be willing to pay. It has offered $82.54 a share in cash and the rest in its own stock - a proposal that would give Time Warner Cable shareholders 45 percent ownership of the combined company.Time Warner Cable has said it wants more cash and less  Charter stock, and made a counterproposal - a Charter bid of $160 per share consisting of $100 per share in cash and the remainder in stock.

19,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Charter Communications Inc, as it campaigns to win over investors in its bid to acquire Time Warner Cable, has suggested that a change in control could be a godsend to the often-disgruntled customers of Time Warner Cable.But if Charter is successful in its bid, customers of Time Warner Cable, the No. 2 U.S. cable provider, who complain about Internet speeds and video may not see improvements anytime soon. And if they're hoping that their bills will be smaller, they may be disappointed.Charter's track record has been on the upswing since Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge took over in February 2012 after leaving Cablevision. Rutledge, who spent two decades at Time Warner Cable, has vowed to ""improve Time Warner Cable customer satisfaction through quality operations, which results in longer average subscriber life.""The problem is that Charter's customer satisfaction scores are not much better than Time Warner Cable's. Charter noted on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday that Time Warner Cable had the lowest customer satisfaction scores, but it neglected to mention that Charter ranks second to last in three of the four regions for video.Time Warner Cable actually has a better score than Charter in the western United States, according to ratings firm J.D. Power.Customer service scores aside, it's far from a sure thing that any new owner - Reuters reported on Wednesday that Charter was in talks with Comcast about splitting some assets - might make customers happier, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said.""Cable companies are not exactly known for their customer service no matter what the brand masthead says,"" Greenfield said.SNL Kagan analyst Ian Olgeirson said Charter has simplified pricing packages that don't give consumers a laundry list of options, which could help Time Warner Cable. But in terms of Internet speeds or video service, he sees most companies as similar.Charter said its top tier Internet service is 100 megs in all markets. For Time Warner Cable, this speed is available in some but not all markets, such as Los Angeles and soon New York. Time Warner Cable plans to boost speeds in its top markets to 300 megs this year. Still, Olgeirson said Charter's pitch has some validity.""Time Warner Cable is generally perceived to be moving in a downward direction over the last couple of years whereas Charter is generally perceived to be moving in a slightly upward direction,"" he said.It's also true that Charter started from a low bar. Emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, Charter's market share is low compared to rivals and it suffered from under-investment for years, according to MoffettNathanson Research analyst Craig Moffett.NEW INTERNET PRICES? On the cost side for consumers, a combination of the companies could even accelerate changes that would raise prices. Executives of Liberty Media, Charter's largest shareholder with a 27 percent stake, have spoken out in favor of usage-based Internet pricing, a practice that could result in higher prices for heavy Internet users.Such a plan could easily be rolled out across Time Warner Cable's markets after an acquisition, especially given that since 2012 Time Warner Cable has offered an Internet pricing option on a metered basis. Over the long run, Liberty Media Chairman John Malone could pressure the combined company to adopt this model further or raise Internet prices, Moffett said.""John Malone seems to have a more aggressive strategy to move the industry towards usage-based pricing. Armed with Time Warner Cable, that would happen sooner rather than later,"" Moffett said.Charter has said it is committed to upgrading Time Warner Cable's service, something that would be supported by the increased capital investment that Charter said is a top priority. Time Warner Cable has also said it would invest more capital into the business this year. Charter has said it plans to improve Time Warner Cable's Internet speeds and video service by converting it to an all-digital signal, which allows more advanced features, including faster broadband Internet speeds.Time Warner Cable has moved slowly to roll out digital technology. It is currently converting its markets and is already digital in New York.Charter is planning to go all digital by the end of the year.As for Charter's proposed changes, Moffett said, ""It's not clear that Rob Marcus won't do the same thing now that he's the CEO,"" referring to Time Warner Cable's chief who took over January 1.If Charter does increase its capital investment, Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said it could ""be very good for the customer in the long term,"" but in the short term he doesn't foresee much change.Customers also aren't sure which company would be better.Charter customer John-Paul Hunt said he pays about $50 a month for Internet service in Woodsville, New Hampshire, which he said is reliable and fast. The 33-year-old IT consultant doesn't pay for TV service because he can't stand commercials. Up until August, he used Time Warner Cable in a neighboring town at his girlfriend's house, which he said also had good service.""I don't know which is better, but I do like the idea of having more than one cable company floating around,"" Hunt said.(Reporting by Liana B.

Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Charter Communications Inc reached out to Comcast Corp this week about teaming up to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, after the larger rival rejected its $37.3 billion takeover bid, according to people familiar with the matter.Charter approached Comcast on Wednesday to discuss carving up the second-largest U.S. cable company's systems and subscribers, the people said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media.Charter, the No. 4 U.S. cable provider, and Comcast, the top U.S. cable provider, are in preliminary discussions about how to structure a potential alliance, the people said. One possibility is that Charter buys all of Time Warner Cable and sells off some of its markets and subscribers to Comcast, one of the people said.It was not immediately clear which geographic markets are under discussion, but analysts have said that Comcast would be interested in Time Warner Cable's largest markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Dallas.The two companies held similar discussions late last year but those talks did not progress at that time. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter declined to comment.A successful tie-up would take out Comcast from the bidding for Time Warner Cable. Comcast, which has also evaluated a takeover bid for all of Time Warner Cable, was seen as the only likely suitor besides Charter. Analysts have said any attempt to merge the two largest cable operators, however, would face tough scrutiny from U.S. regulators.Securing backing from Comcast could also allow Charter, with a market capitalization of around $14 billion, to pay more for Time Warner Cable, which has a much larger market value of $38 billion.Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp, formally announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Monday, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low.

Antitrust experts agreed, however, that any approval - particularly for Comcast - would almost certainly come with strings attached.In particular, the FCC could require the companies to treat all traffic the same, which means that companies such as Comcast with lots of content would be deterred from charging customers more if they watch movies or shows owned by other providers, such as Netflix Inc.That is no small matter.

24,"   By Natalie Harrison, Danielle Robinson and Michelle Sierra  NEW YORK, Jan 17 (IFR/RLPC) - Charter Communications  will test the capacity of the high-yield bond and leveraged loan market the way Verizon did in investment-grade if it is successful in its attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable (TWC).Its USD37.3bn hostile bid, based on an offer of USD132.50 a share, would require as much as USD24bn in debt financing.Although the details of the package still need to be ironed out, and could change if Charter increases its rejected offer or joins up with a rival such as Comcast, it will probably be structured as a Double B type credit with about six times leverage, bankers said.Regardless of the fine-tuning, the bonds and loans each have the potential to be record-breakers in terms of size. The bond component will probably overtake Sprint's USD6.5bn deal that was priced last year as the largest ever junk bond, while the loan piece could surpass HJ Heinz's USD9.5bn loan from last year - and even Clear Channel's USD10.7bn deal from 2008.With about USD60bn in debt, the combined company would also become the biggest high-yield issuer in the market - larger even than Telecom Italia - raising some questions as to how much investors will be able to own in the name.Despite this, bankers are confident the deal can be done - likening it to the USD28bn buyout of Heinz last year by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which needed about USD14bn of new debt.Even another big potential deal in the market requiring jumbo financing shouldn't matter, something bankers have to consider given speculation that Sprint  - 80% owned by SoftBank Corp - may bid for T-Mobile.""This isn't going to be a seven times leveraged deal with no equity. It will have a Double B type capital structure, and investors say they need deals like this in size,"" said one debt capital markets banker. As one investor put it: ""The market is wide open.""PLAYING AROUND Charter, rated Ba3/BB- by Moody's and S&P, described the financing package as ""prudent, with a longer tenor than Charter today and low cost"".It has fully negotiated USD20.5bn in new debt and a USD3.5bn bridge loan with its four banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs - and would also need to refinance existing debt of both companies if the deal goes through. ""There's bound to be a lot of playing around to see where the company can get the most benefit and the cheapest cost of capital,"" said one analyst.That almost certainly means that TWC's existing USD25bn bonds will stay in place. Currently rated Baa2/BBB/BBB, those bonds will be the cheapest debt Charter will have at its disposal, though they will almost certainly fall to junk status.Moody's is so far the only agency to place the ratings of the companies on review for downgrade.""I can't see any reason why those bonds will not be left in the capital structure. Just as in the Heinz buyout, they will be subordinated, and the new bonds will come in above them,"" said another leveraged finance banker. ""It makes no sense to take them out. They not only provide cheap debt, but they limit the amount of new debt that has to be raised.""With no change of control language in those bonds, their prices in secondary trading have sunk. In fact, they have been trading more like a Ba1 entity since talk of a bid first emerged last summer.There is some protection for bondholders that will affect the structure of the bond financing, but it's pretty negligible. Moody's reckons that only USD4bn-USD5bn of new secured debt can be added to the new capital structure due to indentures on the TWC bonds that cap the amount of additional liens of secured debt.The bottom line, though, is that this is just the first round of what is inevitably going to be a long process.Major TWC shareholders have said they would be receptive to a higher offer, but there's also a chance that other cable players such as Cox could surface with rival bids.Then there's Liberty Media. Analysts at CreditSights say Liberty could inject USD4bn to USD5bn of cash into Charter in order to maintain a 27% stake in the combined Charter/TWC entity - a move that would limit the amount of debt Charter would have to raise.Liberty has several pockets of liquidity it could tap, they say, including margin loans and the ability to raise incremental funds at SIRI. A cash injection of that magnitude could keep the Charter leverage only modestly above five times, with a quick roadmap back below that level through growth and synergies, CreditSights said.As the first analyst said: ""Whatever happens, TWC is now fully in play.""",2014-01-17,CHTR,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 9:47am EST",Debt markets braced for Charter test,http://www.reuters.com//article/charter-timewarnercable-debt-idUSL5N0KR28F20140117?type=companyNews
25,"   By Nicola Leske, Soyoung Kim and Michael Erman | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Time Warner Cable TWC.N is borrowing a tactic from a three-year-old takeover battle as it seeks to fend off Charter Communications Inc's (CHTR.O) $37.3 billion unsolicited bid.Time Warner Cable, by publicly naming the price at which it would reconsider its firm opposition to Charter's takeover bid, is following the example of Airgas Inc ARG.N, which successfully repelled Air Products and Chemicals Inc (APD.N) in 2011 by putting forth a high number for the suitor to reach.In the earlier case, the industrial-gas supplier responded to a $70 per share offer from its rival by saying it would not sell for less than $78 per share. Air Products walked away.Similarly, Time Warner Cable is saying no to the current offer, but not never to any deal. While rejecting Charter's $132.50 per share bid as too low last week, the company simultaneously said it would be willing to accept a bid at $160 per share.Time Warner Cable has put itself in a strong early position by suggesting an immediate counteroffer, deal lawyers and other people watching the situation closely say. The price immediately sets market expectations higher and forces Charter to make the next move.""That's given Time Warner Cable some standing, to say that we're not just digging in our heels. We're defending you, our shareholders, from an inadequate offer,"" said a top mergers and acquisitions lawyer who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media.The cable provider's lack of interest in a bid below what it cited leaves Charter with the option of raising its offer to get a deal done on a friendly basis or nominating a slate of directors to Time Warner Cable's board in order to launch a tender offer.WEAKER DEFENSE Still, there is one key difference between the defense of Time Warner Cable and Airgas: The chemical company elects only a minority of its board each year. Even with shareholder support, an unsolicited bidder would have needed at least two years to gain the majority position necessary to force a deal through - too long for most bidders to stomach.All of Time Warner Cable's directors stand for election every year, so Charter could conceivably try to sell the merits of a deal below $160 a share to Time Warner Cable shareholders. ""Even if a majority of (Airgas) stockholders wanted to tender in favor, they couldn't force Air Products to hang around long enough,"" said Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School. ""Time Warner can't do that ... because if Charter runs a proxy contest, it can replace the entire board.""Time Warner Cable's shares are trading at around $135, above Charter's offer and indicating investors expect the bidding to go higher. A number of large shareholders would not support the current price but are open to a deal if Charter sweetens its bid to the $145 to $150 per share range, Reuters reported last week.Most investors expect any sweetener from Charter will fall short of Time Warner Cable's asking price, raising the specter of a proxy battle. Charter has until February 15 to nominate a slate of directors if it wants to go that route.Time Warner would then have to pitch its $160 a share target not to Charter but to shareholders. Of course any new board that resulted from a proxy fight would not necessarily vote differently from the old board.Air Products managed to add three directors to Airgas' board, only to see those directors side with Airgas. All directors must act in the best interests of the company and would be mindful of potential legal challenges, deal lawyers say. ""That slate does have duties to all shareholders and would have to be comfortable in its own right that the deal is a good one,"" said Patrick Quick, partner at Milwaukee-based law firm Foley & Lardner.If Time Warner Cable can make a compelling case for its holdout bid, ""they can withstand almost anything from Malone - other than him hitting their number,"" said the M&A lawyer, referring to John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media Corp(LMCA.O).Malone is trying to use Liberty's 27 percent stake in Charter to consolidate the U.S. cable industry.RATIONALE FOR $160  Time Warner Cable has argued that $160 per share is in line with the valuations of other recent cable deals.According to the cable company's presentation last week, Charter is only offering to pay 7.2 times estimated forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Time Warner Cable says that every other large cable company bought in the last four years commanded values of 8 times forward EBITDA or higher. Its own counteroffer represents 8.2 times.When Liberty bought 27 percent of Charter in March, it paid a price representing about 8.6 times forward EBITDA, according to Time Warner Cable. Just a month before the Liberty deal, Charter itself paid $1.6 billion for small cable operator Bresnan at about 8 times.Because Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S. cable operator after Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), considers itself the biggest and best M&A option available, it believes it should command more, not less. Other companies, such as Cox Communications and Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N, are smaller and remain family-controlled.Some board members had argued for demanding a higher price from Charter, according to people close to the matter.By putting forward a high counteroffer so early, the company could be trying to show that Charter is hoping to buy Time Warner on the cheap.""A lot of time when the targets don't counter or put that number on the table - and frankly, they rarely do - then there's an argument you have a bidder: 'Oh, look at these guys, they're not willing to do anything,'"" said a second corporate lawyer, who asked not to be named because of potential conflicts. ""Putting a counter out is a big frigging negotiating move. They are empowered when they do that.""Charter has argued that Time Warner Cable's EBITDA valuation does not necessarily apply here because unlike other previous cable deals, their offer is in cash and stock, providing potential upside to Time Warner Cable investors who would own roughly 45 percent of the merged company.(Reporting by Nicola Leske, Soyoung Kim, Michael Erman and Liana Baker in New York; Editing by Christian Plumb and Prudence Crowther)",2014-01-22,CHTR,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 5:46pm EST",Time Warner Cable mimics an Airgas negotiating move,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-timewarnercable-airgas-idUSBREA0L28M20140122?type=companyNews

30,"   By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker  Charter Communications Inc has hired proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A as it gears up for a potential proxy fight at takeover target Time Warner Cable Inc, according to people familiar with the matter.Charter is looking to nominate a new slate of directors to replace Time Warner Cable's board after the larger rival rejected its $37.3 billion unsolicited takeover bid.The one-month window to nominate a new slate expires in mid-February for the annual shareholder meeting in May.Charter and its largest investor Liberty Media Corp are searching for candidates, the people said on Friday, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media.Representatives for Charter, Liberty Media and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Friday. Innisfree could not be immediately reached for comment. While bankers and lawyers put together mergers, proxy solicitors help companies or major investors persuade shareholders to accept or reject those deals. They are responsible for identifying companies' shareholders and devising messages to help sway their votes.Their role is most important in situations like proxy fights, where shareholders are to vote on competing slates of board nominees.Charter is wrapping up a two-week road show, holding meetings with Time Warner Cable shareholders all over the country.

31,"   By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. Baker  Jan 24 Charter Communications Inc has hired proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A as it gears up for a potential proxy fight at takeover target Time Warner Cable Inc , according to people familiar with the matter.Charter is looking to nominate a new slate of directors to replace Time Warner Cable's board after the larger rival rejected its $37.3 billion unsolicited takeover bid.The one-month window to nominate a new slate expires in mid-February for the annual shareholder meeting in May.Charter and its largest investor Liberty Media Corp  are searching for candidates, the people said on Friday, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media.Representatives for Charter, Liberty Media and Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Friday. Innisfree could not be immediately reached for comment. While bankers and lawyers put together mergers, proxy solicitors help companies or major investors persuade shareholders to accept or reject those deals. They are responsible for identifying companies' shareholders and devising messages to help sway their votes.Their role is most important in situations like proxy fights, where shareholders are to vote on competing slates of board nominees.Charter is wrapping up a two-week road show, holding meetings with Time Warner Cable shareholders all over the country.

Its free cash flow this year will be flat at $2.5 billion.The company said it lost 217,000 video subscribers in the quarter, which was an improvement from the third quarter when it lost more than 300,000 subscribers, but was worse than Wall Street estimates of a loss of 206,200 subscribers.Time Warner Cable's finance chief Arthur Minson said on the call that some of Time Warner Cable's subscriber numbers in 2013 were ""dismal"" but said the company was now seeing some momentum in 2014.In the fourth quarter, the U.S. cable operator added 39,000 net residential Internet subscribers, a turnaround from a weak third quarter when it lost 24,000 subscribers.Net income attributable to Time Warner Cable rose 5 percent to $540 million, or $1.89 per share, in the fourth quarter, from $513 million, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose about 2 percent to $5.58 billion.Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.73 per share on revenue of $5.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.",2014-01-30,CHTR,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 11:13am EST",UPDATE 3-Time Warner Cable charts path while rebuffing Charter,http://www.reuters.com//article/timewarnercable-results-idUSL3N0L43N820140130?type=companyNews
42,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK As Charter Communications Inc campaigns for investor support for its $37.3 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc, Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge and his turnaround skills are front and center of that effort.But Rutledge's track record as chief operating officer of Cablevision Systems Corp from 2004 to 2011 shows that he may not be quite the miracle worker that allies like to portray him as.In meetings with Time Warner Cable shareholders, Rutledge, 60, and his management team have pledged to revive the fortunes of the second-largest U.S. cable operator. Time Warner Cable suffers from one of the industry's poorest customer service records, has lost subscribers at a higher rate than other large operators, and lags in the rollout of new technology.In contrast, Rutledge has pointed to his successes at Charter, where he has stemmed some subscriber losses and boosted its fortunes since he was appointed CEO in February 2012, thanks in part to measures he put in place to simplify pricing and improve video technology.Rutledge's performance at Cablevision, however, was more mixed, especially near the end of his tenure. While he was at the Bethpage, New York-based company, it increased its market share to industry-leading penetration rates, but by the time of his departure, total customer growth had stalled, with many customers defecting to Verizon Communications Inc's FiOS video service.Cablevision's stock, which roughly doubled during his first seven years as COO, fell 15 percent in 2011. The Dolan family, Cablevision's controlling shareholder, took on a more active role and made some management changes. In December of that year, Rutledge resigned.""Rutledge has this halo around him that I think is somewhat suspect. There was frankly a lot of low hanging fruit at the time in terms of driving data penetration and capturing voice share,"" said Brean Capital analyst Todd Mitchell. ""He has a halo because of what he did there but it did not last beyond him and it looks like it was coming apart before he left.""Mitchell said he is skeptical that Charter can turn around Time Warner Cable, pointing to tough competition from Verizon's FiOS in its largest market, New York. While Time Warner Cable's share price has increased almost five fold since it was spun off from Time Warner Inc in 2009, the operator's growth has matured in many of its territories.A Charter spokesman declined to make Rutledge available for an interview. ""Tom's operational performance as COO of Cablevision ... and CEO of Charter Communications for the past two years is on full display,"" the spokesman said, adding that Charter's management team is focused on its turnaround.LOADING UP ON DEBT To pay Time Warner Cable shareholders, Charter has said it will raise about $25 billion in debt and bring the combined company's leverage ratio - a measure of indebtedness - to five times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), higher than Time Warner Cable's current ratio of about three times. Time Warner Cable shareholders will also receive Charter shares as part of the potential deal, so they are not cashing out completely and will need to be convinced that Rutledge can deliver on promises to make the combined company grow.Rutledge has told shareholders that there will be about $500 million in synergies in the first year, and that he will employ much of the strategy he has at Charter. He has said he will introduce a better pricing scheme, make Time Warner Cable's systems all-digital, which should make the product more advanced, and also improve customer service, an area in which the company has traditionally scored low in consumer surveys.Rutledge is credited with being an expert at managing fleets of workers in the field, improving customer service and pioneering the concept of the ""triple play,"" the combination of Internet, video and phone service that became the marketing standard in the industry.He joined Cablevision as the president of cable and communications in 2002, after he was passed over at Time Warner Cable for a CEO position that went to Glenn Britt. Cablevision was already enjoying rapid growth in its tightly clustered market outside of New York City, but Rutledge helped it expand into Internet and voice services through the ""triple play"" offering.Rutledge was paid well for his performance - $23 million in 2011, $28 million in 2010 and $26 million in 2009. He was viewed as a ""rock star"" inside Cablevision, according to former colleagues, and commuted to work from Connecticut via a helicopter provided by the company. Still, Rutledge had a down-to-earth manner and often showed respect for cable workers in the field since he started himself as a trainee at a company that later became part of Time Warner Cable. FIERCE COMPETITION Rutledge, who loves to ski and owns a home in Colorado, also has a reputation as a tough negotiator. Cablevision fought high-profile battles with media companies over fees the cable company had to pay to carry their content - and those fights sometimes cost the company subscribers.In 2010, Cablevision lost 35,000 subscribers after a fee dispute with Fox caused it to blackout Cablevision during Major League Baseball's World Series.By 2011, analysts say Rutledge had fallen out of favor with the Dolan family, especially CEO James Dolan.The Federal Communications Commission published a report, entitled ""Measuring Broadband America,"" that found Verizon's FiOS service was the top provider at delivering on its advertised Internet speeds while Cablevision was the worst performer.Dolan held Rutledge personally responsible for letting Cablevision's broadband service fall behind its peers, according to BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. A spokesman for Cablevision declined to comment, citing company policy not to discuss former employees.That year, Cablevision also missed a target set five years earlier for cumulative adjusted operating cash flow of about $1 billion, said Leo Hindery, a former cable executive who is a managing partner of private equity firm Intermedia Partners.The year 2011 was also tough for Time Warner Cable. Like Cablevision, it was hit by competition from Verizon's FiOS and lost video subscribers every quarter.Greg Maffei, the CEO of Liberty Media, which is Charter's biggest shareholder, does not hold Cablevision's performance in 2011 against Rutledge. Maffei said in a statement last week that ""a key reason Liberty invested in Charter was the strength of Tom Rutledge and his management team.""Since taking over Charter, Rutledge has streamlined management, simplified pricing and packaging and focused the sales effort on ""triple play,"" according to UBS analyst John Hodulik.Charter's video product has been improved by adding more high definition content, reduced the rate of cancellations and increasing revenue per subscriber, he said. Hodulik said he could see shares of the combined company rise to $200 per share in 18 months after a deal, due to free cash flow growth and Rutledge's operating playbook.Since he became CEO, Charter shares have more than doubled, including gains logged after news of a Time Warner Cable bid emerged. It is also true that Charter, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, started from a low base. Its market share is low compared to rivals and it suffered from under-investment for years.Rutledge's supporters say he will be able to improve Time Warner Cable's operations as well. But critics say Time Warner Cable could make similar changes on its own, without Charter.""Given enough time, Time Warner Cable management would probably be able to narrow the gap between its performance and that of Comcast. There is, after all, little secret sauce in the cable business,"" said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett.(Additional reporting by Ronald Grover in Los Angeles; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Grant McCool)",2014-01-30,CHTR,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 10:11am EST",Analysis: Charter's bid for Time Warner Cable hinges on Rutledge's skill,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-charter-timewarnercable-rutledge-anal-idUSBREA0T01D20140130?type=companyNews
43,"   By Liana B. Baker and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Charter Communications Inc is discussing raising its bid for Time Warner Cable Inc as soon as in the next two weeks, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that could pressure its reluctant rival ahead of a proxy deadline.Charter is considering a higher bid in the low 140s per share range, the people said on Friday, up from its current $132.50 per share offer that values the second-largest U.S. cable operator at $37.3 billion based on shares outstanding.A new price at around $142.50 per share has been discussed, but no decision has been made, one of the people added. The likely bump reflects feedback from Time Warner Cable investors Charter has received in its two-week roadshow, that person added.While timing of any new bid has yet to be decided and may change, Charter could sweeten its offer before, or at the same time it nominates a slate of directors for Time Warner Cable's board, people familiar with the matter said.The one-month window to nominate a new slate expires in mid-February for the annual shareholder meeting expected in May. All the people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Charter, Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment.With no rival bidder for Time Warner Cable in sight, Charter may also hold out on a sweetener until after it nominates a slate, one of the people said. It could also wait until it reaches an agreement with Comcast Corp about carving up Time Warner Cable, the person added. Charter and Comcast are in discussions about how to carve up Time Warner Cable's markets, the people familiar with the matter said on Friday.Comcast is interested in owning Time Warner Cable's systems in New York City and in parts of New England such as Maine, but has little interest in Los Angeles, another of Time Warner Cable's largest markets, Reuters previously reported.The deal could also involve some Charter-owned systems going to Comcast, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, the people said. Under the proposed deal, Comcast would buy the cable systems from Charter if Charter succeeds in acquiring Time Warner Cable. The details and timing of a potential agreement remain unclear.UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a research note on Friday that a bid of $140-145 would be necessary to get support from Time Warner Cable investors.""We would expect Charter to move forward with plans for a proxy fight but believe a new, higher bid may come given the support it would have from Time Warner Cable shareholders and our modeling that suggests ample value for both sides,"" Hodulik said.(Reporting by Liana Baker and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)",2014-01-31,CHTR,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 5:33pm EST",Exclusive: Charter may raise Time Warner Cable bid within weeks - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-timewarnercable-charter-idUSBREA0U1W320140131?type=companyNews

54,"  (Repeats with no changes (By Soyoung Kim and Liana B. BakerNEW YORK Feb 13 Talks between Comcast Corp  and Charter Communications Inc over how they could together buy Time Warner Cable Inc quickly soured as the two bickered over price and the feasibility of engineering a split of the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp, had been pursuing Time Warner for months, but was not making any headway as its larger rival - nearly three times its size by market value - asked for $8 billion more than what it had offered.But Comcast actually believed Time Warner Cable's $160 per share counter to Charter's $132.50 per share bid was reasonable, several people familiar with the situation said on Thursday. At the same time, it worried that splitting a public company with assets in multiple markets and millions of subscribers would be tough, made even harder by the acrimony that had built up over the past eight months between Charter and Time Warner Cable.On Feb. 4 Comcast and Charter met in a last-ditch attempt to see if they could work out their differences, the sources said. They could not.So later in the day, Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts called Time Warner Cable's Rob Marcus to say that he was ready to make a bid for all of Time Warner Cable at a figure close to the asking price, according to the sources.On Thursday, the two announced a $45.2 billion all-stock deal to create a cable behemoth, with an empire stretching from New York to Los Angeles. The deal is the largest M&A transaction so far this year and the third-largest in the media and entertainment sector of all time, according to Thomson Reuters data.If the deal closes, it could give Comcast unprecedented leverage in negotiations with content providers and advertisers. For that reason it is also likely to come under keen regulatory scrutiny.Representatives for Time Warner Cable, Comcast and Charter declined to comment on details of the negotiations. All the sources asked not to be named because the conversations were private.Interviews with several people who were intimately involved in negotiations, however, paint a picture of what went on behind the scenes over the last few days as the deal came together and how Charter lost a prize that it had worked so hard to win.In some ways, these sources said, the two companies have Charter to thank for the deal. Although Comcast, the top U.S. cable operator, had always been intrigued by the idea of buying Time Warner Cable, a deal was not on its list of priorities until Charter put it in play last summer. In the end, one of the sources said, all Charter did was ""wake up the sleeping beast.""John Paulson, whose Paulson & Co hedge fund is one of Time Warner Cable's top 10 shareholders, said of Comcast in an interview with Reuters: ""They're gentlemen, old school businessmen. But they're also aggressive.""Charter's next steps were not clear on Thursday. It had nominated a slate of directors to replace the entire board of Time Warner Cable on Tuesday, but was kept in the dark as its prize was slipping away to another buyer. Time Warner Cable CEO Marcus, in the job for just 44 days, said in an interview that the deal, while good for his shareholders, is bittersweet for him.""I was looking forward to thousands of days, not tens of days doing this job,"" Marcus said.Still, the former Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP M&A lawyer who over the past eight years had served in various roles at Time Warner Cable, including its top dealmaker and chief operating officer, just pulled off one of his largest deals ever. And thanks to his tenure at the company, he could take home some $50 million after it closes.""Sometimes you don't have control over how things unfold,"" Marcus said.THE FINAL DAYS Things moved quickly over the last 10 days, the sources said. After months of pursuing Time Warner Cable without success and speaking informally with Comcast last year, Charter approached Comcast once again in the middle of January about teaming up.The idea was for Charter to buy all of Time Warner Cable and later sell off select systems to Comcast.Comcast, with a $138 billion market value, dwarfs Charter's $13.43 billion, as well as Time Warner Cable's $40 billion market capitalization as of Thursday.But as the two discussed options, Comcast became increasingly uncomfortable with Charter's hostile approach and more skeptical that Charter would be able to win Time Warner Cable's blessing with its offer, the sources said.Comcast also became increasingly excited about the prospect of buying Time Warner Cable on its own.Comcast felt that it could pay between $150 and $160 per share for Time Warner Cable, the sources said. Initially it was also willing to put cash along with stock into the deal. But one of the sources said Time Warner Cable wanted an all-stock deal and for Comcast to use the cash instead to initiate a large share buyback program after the transaction closed to boost the share price of the combined company.That meant Time Warner Cable shareholders would end up owning 23 percent of the combined company and also not have to pay taxes as a result of the transaction.In return for paying the price, however, Roberts had one demand: Comcast would not pay a reverse break-up fee, or the penalty that a buyer pays to the seller if it fails to close a deal, typically because of regulatory reasons, the sources said.The request was unusual for a deal that was sure to face regulatory scrutiny. A few years ago, for example, AT&T Inc  agreed to pay as much as $6 billion as reverse breakup fee, paid in cash and spectrum, as part of its deal to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion. The deal was shot down by regulators, and AT&T had to pay the fees.Some lawyers said such fees are rare in the cable industry, however.""These businesses operate fairly independent enough and if this deal does not get approved, there is not going to be that much damage to Time Warner Cable,"" said Robert Townsend, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster's global M&A practice.Comcast CEO Roberts said he did not recall ever agreeing to a reverse termination fee, not even in its $30 billion buyout of majority of NBC Universal in 2009.Time Warner Cable's board determined that the proposed transaction should get regulatory approval because the companies do not operate in the same markets, the sources said. They agreed to Comcast's condition.Talks were further aided by the fact that executives from the two companies knew each other and were friendly, the sources said. They also had worked together on a deal previously.In 2006, the two split up bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications in a complicated $17.6 billion transaction. Marcus was Time Warner's lead negotiator on the deal at that time.This time around, the two chief executives, along with Comcast Chief Financial Officer Michael Angelakis and Time Warner Cable's Arthur Minson, negotiated key points of the deal by phone as well as in-person meetings in New York, without relying much on advisers.The two sides agreed a final deal price of $158.82 per share on Monday morning, and the board of each company approved the transaction on Wednesday evening.""Throughout the whole process with Charter, I consistently said one thing - insufficient value. They didn't value the unique asset that was Time Warner Cable,"" Marcus said. ""On the simplest level, the TWC-Comcast merger was superior.""",2014-02-14,CHTR,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 7:00am EST",RPT-DEALTALK-How Charter's Time Warner Cable bid woke up a 'sleeping beast',http://www.reuters.com//article/timewarnercable-comcast-idUSL2N0LJ04D20140214?type=companyNews

60,"   By Nicola Leske  Charter Communications (CHTR.O), still rebounding from its failure to buy larger rival Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, is left with the prospect of acquiring smaller players to satisfy its aim of driving U.S. cable consolidation, according to industry analysts.Those likely to be on Charter's potential shopping list include Cox Communications COXC.UL, Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N, Mediacom LLC and Suddenlink, observers say.There ""are at least a few baby elephants left on the M&A savanna,"" said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities, Inc.Charter and its billionaire backer John Malone had courted Time Warner Cable for months, but were outmaneuvered by Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) $45.2 billion merger bid, announced on February 13.Malone, whose Liberty Media Corp (LMCA.O) holds a 27 percent stake in Charter, has been touting the benefits of cable consolidation at every turn. The billionaire investor has long argued that cable companies should team up to fight high programming costs and competition from telecoms and satellite TV companies.In addition, Google Inc (GOOG.O) announced this week that it is planning a major expansion of its super-fast ""Fiber"" TV network, posing another potential threat to cable operators. Shareholders are certain to be asking how Charter, the U.S.'s fourth largest cable operator with 4 million subscribers, intends to accomplish those goals without Time Warner Cable.As the country's second-largest cable operator, Time Warner Cable has over 11 million subscribers.Charter will have a chance to update shareholders about its plans on Friday, when it reports fourth-quarter earnings. But the cable operator likely cannot approach a potential target until it knows which cable systems Comcast will spin off, said Tom Eagan, an analyst with Northland Capital Markets.Comcast has said it will likely part with about 3 million of the 33 million subscribers joint subscribers of the two companies.Of the two largest cable operators likely to be on Charter's list - Cablevision and Cox - Eagan figures that Charter is more likely to acquire Cox, the country's third-largest operator. It is privately held by the Cox family, which might be willing to sell at the higher multiples cable is getting, he said. None of the companies that might be on Charter's list have the breadth and capability that Charter was looking for in Time Warner Cable, but there is logic to combining Charter with a number of smaller companies.""It may take a little longer but it won't get as long a review as Time Warner Cable and Comcast will,"" said a person familiar with the situation, referring to regulatory scrutiny.Taking a look at Europe may also provide a clue. Malone is chairman of Liberty Global (LBTYA.O), Europe's largest cable operator, and has expanded his cable empire there over the past decade via acquisitions from Ireland to Romania.In January, Liberty Global said it would buy Dutch operator Ziggo ZIGGO.AS for 10 billion euros ($13.71 billion).($1 = 0.7293 Euro)(Reporting by Nicola Leske; edited by Ronald Grover and G Crosse)",2014-02-21,CHTR,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 9:29pm EST",Charter can pursue consolidation with smaller players: analysts,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-charter-acquisitions-idUSBREA1K05220140221?type=companyNews

62,"   By Liana B. Baker  Charter Communications would consider buying subscribers that Comcast could divest as part of its proposed Time Warner Cable takeover, Greg Maffei, chief executive of Charter's largest stakeholder, Liberty Media, said on Friday.These were Liberty Media's first comments since Charter Communications (CHTR.O), in which it has a 27 stake, lost out on acquiring Time Warner Cable TWC.N to Comcast. Although Comcast, the top U.S. cable operator, had always been intrigued by the idea of buying Time Warner Cable, a deal was not on its list of priorities until Charter put it in play last summer.Maffei told a conference call that Charter could still go after Time Warner Cable if regulators reject the Comcast deal, although he expects it to win approval, though perhaps with ""onerous conditions.""Maffei said he thinks the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal will ultimately be approved by regulators but said if the deal were to fall through, Liberty and Charter Communications (CHTR.O) are leaving the option on the table of acquiring Time Warner Cable.Maffei said he wants Liberty and Charter to be ""flexible both for acquisitions of other systems or potentially the divestitures out of Time Warner or if the Time Warner deal is not able to be completed -- looking back at the whole thing,"" he said. Comcast has said it is willing to divest 3 million subscribers.While Charter, driven by Liberty Media, missed out on acquiring Time Warner Cable, Maffei did not rule out further cable deals.""We certainly learned in this process that there were many investors who are interested in investing in cable consolidation either with Charter or alongside Liberty. And I suspect if a need arises for additional equity for a cable consolidation play, we'll see a lot of interest,"" he said. SIRIUS XM Liberty last month offered to buy out Sirius XM's minority shareholders in a deal that could be worth more than $10 billion. The deal would make the entire asset part of Liberty's portfolio and take the public shares off the market.Liberty currently owns more than half of Sirius XM. Shareholders such as consumer advocate Ralph Nader have spoken out against the deal, an offer of $3.68 per share that provides little premium to shareholders. Sirius XM shares were trading at $3.62 per share on Friday.Liberty said it still wants to go through with the deal and use Sirius XM's cash for share repurchase or strategic acquisitions.Maffei said Liberty was in touch with Sirius XM's special committee, which is studying the offer. While he suggested there could be a bit of room for Sirius XM's committee to negotiate a higher price, he said that a deal does not have to get done and in terms of price, ""there certainly are limits to what would be appealing.""Maxim Securities analyst John Tinker said that Maffei is in full negotiating mode and ""is very clear that at a certain price they don't need to do the deal.""(Reporting by Liana B.

Last year's fourth quarter marked Comcast's first upswing in cable video subscribers in more than six years.Most cable companies have been shedding video subscribers for the past few years, losing them to satellite and telecom rivals as well as newer Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc.""Two straight quarters of basic video subscriber gains, even small ones, isn't enough to call a reversal of perennial losses,"" said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett in a research note. ""But it's a start.""Comcast's high-speed Internet growth slowed in the quarter.

A separate Liberty Broadband could help raise capital for Charter, he added. On April 28, Charter said it would pay Comcast $7.3 billion for 1.4 million cable subscribers and trade about 1.6 million subscribers in different parts of the country in a deal that depends on regulatory approval of Comcast's takeover of Time Warner Cable. Charter will also own one-third of a new cable company to be spun off from Comcast.Maffei said the spin-off would be completed by the end of the year. It replaces a previous plan announced in March to split up the cable media assets into new companies, Liberty Broadband Group and Liberty Media Group.  The plan announced on Thursday will be a hard spin-off of Liberty Broadband, similar to how Liberty spun off television and movie channel Starz last year.

84,"   By Liana B.

The announcement came amid more clarity on Charter's expansion plans.On April 28, Charter said it would pay Comcast $7.3 billion for 1.4 million cable subscribers and trade about 1.6 million subscribers in different parts of the country in a deal that depends on regulatory approval of Comcast's takeover of Time Warner Cable. Charter will also own one-third of a new cable company that will be spun off from Comcast. Maffei said the spin-off would be completed by the end of the year.

87,"   By Lisa Lee | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aug 8 Cable company Charter Communications cut the size of its term debt and made lender friendly changes on Friday, driven by choppy market conditions, sources said.This is one of a batch of deals facing higher borrowing costs as investors balk at pricing levels due to growing volatility in the equity and high-yield markets.The changes to the credit come on the heels of a weakened secondary market, $1.5 billion of outflows from bank loan mutual funds and a record $7.1 billion in outflows from high-yield bond funds in the latest week ending Wednesday.""The large outflows are widening primary pricing,"" said a loan investor.The company is now seeking a $3.5 billion, seven-year term loan to back its purchase of Time Warner Cable assets from Comcast, said sources. Formerly, the company was looking to seal $7.4 billion in term debt, split between a $3.2 billion, six-year first-lien term loan G and a $4.2 billion, seven-year first-lien term loan H.Charter is also in market for a $1 billion, five-year term loan A-2 and a $500 million incremental 3.5-year revolving credit, which are unchanged.Goldman Sachs, lead left on the transaction, declined to comment. Goldman is joined on the right by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Loan sources predict that the rest of the credit facility will come to market after the Labor Day holiday.Price guidance on the now smaller term loan is being increased to LIB+350 with a 75 basis point (bp) Libor floor and a 99 original issue discount (OID). Earlier in the week, whispers were for a hike to LIB+325 with a 75bp Libor floor. The term loan G was initially guided at LIB+275-300 with a 75bp Libor floor and 99.5 original issue discount. Pricing for the term loan H was guided at LIB+275-300 with a 75bp Libor floor and a 99 OID. Call protection is being guided at 101 soft call for six months.Structural changes are also in the works, including MFN options and ticking fees, sources said.Formerly, ticking fees for the loans were 33 percent of margin for the first 45 days, 50 percent of margin for days 46 through 90 and 100 percent of margin 91 days or longer, sources said.Recommitments from lenders are due Monday.Charter's asset purchase is tied to Comcast Corp's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable announced in February. Comcast, in a joint statement with Charter in April, said it would divest systems serving existing Time Warner Cable customers directly to Charter for cash.

88,"   By Lisa Lee, Michelle Sierra and Natalie Harrison  NEW YORK, Aug 13 (TRPLC/IFR) - Charter Communications is expected to revisit the leveraged loan market as soon as September, and may also try to sell a high-yield bond, to raise the remaining US$3.9bn it needs to buy Time Warner cable assets.Charter more than halved the size of its senior secured institutional facility to US$3.5bn from US$7.4bn last Friday,  opted for a seven-year term loan rather than two term loans with different maturities and increased pricing.One leveraged finance banker close to the situation said the decision to cut the size of the deal was due to a combination of softer markets, and the issuer's sensitivity around higher  financing costs following a pick-up in volatility shortly after the deal launched to investors.A repricing in the high-yield market has now fully filtered through to the loan market, the banker said.""The company doesn't really need the money for six months so it can be patient,"" the banker said.The cable giant is now considering its options to finance the rest of its acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC) subscribers, which rival Comcast is selling to help get regulatory approval for its planned US$45bn purchase of TWC .Those choices include revisiting the loan market or raising cash from a unsecured high-yield bond, most likely in the fall, the banker said.The hope is that the smaller deal size will make it more manageable to term out risk.""Banks like to underwrite deals like Charter because everyone wants to own cable,"" said another leveraged finance banker.""Investors know the name, and it's not a question of evaluating Charter risk.""Goldman Sachs is lead left on the transaction, joined by other bookrunners Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. FINDING A LEVEL Still, the deal's struggle is a worrying sign as there are US$69bn of leveraged loans in the pipeline, according to Thomson Reuters LPC, and investors are certain to continue to make the most of the volatility by demanding higher prices on deals.Albertsons, for example, sweetened pricing on US$4.6bn of institutional term loans backing its acquisition of supermarket operator Safeway earlier this month.""Both are good deals,"" said a loan investor, referring to Albertsons and Charter. ""Investors just expect to be paid more.""The first banker said issuers would stay nimble, looking to tap either the loan or the bond market depending on what offers the best value in the weeks ahead.""The loan market has very strong technicals, driven by the CLO bid, but there is also a lot of supply. That could mean the bond market could find equilibrium faster than loans,"" said the banker. ""In this market, it's all about finding a level."" Charter and Albertsons are not the only companies that are having to adjust to different pricing levels.On the loan side, a number of opportunistic deals have recently been pulled in response to volatility in the equity and high-yield markets. They include a US$380m financing backing a dividend recapitalization for packager HCP Global Limited, and repricing attempts for education technology company Blackboard and precision engineering firm SeaStar Solutions.Well services company Expro also reduced its deal to US$1.45bn, removed a delayed draw tranche and upped pricing.Bond deals for the buyout of Safeway and another for Jupiter Resources - backing Apollo's acquisition of Encana's Bighorn assets - have been pushed back to September.And another acquisition deal, for NCSG Crane & Heavy Haul Corp, not only priced a week later than expected but also came 200bp wide of whispers.One private equity source estimated capital costs had risen by at least 100bp over the past month - but said it really boils down to individual credits. Factors taken into account include the size of the deal, the length of commitment, ratings, and whether the credit is already known in the market, he said.TREADING CAREFULLY The second banker stressed fairly aggressive deals are still getting done with structural changes that benefit investors such as extended call protections and Most Favored Nation clauses (MFN).The banker pointed to a loan and bond deal from BWAY which priced last week and partly financed a dividend to shareholders.""BWAY had very aggressive terms, but came unscathed. Will we be more careful? Absolutely. Does it mean we offer 101 protection for a year now? Probably. Add MFNs? Most likely,"" said the banker.""Banks have to be careful and underwriters are under pressure but I'm not aware of anything disastrous that has been underwritten.""Some commitments, for the buyout of Acosta by Carlyle, for example, was only signed in the past month when markets were already choppy - showing banks are holding their nerve.The hope is that investors will now start to see value. The yield-to-worst on the high-yield index neared 6% last week, but has since retraced to 5.59%, according to the Barclays index.From a borrower's perspective, funding costs remain cheap.""When you see that the yield on a bond is lower than the leverage on a deal you know that the market is frothy,"" said another private equity source.""The market was well overdue for a correction.""

95,"   By Matt Scuffham | LONDON  LONDON British startup lender Charter Savings Bank was cleared on Wednesday to start taking deposits as authorities try to encourage the formation of new banks to take on the dominant ""big four"". The award of a banking license to Charter Savings comes after Britain last year made it easier for new banks to launch, cutting the length of time it takes to apply for a license and lowering the amount of capital new banks must hold.The new bank's parent company Charter Court Financial Services, was founded in 2008 and is majority-owned by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Associates. The Wolverhampton-based business employs 250 staff and will run Charter Savings Bank alongside its Exact and Precise mortgage brands. Chief Executive Ian Lonergan told Reuters that the bank, which will save on start-up costs by not having branches, plans to take customers from bigger rivals by offering better rates. Many British savers have become disillusioned by the savings rates offered by established financial services firms.The bank will begin offering products including fixed rate bonds and savings accounts from March. ""They will be pretty simple savings products but with very competitive rates. The incumbents don't offer such great rates and our research tells us customers are prepared to move to challenger banks,"" he said. Lawmakers and regulators are keen to see challengers appear to break the grip of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC -- which account for more than three-quarters of lending to individuals and small businesses.Some lawmakers say a lack of competition contributed to the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 and subsequent scandals. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority was last year handed a new remit to promote competition within banking. Andrea Leadsom, a UK minister with responsibility for financial services policy, said moves to promote competition should take priority over increased regulation of the industry. The appetite for new banks contrasts sharply with the attitude of regulators during the financial crisis. Minutes from meetings of Bank of England officials during the crisis which were published for the first time on Wednesday showed regulators had wanted fewer home loan providers.""Arguably there was an economic need for rationalization in the number of mortgage lenders –- the Bank should not be seen to be seeking to preserve the existing number of players in this market,"" the minutes say. Charter Savings has become the third new bank to be granted a license since the new rules were introduced, following Paragon and Scoban.($1 = 0.6605 pounds) (Editing by David Holmes and Jason Neely)",2015-01-07,CHTR,"Wed Jan 7, 2015 | 7:24am EST",Charter Savings to become third new UK bank since rule change,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-britain-banks-charter-idUSKBN0KG0W220150107?type=companyNews
96,"  Feb 14 Comcast Corp said on Friday that a California Public Utilities Commission Administrative (CPUC) law judge recommended  to approve its pending $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable and related transactions with Charter Communications.The approval, characterized by Comcast as an ""important step"" for the overall regulatory process, was proposed with a set of conditions, including making broadband available to un-served and under-served communities.Approval from California, the most populous U.S. state, is just one of a series of state and federal hurdles Comcast needs to clear to close the merger. Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen said the company was reviewing the proposed decision but that some of the recommended conditions ""could prevent the full benefits of this transaction being realized by Californians, and create a more intrusive regulatory regime where innovative services could be hampered rather than helped.""In a statement, Cohen specifically cited the penetration rates and said the time frame related to making broadband more widely available to communities lacking service was ""simply unattainable under market conditions."" ""We look forward to working with the Commission as it creates conditions to approve this transaction that are fair to consumers in California and to our company,"" he said. The overall approval of Comcast's acquisition of Time Warner has been closely watched especially as regulators propose rules that adhere to net neutrality, or the notion that all internet providers should treat all web traffic equally.Comcast said it already has the vast majority of state and local approvals necessary to close the deal.

The talks come at a time when oversupply is already a major concern for energy investors, having contributed to crude falling more than 50 percent from a high in June.Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd agreed to buy reinsurer Montpelier Re Holdings Ltd for about $1.83 billion, while Charter Communications Inc agreed to acquire Bright House Networks in a roughly $10 billion deal. The news follows a number of big deals announced on Monday, all of which contributed to the market's broad advance and the Dow's biggest one-day rise in more than a month. Charter rose 8.3 percent to $198.66 while Montpelier rose 3 percent to $39.31. Endurance fell 2 percent to $63.02.""Today's move is largely in reaction to yesterday, a back-to-normal session, but our view on the market is still constructive. As we see continued acquisition deals, that will be supportive for the backdrop,"" said James Dunigan, chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. Trading may be volatile ahead of the March payroll report, due on Friday, when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday. If the report is strong, investors could view the U.S. Federal Reserve as more likely to raise rates earlier than currently expected.Tuesday marks the end of the first quarter. Over the period, the Dow rose 0.5 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq rose 4 percent. This is the ninth straight quarterly advance for the S&P and Nasdaq, the longest such streak for the S&P since 1998 and the longest for the Nasdaq in its history.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 74.74 points, or 0.42 percent, to 17,901.57, the S&P 500 lost 8.68 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,077.56 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 18.60 points, or 0.38 percent, to 4,928.84.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,028 to 628, for a 3.23-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,628 issues fell and 540 advanced, for a 3.01-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 was posting 6 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 15 new highs and 10 new lows.

111,"  * Announcement could come as soon as Friday -source* FCC's strong stance seen as big factor -sources* Senator Franken: Collapse would be ""huge victory"" for consumers   (Recasts with new sourcing; adds quote from advocacy group, background)By Liana B. Baker, Alina Selyukh and Diane BartzNEW YORK/WASHINGTON, April 23 Comcast Corp's  board was meeting late on Thursday to finalize plans to abandon its proposed $45 billion merger with  Time Warner Cable Inc, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.An announcement is expected as early as Friday, the person added, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.Representatives of Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment.The news came a day after officials of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest U.S. cable companies, met with reviewers at the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Comcast planned to drop its offer in the face of opposition from U.S. regulators.The Justice Department is weighing whether the deal hurts competition while the FCC is weighing whether it is in the public interest. Both agencies expressed concerns, though sources told Reuters it was the FCC's strong stance that particularly tipped the scales to kill the deal.FCC reviewers told the agency staff at a Wednesday briefing that they planned to recommend taking the merger issue to an administrative law judge for a hearing, which would amount to the FCC blocking the deal.The FCC's move is its latest flex of muscle under Chairman Tom Wheeler, who recently imposed the strictest-ever regulations on Internet providers and in 2014 helped scuttle a potential merger between wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US.IMPACT ON OTHER DEALS  Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy group, and an opponent of the deal, said Wall Street would now reconsider some aggressive deals. ""I thought this was an uphill battle and a real long shot,"" he said of opposition to the Comcast-TWC deal, indicating how the opposition's apparent success would influence other deals.The Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal faced vocal criticisms from some politicians, media company executives and diverse public and industry groups, who worried it would create a massive monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV.Though the two companies largely do not compete against each other, opponents have been drilling into the combined company's broadband reach and raising concerns about its potential gate-keeping power over the online video market, among others.""If reports of the collapse of the deal are true, it would be a huge victory for American consumers."" said U.S. Senator Al Franken, a Democrat of Minnesota and a vocal opponent of the merger. ""This transaction would create a telecom behemoth that would lead to higher prices, fewer choices and even worse service. We need more competition in this space, not less,"" Franken said in a statement.Earlier this week, six senators sent a letter to the FCC urging that they reject the merger.If the deal falls through, investment bankers also look to suffer as they are worried about whether they will get paid, with smaller advisory firms particularly on edge.Last week, Bloomberg reported that attorneys at the Justice Department's antitrust division were nearing a recommendation to sue to block the merger, citing concerns for consumers.Earlier, Charter Communications Inc had lost out to Comcast in a bid to acquire Time Warner Cable.A Charter spokesman had no comment on the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal or what Charter plans to do next. However, Charter's controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, has indicated continuing interest.At an investor day last November, when asked if he would pursue Time Warner Cable if the Comcast bid fell through, Liberty Media Chairman John Malone said, ""Hell yes.""Greg Maffei, chief executive of Liberty Media, had no comment on Thursday.Shares of Comcast closed up 0.8 percent at $59.23 and Time Warner Cable closed down 0.6 percent at $148.76. Charter shares closed down 0.7 percent at $183.58.   (Reporting by Liana B.

119,"  * DOJ, FCC say merger would have given Comcast unfair advantage* Charter offer for Time Warner cable likely - analysts* Time Warner Cable shares up 2 pct, Comcast little changed   (Adds analyst comment, context)By Devika  Krishna KumarApril 24 Comcast Corp abandoned its $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable Inc on Friday after U.S. regulators raised concerns that the deal would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market.The collapse of the deal opens the door for other possible offers for Time Warner Cable, but also casts heightened regulatory risk on merger activity in the U.S. cable industry, which has been rapidly consolidating in the face of competition from satellite TV and Web-based services.The proposed acquisition had faced criticism from some politicians, media company executives and consumer and industry groups, who had worried it would create a monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV. Comcast had argued the merger would bring faster service and better video services to more Americans. ""The pressure to consolidate in a very competitive industry is going to continue,"" Maxim Group analyst John Tinker said.Charter Communications Inc lost out on a bid for Time Warner Cable last year, and Charter's controlling shareholder, Liberty Media Corp, had since indicated continuing interest.""We believe that TWC will get a bid from Charter in the next three months, which we expect to be lower than the market expects,"" Needham analysts said in a note. The analysts said they expected the opening bid at $130 to $135 per share. Time Warner Cable shares last traded at $152.52, up 2.5 percent on the day. Comcast shares were up 0.15 percent at $59.32 and Charter shares were down 0.8 percent at $182.18.ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONCERNS  The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would have created a company controlling almost 30 percent of the U.S. pay-TV subscribers, following promised divestitures, and would have provided high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday that the merger would have posed an ""unacceptable risk to competition and innovation.""U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the companies' decision to abandon the deal was ""the best outcome for American consumers.""Comcast had argued that the Time Warner Cable deal would not be anti-competitive because the companies had no real geographic overlap. The company had also proposed to divest some assets to help address regulatory concerns.The collapse of the deal is a setback for Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts.""Today, we move on,"" he said in a statement.

121,"   By Liana B. Baker, Alina Selyukh and Diane Bartz | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Comcast Corp's  board was meeting late on Thursday to finalize plans to abandon its proposed $45 billion merger with  Time Warner Cable Inc , according to a person directly familiar with the matter.A formal announcement is expected as early as Friday, the person added, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Comcast and Time Warner Cable declined to comment.The news came a day after officials of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest U.S. cable companies, met with reviewers at the Justice Department, which is considering whether the deal would harm competition, and the Federal Communications Commission, which is considering whether the deal was in public interest.Both agencies signaled reservations, though sources told Reuters it was the FCC's strong stance that particularly tipped the scales to drop the deal, which carries no break-up fee.FCC reviewers told the agency staff at a Wednesday briefing that they planned to recommend taking the merger issue to an administrative law judge for a hearing, which would amount to the FCC blocking the deal.That was the latest flex of muscle by the FCC under Chairman Tom Wheeler, who recently imposed the strictest-ever regulations on Internet providers and in 2014 helped scuttle a potential merger between wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US.Bloomberg first reported on Thursday that Comcast planned to drop its merger offer in the face of opposition from regulators. The Justice Department's antitrust attorneys were also nearing a recommendation to sue to block the merger, Bloomberg reported. INTERNET AND VIDEO CONCERNS The Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal has faced vocal criticisms from some politicians, media company executives and diverse consumer and industry groups, who worried it would create a massive monolith with too much control over what Americans do online and watch on TV.The merger would create a company controlling less than 30 percent of the U.S. pay-TV subscribers, following promised divestitures. It would provide high-speed Internet access to almost 40 percent of Americans, according to SNL Kagan data.""This transaction would create a telecom behemoth that would lead to higher prices, fewer choices and even worse service. We need more competition in this space, not less,"" said U.S. Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat and a vocal opponent, who called the news of potential collapse a victory for consumers. Though the two companies largely do not compete against each other, opponents, including Dish Network Corp and Netflix Inc, have been drilling into the combined company's broadband reach and raising concerns about its potential gate-keeping power over the online video market, among others.LOBBYING HEAVYWEIGHT Comcast had argued the deal would bring faster service and better video services to more Americans, and it has sounded positive notes about the merger's fate until the last minute.

133,"   By Liana B. Baker  Bright House Networks, the sixth largest U.S. cable operator, is preparing to abandon a $10.4 billion deal to be acquired by larger peer Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), according to people familiar with the matter.Charter, the No. 4 U.S. cable operator, clinched the deal with Bright House in March contingent on completion of Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) $45.2 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N. Comcast walked away from the Time Warner Cable deal last month because of antitrust hurdles.Charter's agreement with Bright House includes a 30-day provision for them to renegotiate a deal in this event. That period lapses in about two weeks. Even though negotiations are still formally continuing, Bright House, which is controlled by the Newhouse family, owner of magazine publisher Conde Nast, now believes it best to remain independent, the people said this week.Time Warner Cable has an agreement to negotiate programing rates for Bright House, as well as share technology, in exchange for a fee. Bright House would rather not change this arrangement by partnering with Charter, which is a smaller operator than Time Warner Cable, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Bright House Networks, Charter and Time Warner Cable representatives declined to comment.Last week, Charter Chief Executive Tom Rutledge said on the company's earnings call he was negotiating with Bright House ""in good faith."" Time Warner Cable has the right of first refusal in the event Bright House pursues a sale.The U.S. cable TV industry has been rapidly consolidating in recent years to counter the growing popularity of satellite TV and Web-based entrants such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). The Bright House deal would have made Charter, whose biggest shareholder is John Malone's Liberty Broadband Corp, the No. 2 U.S. cable TV provider. It would have helped Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence. Charter's key markets include Alabama, Georgia, Michigan and California.Charter is now in negotiations to acquire Time Warner Cable, people familiar with the matter have previously said. Time Warner Cable's deal with Comcast fell through after U.S. regulators raised concerns that it would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market.Charter last week reported a first-quarter net loss of $81 million, or 73 cents per share, up from $37 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.

142,"   By Alina Selyukh and Malathi Nayak  A potential bid by French telecom group Altice SA to buy U.S. cable company Time Warner Cable Inc would pass regulatory hurdles more easily than an offer pondered by cable rival Charter Communications Inc , according to analysts and experts.Altice, controlled by French billionaire Patrick Drahi, on Wednesday agreed to buy regional U.S. cable company Suddenlink. It has also approached Time Warner Cable for a deal, according to people familiar with the talks.The moves come as Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S. cable provider, is being circled by smaller rival Charter after Comcast Corp, the biggest U.S. cable operator, failed to get government approval for a merger over concerns that it would control Internet access of too many Americans.Some analysts see regulatory hurdles for a possible Charter-TWC deal, especially after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler earlier this month said ""more competition would be better"" for cable companies providing broadband Internet.""Does the government want to create another Comcast?"" BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield asked in a recent note on a possible Charter-Time Warner Cable merger. His answer leaned toward a no. A merger of Charter and Time Warner Cable, with other related deals, would eliminate one of the country's top Internet providers and control more than 20 percent of the broadband market, according to data from MoffettNathanson.  Altice is a new entrant to the U.S. market. With Suddenlink, the seventh largest U.S. cable company, and Time Warner Cable, it would control less than 15 percent of the broadband market, according to the data.""To the extent that the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal raises regulatory concerns because they're still one of the largest domestic broadband companies, Altice doesn't bring any of that baggage,"" said Harold Feld, a veteran telecom observer at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. The Comcast-TWC deal would have created a behemoth Internet provider with roughly 40 percent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. U.S. regulators have not commented specifically on any new potential deals.New Street Research analysts argue that Comcast's failed merger does not portend broader regulatory opposition to cable consolidation, giving Charter an opportunity to offer online video protections to ease potential regulatory review. Plus, a combination of TWC with Charter would offer more cost savings, New Street's Spencer Kurn said.""You’re combining two players with much greater scale and there’s more synergy value that you can create.""As a foreign company, Altice would face additional review from national security and telecommunications officials, which experts say could lead to criticism from opponents, but ultimately not pose a challenge.

A larger company in this sector could achieve greater economies of scale, including in negotiations with programmers.The cash-and-stock deal values Time Warner Cable at $195 per share, according to sources, and comes just one month after Comcast dropped its $45.2 billion merger agreement with Time Warner Cable, clinched in February 2014, over antitrust concerns.Time Warner Cable shares closed at $171.18 on Friday.

149,"   By Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 26 Time Warner Cable, entering into talks to be acquired by  Charter Communications Inc just a month after regulators killed a proposed takeover by Comcast Corp's, was determined not to get burned a second time.It won such an insurance policy on Tuesday, when Charter included as part of its $56 billion takeover agreement a pledge to pay Time Warner Cable a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal goes south. Comcast, by contrast, had made no such pledge and was able to walk away scot-free when its bid collapsed.Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus said in an interview that the company had more leverage to negotiate various terms of the deal with Charter because it was a competitive process. Reuters reported that French telecom company Altice had been in talks about buying the company as well.Time Warner Cable's insistence on a breakup fee reflects lingering worries that the Federal Communications Commission, which rejected the Comcast deal over concerns about its broadband market reach and the future of online video, could do something similar in this case.Charter, meanwhile, was willing to pledge $2 billion because it is confident the deal will go through and it ultimately won't have to pay the fee, according to people close to the company who declined to speak on the record.Underscoring the high stakes involved, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler issued an unusually quick statement when the new deal was announced on Tuesday, reiterating that the agency will review the deal to determine whether it is in the public interest.""In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient,"" Wheeler said. ""The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved."" 'A HARD LOOK' While one FCC official noted that ""absolutely nothing about this transaction has been pre-judged"" and other experts warned against reading any implicit indications of opinion in the comment, some insiders saw Wheeler's statement as a reason for concern.""That's a shot across the bow,"" said one antitrust expert and former FCC official, who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships. ""If I were the parties, I wouldn't like that statement.""Although the FCC and the Department of Justice will both review the merger proposal, the former will present a higher hurdle for Charter because of its broad public interest standard. The Justice Department reviews deals' antitrust impact and has to prove actual harm to consumers to stop a merger.One issue of concern for regulators is whether the combination of Charter and Time Warner Cable will result in higher prices for cable and broadband, said Gene Kimmelman, a veteran of the Justice Department who is now president of the public interest group Public Knowledge. ""It will get a hard look and it will depend on whether they will work out conditions,"" he said, adding that conditions usually can be worked out in such deals.Other industry analysts said Charter's deal would be viewed as less risky than that of Comcast because of its relatively smaller scale and lack of major content assets like Comcast's NBC Universal.""This is a qualitatively different deal,"" said Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and founder of Business in the Public Interest think tank.Charter kicked off a charm offensive in the deal's favor on Tuesday, pledging to invest more in faster broadband, public WiFi networks and high-speed Internet connections for small and medium-sized businesses. It also promised more affordable telephone service and better video products, including high definition channels. 'DISMAL' CUSTOMER SERVICE Still, Charter will face tough questions on the U.S. broadband Internet market, of which the combined companies would control more than one-fifth, according to data from research firm MoffettNathanson.Wheeler said the FCC's review of a possible Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination led regulators to begin to consider cable companies less as traditional pay-TV providers and more as Internet service providers. The regulators are likely to seek reassurances that the new company would not harm the growing online content competition, for instance by charging high fees for access to its network, experts say. Charter currently does not charge such fees.""One of the biggest questions about Charter and Time Warner Cable is whether the deal is in the public interest. Frankly, we're skeptical,"" said Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.""Prices for cable and broadband continue to go up, and customer service is dismal.""And, as with any cable or Internet deal, regulators will look to see if Charter and Time Warner systems overlap, and require asset sales in areas where they do before approving any deal. Both Time Warner Cable and Charter are strongest along the eastern United States with a smattering of customers in Texas and California, although they directly compete in few, if any of those markets.(Reporting by Diane Bartz and Alina Selyukh; Editing by Christian Plumb)",2015-05-26,CHTR,"Tue May 26, 2015 | 7:52pm EDT",Charter's Time Warner Cable bid faces $2 billion regulatory question,http://www.reuters.com//article/twc-ma-charter-communi-regulator-idUSL1N0YH1GB20150526?type=companyNews

The combined companies would control about one-fifth of the U.S. broadband Internet market, according to research firm MoffettNathanson.The merged company would still be smaller than Comcast, which serves about one-third of U.S. broadband users, said analyst Craig Moffett in a note to clients. He added that ""one has to be sober about genuine risks that this deal could still be rejected."" Still, experts said the transaction is different enough from the scuttled Comcast takeover that it is likely to win regulatory approval with certain conditions.""This is a qualitatively different deal,"" said Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and a founder of Business in the Public Interest think tank.""The regulatory hurdles will be lower on this transaction primarily because you don't have the same public interest concerns that you had with Comcast, in additional to a smaller total footprint across the nation.""A VERY DIFFERENT TRANSACTION"" Time Warner Cable's shares rose 7.3 percent to $183.60, still well below Charter's $195.71 cash and stock offer. Charter shares rose 2.5 percent to close at $179.78. Executives from Charter and Time Warner Cable said concerns were overblown that the deal could face the same opposition as the Comcast takeover did.""It's a smaller company so some of the concerns that were raised about potential abuses of a larger company don't pertain here,"" Time Warner Chief Executive Rob Marcus said in an interview.""It is also the case that we don't have any of the other complications that arose out of Comcast being a vertically integrated media company with a broadcast network, a movie studio, a national cable network,"" he said.Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports magazine, said on Tuesday that Time Warner Cable placed 16th out of 17 companies in its customer satisfaction survey, while Charter ranked 14th.Charter CEO Tom Rutledge, defending the quality of the company's service in an interview, said its slowest Internet data speed was a swift 60 megabits per second, which it offers for $60 a month. Time Warner Cable's ""basic"" tier is 10 megabits, initially priced at $30 a month, according to its website.Rutledge said the combined company would bring back customer service jobs to the United States that have been outsourced to offshore calling centers.""We plan to use in-house people to do service and transactions, and all that leads to higher quality, which actually reduces costs as your get better customer experiences,"" he said. ""WILL CABLE PRICES GO UP?"" Comcast walked away last month from the deal to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, citing regulatory concerns.Now the pressure is on Malone, a 74-year-old billionaire dubbed the ""King of Cable,"" to show that he can complete a deal that slipped away from his larger rival.The Charter/Time Warner Cable deal would likely be approved by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division but could face conditions at the Federal Communications Commission, said Gene Kimmelman, who worked at the Justice Department.""It's more of an FCC focus and there they have still a heavy lift. Will cable prices go up? Will broadband prices go up?"" said Kimmelman, now president of public interest group Public Knowledge. He added that the regulators' review would also focus on developing Internet video competition.If the deal is blocked, Charter would be on the hook for a $2 billion break-up fee, the companies said.Malone, who in the 1980s built a small Denver cable company into the nation's largest cable system, has been outspoken about the need for more consolidation.He said in 2013 that cable companies should team up to create a rival to Netflix, pooling their money to acquire the kind of content that would be too expensive for a single cable operator to acquire.As part of the complicated deal, Charter also wins control of Bright House Networks from Advance Newhouse for $10.4 billion. That would help Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence.A combined Charter-TWC would serve large clusters of subscribers in New York, Texas and California. Charter would have the size to undercut telecommunications companies in the lucrative data services market.

151,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 26 (Fitch) CCO Holding LLC's (CCOH) and Charter Communications  Operating, LLC's (CCO) 'BB-' Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) remain on Rating  Watch Positive following the announcement of the merger agreement today by  Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter) and Time Warner Cable, Inc. (TWC),  according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch placed CCOH and CCO's 'BB-' IDRs on Rating Watch Positive following the  April 2015 announcement of the acquisition of Bright House Networks, LLC (Bright  House) from Advance/Newhouse Partnership (A/N) for $10.4 billion. Following the  announcement that Comcast Corporation and TWC had terminated their merger  agreement, on May 18, 2015 Charter and A/N reaffirmed their commitment to  complete this deal under the same economic and governance terms. CCOH and CCO  are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter.  Fitch views the merger with TWC positively and believes it will strengthen  Charter's overall credit profile. Fitch anticipates that Charter's total  leverage, pro forma for both the TWC merger as it is currently structured and  the Bright House acquisition, would be 4.5x. Fitch notes that integration risks  are elevated and Charter's ability to manage the integration process and limit  disruption to the company's overall operations is key to the success of the  transactions. On a pro forma basis the combined company will serve 24 million customer  relationships and become the second largest cable multiple system operator in  the country. Pro forma revenues totalled approximately $36 billion during 2014  and EBITDA was approximately $13 billion. Charter's operating strategies are  having a positive impact on the company's operating profile resulting in a  strengthened competitive position. The market share-driven strategy, which is  focused on enhancing the overall competitiveness of Charter's video service and  leveraging its all-digital infrastructure, is improving subscriber metrics,  growing revenue and ARPU trends, and stabilizing operating margins. Charter's leverage as of the LTM ended March 31, 2015 was 4.4x excluding the  debt issued by CCOH Safari, LLC and CCO Safari, LLC. Management's leverage  target remains unchanged ranging between 4x and 4.5x. Fitch recognizes that a  large portion of the TWC transaction will involve senior secured debt, both  existing at TWC and new issuance. Depending on the ultimate capital structure, a  one or two notch upgrade could be possible provided that pro forma senior  secured leverage is at or below 4.0x and total leverage does not exceed 5.0x.  Resolution of the Rating Watch will largely be based on Fitch's review of  Charter's capital structure including assignment of potential equity credit to  the convertible preferred partnership units and an assessment of the risks  associated with Charter's ability to integrate the new cable systems from TWC  and Bright House. RATING SENSITIVITIES --Positive rating actions would be contemplated if the TWC merger and the Bright  House acquisition go forward as total leverage is expected to be 4.5x; --If the company demonstrates progress in closing gaps relative to its industry  peers on service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives; --Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and  cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy; --Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely coincide with a leveraging  transaction or the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that  increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan; --Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; --A perceived weakening of Charter's competitive position or failure of the  current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth  along with strengthening operating margins.

153,"  * Charter agrees to buy Time Warner Cable in $56 bln deal* Altice aims to earn half of sales from U.S. one day* Cablevision, Cox, Mediacom could be targets - analystsBy Leila AbboudPARIS, May 26 Patrick Drahi, the billionaire owner of deal-hungry European telecoms group Altice, will not let missing out on Time Warner Cable dissuade him from further expansion in the United States, people familiar with the situation said.Taking his first step across the Atlantic last week by agreeing to buy Suddenlink cable group for $9.1 billion , Drahi also held early talks with Time Warner Cable and weighed a bid, sources had told Reuters.But the 51-year-old Franco-Israeli businessman was beaten to the finishing line by Charter Communications, backed by his mentor turned rival, cable tycoon John Malone.Charter has offered to buy Time Warner Cable for $56 billion, seeking to combine the No. 3 and No. 2 U.S. cable operators if regulators agree.Altice does not intend to submit a fresh offer for TWC, two sources said late on Monday.""There are plenty of other cable companies in the U.S. besides Time Warner, and Altice still intends to be a player in the coming consolidation in the U.S. market,"" one of them said. But missing out on the big prize means that Altice could face a harder, more uncertain road in the United States, once the lines are redrawn by the latest deals, analysts said.Drahi will also have to move fast if he is to realise his mission set after the Suddenlink deal for Altice to one day earn half of its revenue in the United States.After buying Suddenlink, the seventh-biggest cable group in the United States, Altice will earn 12 percent of revenue from the market, with the rest coming from telecom and cable assets in France, Israel, Portugal and the Dominican Republic.Analysts said among the possible targets for Altice are Cox Communications, the fourth-largest U.S. cable group, which is in private hands; publicly traded, fifth-placed Cablevision  ; or privately held eighth-placed Mediacom. DEAL-MAKER Each target has strengths and weaknesses. Cox's family owners may not be interested in selling, while heavily indebted Cablevision faces considerable competition from Verizon Communications' fibre network in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and therefore is less profitable than some peers.Cablevision Chief Executive James Dolan said in early May he would be interested in a deal with another cable operator, but not telecom player Verizon.Altice shares dropped 6 percent to 123.10 euros at 1520 GMT, compared with a 1.1 percent fall for Europe's telecom index .Craig Moffett, analyst at independent research firm MoffettNathanson LLC, said in a note Altice would need to hurry to bid on something since Suddenlink ""on a standalone basis simply isn't compelling enough, at least at the price Altice paid for it"". Suddenlink has 1.2 million subscribers in the south and midwest regions, and Altice has the aim of stripping some $215 million in annual cost reductions out of the company.""To achieve their targeted 50-50 portfolio mix between U.S. and non-U.S. holdings, Altice would need to virtually run the table and buy half of everything out there that isn't named Comcast or Charter,"" Moffett said.""If one assumes that Cox isn't a seller (they're the largest remaining company after TWC and Charter itself, and they have sounded relatively resolute in their desire to remain independent) then Altice would need to successfully buy essentially everyone else.""""Altice will never amount to much more than a distant, distant third. Very likely, they too will be long term sellers to Charter,"" Moffett concluded.Others think it is too early to write off Drahi, who has surfed a wave of cheap debt to turn Altice into a serial acquirer since going public in January 2014.Last year alone, the group used its French cable company Numericable to take over the country's second largest mobile carrier SFR, as well as snapping up Portugal Telecom  and another operator in the Dominican Republic.""This is not the end of the road for Altice in the United States,"" said Emmanuel Carlier, analyst at ING who has a buy rating on Altice.""The company would not have bought Suddenlink without having the next steps in their heads. If it cannot get TWC, then it will probably buy other players but it will take a few years to carry out.""(Additional reporting by Gregory Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Alison Williams)",2015-05-26,CHTR,"Tue May 26, 2015 | 11:24am EDT",Altice's ambitions for U.S. undimmed after Time Warner Cable setback,http://www.reuters.com//article/twc-ma-charter-communi-altice-idUSL5N0YH33T20150526?type=companyNews

158,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 27 Charter Communications Inc  executives are exploring whether to launch an online video service as part of its combination with larger rival Time Warner Cable Inc, in what would be an unprecedented move in the cable industry.The $56 billion takeover announced on Tuesday would make Charter the No. 2 U.S. Internet and cable company after Comcast Corp. Charter's top shareholder John Malone, a cable industry pioneer, is on record as being a fan of streaming TV over the Internet.And Tom Rutledge, who would run the combined Charter-Time Warner Cable, has now opened the door to establishing the cable industry's first competitor to services like Netflix Inc  and Hulu.""We're certainly exploring that thought,"" Charter CEO Tom Rutledge said in an interview on Tuesday. ""But whether you can put an over-the-top product together today with the existing services that are in cable and make that work is unclear to us. It's certainly something of interest.""The development of Charter's video technology in recent years, which includes a shift to cloud-based systems, also make it a likely move, analysts say.New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said that Charter executives want to avoid the opposition faced by Comcast, which dropped its own Time Warner Cable bid after regulators expressed concern that the combined entity would stifle competition by gaining the largest market share in broadband and video streaming. ""Charter is going to be very proactive in helping that market emerge,"" he said. ""Even since the Comcast deal broke, they've been more vocal about over-the-top,""Companies from Sony Corp to Dish Network Corp  have launched online video, or ""over-the-top"" services. Apple Inc, which already sells an Internet TV device, has been talking to CBS Corp and others about an enhanced product that would more directly compete with cable operators.Cable companies such as Comcast have not yet launched their own Internet television services, in part over concern that it could threaten their existing pay-TV businesses that are seeing margins shrink. But Malone, chairman of Charter's largest investor Liberty Media Corp, suggested less than two years ago that cable companies should team up to take on Netflix.

The company has the technology to store video and meter video consumption to bill customers, said Ulis, who helps companies build online video products and does not work with Charter.An online video service from Charter could be somewhat similar to satellite operator Dish's Sling TV, which offers a fixed set of basic channels at $20 a month, Nixon said.Like Dish, Charter could go after its existing customer base as well as younger viewers who prefer consuming content online, analysts say.""The challenge about going to existing subscribers is you run the risk of cannibalizing,"" Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said.

159,"   By Davide Scigliuzzo  NEW YORK, May 27 (IFR) - Charter Communications said in an SEC filing on Wednesday that secured debt to be issued to finance its planned merger with Time Warner Cable would be rated investment-grade by two out of the three main rating agencies.The company said it expects to maintain a ratio of secured debt to adjusted EBITDA of the combined companies at about 3.5x. The secured portion of the expected US$31bn financing backing the deal will comprise of loans and bonds. Charter said the secured bonds would be eligible for investment grade indices. Charter announced on Tuesday a new bid to merge with Time Warner Cable and acquire Bright House Networks.

160,"  (Repeats for more subscribers; no change to text)By Diane Bartz and Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON May 26 Time Warner Cable, entering into talks to be acquired by  Charter Communications Inc just a month after regulators killed a proposed takeover by Comcast Corp's, was determined not to get burned a second time.It won such an insurance policy on Tuesday, when Charter included as part of its $56 billion takeover agreement a pledge to pay Time Warner Cable a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal goes south. Comcast, by contrast, had made no such pledge and was able to walk away scot-free when its bid collapsed.Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Rob Marcus said in an interview that the company had more leverage to negotiate various terms of the deal with Charter because it was a competitive process. Reuters reported that French telecom company Altice had been in talks about buying the company as well.Time Warner Cable's insistence on a breakup fee reflects lingering worries that the Federal Communications Commission, which rejected the Comcast deal over concerns about its broadband market reach and the future of online video, could do something similar in this case.Charter, meanwhile, was willing to pledge $2 billion because it is confident the deal will go through and it ultimately won't have to pay the fee, according to people close to the company who declined to speak on the record.Underscoring the high stakes involved, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler issued an unusually quick statement when the new deal was announced on Tuesday, reiterating that the agency will review the deal to determine whether it is in the public interest.""In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient,"" Wheeler said. ""The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved."" 'A HARD LOOK' While one FCC official noted that ""absolutely nothing about this transaction has been pre-judged"" and other experts warned against reading any implicit indications of opinion in the comment, some insiders saw Wheeler's statement as a reason for concern.""That's a shot across the bow,"" said one antitrust expert and former FCC official, who asked not to be identified to protect business relationships. ""If I were the parties, I wouldn't like that statement.""Although the FCC and the Department of Justice will both review the merger proposal, the former will present a higher hurdle for Charter because of its broad public interest standard. The Justice Department reviews deals' antitrust impact and has to prove actual harm to consumers to stop a merger. One issue of concern for regulators is whether the combination of Charter and Time Warner Cable will result in higher prices for cable and broadband, said Gene Kimmelman, a veteran of the Justice Department who is now president of the public interest group Public Knowledge.""It will get a hard look and it will depend on whether they will work out conditions,"" he said, adding that conditions usually can be worked out in such deals.Other industry analysts said Charter's deal would be viewed as less risky than that of Comcast because of its relatively smaller scale and lack of major content assets like Comcast's NBC Universal.""This is a qualitatively different deal,"" said Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and founder of Business in the Public Interest think tank. Charter kicked off a charm offensive in the deal's favor on Tuesday, pledging to invest more in faster broadband, public WiFi networks and high-speed Internet connections for small and medium-sized businesses. It also promised more affordable telephone service and better video products, including high definition channels.'DISMAL' CUSTOMER SERVICE Still, Charter will face tough questions on the U.S. broadband Internet market, of which the combined companies would control more than one-fifth, according to data from research firm MoffettNathanson.Wheeler said the FCC's review of a possible Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination led regulators to begin to consider cable companies less as traditional pay-TV providers and more as Internet service providers. The regulators are likely to seek reassurances that the new company would not harm the growing online content competition, for instance by charging high fees for access to its network, experts say. Charter currently does not charge such fees.""One of the biggest questions about Charter and Time Warner Cable is whether the deal is in the public interest. Frankly, we're skeptical,"" said Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.""Prices for cable and broadband continue to go up, and customer service is dismal.""And, as with any cable or Internet deal, regulators will look to see if Charter and Time Warner systems overlap, and require asset sales in areas where they do before approving any deal. Both Time Warner Cable and Charter are strongest along the eastern United States with a smattering of customers in Texas and California, although they directly compete in few, if any of those markets.

165,"   By Jonathan Schwarzberg and Lynn Adler | NEW YORK, June 4  NEW YORK, June 4 Huge takeovers by companies including cable operator Charter Communications Inc and chipmaker Avago Technologies promise to propel merger and acquisition loan volume from strong to certifiably robust as deals were announced at a record-breaking pace in May.Leveraged deals are taking a backseat to investment grade deals, however, as corporations with strong balance sheets and huge amounts of cash on their books are beating out sponsors already burdened by the constraint of leveraged lending guidance that has limited leverage to around 6.0 times on most deals.Industry insiders expect both leveraged and investment grade M&A activity to remain strong throughout the remainder of the year, with demand for debt outweighing supply despite the rash of new deals.""There's a lot of capital chasing the loan side of these deals,"" said George Tetler, a partner at Bowditch & Dewey, referring to debt investors.Companies in the United States announced $245.2 billion of mergers and acquisitions in May, breaking the all-time record of $225.8 billion for monthly M&A volume set in May 2007, according to data from Dealogic. So far this year volume in the United States has reached $825.8 billion, compared to $542.1 billion in the same period last year. M&A activity has boosted volume in a market that until the second quarter of the year was virtually void of refinancing activity.Total completed M&A loan volume is $176.5 billion year-to-date compared to $163.5 billion at this time last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. Another $96.2 billion is in the pipeline, led by Charter, which is arranging approximately $32 billion of loans to fund its acquisitions of fellow cable operators Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.Avago said it plans to arrange $15.5 billion of loans to back its purchase of rival Broadcom Corp, including $9 billion of new money and $6.5 billion of refinancing debt. Avago is a leveraged deal while Charter has said it anticipates netting an investment grade rating on its secured debt. This week, another chipmaker - Intel, the world's biggest - agreed to buy Altera for $16.7 billion, the third big deal this year in the highly fragmented chip industry.Charter is the largest M&A financing of the year so far, followed by a pair of other investment grade transactions. Drugmaker Abbvie lined up an $18 billion bridge loan to support its $21 billion acquisition of pharmaceutical company Pharmacyclics in March for the second-largest deal. Drugstore CVS Caremark Corp arranged a $13 billion bridge loan to finance its $12.7 billion purchase of pharmacy services provider Omnicare.  PIPELINE BOOST Investment grade deals have made up 41.5 percent of completed M&A financing this year, and this number jumps to 50.3 percent including deals in the pipeline. Last year at this time, investment grade deals made up just 35.8 percent of total volume.""On the investment grade side, people had been waiting for the floodgates to open for a while, and fairly clearly they have now opened,"" said Jason Kyrwood a partner at Davis Polk, adding the deals tend to come in waves by sector, from food companies last year to pharma and healthcare to telecom.Cross-border deals have also become more prevalent. It does not look like M&A activity is ready to slow down yet.""The chatter I am hearing suggests that the pipeline remains robust, with a few nice larger transactions still to come,"" Kyrwood said, referring to both leveraged and non-leveraged deals.In particular, Tetler noted that General Electric Co's decision to sell most of financial services unit GE Capital should spur M&A activity in the financial services sector throughout the remainder of the year, as GE sells off the unit in pieces.

168,"  WASHINGTON, June 5 New U.S. net neutrality regulations have not affected how Charter Communications Inc  invests in building its telecoms networks, Chief Executive Tom Rutledge told Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler this week.In a meeting with Wheeler and other FCC officials, disclosed in a government filing on Friday, Rutledge discussed Charter's $56 billion takeover bid for bigger rival Time Warner Cable Inc , which the FCC must approve.One big issue overshadowing telecom mergers is the FCC's recent passage of new Internet traffic regulations, which AT&T and trade groups representing cable and wireless broadband providers, including Charter, are fighting in court. In their court case, they cite threats to innovation and investment among other factors. Rutledge, however, told Wheeler that ""the commission's decision to reclassify broadband Internet access under Title II has not altered Charter's approach of investing significantly in its network to deliver cutting edge services,"" according to the disclosure of the June 2 meeting. A federal appeals court is currently weighing the telecom and cable companies' request to delay implementation of the net neutrality rules, which are slated to go into effect on June 12.

In its first official argument in support of the deals, Charter also said the new company would not harm online video services providers as its success would depend on the broadband business rather than on video services.Charter would invest at least $2.5 billion in commercial areas and deploy over 300,000 out-of-home WiFi access points, according to the filing.The company had in May announced its offer to buy bigger rival TWC for $56 billion, prompting a statement from the FCC that the deal would be reviewed to determine whether it was in the public interest. Charter had said in March it would buy Bright House Networks for $10.4 billion to expand its cable network.The proposed deals mark a huge step towards industry consolidation, long advocated by cable pioneer John Malone, Charter's biggest shareholder, as the new company would control a big swath of the cable and Internet markets.

171,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON, June 29  NEW YORK/LONDON, June 29 Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worldwide in the second quarter of 2015 almost matched the record set in the second quarter of 2007, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data, as big companies turned to deals to boost their market share.Low interest rates and stronger confidence among chief executives have led to a steady rise in M&A activity in the last two years to close to pre-2008 financial crisis levels. The second quarter of 2015, however, stands out for the number of mega deals that were clinched or attempted.These include Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion acquisition of British rival BG Group Plc, cable operator Charter Communications Inc's $78.7 billion merger with Time Warner Cable Inc, and chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd's $37 billion acquisition of peer Broadcom Corporation.Such large deals drove M&A volumes globally in the second quarter of 2015 up by 34.6 percent year-on-year to $1.33 trillion as of June 26, shy of the record $1.41 trillion seen in the second quarter of 2007.""Given the consolidation that is going on across numerous sectors, to be a bystander could mean losing ground from a competitive standpoint,"" said Gary Posternack, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Barclays Plc.""Companies are mapping out their industry landscapes, focusing on transactions that could position themselves as industry leaders, and acting aggressively to try to bring them to fruition,"" Posternack added. Consolidation was often sparked by one company exploring a sale and spurring its rivals into action. In the United States, for example, health insurer Humana Inc's decision to put itself on the block prompted peers Cigna Corp, Aetna Inc , Anthem Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc  to also explore other deals.To be sure, there were several takeover approaches in the quarter that were rebuffed. Cigna has so far snubbed Anthem's $53.8 billion acquisition proposal, natural gas pipeline company Williams Companies Inc rejected a $53.1 billion offer from peer Energy Transfer Equity LP, and generic drug maker Mylan NV is resisting a roughly $50 billion bid by  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, while also seeking to acquire rival Perrigo Company Plc in a hostile $35 billion bid.""The public markets have become more receptive to companies taking control of another company in a transformational way, even when the target may be reluctant to sell or merge,"" said Robin Rankin, global M&A co-head at Credit Suisse Group AG . STRATEGIC DEALS A major difference between the recent M&A boom and that  seen in 2007 is that the latter was to a large extent fueled by private equity-backed leveraged buyouts, as opposed to this year's strategic corporate deals. In fact, the first half of 2015 has seen the slowest six-month period for private equity-backed acquisitions since 2012.""For private equity investors, one of the main issues is the limited supply of assets. They have money to put to work but it proves hard for them to compete against industry players or new money pools in fiercely competitive auctions,"" said Luigi Rizzo, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Corp Despite the near-record M&A volumes, and the frothy valuations that have accompanied them, dealmakers say companies that see a strong strategic rationale remain committed to acquisitions.""When you are in the boardroom, discussion is not generally focused on whether we are in a bubble or not, or how long will this M&A trend continue. The discussion is rather about fundamentals, what is happening to operations and how much is the business worth,"" said Stephen Arcano, M&A head at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.M&A volumes jumped in all three regions. More companies showed appetite for cross-border dealmaking, with U.S. agrochemicals company Monsanto Co launching a bid for Switzerland's Syngenta AG, and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc going after German peer K+S AG .""Buyers are looking for growth and borders do not represent obstacles. If they can buy something in emerging markets, developed Asia or in Europe, that is consistent with their strategy, that will be what they want to do,"" said Bob Eatroff, Americas M&A co-head at Morgan Stanley.Macro-economic concerns such as Greece's debt crisis and China's interest rate policies did not dampen M&A sentiment in Europe and Asia in the second quarter. Dealmakers say this could change if concerns over Greece or other issue curb risk taking.""The market backdrop in Europe could be described as a form of surreal stability; markets are favorable, but there are potential risks on the horizon which may not yet have been factored in,"" said Robert Leitão, head of Rothschild's global financial advisory team.

""But (the high-yield bond) does not have to come (yet). So that can be tabled until the market is stronger.""The go/no-go decision tomorrow morning would depend on the tone in the broader markets, with buyside and sellside alike watching the Greek debt standoff and China's stock market rout. Syndicate bankers say that, despite those woes, investor appetite for quality paper remains strong.Charter's merger with TWC will combine the fourth and second-largest cable players in the US. The cable M&A deal would be the largest of its kind since records began in 1980, and the sixth-largest US M&A deal on record, according to Thomson Reuters data, valuing TWC at US$78.7bn including debt and US$56bn without.Charter initially said it had lined up commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and UBS when it announced details of the planned acquisition in May.IFR later reported that Deutsche Bank had also joined the line up of banks arranging the financing.

The split-rated trade had amassed more than US$40bn of orders at the time it was launched, allowing Charter to tighten pricing on all six tranches.     Goldman Sachs was global coordinator on the deal - rated Ba1/BBB-/BBB- by Moody's, S&P and Fitch - with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse as active books, and Deutsche Bank and UBS as passives.     Charter was expected to pay about 8bp-15bp in new issue concessions compared with Time Warner outstandings - an impressive result given the recent volatility in the market.     The bonds were quoting about 5bp tighter than their launch levels in the gray market.         The senior secured notes are part of what is expected to be a US$31bn M&A funding package that will also include high-yield bonds and bank debt.

182,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Friday said it boosted its stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Corp (CHTR.O), and signaled it may have another large investment planned after agreeing to buy Precision Castparts Corp (PCP.N) in its largest-ever purchase.Berkshire also appeared to have shed its stakes in oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N) and refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) in the second quarter, as the oil industry struggles with falling prices.The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire's $107.2 billion U.S. stock portfolio on June 30.Berkshire kept some details about its holdings confidential. The SEC sometimes lets the Omaha, Nebraska-based company delay disclosures of new stakes so Buffett can build them quietly, rather than have investors piggyback on him before he finishes.Friday's filing suggests that only a small percentage of the $3.09 billion of stock that Berkshire bought in the quarter went to companies it already owned.Berkshire held 8.51 million shares of Charter worth $1.46 billion on June 30, up from 5.98 million shares on March 31. It also confirmed its purchase of 20 million shares, or 8.7 percent, of paint maker Axalta Coating Systems Ltd (AXTA.N) from controlling shareholder Carlyle Group LP (CG.O).Berkshire reported lower stakes in conglomerate Chicago Bridge & Iron Co (CBI.N), media company Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and Wabco Holdings Inc (WBC.N), which sells braking and suspension systems for commercial vehicles.It swapped most of what was once a much larger Phillips 66 stake for a chemicals business in February 2014. Friday's filing did not disclose who made which Berkshire investments. Smaller investments are often made by Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may eventually succeed Buffett as chief investment officers.Combs invested in Precision Castparts before Berkshire said on Monday it would buy the aerospace parts maker. The transaction valued that company at $32.3 billion.Other prominent investors such as Jana Partners and Davis Selected advisers bought Precision Castparts during the quarter. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) remained Berkshire's biggest stock  holding.Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) became Berkshire's second-biggest holding last month, when H.J. Heinz Co bought Kraft Foods Group Inc. That transformed Berkshire's 52.5 percent stake in Heinz into a 26.9 percent stake in Kraft Heinz.Berkshire owns more than 80 businesses, including the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance.

186,"   By Jonathan Schwarzberg | NEW YORK, Sept 3  NEW YORK, Sept 3 Big issuers of US leveraged loans including cable company Charter Communications Inc  and chipmaker Avago Technologies will test the US leveraged loan market by launching jumbo deals after the Labor Day holiday, but could benefit from a flight to quality after global equity market turmoil.Investors are expected to favor large liquid deals for highly-rated companies as they become more selective about deals that they are willing to hold on their books in a 'risk off' environment as China's stock market crash and slumping commodities prices exacerbate fears of increasing default rates.""I believe there's a higher degree of uncertainty right now driven by a combination of historically low commodity prices and equity market volatility plus what happens with interest rates,"" said Kevin Lockhart, global co-head of leveraged finance at Jefferies.Wider market volatility usually pushes secondary prices lower, and average secondary bids on the SMi100 index of most widely held loans dropped to 98.71 at the start of September from 99.62 on July 21. This typically prompts a pricing correction in the primary market as investors call for higher pricing or discounts and improved terms, including adding or boosting call protection and adding most favored nation clauses.Charter and Avago have jumbo multi-billion dollar acquisition loans to launch after Labor Day, despite launching smaller deals before the holiday to minimize execution risk on the larger financings in light of market turmoil.These jumbo loans could be less affected by typical market dynamics, however, due to low dealflow this year in the US leveraged loan market and continued demand from deal-hungry investors as new Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds, the main buyers of loans, have continue to be issued.US leveraged volume was just US$559bn at the end of August for the year to date, 19% lower than US$689bn in the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. ""It feels like pricing should widen a bit, but that is offset by the combination of CLO creation and the fact that year over year volume is low,"" Lockhart said.The volume of deals launching after Labor Day is unlikely to change excess demand, which will continue to favor borrowers with strong credit profiles, another banker said.This means that Charter and Avago's bellwether deals may still be able to achieve competitive pricing, although smaller, less liquid deals are expected to see more revision.""The top tier of credits is probably going to be on par with pricing earlier this year and may be slightly tighter on occasion because everyone is going to be chasing quality."" Lockhart said. PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES Charter and Avago launched smaller deals in July and August to reduce the size and risk of the remaining loans that they need to raise. Investors were supportive and both deals were increased from original targets.Charter increased a term loan H financing to US$3.8bn from US$3.5bn on July 22, which part-finances its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks LLC, which total US$78.7bn. The company still has commitments to issue a further US$5.2bn of debt to help finance the acquisitions. Avago increased a term loan A to US$4.25bn from US$3.25bn on August 14, which also part-financed its US$37bn acquisition of rival Broadcom Corp. The company said that it plans to line up a total of US15.5bn to finance the deal, leaving more than US$10bn to raise. Avago will use US$9bn of loans to finance the acquisition and US$6.5bn will refinance debt.Charter and Avago's follow-on deals are expected to be well received by investors, a senior banker said, adding that deals at the lower end of the credit spectrum will not find as much interest from investors.Demand for riskier lower-rated deals and subordinated second lien loans has fallen in the recent market rout. Many buyers were crossover high-yield investors and deals with second-lien debt are now being restructured with bonds when possible. Private equity firms and alternative lenders may also buy second lien tranches if they are small enough.Bankers still expect September to be busy due to continued mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity with deals in the pipeline including a financing backing fashion department store operator Belk Inc's US$3bn buyout by Sycamore Partners, which has commitments from nine banks.The current round of equity market volatility is expected to create new financing opportunities in the fall, but fewer jumbo deals of Charter's or Avago's scale are expected.""It's not a market that is dominated by big deals right now,"" the banker said. ""But there are going to be quite a few more things on the calendar.""

If the TWC merger does not occur, the CCOH Safari  notes are required to be repaid, and Fitch will withdraw the rating.  At this time, Fitch maintains CCOH and CCO's current 'BB-' IDRs and related debt  securities on Rating Watch Positive. CCOH Safari was created to allow Charter to opportunistically pre-fund the  transactions, with the proceeds placed into escrow in CCOH Safari until the  transactions are completed. Prior to the consummation of the transactions, the  notes will be secured by a first-priority interest in the cash held in CCOH  Safari's escrow account. The cash will be released once the transactions are  complete and all related conditions are met, at which time CCOH Safari will  merge into CCOH which will become the obligor of the notes. If the transactions  are not completed, the notes will be subject to a mandatory redemption at par.  Once the notes become the obligations of CCOH, they will rank pari passu in  right of payment with all existing and future senior notes and all existing and  future unsubordinated, unsecured debt of CCOH.  On May 23, 2015, Charter announced a merger with TWC for total consideration of  $196.60 per share, providing a total valuation for TWC of $78.7 billion as of  the announcement date. The offer consists of a combination of cash and Charter  stock totaling $56.4 billion for all outstanding TWC shares. As part of the  transaction, approximately $23.3 billion of existing TWC debt will be rolled  into CCO and will have equal and ratable security with all first lien debt  (existing Charter and TWC debt and newly issued debt). The TWC merger is not  contingent on the acquisition of Bright House. TWC's total consideration assumes that all TWC shareholders elect to receive  $100.00 cash and 0.5409 shares of Charter common stock for each share of TWC  common stock. However, TWC's shareholders have the option to receive $115.00  cash and 0.4562 shares of Charter common stock for each share of TWC common  stock. If the latter occurs, Charter has committed financing for approximately  $4.3 billion of additional unsecured debt to be issued by CCOH. Fitch views both transactions positively and believes they will strengthen  Charter's overall credit profile. Fitch anticipates that Charter's total  leverage, pro forma for both the TWC merger as it is currently structured and  the Bright House acquisition, would be under 5.0x at closing. Integration risks  are elevated, and Charter's ability to manage the integration process and limit  disruption to the company's overall operations is key to the success of the  transactions. On a pro forma basis the combined company will serve 24 million customer  relationships and become the second largest cable multiple system operator in  the country. Pro forma revenues totalled approximately $36 billion during 2014  and EBITDA was approximately $13 billion. Charter's operating strategies are  having a positive impact on the company's operating profile resulting in a  strengthened competitive position. The market share-driven strategy, which is  focused on enhancing the overall competitiveness of Charter's video service and  leveraging its all-digital infrastructure, is improving subscriber metrics,  growing revenue and ARPU trends, and stabilizing operating margins. Resolution of the Rating Watch will largely be based on Fitch's review of  Charter's ultimate capital structure including assignment of potential equity  credit to the convertible preferred partnership units and an assessment of the  risks associated with Charter's ability to integrate the new cable systems from  TWC and Bright House. KEY RATING DRIVERS All three entities regularly produce strong levels of free cash flow (FCF) that  provide the company with substantial financial flexibility. Charter management  stated that, in the short term, they will use FCF to meet existing and planned  amortization, which along with EBITDA improvement is expected to lower leverage  by 0.6x annually. They also stated that there are no short-term plans for  shareholder friendly activities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions would be contemplated if the TWC merger and the Bright  House acquisition go forward as total leverage is expected to be below 5.0x; --If the company demonstrates progress in closing gaps relative to its industry  peers on service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives; --Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and  cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy; --Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely coincide with a leveraging  transaction or the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy that  increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of a credible deleveraging plan; --Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; --A perceived weakening of Charter's competitive position or failure of the  current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth  along with strengthening operating margins. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as  satisfactory given the rating category. Charter's financial flexibility will  improve in step with the growth of free cash flow generation. Charter generated  $543 million of free cash flow (FCF) during the LTM period ended Sept.  30,  2015. FCF has been increasing due primarily to a decrease in capital  expenditures driven by the completion of Charter's transition to all digital in  2014. The company's liquidity position is primarily supported by available  borrowing capacity from its $1.3 revolver and anticipated free cash flow  generation. Commitments under the company's revolver will expire in April 2018.  As of Sept. 30, 2015, approximately $1.0 billion was available for borrowing. Charter's leverage as of the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2015 was 4.2x (excluding the  debt issued by CCOH Safari, LLC and CCO Safari, LLC which was repaid following  the termination of the Comcast TWC merger.) Charter's total leverage target  remains unchanged ranging between 4x and 4.5x. Fitch recognizes that a large  portion of the TWC transaction will involve senior secured debt, both existing  at TWC and new issuance. Charter recently stated that it expects to maintain a  senior leverage target of 3.5x following the completion of the TWC and Bright  House transactions. Depending on the ultimate capital structure, a one or two  notch upgrade of Charter's IDR and existing ratings could be possible provided  that pro forma senior secured leverage is at or below 4.0x and total leverage  does not exceed 5.0x.

212,"  (Adds details on T-Mobile, Puerto Rico Telephone company;  Liberty and Comcast could not be reached for comment)By David Shepardson and Malathi NayakWASHINGTON/NEW YORK March 18 The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Friday that it had received 104 applications to take part in an auction of valuable low-frequency airwaves relinquished by TV broadcasters,     including many wireless companies who want to use the airwaves to build new networks or improve existing coverage.The government plays the middleman in the auction designed so broadcasters are incentivized to sell at the lowest rates and telecom companies are encouraged to buy at the highest rates. The government keeps a large part of the difference.The FCC said 69 applications are complete and 35 are incomplete. The incomplete applicants have until April 6 to finish their application.The applicants include subsidiaries of Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc  and Liberty Global Plc  and many U.S. rural carriers. Some applications were filed by individuals, partnerships, consortiums or other corporate entities and ownership of the entities will not be publicly known until Monday. Also applying to bid is Puerto Rico Telephone Company Inc, a firm owned by Mexican telecom giant America Movil SAB, which is controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim.In an FCC filing from February seen by Reuters, Liberty's subsidiary ""Liberty Spectrum Inc"" told the agency that it may bid on one or more blocks of low-frequency spectrum in the auction to potentially provide mobile wireless services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Global, headquartered in London and backed by cable pioneer John Malone, could not be immediately reached for comment.Malone's Liberty Broadband Corp. backs U.S.-based pay-TV provider Charter Communications Inc, which appeared on Friday to be absent from the FCC's list although more details could emerge on Monday once the agency releases the auction applications. Charter's chief executive has said in recent weeks participation in the auction was unlikely. Comcast Corp and Dish Network Corp both said previously they planned to bid.A person familiar with the bids said that cable company Comcast had bid through a company with a different name. Comcast did not respond to a request for comment. Silicon Valley investment firm Social Capital has said it will take part and filed an application, while the No.4 U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp and Alphabet Inc, which participated but did not buy in a 2008 auction, have said they are sitting out.Analysts forecast that the upcoming auction could fetch proceeds in the $15 billion to $45 billion range, but they expect bidders to be less aggressive than in the FCC's last auction, the ""AWS-3 auction,"" which ended last year and set a record of $44.9 billion in bids.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said earlier this month that he was ""encouraged by the strong interest that we have seen both from broadcasters interested in selling their spectrum and the broad assortment of parties interested in buying it.""Separately, the FCC said Friday that a decision by a federal appeals court late Thursday to allow Latina Broadcasters to provisionally participate in the auction that begins March 29 will not delay the auction.The FCC in February denied Latina Broadcasters application to participate.

217,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained the 'BB-' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDR) assigned to CCO Holdings, LLC (CCOH) and Charter Communications  Operating, LLC (CCO) on Rating Watch Positive. Fitch has also affirmed the  specific issue ratings assigned to CCO Safari II, LLC (CCO Safari II) and CCO  Safari III, LLC (CCO Safari III). A complete list of rating actions follows at  the end of this release. Approximately $35.9 billion of debt (principal value)  outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2015 is affected by Fitch's action. CCOH and CCO are  indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter). This release and maintenance of the Rating Watch are in accordance with Fitch's  guidelines related to the review of Rating Watch status following Fitch's  placement of the companies' ratings on Rating Watch Positive on April 2, 2015.  Fitch placed CCOH and CCO's 'BB-' IDRs on Rating Watch Positive following the  announcement of the acquisition of Bright House Networks (Bright House) from  Advance/Newhouse Partnership (A/N). The Bright House acquisition is valued at  $11.1 billion as of Feb. 4, 2016. Resolution of the Rating Watch will be based largely on Fitch's review of  Charter's capital structure if the transactions are completed. Further inputs  will include the assignment of potential equity credit to the convertible  preferred partnership units and a further assessment of the risks associated  with Charter's ability to integrate cable systems acquired from TWC and Bright  House. Depending on the ultimate capital structure, a one- or two-notch upgrade  could be possible. On May 23, 2015, Charter announced a merger with Time Warner Cable, Inc. (TWC)  for total consideration of $203.28 per share as of Feb. 4, 2016, providing a  total valuation for TWC of $80.1 billion. The offer consists of a combination of  cash and Charter stock totaling $58.4 billion for all outstanding TWC shares.  TWC shareholders have two options for the split between cash and Charter common  stock: 1) $100.00 cash and 0.5409 shares of Charter common stock for each share  of TWC common stock or 2) $115.00 cash and 0.4562 shares of Charter common stock  for each share of TWC common stock. If shareholders choose the latter option,  Charter has the financial flexibility, which may include a portion of the net  proceeds from its February 2016 issuance of $1.7 billion of senior notes due  2024, to fund the increased cash needs. If Charter requires additional liquidity  to satisfy cash funding needs for TWC shareholders, CCOH has committed financing  in place for $5 billion of unsecured debt. KEY RATING DRIVERS M&A Activity Credit-Positive: Fitch views the TWC and Bright House transactions  positively and believes they will strengthen Charter's overall credit profile.  Fitch anticipates that Charter's total leverage, pro forma for both the TWC  merger as it is currently structured and the Bright House acquisition, would be  under 5x at closing. The Federal Communications Commission and the U.S.  Department of Justice are expected to issue conditionally positive rulings  within the next few weeks, while Charter has received approval from each state  it will operate in, except California, which is expected to issue a ruling in  May 2016. Integration Key to Success: Integration risks are elevated with two simultaneous  transactions, and Charter's ability to manage the integration process and limit  disruption to the company's overall operations is key to the success of the  transactions. Credit Profile Changes: Charter's pro forma Fitch-calculated total leverage will  exceed its target of 4x and 4.5x at closing, but is expected to fall below 4.5x  within 12 months. In addition, the company stated it expects its first lien  leverage to be below 3.5x following the completion of the TWC and Bright House  transactions. On a pro forma operating basis, the combined company will serve 24  million customers and become the second largest cable multiple system operator  in the country  Improving Operating Momentum: Charter's operating strategies are having a  positive impact on the company's operating profile, resulting in a strengthened  competitive position. The market-share-driven strategy, focused on enhancing  Charter's video service competitiveness and leveraging its all-digital  infrastructure, is improving subscriber metrics, growing revenue and average  revenue per unit (ARPU) trends, and stabilizing operating margins. Digital Initiatives Enable FCF Growth: Charter has completed its all-digital-service transition, which, along with the introduction of its  interactive IP-based video user interface, positions the company to offer a more  competitive service. Fitch anticipates these initiatives will alleviate  residential video subscriber losses and increase service penetration while  boosting ARPUs, and translate into accelerating revenue growth, margin expansion  and growing free cash flow (FCF) generation. Strong FCF Provides Financial Flexibility: All three entities (Charter, TWC and  Bright House) produce strong FCF that provide the companies, separately and in  aggregate, substantial financial flexibility. Once the transactions are  completed, Charter stated it will use FCF in the short term to meet existing and  planned amortization, which along with EBITDA improvement is expected to lower  leverage by 0.6x annually. They also stated there are no short-term plans for  shareholder-friendly activities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Due to the uncertainty surrounding approval of the TWC and Bright House  transactions, Fitch's forecast reflects Charter on a standalone basis. Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Charter include: --Low-to-mid-single-digit cable revenue growth highlighted by continued  high-speed data and commercial service revenue growth. --EBITDA margins remain flat reflecting ARPU growth from subscribers taking more  advanced video services and higher speed data service tiers, offset by increased  programming costs and spending to enhance customer service and products. --Fitch estimates Charter will generate $400 million of FCF in 2016, slightly  less than the anticipated $1 billion to $1.2 billion of FCF during 2017 and  2018, respectively. FCF in 2016 is negatively impacted by additional interest  expense related to debt issued by CCOH Safari, LLC, CCO Safari II, and CCO  Safari III (collectively, Safari Entities). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating actions would be contemplated given the following: --The TWC merger and the Bright House acquisition go forward as expected and  total leverage is below 5.0x; --If the company demonstrates progress in closing gaps relative to its industry  peers in service penetration rates and strategic bandwidth initiatives; --Operating profile strengthens as the company captures sustainable revenue and  cash flow growth envisioned when implementing the current operating strategy. Fitch believes negative rating actions would likely occur given the following: --A leveraging transaction or the adoption of a more aggressive financial  strategy that increases leverage beyond 5.5x in the absence of a credible  deleveraging plan; --Adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy; --A perceived weakening of Charter's competitive position or failure of the  current operating strategy to produce sustainable revenue and cash flow growth  along with strengthening operating margins. LIQUIDITY Fitch regards Charter's liquidity position and overall financial flexibility as  satisfactory given the rating category. Charter's financial flexibility will  improve in step with the growth of FCF generation. Charter generated $519  million of FCF during the year ended Dec. 31, 2015. Although FCF had been  increasing due primarily to a decrease in capital expenditures driven by the  completion of Charter's transition to all-digital in 2014, 2015 was negatively  impacted by interest expense associated with debt issued for the transactions.  The company's liquidity position includes cash of $5 million, excluding cash  held in escrow at Safari Entities, and is supported by $961 million of borrowing  capacity from its $1.3 billion revolver and anticipated FCF generation.  Commitments under the company's revolver will expire in April 2018. Fitch notes  that the revolver will increase to $3 billion as part of the TWC and Bright  House transactions. Charter's leverage as of the last 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2015 was 4.1x,  excluding the debt issued by Safari Entities. Charter's total leverage target  remains unchanged, ranging between 4x and 4.5x, and will remain unchanged  following the completion of the transactions. Fitch recognizes that a large  portion of the TWC transaction will involve senior secured debt, both at TWC and  the Safari Entities, including approximately $22.5 billion of existing TWC  senior secured debt. All existing TWC and Safari Entities first-lien debt will  be rolled into CCO and will have equal and ratable security with all existing  Charter first-lien debt.  Charter stated it expects its first lien leverage of 3.5x upon the closing of  the transactions. Depending on the ultimate capital structure, a one- or  two-notch upgrade of Charter's IDR and existing ratings could be possible  provided that pro forma senior secured leverage is at or below 4x and total  leverage does not exceed 5x. Charter proactively extended its maturity profile and only 5% of outstanding  debt matures before 2019, including $93 million and $102 million during 2016 and  2017, respectively. Fitch believes that Charter has the financial flexibility to  retire near-term maturities with cash on hand and future FCF.

220,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A California administrative law judge recommended approving Charter Communications Inc's (CHTR.O) proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable TWC.N and Bright House Networks with some significant conditions, according to a decision made public late on Tuesday.California is the last state where the deal still faces approval. The approval by various states is in addition to a decision by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which is continuing its review of the transactions that would make Charter the No. 2 U.S. internet and cable company after Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).In California, the decision faces a vote by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as early as May 12.Charter said last May it would buy Time Warner Cable, the fourth-largest U.S. cable company, in a $56 billion cash-and-stock deal. Charter also announced in March 2015 it would buy Bright House Networks in a $10.4 billion deal.In his proposed decision, CPUC Administrative Law Judge Karl Bemesderfer found that the merger was ""in the public interest."" But the 70-page proposed decision imposes significant conditions on Charter. Within two and a half years of closing the transaction, Charter must convert all households in its California service territory to an all-digital platform with download speeds of not less than 60 Mbps - higher speeds than many users currently have.In addition, Charter must offer all customers in California the option of acquiring their own modems and cable set-top boxes without any price increases.The proposed decision also says Charter must comply with the FCC's open internet ""net neutrality"" order - even if a federal appeals court strikes it down. A court ruling on the FCC order could come as early as this week. California's five-member commission often amends a proposed decision before approving it. A commissioner could also propose an alternate decision.Charter said in a statement late Tuesday it was ""pleased the regulatory process is moving forward and will continue our productive engagement at the California Public Utilities Commission as we work toward obtaining final approval in the weeks ahead and bringing the benefits of New Charter to more Californians.” The proposed decision would impose other restrictions on Charter for three years: It could not adopt fees for users to use specific third-party internet applications and could not engage in usage-based billing or impose data caps during that time frame.Last week, Charter's chief executive met with the head of the FCC on the proposed tie-ups.New Charter would be the third-largest pay-TV provider in the country, serving roughly 17.3 million customers, and the second-largest broadband provider, with 19.4 million subscribers in nearly 40 states.

223,"   By Diane Bartz, Malathi Nayak and David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Justice Department on Monday gave antitrust approval to Charter Communications Inc's (CHTR.O) proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and Bright House networks, which would create the second-largest U.S. broadband provider and third-largest video provider.The Justice Department's approval carried conditions designed to protect competition, coming at a time when the pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix (NFLX.O) and Hulu.The Federal Communications Commission must also approve the deal, and the agency's chairman on Monday said he, too, was prepared to put conditions on the merger aimed at promoting broadband competition.The Justice Department said that as part of its approval, Charter agreed to refrain from telling its content providers that they cannot also sell shows online.""Continued growth of OVDs (online video) promises to deliver more competitive choices and a greater ability for consumers to customize their consumption of video content to their individual viewing preferences and budgets,"" the Justice Department said in a court filing. ""The emergence of OVDs threatens to upend the competitive landscape.""At the FCC, Chairman Tom Wheeler said he circulated an order seeking approval of the merger with conditions that ""will directly benefit consumers by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband deployment."" Wheeler said if approved the conditions would require Charter to extend high speed internet access to another two million customers within five years – with one million served by a broadband competitor. Additionally, Charter would not be permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps and would be prohibited from charging interconnection fees, including to online video providers, which deliver large volumes of internet traffic to broadband customers. He said the agreement would ""demonstrate the viability of one broadband provider overbuilding another.""It was not immediately clear when the FCC would decide. Both sets of conditions would be in place for seven years;  Charter had sought three. Charter has valued the deal at $56.7 billion for Time Warner Cable, excluding debt, and $10.4 billion for Bright House Networks.Charter said it was pleased with both the Justice Department and FCC's actions. ""We are confident New Charter will be a leading competitor in the broadband and video markets,"" the company said in a statement.   Shareholders of both companies have approved the deal. The only other outstanding approval needed is from one last state, California. An administrative judge has recommended the state's public utilities commission approve the deal, which could come as early as May 12Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp (LMCA.O), had pursued TWC as far back as 2013.

224,"  (Adds further conditions being sought by FCC)By Diane Bartz, Malathi Nayak and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, April 25 The U.S. Justice Department on Monday gave antitrust approval to Charter Communications Inc's proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc  and Bright House networks, which would create the second-largest U.S. broadband provider and third-largest video provider.The Justice Department's approval carried conditions designed to protect competition, coming at a time when the pay television industry faces stagnation due to new competition from over-the-web rivals like Netflix and Hulu.The Federal Communications Commission must also approve the deal, and the agency's chairman on Monday said he, too, was prepared to put conditions on the merger aimed at promoting broadband competition.The Justice Department said that as part of its approval, Charter agreed to refrain from telling its content providers that they cannot also sell shows online.""Continued growth of OVDs (online video) promises to deliver more competitive choices and a greater ability for consumers to customize their consumption of video content to their individual viewing preferences and budgets,"" the Justice Department said in a court filing. ""The emergence of OVDs threatens to upend the competitive landscape."" At the FCC, Chairman Tom Wheeler said he circulated an order seeking approval of the merger with conditions that ""will directly benefit consumers by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband deployment.""Wheeler said if approved the conditions would require Charter to extend high speed internet access to another two million customers within five years - with one million served by a broadband competitor.Additionally, Charter would not be permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps and would be prohibited from charging interconnection fees, including to online video providers, which deliver large volumes of internet traffic to broadband customers. He said the agreement would ""demonstrate the viability of one broadband provider overbuilding another."" It was not immediately clear when the FCC would decide.Both sets of conditions would be in place for seven years;  Charter had sought three.Charter has valued the deal at $56.7 billion for Time Warner Cable, excluding debt, and $10.4 billion for Bright House Networks. Charter said it was pleased with both the Justice Department and FCC's actions. ""We are confident New Charter will be a leading competitor in the broadband and video markets,"" the company said in a statement.Shareholders of both companies have approved the deal. The only other outstanding approval needed is from one last state, California. An administrative judge has recommended the state's public utilities commission approve the deal, which could come as early as May 12Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp, had pursued TWC as far back as 2013.

245,"   By David Shepardson  Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable company, will pay a $2.3 million fine to resolve a federal investigation into allegations the company wrongfully charged cable TV customers for services and equipment they never authorized.The Federal Communications Commission said on Tuesday it had received numerous complaints from consumers that Comcast added charges to their bills for unordered services, including premium channels, set-top boxes and digital video recorders.Comcast will implement a five-year compliance plan as part of a consent decree, the FCC said, and must offer a detailed program for responding to consumer complaints ""in a standardized and expedient fashion."" By next year, the FCC said, Comcast must send customers a separate order confirmation of new services, allow customers to block additional cable services, improve customer record keeping and require additional employee training for individuals placing excessive unauthorized charges on customer bills.Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice said the company did  not agree with the FCC's legal theory but added, ""We acknowledge that, in the past, our customer service should have been better and our bills clearer."" She also said Comcast had already committed to make most changes sought by the FCC. The FCC investigation found numerous examples of Comcast billing customers for services they did not want but would not refund charges. Customers were often told by Comcast that the company would only address six months of billing issues because of its computer systems, the FCC said. In June, a U.S. Senate panel found overbilling to thousands of consumers by Charter Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable, which has since been acquired by Charter.The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said the companies made no effort to trace equipment overcharges unless consumers asked and did not provide notice or refunds.Comcast told the Senate panel it would make it easier for consumers to cancel service without being forced to stay on the phone and answer questions.",2016-10-11,CHTR,"Tue Oct 11, 2016 | 12:34pm EDT",Comcast will pay $2.3 million to settle U.S. billing probe,http://www.reuters.com//article/fcc-comcast-idUSL1N1CH171?type=companyNews
