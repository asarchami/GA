0,"   By Danielle Robinson  Jan 9 (IFR) - Hewlett-Packard appeared to be getting strong demand Thursday for its first bond offering in almost two years, in another sign of the market's belief in the turnaround plan at the US computer giant.The USD2bn bond deal will put a dent in the USD5.5bn of debt that Hewlett-Packard has coming due this year at a time when CEO Meg Whitman's turnaround plan has helped restore stability and the decline in the PC market is expected to slow.HP has made significant improvements in its credit fundamentals, including a decline in its net operating debt to zero in the past year - helping to restore investor confidence.""We think HPQ still faces a difficult turnaround, but challenges, including PC market dynamics, appear to be easing and should reduce tail risk of a break-up or significant M&A,"" said Danish Agboatwala, senior TMT credit strategist at Barclays.The company launched the two-tranche bond at the tight end of guidance, reflecting solid demand for the five-year fixed and floating-rate transaction.""People are so geared up for this deal that I have no doubt there will be a food fight to get allocations,"" said a credit strategist not involved in the trade.The USD1.25bn fixed piece launched at 102 basis points over Treasuries, while the USD750m floater was launched at 3mL+94bp.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Scotland and Wells Fargo are the lead managers on the deal, which was first marketed at initial price thoughts of 115-120bp earlier in the day. Guidance tightened from there to T+105 area (+/-3bp).HP shares were trading at USD27.76 around midday on Thursday, up from roughly USD21 just three months ago. Its spreads have already tightened dramatically, with some syndicate bankers having seen its 10-year notes in the mid-200s about three months ago.THE NO-CONCESSION CONCESSION  To draw in investors to the trade, which is expected to price later in the day, the company started out offering generous new issue concessions.A relevant comparable was HP's own 5.5% March 2018s, trading at Treasuries plus 75bp or G+113bp and a high dollar price of USD112.00.One banker away from the deal suggested taking off around 10bp for the high dollar price to bring the G spread on the 18s to around 103bp.Although some credit curve difference might have to be added back in to that spread, that would suggest a new issue concession that looks like 10bp at the 115-120bp whisper level but actually amounts to nothing at all at the guidance level, the banker said. Another pricing benchmark is HP's 4.05% September 2022s at Treasuries plus 115bp or G+139bp, which suggests fair value on a new 10-year would be around 140-145bp, he said.HP has a steep credit curve of about 40bp between five and 10 years, putting fair value on a new five-year at around 100-105bp, which would suggest a new issue concession at the initial price thoughts level of around 10-15bp, according to the banker - and again basically nothing at the T+105bp official price talk.With the launch at 102bp, that would indicate a negative new issue concession.Not all analysts agree, of course. Morningstar puts fair value on a new HP five-year fixed-rate note at well under 100bp, making the deal an attractive buy.""We believe HP should trade in line with a BBB+ portion of the Morningstar Industrials Index, which currently stands at 125bp, with an average of about 10 years to maturity,"" a Morningstar credit strategist wrote.""On this basis we would place fair value on the new five-year at about 85-90bp.""HP is rated Baa1/BBB+/A- by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. It was last in the bond market in March 2012, when it issued USD500m 4.05% 2022s and USD1.5bn 2.6% 2017s.",2014-01-09,HPQ,"Thu Jan 9, 2014 | 2:09pm EST",Hewlett-Packard sees strong demand for new bond,http://www.reuters.com//article/hp-bonds-idUSL2N0KJ1UF20140109?type=companyNews

10,"  LONDON Hewlett Packard said Autonomy, the software firm it bought in 2011, overstated profits at one of its main British units by 81 percent in the year before it was sold in Britain's biggest ever technology deal.Little over a year after the $11.7 billion acquisition, the Silicon Valley company wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion, accusing the management of accounting irregularities.Autonomy was founded and led by British entrepreneur Mike Lynch, who has repeatedly denied the allegations.In the first specific allegation since the writedown, HP said it had refiled 2010 accounts for Autonomy Systems Limited, one of its British operating units, revising the annual revenue down by 54 percent to 81 million pounds.Net profit for the period was reduced by 86 million pounds ($133 million) to 19.6 million pounds according to the filing, seen by Reuters, that HP says it has made to Companies House - the organization that registers UK companies. The drop, $133 million at 2010 exchange rates, compares with reported 2010 net profit for Autonomy as a whole of $217 million, according to the company's annual report.Lynch had previously said that differences in IFRS and U.S. GAAP accounting standards appeared to have had a role in some of HP's allegations. ""The extensive investigations undertaken by Hewlett-Packard ... into the past accounting practices of the group, have revealed extensive errors (including misstatements) in the previously issued financial statements,"" the revised accounts said.HP, based in Palo Alto, California, has said it passed information from an unidentified whistleblower to the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC and Britain's Serious Fraud Office. Until now, however, few details had emerged about the nature of the alleged irregularities.

It took a writedown of $8.8 billion in November 2012, accusing Autonomy officials of accounting fraud.Autonomy's practice of selling hardware to clients at a loss had been documented by auditors and a report was provided to HP after it bought the British software maker, FT said. HP executives were included in communications about Autonomy's hardware sales before the whistle-blower brought the transactions to light, FT said, citing several emails. () In an October 2011 email that Chief Executive Meg Whitman was copied on, Autonomy cited difficulties it was having in selling HP hardware, the newspaper reported. However, HP said that while it eventually learned about the hardware sales, it knew nothing of the accounting improprieties until the whistleblower came forward, FT said.Autonomy's former Chief Executive Mike Lynch and HP could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular business hours.",2014-02-18,HPQ,"Tue Feb 18, 2014 | 1:41am EST",HP execs were aware of Autonomy's loss-making hardware sales - FT,http://www.reuters.com//article/hp-autonomy-idUSL3N0LN1IY20140218?type=companyNews

Chief Executive Office Meg Whitman told analysts that the company saw corporations and agencies beginning to replace ageing computers in the quarter, while Microsoft's decision to soon end support for its Windows XP operating system also prompted PC upgrades.Business at its enterprise group, the lynchpin of HP's strategy to transform itself into an IBM-like provider of enterprise computing services, edged 1 percent higher as server sales fared better than analysts had expected.

28,"  SAN FRANCISCO, March 25 Hewlett-Packard Co  plans to outline its entry into the 3D-printing business by October, as the computing company seeks to extend its dominance of traditional printers into a fledgling but fast-growing market.Chief Executive Meg Whitman said last week HP would make an announcement in June, now that the company has solved a number of technical problems that have hindered broader adoption of the high-tech manufacturing process. But in a blogpost updated over the weekend, HP said she had ""inadvertently"" mis-spoken and that the company was planning instead on making its 3D-printing announcement by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in October.

29,"   By Patrick Temple-West | WASHINGTON, March 31  WASHINGTON, March 31 Caterpillar Inc  avoided paying $2.4 billion in U.S. taxes from 2000 through 2012 by moving profits from sales of replacement parts through a low-tax unit it set up in Switzerland, a congressional panel said on Monday.In the latest example of a major U.S. corporation's offshore tax strategies going under the congressional microscope, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report focused on a complex 1999 restructuring by Caterpillar.The world's largest mining and construction equipment maker's restructuring negotiated a low tax rate with Switzerland for a unit it set up there to book taxable profits from sales of Caterpillar-branded replacement parts made by third parties under contract with the Peoria, Illinois-based company.""This is a prime example of a tax avoidance strategy, which is costing the U.S. Treasury billions of dollars,"" said Senator Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, which has a hearing scheduled for Tuesday on the report's findings. Caterpillar makes no replacement parts and has no warehouses in Switzerland, but 85 percent of its parts business's profits went through the Swiss unit, where the company pays a tax rate of between 4 percent and 6 percent, the subcommittee said.The top U.S. corporate tax income rate is 35 percent.Caterpillar's Swiss structure continues to save the company about $300 million a year in U.S. taxes, the subcommittee said. In a response to the Levin report, Caterpillar said its Swiss unit, known as Caterpillar Sarl, or CSARL, has a large marketing and sales presence in Geneva, Switzerland.""CSARL is no mere shell, but rather a major operating company employing hundreds of personnel in Geneva,"" said Julie Lagacy, vice president of Caterpillar's finance services division, according to prepared testimony released ahead of the hearing. Along with three Caterpillar executives, representatives of Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), which advised Caterpillar on the restructuring, are expected to testify.A spokeswoman for PwC defended the firm's tax advice to Caterpillar. ""We stand by the work we did for them,"" the spokeswoman said in a statement.Levin's panel has also held hearings on the tax strategies of Apple Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and Microsoft Corp.""This (Caterpillar) investigation demonstrates just how shifting profits to a tax haven is not just the province of high-tech companies,"" Levin said.

34,"  NEW YORK Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co are poised to rise by 20 percent over the next year, helped by an expected pickup in information-technology spending, according to an article in the April 7 edition of Barron's.HP's stock has risen 46 percent in the past year, but with a valuation of 8.7 times projected earnings over the next four quarters, it still trades at a 44 percent discount to the market, the financial newspaper said. By way of comparison, Xerox trades at close to 10 times earnings, it added.While spending on information technology has been weak in recent years, buyers worldwide are on track to spend 3.2 percent more this year, research group Gartner said last week.Barron's pointed to a report that said if HP can gain an extra point of market share in the computer servers market, it would be worth around $400 million in revenue. Currently, HP shares, which closed at $32.64 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, go for the same price they did 15 years ago, as the Internet and smartphones have made things like pricey personal computers and printers less of a necessity. But the company has undergone a massive restructuring since former eBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman took the helm in 2011. HP, which until 2010 was the world's largest tech company by revenue, has announced 34,000 job cuts since May 2012, and through carefully managing inventory and keeping capital spending in check, it has generated more than $15 billion in free cash in its past two fiscal years, Barron's said.A 20 percent gain over the next year would put HP shares at close to $40, with a Xerox-like valuation of about 10 times earnings, based on next year's forecast, Barron's said. ""That seems like a low hurdle,"" it added.(Reporting by John McCrank; Editing by Paul Simao)",2014-04-06,HPQ,"Sun Apr 6, 2014 | 3:43pm EDT",Hewlett-Packard shares look cheap despite big rebound: Barron's,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-hewlettpackard-shareprice-idUSBREA350KR20140406?type=companyNews
35,"  (Adds details of allegations, quote from DOJ official)By Adrian Krajewski and Aruna ViswanathaWARSAW/WASHINGTON April 9 Hewlett-Packard  agreed to pay $108 million to resolve wide-ranging U.S. government investigations into whether some of its foreign units bribed government officials to obtain lucrative contracts, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.HP's Russia subsidiary pleaded guilty to paying millions of dollars in bribes - some in the form of expensive watches and swimming pool technology - to win business with the federal prosecutor's office in Russia, the U.S. Justice Department said.Polish and Mexican units of the computing giant also resolved U.S. criminal charges related to contracts they had won in those countries, and Polish prosecutors charged a local HP executive with paying related bribes.The Securities and Exchange Commission entered into a related settlement with HP over allegations that its subsidiaries made improper payments to government officials.Both U.S. agencies charged the company or its units with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1970s law that bars U.S. linked firms from paying bribes to officials of foreign governments.""Hewlett-Packard subsidiaries created a slush fund for bribe payments ... employed two sets of books to track bribe recipients, and used anonymous email accounts and prepaid mobile telephones to arrange covert meetings to hand over bags of cash,"" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bruce Swartz said in announcing the settlement.In a statement, HP executive vice president and general counsel John Schultz said HP fully cooperated with the investigation.""The misconduct described in the settlement was limited to a small number of people who are no longer employed by the company,"" Schultz said.BAGS OF CASH  The allegations date back to 1999, when the Russian government announced a $100 million project to automate the computer and telecom systems of its Office of the Prosecutor General.To secure the first phase of that contract, HP created an elaborate deal to buy back its own products at inflated prices in order to create a secret slush fund, prosecutors said.The funds were used on everything from travel, cars and jewellery to furniture and household appliances, prosecutors said.More recently, between 2006 and 2010, prosecutors said HP paid more than $600,000 in bags of cash and HP products as bribes in Poland.HP provided those incentives to an official at the Polish National Police agency to win technology contracts with it, the U.S. government said. An HP Poland executive used an anonymous email account and a pre-paid mobile phone to evade detection, it said.Polish officials also took action against the HP executive, and said on Wednesday dozens of people had been charged there as part of an industry-wide investigation of corruption dating from 2007 to 2009.The Appellate Prosecutors' office named the former government official as Andrzej M., and the former HP executive as Tomasz Z., without giving their full last names in accordance with the Polish law.Reuters was not immediately able to reach either of the two, or their legal representatives.Zbigniew Jaskolski, a spokesman for the Appellate Prosecutors' office in Warsaw, which handles major cases, said the official gave favorable treatment for firms, including HP, which were bidding for IT contracts with the police headquarters that were worth a total of $39.71 million. Both the former executive and the former official have been charged with offenses which carry prison sentences of between two and 12 years, Jaskolski said.REMEDIAL EFFORTS HP's U.S. settlement also resolved charges of misconduct at its Mexico unit from 2008-2009.HP Mexico paid a $1.41 million ""commission"" to seal a software deal with Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, Pemex, prosecutors said.A representative for Pemex could not immediately be reached for comment.As part of the probe resolutions, HP agreed to improve its internal controls and report on those improvements to the Justice Department.It also agreed to make sure that its senior management provide ""strong, explicit, and visible support"" to the company's anti-corruption policies, according to the terms of the deal.The Justice Department said it acknowledged ""extensive anti-corruption remedial efforts"" the company undertook, including disciplining culpable employees.

IBM and HP declined to comment, while Atos was not immediately available for comment.""We are in talks with several sector heavyweights about a takeover of the IT infrastructure, and we want to secure most of the jobs following a sale,"" Lufthansa's Chief Financial Officer Simone Menne told German paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung FAZ in an interview published on Tuesday. The paper was the first to report the interested parties.According to the plans, Lufthansa Systems will be divided into three parts - Infrastructure, Airline Solutions and Industry Solutions. The infrastructure division, which employs 1,400 people, will be sold, while the other two will remain within the Lufthansa group.

43,"  (Corrects to chip maker from handset maker in first paragraph)* Cirrus offers 235 pence for each Wolfson share* Says bid supported by 7pct of target's shareholders* Wolfson shares up more than 70 pctBy Kate HoltonLONDON, April 29 U.S. chip maker Cirrus Logic Inc is to buy Wolfson Microelectronics Plc for an agreed 291 million pounds ($489 million) in cash, sending shares in the British company up more than 70 percent.Wolfson, an Edinburgh-based company which specialises in audio technology, had suffered in recent months after missing out on a deal to make chips for the 4G version of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Galaxy S4 smartphone. Wolfson becomes the latest in a series of British technology groups to be bought by overseas interests in recent years, after Autonomy was sold to Hewlett-Packard Co, CGI Group Inc  bought Logica and Misys was acquired by U.S.-based private equity firm Vista Equity Partners.Cirrus, a supplier to Apple Inc, said the agreed 235 pence per share deal for its nearest rival would strengthen its portfolio and add new products such as Wolfson's successful microphones.Wolfson Chairman Michael Ruettgers said: ""Together with Cirrus Logic, we believe this will create a powerful platform for future growth, above and beyond our standalone potential"".Wolfson, which employs around 420 at 12 locations worldwide, also published first-quarter results showing slightly lower than expected revenue. The group posted an underlying operating loss of $4.5 million, up from $2.8 million a year before, on revenue which slumped to $28.8 million from $48.1 million.Cirrus said its offer already had the backing of 7 percent of Wolfson's investors.Analysts at brokerage N+1 Singer said their confidence in Wolfson's technology had not been fully reflected in the financial performance of the company, but said the bid showed the value of its expertise. ""The premium valuation in today's bid reflects the IP (intellectual property) in the product portfolio and the potential which this has in a larger-scale business,"" they said.Shares in Wolfson - which dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years in February after the company posted an underlying operating loss of $4.5 million for the final quarter of 2013 - were up 73 percent in early morning trading.The advance took its stock market value to 270 million pounds.Dan Ridsdale, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: Cirrus had got a good deal. ""While (Wolfson's) Q1 results were weak as expected, we feel that Cirrus is buying this business at a trading nadir and believe that a recovery in (business) ... primarily at Samsung should drive a strong recovery in H2,"" Ridsdale said.In its results statement, Wolfson said it was strengthening its relationship with Samsung with a number of design wins.($1 = 0.5950 British Pounds)   (Editing by Mark Potter and David Holmes)",2014-04-29,HPQ,"Tue Apr 29, 2014 | 9:14am EDT",CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Apple supplier Cirrus to buy British chip maker Wolfson,http://www.reuters.com//article/cirrus-logic-wolfson-idUSL6N0NL1PT20140429?type=companyNews

48,"  Paul Casey came within one stroke of the PGA Tour scoring record for nine holes when he stormed home in 27 shots in the second round at the HP Byron Nelson Championship in Irving, Texas on Friday. Casey was in danger of missing the cut after a mediocre start but turned on the afterburners to end the day only two strokes behind American leader Brendon Todd at the TPC Four Seasons Resort. ""I found it difficult (early but) I broke the seal, made an eagle on (hole) number seven and then the hole started to get bigger and bigger,"" the Englishman told reporters after picking up an eagle and six birdies on the inward nine for a seven-under-par 63 in ideal morning conditions.""I hit some wonderful shots on the back nine (although) I got some lucky breaks here and there.""Only American Corey Pavin, who shot an eight-under 26 on the front nine at Brown Deer Park during the 2006 U.S. Bank Championship in Milwaukee, has posted a lower nine-hole score on the PGA Tour.Casey's 27 matches the tour record for a back nine, emulating Nick Watney (2011 AT&T National), Brandt Snedeker (2007 Buick Invitational), Billy Mayfair (2001 Buick Open), Andy North (1975 B.C. Open) and Mike Souchak (1955 Texas Open). Casey sank a couple of long putts, including a 30-footer for eagle at the par-five 16th, but most of his birdies came from precise approach shots.He ended the day in an eight-way tie for second along with German Martin Kaymer (67).Todd, who has never finished better than sixth on tour, birdied the final two holes after superb approach shots to shoot 64 and set the halfway pace on eight-under 132. Casey was ranked as high as third in the world in 2009 before injuries and the turmoil of a divorce sent him plummeting out of the top 150.But the 36-year-old from Cheltenham has worked his way back towards the top echelon in the past year and on Friday it all came together.""I’ve had comments the last couple of weeks (from) guys saying you’re hitting it a long way,"" he said. ""I’m kind of smiling to myself because I used to hit it a long way and it’s been a couple of years since I’ve done that. I’ve really struggled (but) I'm loving my golf right now.""Former world number one Kaymer showed no signs of a victory hangover following his Players Championship win on Sunday as he drained four birdies and one bogey in his 67.

49,"  A brilliant left-handed recovery shot helped American Brendon Todd to his first PGA Tour title, a two-stroke victory at the $6.9 million HP Byron Nelson Championship in Texas on Sunday.Todd, who had never finished better than sixth on tour, displayed impressive poise and a sizzling short game to card a bogey-free four-under-par 66 at the Four Seasons TPC in Irving.He finished at 14-under 266, while Canadian Mike Weir (67), without a win since 2007, claimed second place on 12-under.Todd collected $1.24 million and an invitation to next year's Masters, less than two hours down the road from where he went to college at the University of Georgia in Athens.""I thought I could win on the PGA Tour. It's taken a while but now that I've won it's a dream come true,"" the 28-year-old told reporters.""I'm really excited, the relief I finally have a chance to play the PGA Tour for multiple years (but) number one (is) going to Augusta.""Todd hit a number of good shots, including a bunker shot he holed at the par-three second, but none was more memorable than his second shot at the par-three 13th. After yanking his tee shot 20 yards left of the hole, he was stymied by a tree, so the right-hander instead chipped his second shot left-handed.He made near perfect contact and his ball trundled down to within seven feet of the hole, from where he sank the putt for an unlikely par.""I just took my four-iron and just hit it with the back of the club,"" he said. ""It just ran down there perfect. I didn't care where it went. I just wanted to get it down near the hole.""Buoyed by the reprieve, Todd parred his way home, although victory was not assured until he drilled a 15-foot par putt at the 17th and then avoided water with his tee shot at the last.""There were so many up-and-downs on the back nine but that putt on 17 was huge. It allowed me to play a little more conservatively on 18. I couldn't even explain how (nervous) I felt on the back nine today. ""I made one double-bogey in the first round and after that absolutely scored my pants off. I have a great short game and even I'll say it was amazing this week.""Weir, meanwhile, recorded his best finish since 2010. The 2003 Masters champion was the only one to exert any pressure on Todd on the back nine as one player after another fell away.Nobody was more disappointed than South African Louis Oosthuizen, who started the final round tied for the lead with Todd, but crashed out with a 74 to finish equal 11th.

50,"  South African Louis Oosthuizen carded four birdies in the last five holes to surge into a share of the lead with American Brendon Todd after the third round at the $6.9 million HP Byron Nelson Championship in Texas on Saturday.However, neither of the two co-leaders will feel particularly confident about victory given that seven other players are no more than two strokes off the pace heading into Sunday's final round.Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion, recovered from a poor start, two bogeys in the first four holes, to fire a six-under-par 64, the best round of the day at the TPC Four Seasons Resort in Irving.""I hit the ball really well with my irons and had a lot of putts inside 10 feet for birdie and I think I made them all,"" the South African told CBS Sports.Halfway leader Todd (68) also birdied the last to join Oosthuizen at 10-under 200, one stroke ahead of Canadian Mike Weir (67) and Americans Gary Woodland (66) and James Hahn (65).Todd has never finished better than sixth on tour, while Weir, the 2003 Masters champion, has not had a top-10 finish on the U.S. circuit in more than four years. American Morgan Hoffman was tied for the lead until he butchered the par-four 18th, yanking his drive into the water en route to a double-bogey and a 68 to fall back into a tie for sixth with, among others, Irishman Padraig Harrington.World number 39 Oosthuizen pulled out of last year's Byron Nelson Championship after three rounds, due to a neck injury, and he also battled back problems earlier this year.However, a runner-up finish at the Malaysian Open last month indicated he was back in form. Oosthuizen, whose smooth swing is regarded by his peers as one of the best in the game, said he liked the course this week because it puts a premium on accuracy rather than power.""It's so tough out of the rough,"" he said. ""The key thing for me is hitting fairways and then finding greens, because I'm putting really well. ""I putted really well today, putted well yesterday, so I want to give myself as many birdie opportunities as I can (tomorrow) and make a few.""Seventeen-year-old American Scottie Scheffler became the first amateur since 2006 to record a hole-in-one on the PGA Tour when he aced the par-three second with a five-iron from 218 yards.It was the sixth hole-in-one on tour this year.

51,"  (Adds CEO and CFO's comments, byline)By Edwin ChanSAN FRANCISCO May 22 Hewlett-Packard Co  plans to cut as many as 16,000 more jobs in a major ramp-up of CEO Meg Whitman's years-long effort to turn around the personal computer maker and relieve pressure on its profit margins.On Thursday, the company posted a disappointing 1 percent drop in quarterly revenue, as it struggled to maintain its grip on the shrinking personal computer market while protecting profit margins. That marked its 11th consecutive quarterly sales decline.Shares in HP closed down 2.3 percent at $31.78, after the company inadvertently posted the results on its website more than half an hour before the closing bell. HP, whose sprawling global operations have more than 250,000 employees, had originally planned to shed 34,000 jobs as part of its corporate overhaul. On Thursday, it estimated 11,000 to 16,000 more positions needed to go, scattered across different countries and business areas.Whitman said HP continues to find areas to streamline across the company's broad portfolio, which encompasses computing, networking, storage and software. But research jobs, which are vital for innovation and long-term growth, will continue to grow. HP is looking to cut back more in ""areas not central to customer-facing and innovation agendas,"" she said in an interview, rather than areas like research. ""That's not what we're doing here. You need to look at the R&D spending, which is up.""The Silicon Valley company is trying to reduce its reliance on PCs and move toward computing equipment and networking gear for enterprises, part of Whitman's effort to curtail revenue declines and return the world's No. 1 PC maker to growth. HP recorded sales of $27.3 billion in its fiscal second quarter, ended April 30, just shy of the $27.41 billion Wall Street had expected.Whitman said China remained a challenging region, though revenue from that country rose in the quarter. U.S. companies like International Business Machines Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have blamed recent lackluster performances on a backlash against American companies in China, in the wake of U.S. spying allegations.On Thursday, HP forecast full-year earnings of $3.63 to $3.75 a share, compared with Wall Street's estimate for  $3.71.It reported non-GAAP diluted net earnings of 88 cents a share in the fiscal second quarter, up 1 percent from a year earlier and about level with what analysts, on average, had expected.

Small-caps and the so-called momentum names in the Internet and biotech spaces have recently echoed the broader market's direction, but moved in an outsized fashion, often without specific news. Among momentum names, noted for high growth and perceptions of excessive valuation, Vertex Pharmaceuticals shares shot up 6 percent to $71.18, while Alexion Pharmaceuticals  rose 2.5 percent to $160.48. The Nasdaq biotechnology index gained 1.9 percent. Shares of Salesforce.com , the world's biggest maker of online sales software, advanced 6.1 percent to $53.27.The Russell 2000 index of small-cap shares rose 0.9 percent, outperforming the broader S&P 500. The Russell fell into correction territory last week - defined as a 10 percent decline from a recent closing high - but has since retraced some of that, and is now less than 8 percent from its peak.""Small-caps and momentum names are doing good today, but we really need another solid gain in the overall market for those high growth-oriented, high-risk stocks"" to move away from the day-to-day volatile trading, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Hewlett-Packard Co posted a bigger-than-expected drop of 1 percent in quarterly revenue as it struggled to maintain its grip on a shrinking personal computer market while protecting profit margins. The stock reversed earlier gains to end down 2.3 percent at $31.78.Housing stocks ranked among the market's biggest outperformers, with the housing index up 1.2 percent after existing home sales rebounded in April.

The S&P 500 is about 10 points away from its record intraday high set on May 13. For the past week, the index has been caught between the high and its 50-day moving average as data left investors unsure about the pace of the economic recovery.Shares of JD.Com soared in their market debut on Thursday, jumping 10 percent to close at $20.90 after the Chinese e-commerce company raised $1.78 billion in an initial public offering.Best Buy Co rose 3.4 percent to $26.22. The electronics retailer reported first-quarter earnings that topped expectations and domestic comparable-store sales that fell more than expected.U.S. existing home sales rose in April and the supply of properties on the market hit the highest level since August 2012, hopeful signs for the housing market's stalled recovery.About 5.1 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 5.9 billion.

62,"  (Adds analyst's and executives' comments)By Edwin ChanSAN FRANCISCO May 22 Hewlett-Packard Co  plans to cut as many as 16,000 more jobs in a major ramp-up of CEO Meg Whitman's years-long effort to turn around the personal computer maker and relieve pressure on its profit margins.Whitman said the turnaround remained on track and her raised target reflected how HP continued to find areas to streamline across its broad portfolio, which encompasses computing, networking, storage and software. But some analysts wondered whether it signaled a worsening outlook for the coming year, or if more jobs may be cut.""The rationale makes sense,"" said RBC analyst Amit Daryanani. But ""you do worry if there's a finality to this process, or if it's an ongoing thing that may affect morale at the end of the day. So far the trend has been worrisome.""HP, whose sprawling global operations employ more than 250,000, estimated about three years ago when it first hatched its sweeping overhaul that it would need to shed 27,000 jobs. That number rose to 34,000 last year.On Thursday, it estimated another 11,000 to 16,000 more jobs needed to go, scattered across different countries and business areas. That took the grand total under Whitman's restructuring to 50,000. The Silicon Valley company is trying to reduce its reliance on PCs and move toward computing equipment and networking gear for enterprises, part of Whitman's effort to curtail revenue declines and return the world's No. 1 PC maker to growth.But that goal remains elusive. The company posted a disappointing 1 percent drop in quarterly revenue, as it struggled to maintain its grip on the shrinking personal computer market and weak corporate tech spending.That marked its 11th consecutive quarterly sales decline. Shares in HP closed down 2.3 percent at $31.78, after the company inadvertently posted the results on its website more than half an hour before the closing bell.A PIVOTAL DIVISION  Research jobs, which are vital for innovation and long-term growth, will continue to grow, Whitman stressed.HP is looking to cut back more in ""areas not central to customer-facing and innovation agendas,"" she said in an interview, rather than areas like research. ""That's not what we're doing here. You need to look at the R&D spending, which is up.""HP recorded sales of $27.3 billion in its fiscal second quarter ended April 30, just shy of the $27.41 billion Wall Street had expected.Whitman said China remained a challenging region, though revenue from that country rose in the quarter. U.S. companies like International Business Machines Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have blamed recent lackluster performances on a backlash against American companies in China, in the wake of U.S. spying allegations.On Thursday, HP forecast full-year earnings of $3.63 to $3.75 a share, compared with Wall Street's estimate for $3.71.It reported non-GAAP diluted net earnings of 88 cents a share in the second quarter, up 1 percent from a year earlier and about level with what analysts, on average, had expected.

65,"   By Jonathan Stempel | June 9  June 9 Mark Zuckerberg and other members of Facebook Inc's board have been sued by a shareholder who claimed a policy letting them annually award directors more than $150 million of stock each if they choose is unreasonably generous.In a complaint filed on Friday night in Delaware Chancery Court, Ernesto Espinoza said the board was ""essentially free to grant itself whatever amount of compensation it chooses"" under the social media company's 2012 equity incentive plan, which also covers employees, officers and consultants.He said the plan annually caps total awards at 25 million shares and individual awards at 2.5 million, and in theory lets the board annually award directors $156 million in stock each, based on Friday's closing price of $62.50. The lawsuit does not contend that such large sums will be awarded.Espinoza also said last year's average $461,000 payout to non-employee directors was too high, being 43 percent larger than typical payouts at ""peer"" companies such as Amazon.com Inc  and Walt Disney Co that on average generated twice as much revenue and three times more profit.

66,"  * Intel accused in 2009 of trying to thwart rival AMD* Intel declines to say if it will go to Europe's top court   (Recasts; adds Intel, lawyer, BEUC comments)By Foo Yun CheeLUXEMBOURG, June 12 U.S. chipmaker Intel  lost on Thursday its challenge against a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.44 billion) European Union fine handed down five years ago, as Europe's second highest court said regulators did not act too harshly.The European Commission in its 2009 decision said Intel tried to thwart rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by giving rebates to PC makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.The EU competition authority said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips.Judges at the Luxembourg-based General Court said on Thursday they backed the Commission's decision.""The Commission demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that Intel attempted to conceal the anti-competitive nature of its practices and implemented a long term comprehensive strategy to foreclose AMD from the strategically most important sales channels,"" the court said in a near 300-page decision. Judges said the EU watchdog had not been heavy-handed with the level of the fine, equal to 4.15 percent of Intel's 2008 turnover, versus a possible maximum of 10 percent. While Commission penalties rarely hit the top figure, the rising level of fines is a source of worry for many companies.""The General Court considers that none of the arguments raised by Intel supports the conclusion that the fine imposed is disproportionate. On the contrary, it must be considered that that fine is appropriate in the light of the facts of the case,"" judges said.Intel, which can take its case further to the Court of Justice of the European Union but only on points of law, declined to say whether it would do so.""We are very disappointed about the decision. It's a complex case which is reflected in the decision. We will begin evaluating the decision,"" Intel spokeswoman Sophie Jacobs said. BETTER OUT OF COURT? The Commission welcomed the ruling, as did consumers' lobbying group BEUC. ""When large companies abuse their dominance of the market, it causes direct harm to consumers. The court's ruling issued a strong reminder that such behaviour is illegal and unacceptable,"" said BEUC director-general Monique Goyens.The court's judgement suggests companies would be better off settling antitrust charges instead of fighting them, said Martina Maier, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery.""Companies under investigation by the Commission should not count on winning in court with the argument that the Commission would not have properly assessed the economic effects of an abuse of dominance,"" she said.""This might well lead to a supplementary incentive for a company under investigation for an alleged abuse of dominance to settle with the Commission or to offer commitments in order to motivate the Commission to end its investigation.""Samsung recently settled EU charges while Google  has also clinched a deal with the Commission.The case is T-286/09, Intel vs Commission.($1 = 0.7345 Euros)   (Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-06-12,HPQ,"Thu Jun 12, 2014 | 5:57am EDT",UPDATE 2-Intel loses court challenge against $1.4 bln EU fine,http://www.reuters.com//article/intel-court-eu-idUSL5N0OT1JW20140612?type=companyNews

68,"   By Jonathan Stempel | June 26  June 26 Hewlett-Packard Co has won the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing the computer maker of securities fraud for misleading shareholders about its commitment to ethics while its chief executive was allegedly engaging in sexual harassment.In August 2013, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco had thrown out an earlier version of the lawsuit, and on Wednesday dismissed a revised version that he said failed to address his concerns. Wednesday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the lawsuit cannot be brought again.Before the case arose, HP had updated its Standards of Business Conduct following a 2006 scandal over news leaks.The lawsuit stemmed from the sudden August 2010 departure of Chief Executive Mark Hurd amid allegations that he had harassed an independent consultant, Jodie Fisher. Hurd, who is now president of Oracle Corp, had won wide credit at HP for improving the company's fortunes. An internal HP probe ultimately cleared Hurd of harassment but found that he filed inaccurate expense reports.    Plaintiffs led by the Retail Wholesale & Department Store Union Local 338 Retirement Fund of Mineola, New York claimed that HP's share price was inflated during the period of Hurd's alleged misconduct.They said the Palo Alto, California-based company's statements about its business conduct standards led them to believe Hurd was in compliance. Last August, Tigar called HP's statements too vague and general to justify liability, but gave the plaintiffs another chance to make their case.On Wednesday, he said the new complaint offered more detail about Hurd's conduct and whether it violated HP's rules, but still did not show that Hurd's or HP's representations amounted to a ""warranty of ethical compliance"" with the SBC. ""Accordingly,"" Tigar wrote, ""plaintiff has not stated a securities law violation."" He also said Hurd's failure to disclose his non-compliance with the SBC was not a ""materially false"" omission.Ira Press, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. HP did not immediately respond to similar requests. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined to comment.The case is Retail Wholesale & Department Store Union Local 338 Retirement Fund v.

69,"  (Updating with comment from Lynch's spokesman, background on previous settlement)By Nadia Damouni, Paul Sandle and Casey SullivanJune 27 Hewlett-Packard Co and attorneys representing shareholders have agreed to settle litigation over its troubled $11.1 billion acquisition of British software company Autonomy Corp, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Under the terms of the settlement, involving three lawsuits, the attorneys for the shareholders have agreed to drop all claims against HP's current and former executives, including CEO Meg Whitman, board members and advisers to the company, the source said.The exception to that will be former officials at Autonomy. As part of the agreement, the shareholders' attorneys will assist HP in pursuing claims against Autonomy's co-founder and former CEO Michael Lynch, its former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain, and potentially others related to Autonomy, the source said. The precise nature of such claims and when HP might file them could not be learned.The settlement, which followed mediation, is expected to be announced as soon as Monday. The source said it is likely to be signed before Monday.HP took an $8.8 billion impairment charge in November 2012 for its purchase of Autonomy only just over a year earlier, with more than $5 billion of that linked to what HP said at the time were ""serious accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures.""The size of the loss, and the speed with which it occurred, marks the deal as one of the most disastrous done by a major company in recent years.In particular, sources close to an HP investigation into the matter say that the technology giant believes that Autonomy's results and prospects were made to look much better than they were. Lynch, has consistently denied HP's allegations, saying HP is blaming him for its own failure to manage Autonomy after the acquisition.A spokesman for Lynch said that ""we continue to reject HP's allegations."" He said it appears that Whitman will be using a large sum of HP's money to avoid explaining in court why she made the November 2012 allegations regarding Autonomy. ""We hope this matter will now move beyond a smear campaign based on selective disclosure and HP will finally give a full explanation,"" the Lynch spokesman added.Hussain has not responded to calls and emails.

Rackspace leases server space and helps corporations store and access data in the cloud.The company said in a regulatory filing in May that it had been approached by multiple parties and had hired Morgan Stanley to help it in the process.Cowen and Co analysts, in a note dated June 30, said there was a small chance of a take-private transaction, adding that potential buyers could also include telecom provider CenturyLink Inc. Rackspace has faced stiff competition from newer startups as well as established players in the cloud computing business, such as Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc, which have slashed prices recently.While Amazon and Google do not disclose the number of servers they operate, analysts have estimated that their server count is much higher than Rackspace's 106,000.""Given the competitive uncertainties in cloud and hosting, it would certainly be a bold move by management and financial sponsors to take the company private,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin told Reuters.Concerns among investors about Rackspace's ability to compete with its larger rivals have pushed down its shares to mid-thirties from a high of $81 last year.

Whitworth had led an investigation into Autonomy, whose executives have denied wrongdoing.Patricia Dunn resigned in 2006 amid criticism over a wiretapping scandal, when she authorized eavesdropping on directors and journalists to plug media leaks. FORCE FOR CHANGE Whitworth, 58, has long been a force to be reckoned with in boardrooms. Past successes included convincing ITT Corp  to split into three in 2011, and pushing Timken Co to spin off its steel unit. His fund is pushing to break up Manitowoc Co Inc. Some executives, including eBay Inc CEO John Donahoe, have contrasted his low-key approach with that of Carl Icahn, who often wages public campaigns.He has served on the boards of companies including Genzyme Corp and Mattel Inc.While Whitworth's reputation may be outsized, his firm manages roughly $6 billion and is small compared with the likes of PIMCO or BlackRock. Its modest scale makes it vulnerable should investors take their funds elsewhere.""The perception is that he is the firm and that can make it more difficult,"" said Geoff Bobroff, an industry consultant who runs Bobroff Associates.One investor professed support on Tuesday.""Relational Investors has been a manager for CalSTRS for over a decade and we have great confidence in their team to carry on during Ralph's leave,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the pension fund.

83,"   By Nadia Damouni and Paul Sandle  The Vatican has become enmeshed in a struggle between Hewlett-Packard Co and Michael Lynch, the former CEO of the UK software company Autonomy Corp bought by HP in 2011 in a deal that led to a big loss for the U.S. technology giant.An argument over the proposed use of Autonomy’s software to help digitize the Vatican’s library potentially lends support to HP’s accusation that Autonomy booked sales even when the intended end user had not decided to buy the software.  In the end, the Vatican says it did not purchase the software for the library project from Autonomy or from a reseller of Autonomy’s products, MicroTechnologies LLC. Nevertheless, Autonomy booked $11.55 million in revenue based on the sale to MicroTech of software that was earmarked for the proposed Vatican deal, according to sources familiar with HP’s investigation. Autonomy’s booking of revenue tied to a Vatican deal that didn’t happen illustrates one way in which HP contends the software company gave a distorted impression of how rapidly it was growing, these sources said. A source familiar with Autonomy’s business at the time counters that its approach to booking revenue in such transactions with resellers was permissible under UK accounting standards and blessed by its auditor Deloitte.HP took an $8.8 billion impairment charge in November 2012 for its $11.1 billion purchase of Autonomy.  The size of the loss, and the speed with which it occurred, marks the deal as one of the most disastrous done by a major company in recent years.ASKED TO PARTICIPATE      A letter seen by Reuters shows that Vienna, Virginia-based MicroTech, wrote to the Vatican library, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (BAV), on April 23 this year seeking payment for the $11.55 million of Autonomy software. MicroTech CEO and President Anthony Jimenez said in the letter that in March 2010 Autonomy had requested it buy the software in 2010 so that MicroTech could “participate as a reseller” in a project between the library and Autonomy. Jimenez said MicroTech was surprised to see an announcement from another company, Japan’s NTT Data Corp, in March this year stating that it had been selected to conduct the Vatican library’s digitization project. He asked the Vatican library if Autonomy software had been used in the NTT contract or any other such project, and, if so, when was payment made for that software and who received it.“We are writing to you to confirm your receipt and use of the software and to obtain payment for that use,” said Jimenez in the letter. In response, Vatican library prefect Monsignore Cesare Pasini sent a letter to HP in which he said MicroTech’s assumption that Autonomy software was being used in the project “is absolutely false.” He said the project uses software from NTT Data and others but not anything from Autonomy and MicroTech.Pasini added that the Vatican library has “never dealt with MicroTech.” HP declined to comment on how it responded to the Vatican letter.MicroTech General Counsel Aaron Drabkin said that Jimenez was not available for comment.PURSUING CLAIMS  HP said late last month it plans to pursue claims against Lynch and Autonomy’s former Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain. The precise nature of such claims and when HP might file them could not be learned.Authorities, including the U.S. Justice Department, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK’s Serious Fraud Office, are also investigating HP’s accusations against Autonomy’s former top management.A lawyer for Hussain did not respond to requests for comment.The MicroTech claim to the Vatican for payment leaves key questions unanswered. It is not clear why the reseller agreed to buy the software for a project that had not been awarded, and why the Vatican had never heard of MicroTech’s involvement.Struck on the last day of the first quarter of 2010, the MicroTech deal was crucial in allowing Autonomy to meet market expectations for the quarter, with revenue – which was boosted by acquisitions - coming in at $194.2 million, up about 50 percent from a year earlier. Analysts’ consensus forecast was for $193 million. It was on the basis of such growth that HP when it acquired Autonomy was prepared to pay a 79 percent premium to its stock market value.In the end, HP wrote off $2.3 million on the sale to MicroTech because of non-payment to HP by the reseller. That is according to an internal email, dated Oct. 12, 2011, from Autonomy’s accounts department to counterparts in HP that has been reviewed by Reuters. By that date, HP owned Autonomy. Autonomy’s deal with MicroTech is among a series of transactions that are being questioned by HP following its investigation, the sources familiar with the probe said.HP declined to comment on the specifics of the Vatican deal but said in a statement that more generally “former senior Autonomy management used numerous tactics to misrepresent the reported financial metrics of the company.” It said that this included Autonomy recognizing revenue on transactions that never closed and misidentifying categories of revenue to “create the illusion of a high-growth company.” The result was that investors and HP were misled, HP alleged.  Autonomy’s former management believes HP is misrepresenting the nature of a few deals that don’t in any way add up to the amount of revenue that HP claims was questionable, according to the sources familiar with Autonomy’s business at the time. Under International Financial Reporting Standards, several conditions must be met before a company can book revenue from the sale of goods to a reseller. These include the condition that “significant risks and rewards or ownership of the goods” has been transferred to the buyer, and the seller “retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold.” Lynch believes that this was clearly the case with the MicroTech sale, according to the source familiar with Autonomy’s business at the time. MicroTech made its own commercial decision to buy the software, and was therefore like any other customer for Autonomy, the source said, adding that whether that software ended up with the Vatican or not was an issue for MicroTech and not Autonomy. LOST INTEREST Ambrogio Piazzoni, vice prefect of the Vatican library,  told Reuters that it had worked with Autonomy on a feasibility study that lasted up to a year-and-a-half. But he said around the summer of 2011 – just before Autonomy's acquisition by HP - Autonomy stopped showing interest in the project, putting off appointments, though it did not formally withdraw.According to documents prepared for Autonomy’s audit committee that have been seen by Reuters, Deloitte reviewed the deal and it was satisfied the sale to MicroTech had taken place and could be booked by Autonomy.In a statement Deloitte said it “categorically denies that it had any knowledge of any accounting improprieties or misrepresentations in Autonomy’s financial statements.”  (Reporting by Nadia Damouni and Paul Sandle; Additional reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Martin Howell)",2014-07-18,HPQ,"Fri Jul 18, 2014 | 11:48am EDT",Exclusive: Vatican dispute sheds light on HP case in troubled Autonomy deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-hp-autonomy-vatican-idUSKBN0FN20H20140718?type=companyNews

94,"   By Edwin Chan | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Hewlett-Packard Co posted a surprise increase in quarterly revenue after sales from its personal computer division climbed 12 percent, but a flat to declining performance from its other units underscored the company's uphill battle to revive growth.HP sales rose a mere 1 percent to $27.6 billion in its fiscal third quarter from $27.2 billion a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had forecast a modest drop in revenue to $27.01 billion.    The Silicon Valley giant is undergoing a major overhaul aimed at cutting costs and re-orienting itself toward higher-margin businesses such as computing infrastructure. It's trying to reduce a reliance on PCs and move toward servers, storage and networking for enterprises - part of Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman's effort to return the sprawling company to growth.Whitman credited personal computer demand for ""coming back some"" as consumers and corporations upgraded ageing machines. She was pleased with 2 percent growth in revenue to $6.9 billion at the Enterprise Group, the company's second-largest business that deals in networking, storage and servers.""It's a turnaround in a declining business,"" Whitman said in an interview. She singled out a 9 percent increase in sales of industry-standard servers in particular, saying uncertainty around Lenovo's acquisition of IBM Corp's low-end server unit helped steer business to HP. ""We've been able to capitalize on that uncertainty and our win rates are up against IBM,"" Whitman added.She pegged Russia and China - countries whose relations with the United States have come under strain - as weak spots for PC sales, though Whitman said its Chinese business as a whole remained on solid footing.HP intends to remain rigorous on costs to try and boost profitability. In May, it estimated another 11,000 to 16,000 more jobs needed to be cut on top of 34,000 previously announced.

95,"  (Adds analysts' and executives' comments from the call)By Edwin ChanSAN FRANCISCO Aug 20 Hewlett-Packard Co  posted a surprise increase in quarterly revenue after sales from its personal computer division climbed 12 percent, but a flat to declining performance from its other units underscored the company's uphill battle to revive growth.HP sales rose a mere 1 percent to $27.6 billion in its fiscal third quarter from $27.2 billion a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had forecast a modest drop in revenue to $27.01 billion.The Silicon Valley giant is undergoing a major overhaul aimed at cutting costs and re-orienting itself toward higher-margin businesses such as computing infrastructure. It's trying to reduce a reliance on PCs and move toward servers, storage and networking for enterprises - part of Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman's effort to return the sprawling company to growth.Whitman credited personal computer demand for ""coming back some"" as consumers and corporations upgraded ageing machines. She was pleased with 2 percent growth in revenue to $6.9 billion at the Enterprise Group, the company's second-largest business that deals in networking, storage and servers. ""It's a turnaround in a declining business,"" Whitman said in an interview. She singled out a 9 percent increase in sales of industry-standard servers in particular, saying uncertainty around Lenovo's acquisition of IBM Corp's  low-end server unit helped steer business to HP.""We've been able to capitalize on that uncertainty and our win rates are up against IBM,"" Whitman added. She pegged Russia and China - countries whose relations with the United States have come under strain - as weak spots for PC sales, though Whitman said its Chinese business as a whole remained on solid footing.HP intends to remain rigorous on costs to try and boost profitability. In May, it estimated another 11,000 to 16,000 more jobs needed to be cut on top of 34,000 previously announced.It narrowed its earnings forecast for the full year to $3.70 to $3.74 per share, from $3.63 to $3.75.

99,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. judge cast doubt on Monday over a proposed agreement struck between Hewlett-Packard Co and plaintiff shareholders to settle a lawsuit over the computing giant's botched acquisition of Autonomy Plc.At a hearing on Monday in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer rejected several million dollars in fees that shareholder attorneys would have recouped under the settlement. ""That's out,"" he said. In order to approve the remainder of the deal, Breyer said he would have to make further inquiries into whether dismissing claims against HP officers, including current Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman, was fair for shareholders.HP announced a $8.8 billion writedown in November 2012, just over one year after buying Autonomy, and linked more than $5 billion to accounting fraud and inflated financials by Autonomy executives. The British company and its executives have denied any wrongdoing.Under the terms of the settlement reached in June, shareholder attorneys agreed to drop all claims against HP's current and former executives, including Whitman, board members and advisers to the company.HP, in turn, agreed to team up with the shareholder attorneys to bring claims against former Autonomy executives, including Chief Executive Michael Lynch. The shareholder attorneys would have recouped at least $18 million in fees. In court on Monday, HP attorney Marc Wolinsky disclosed that HP also intends to sue the British unit of Deloitte & Touche LLP [DLTE.UL] over its role in auditing Autonomy Plc. In a statement, Deloitte said any HP claim ""would be utterly without merit and we will defend ourselves strongly against it.""HP's allegations of accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures at Autonomy have prompted an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the UK's Serious Fraud Office. Multiple parties objected to the shareholder settlement, including former Autonomy Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain. In court on Monday, Hussain's attorney John Keker called the deal a ""whitewash"" and asked that he be allowed to review internal HP documents that absolve Whitman and others of wrongdoing.  ""This is a joke,"" Keker said. ""If it were a carcass, animals would walk around it, it stinks so much.""Wolinsky said HP would vigorously contest Hussain's ability to review documents. In a statement, HP said it will continue with its bid to settle or dismiss the shareholder litigation.Breyer scheduled another court hearing next month to decide how to move forward, and whether Hussain and others would be allowed to formally intervene in the case.  Regardless, Breyer said he would need to weigh the evidence against HP officers as part of his analysis on whether the deal absolving them of liability is fair for shareholders.

112,"   By Jim Finkle | Boston  Boston EMC Corp plans to keep its majority stake in software maker VMware Inc despite pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management, a person familiar with EMC's thinking told Reuters on Thursday.The person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter, described as inaccurate a Thursday report in the New York Post that EMC had decided to explore selling its stake in business software maker VMware. The source did not provide further details.In July, Elliott Management notified EMC it had acquired a stake in the company and urged Chief Executive Officer Joseph Tucci to spin off VMware, saying the move would boost the value of the two assets. Tucci has balked, saying VMware is one of his company's ""most strategic assets."" In July he said he would meet with Elliott officials. EMC and Elliott have declined to discuss what has happened since.  At a Citi investor conference last week, David Goulden, the CEO of EMC's information infrastructure division, said the company wants to hold on to VMware.""If we separate it, we would actually destroy value,"" he said, according to a transcript of the Sept. 3 event. ""It wouldn't be as efficient a mechanism and it wouldn't be as strong a competitor in the marketplace as we are today."" Shares of EMC were up 0.7 percent at $29.71 in afternoon trade. VMware was down 0.5 percent at $96.91.A representative for Elliott, which has invested more than $1 billion in EMC, declined comment. The activist firm has a history of buying stakes in technology companies and pushing them to make changes to benefit shareholders. Its other investments include Juniper Networks Inc and Riverbed Technology Inc. Elliott, which is run by Paul Singer, is also in a tussle with the Argentinian government over defaulted debt.EMC, which owns about 80 percent of VMware, bought the company in 2004 for $700 million. VMware accounted for about 22 percent of EMC's revenue of $23.2 billion in 2013.

125,"  * Valuation lower than previously announced $2.3 bln* CEO says x86 servers offer margins greater than PC's 4 pct* Lenovo to challenge HP, Dell   (Adds CEO quotes, context)By Gerry ShihBEIJING, Sept 29 Lenovo Group Ltd will close its acquisition of International Business Machines Corp's (IBM) x86 server division on Oct 1 for $2.1 billion, giving the Chinese tech firm the firepower to win business clients from U.S. rivals.The closing purchase price is lower than the $2.3 billion announced in January because of a change in the valuation of inventory and deferred revenue liability, Lenovo said. Roughly $1.8 billion will be paid in cash and the remainder in stock. The purchase is Lenovo's latest since overtaking Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) as the world's top personal computer (PC) maker last year, in its quest to diversify away from a steadily shrinking PC market. Earlier this year, Lenovo also said it would pay $2.9 billion for Google Inc's  Motorola smartphone unit.In an interview, Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said the IBM deal opened a new ""growth engine"" for his company. He said he expected the x86 unit to bring in $5 billion in its first year and deliver margins higher than the 4 percent of Lenovo's PC business. ""In the large and medium enterprise space we can now fully leverage IBM technology to compete with brands like HP and Dell,"" Yang said by telephone. ""We can combine this good technology with Lenovo's efficient operations.""IBM's x86 server business has trailed those of HP and Dell Inc in market share. But Yang said Lenovo has expertise competing in markets with razor-thin margins, gained during its journey to becoming the world's largest PC maker.Lenovo currently sells a line of low-end servers under the ThinkServer brand, but the company pursued IBM's x86 portfolio because its higher-end machines can perform more complex analytics and database-related functions. The x86 server team will continue to be led by former IBM executive Adalio Sanchez, who will report to Gerry Smith, president of Lenovo's enterprise business group, Lenovo said in a statement announcing the deal's impending closure.Some observers expected the deal would take longer to close because of uncertainty about how U.S. regulators might respond to a Chinese company buying a server business during a time of cyber-security tensions between the United States and China.Lenovo previously bought its consumer PC laptop business from IBM in 2005.In recent years, IBM has been undergoing a strategic shift away from hardware, focusing instead on higher-margin cloud and big data products.

126,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of  Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Electronic Data  Systems LLC (EDS) at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings  follows at the end of this press release. The rating actions affect approximately $26 billion of total debt, including the  company's undrawn $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities (RCF). KEY RATINGS DRIVERS HP's ratings and Outlook reflect: --Significant scale and broad portfolio, which provides purchasing leverage for  shared components and strengthens the resiliency of its total revenue. --Solid liquidity provided by nearly $14.5 billion of cash (primarily offshore),  $7.5 billion of undrawn committed credit facility capacity and consistent annual  FCF (post dividends) in excess of $5 billion for the past four fiscal years.  Fitch expects FCF of $7.4 billion and $4.8 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2015. --Significant reduction in core debt. HP's core leverage was 0.7x as of July 31,  2014 compared with 1.1x a year ago. Fitch forecasts core leverage will remain  below 1x through fiscal 2017 reflecting revenue stabilization, modest EBITDA  margin expansion due to restructuring activities and positive revenue mix. --Strong worldwide market share, including leading unit market share in servers  and printers and second largest share in PCs, IT services and networking. --More than 30% of HP's total revenue is recurring, primarily via printer  supplies, outsourcing and technology services, and software maintenance. --Geographically diversified revenue base with majority of revenue derived from  outside the U.S.  Ratings concerns center on: --Sustainability of PC demand as commercial migrations attributable to  Microsoft's end of support for Windows XP subsides. --Aggressive industry pricing pressure in PCs and servers that has pressured  profitability, mitigated by HP's realization of cost savings from restructuring  actions.  --Long-term hardware revenue and profitability pressures if commercial customers  aggressively adopt cloud computing in lieu of on-premise and the market for  cloud services remains highly concentrated.  --Event risk in terms of a major acquisition following recent media reports that  HP considered merging with EMC in a purportedly all stock transaction valued at  $60 billion.  --Continued profitability pressures in Enterprise Group (EG), which represented  approximately 36% of HP's operating income in the latest 12 months (LTM) ended  July 31, 2014, down from 40% the prior year. EG operating income has decreased  8.5% in the LTM compared to the prior year. The lower margin reflects a higher mix of lower margin industry standard servers  (ISS), a competitive pricing environment, and continued secular decline in high  margin business critical systems (BCS) revenue, which declined 18% in the LTM  ended July 31, 2014. HP's technology services revenue and operating margin are  also adversely affected as customers gradually migrate to UNIX servers offered  by competitors (IBM and Oracle) or x86 servers that have lower attach rates and  less profitable support contracts. In addition to its solid cash position and consistent FCF, HP's liquidity is  further supported by two undrawn revolving credit facilities, which had  aggregate capacity of $7.5 billion as of July 31, 2014, and multiple revolving  trade receivables facilities with $986 million of available capacity as of July  31, 2014. HP's revolving credit facilities consist of a $4.5 billion credit  facility expiring in April 2019 and a $3 billion facility expiring in March  2017. Minimum interest coverage of 3x is the sole financial covenant.  Total debt was $19.8 billion as of July 31, 2014, consisting of short-term debt  of $2.7 billion, primarily current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt  of $17.1 billion. Fitch estimates approximately $10.8 billion, or 55% of total  debt, is attributable to HP's customer-financing business.  RATINGS SENSITIVITIES  The ratings may be upgraded in the event of: --Strong revenue growth and expanding margins for the Enterprise Group, which  provides greater diversity to the company's operating income mix. Printing  accounted for 38% of total segment operating profit in the LTM ended July 31,  2014 compared with 35% the prior year and up from 29% in FY 2012. --Material revenue shift towards software provides margin expansion and greater  recurring revenue through subscriptions or maintenance. The ratings may be downgraded in the event of: --Continued long-term market share losses in industry standard servers. --Total debt / FCF stays above 5x for a sustained period. --Core debt / core EBITDA stays above 2x for a sustained period. Core metrics  exclude HP's financing business. --Significant decline in supplies demand, particularly commercial, which is not  offset by growth in other HP segments.  --The company divests any businesses that results in material dis-synergies or  EBITDA deterioration.  Fitch currently rates HP and its wholly owned subsidiaries as follows: Hewlett-Packard Company  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-';  --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Senior credit facilities 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'; --Commercial paper (CP) 'F2'.

129,"  (Rewrites, adds background and data on HP)Oct 5 Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard Co , which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, plans to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday.The move, which could be announced as early as Monday,  would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.HP's printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter's financial results. It is not clear how many of HP's more than 300,000 staff work in each of the planned businesses.Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.HP's market value of $66 billion is dwarfed by Apple Inc's  $596 billion and Microsoft Corp's $380 billion. It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments. Dell, which is HP's closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.SPIN-OFF TREND  HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses. Last week online auction company eBay Inc  said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.HP and some of its investors have long considered such a move, the Journal report noted. As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.A source familiar with the matter said HP had held merger talks with storage and cloud-computing firm EMC  recently, as a way of moving more forcefully into online services.Many investors and analysts have called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so  that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses. Company executives have said in the past that personal computers underpin and support the company as a whole. HP did consider spinning off its PC division in 2011 under then-CEO Leo Apotheker, but ultimately decided against the idea.The PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines. Even so, the report of the plan to split off that business surprised some on Wall Street.""I wonder what would have changed in the board's thinking that previously they thought they needed computers together with services to properly serve large enterprises to now,"" said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst.""PCs and printing remain in long-term secular decline, and while HP has managed that business well, the challenges for that portion of the split company will only grow as the demand continues to erode, and commoditization forces prices down further.""The Journal, citing one of its sources, said the plans call for current HP CEO Meg Whitman to become CEO of the new so-called enterprise company and also be chairman of the PC and printer company.Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo would be chairman of the enterprise company. The CEO of the PC and printer company would be Dion Weisler, who is currently an executive in that division, the report said.

132,"   By Supantha Mukherjee and Edwin Chan  Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, and eliminate another 5,000 jobs as part of its turnaround plan.HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both  businesses through a tax-free transaction next year. Each business contributes about half of HP's revenue and profit.Shares of the 75-year-old company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 4.4 percent at $36.78 in late morning trading on Monday.Chief Executive Meg Whitman told Reuters the newly created HP Inc would mostly stick to its knitting – PCs and printers – for now, while exploring related markets such as 3D printing.The company has no plans to venture into the hotly contested consumer mobile devices market, where it stumbled years ago.""There’s still lots of opportunities in other adjacencies, where we don’t chase the market leaders,"" said Whitman, who will be CEO of HP Enterprise, the business that will sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.Whitman said HP’s balance sheet had improved markedly over the past few years, allowing the company to come to the decision to split up from a position of strength.""This would not have been possible three years ago,"" she said, referring to a proposal to spin off PCs in 2011. Some analysts expressed skepticism about the latest move.Barclays analysts noted that the sudden announcement in 2011 was disruptive to HP's sales, its sales force and demand.""If the (latest) decision by HP isn't well communicated or is not well executed, the negative share shifts could be material,"" they said in a note.Analysts at Bernstein Research also warned of ""material negative synergies"" and one-time costs associated with the spinoff, largely in purchasing but also in distribution. The separation, they said, was fueled by weakness, not strength.A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with Whitman. HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.While there were skeptics, many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of HP or a sale of the PC business so that HP could focus on the more profitable side of its operations. ""Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,"" Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement. Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP.HP is the latest in a line of companies to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.Online auction company eBay Inc (EBAY.O), which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.""We like the spin and believe it could create additional value over time,"" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, wrote. ""In our view, focus is more important than synergies, and it is hard to be good at both consumer and enterprise computing.""HP's printing and PC business will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division.

133,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the ratings of  Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Electronic Data  Systems LLC (EDS) on Rating Watch Negative. The placement on Negative Watch  follows HP's announced separation into two companies, consisting of HP  Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPI). The tax-free spin-off to shareholders is  expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year (FY) 2015 (Oct. 31).  The rating actions affect approximately $26.6 billion of total debt, including  the company's undrawn $7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities (RCF). The Rating Watch Negative reflects the loss of business diversity, anticipated  greater financial performance volatility at HPE due to lower recurring revenue,  risk of dis-synergies, particularly procurement, uncertainty regarding the  ultimate liquidity profile and capital structure for HPI and HPE.  The Negative  Watch also reflects minimal strategic rationale for HPI to maintain a strong  investment grade rating and greater risk of debt-financed acquisitions at HPE  given the loss of considerable FCF generated by HPI.  In the latest 12 months (LTM) ended July 31, 2014, Fitch estimates HPI, which  will consist of HP's Printing (consumer and commercial hardware, supplies and  managed print services) and Personal Systems (consumer and commercial notebooks,  desktops, workstations and tablets) segments, generated revenue of $57.2 billion  (49% of total HP excluding eliminations), operating profit of $5.4 billion (49%  of total HP) and an operating margin of 9.4%. HPE will consist of HP's Enterprise Group (servers, storage, networking and  technology services), Enterprise Services (infrastructure technology outsourcing  and application and business services), Software, and HPFS segments. In the LTM  ended July 31, 2014, Fitch estimates HPE, including corporate investments,  generated revenue of $58.6 billion (51% of total HP excluding eliminations),  operating profit of $5.8 billion (51% of total HP) and an operating margin of  9.9%. Fitch expects HPI will assume the vast majority of HP's existing core debt,  which totaled $9 billion at July 31, 2014. This reflects HPI's lower inorganic  growth opportunities and greater and more consistent FCF generation relative to  HPE due to lower capital intensity and cash conversion cycle, and greater  recurring revenue. At a minimum, HPE will assume all of the debt associated with  HP Financial Services (HPFS), which totaled $10.8 billion at July 31, 2014.  Fitch believes managing dis-synergies post separation, particularly in  procurement, could prove difficult and may place HPI and HPE at a competitive  disadvantage relative to larger rivals, such as Lenovo Group (Lenovo) and Dell  Inc. (rated 'BB-' with a Stable Outlook). Lenovo became the third largest  provider of industry standard servers after it completed the acquisition of  IBM's x86 business for $2.1 billion on Oct. 1, 2014.  HP expects to offset procurement dis-synergies through joint purchasing  agreements and improved nimbleness post separation. Furthermore, HP Financial  Services will also continue to provide financing solutions to HPI customers and  partners post separation. KEY RATINGS DRIVERS HP's ratings and Outlook reflect: --Significant scale and broad portfolio, which provides purchasing leverage for  shared components and strengthens the resiliency of its total revenue; --Solid liquidity provided by nearly $14.5 billion of cash (primarily offshore),  $7.5 billion of undrawn committed credit facility capacity and consistent annual  FCF (post dividends) in excess of $5 billion for the past four fiscal years;  --Significant reduction in core debt. HP's core leverage was 0.7x as of July 31,  2014 compared with 1.1x a year ago;  --Strong worldwide market share, including leading unit market share in servers  and printers and second largest share in PCs, IT services and networking; --More than 30% of HP's total revenue is recurring, primarily via printer  supplies, outsourcing and technology services, and software maintenance; --Geographically diversified revenue base with majority of revenue derived from  outside the U.S.  Ratings concerns center on: --Sustainability of PC demand as commercial migrations attributable to  Microsoft's end of support for Windows XP subsides; --Aggressive industry pricing pressure in PCs and servers that has pressured  profitability, mitigated by HP's realization of cost savings from restructuring  actions;  --Long-term hardware revenue and profitability pressures if commercial customers  aggressively adopt cloud computing in lieu of on-premise and the market for  cloud services remains highly concentrated;  --Event risk in terms of a major acquisition following recent media reports that  HP considered merging with EMC in a purportedly all stock transaction valued at  $60 billion;  --Continued profitability pressures in Enterprise Group (EG), which represented  approximately 36% of HP's operating income in the latest 12 months (LTM) ended  July 31, 2014, down from 40% the prior year. EG operating income has decreased  8.5% in the LTM compared to the prior year. The lower margin reflects a higher mix of lower margin industry standard servers  (ISS), a competitive pricing environment, and continued secular decline in high  margin business critical systems (BCS) revenue, which declined 18% in the LTM  ended July 31, 2014. HP's technology services revenue and operating margin are  also adversely affected as customers gradually migrate to UNIX servers offered  by competitors (IBM and Oracle) or x86 servers that have lower attach rates and  less profitable support contracts.  In addition to its solid cash position and consistent FCF, HP's liquidity is  further supported by two undrawn revolving credit facilities, which had  aggregate capacity of $7.5 billion as of July 31, 2014, and multiple revolving  trade receivables facilities with $986 million of available capacity as of July  31, 2014. HP's revolving credit facilities consist of a $4.5 billion credit  facility expiring in April 2019 and a $3 billion facility expiring in March  2017.

Total debt was $19.8 billion as of July 31, 2014, consisting of short-term debt  of $2.7 billion, primarily current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt  of $17.1 billion. Fitch estimates approximately $10.8 billion, or 55% of total  debt, is attributable to HP's customer-financing business.

""Before earnings there's a lot of short-term trading going on and we have increased volatility,"" he said.The Dow Jones industrial average was falling 65.88 points, or 0.39 percent, to 16,943.81, the S&P 500 was losing 8.33 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,959.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was dropping 27.29 points, or 0.61 percent, to 4,448.33. The S&P 500 posted its largest daily advance in nearly two months on Friday but finished the week in the red.The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was CareFusion, rising 22.94 percent after medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson agreed to buy it for $12.2 billion in cash and stock. On the Nasdaq, the largest gainer was also related to an acquisition, with Durata Therapeutics rising 72.2 percent.GT Advanced Technologies, down 87.3 percent to $1.40, was the most active stock on the Nasdaq after Apple Inc's  partner in a sapphire glass plant in Arizona said it had filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection.Declining issues were outnumbering advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,625 to 1,402, for a 1.16-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,749 issues were falling and 846 advancing for a 2.07-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 15 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 21 new highs and 91 new lows.

136,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 6 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open on Monday,  indicating Friday's rally could continue as investors grow more confident in the economy's strength and Federal Reserve policy.Tech shares will likely be in focus after Hewlett-Packard Co  said it would split into two public companies. Shares of the computer company rose 7.2 percent to $37.75 in heavy premarket action.The S&P 500 index posted its best day since August on Friday, lifted by a stronger-than-expected jobs report that boosted optimism about the economy, though the Federal Reserve was not seen as speeding up its timeline for raising interest rates.As of Friday's close, the S&P 500 was about 2.2 percent away from its record close. The Russell 2000 was down 8.6 percent from its record. Last week, the small-cap index fell more than 10 percent from its peak, putting it into correction territory and raising concerns the weakness could spread to the broader market. The S&P 500 had fallen 4.6 percent from its record intraday high to its recent intraday low. While the decline is less than half of the 10 percent drop that indicates a correction, which the benchmark index hasn't undergone since 2012, it fell below its 150-day moving average for the first time since November 2012. It subsequently rebounded back above that level but remains under its 50-day average, which could serve as a resistance level against further gains.Market volatility has been higher of late, with equities notching big swings amid unrest in Hong Kong and concerns about Ebola in the United States. Those issues could continue to drive trading. The CBOE Volatility index ended Friday at 14.55, well below its long-term average of 20.

141,"  (Note: Offensive word in book's title)By Gwladys FoucheOSLO Oct 9 Part memoir, part reflection on business life, ""Good Enough for the Bastards"" is a bestseller by Anita Krohn Traaseth, former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Norway, encouraging women to reach for the top jobs.The book, in the same vein as ""Lean In"" by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, took Norway by storm this year, selling 16,000 copies in a country where a non-fiction book is considered a hit if it breaks through the 800 mark.The title is one of her father's favourite expressions, meant to encourage her to avoid unnecessary perfectionism. ""He would say: 'Anita, when you try something out, it only has to be good enough for the bastards',"" she told Reuters.Traaseth does not provide a how-to guide to success. Instead, she reflects on the challenges she has faced, like growing up with a mother who was bipolar and took her own life. She also tells of the time she lost her job and felt ashamed as she queued up for benefits.Traaseth, 42, spoke with Reuters about the book, which has just been published in English.Q: Why did you want to write this book?A: This was based on a blog on leadership I set up (tinteguri.com) and a Norwegian publisher got interested. I had never dreamt of writing a book. Now that I have written it, my aim is to share a contemporary story about what is like being a female CEO in 2014. I did not want to do it the traditional way. I wanted to explain my life, how my courage was formed. I wanted to have a look at my CV not from the perspective of ""look how good I am"" but more from a perspective of vulnerability and the importance of lessons learnt. Q: How did you write the book?A: It took me nine months to write the book, like a pregnancy. I wrote every evening from 9:30pm to 1:30am. I did it at the same as heading Hewlett-Packard and at the same time as having three daughters. So it is possible. Q: Why the title?A: It is an expression my father, a sailor, has. It has helped me avoid the ""Good Girl"" syndrome. He would say: ""Anita, when you try something out, it only has to be good enough for the bastards."" If you strive to make everybody happy and you are never satisfied with yourself, you are never going to be happy and you are never going to be valuable for anyone around you. At some point, you have to set your own limits, be satisfied with who you are and do what you believe in.Q: In the book, you talk about the importance of being vulnerable. How is it important? A: If you want to be a credible leader or person, it is important you understand your own story, what kind of values and background have formed you. Not only remembering the victories, but really reflecting on the situations that were painful, that were defining moments is important. The more open you are about your own situation, the safer you become as a person.Q: Since 2003 Norway has a law dictating that at least 40 percent of the board members of a listed company must be female. But only three percent of listed firms are led by women. Why do you think that is?A: In Norway, the biggest goal was to get women into the work force, so now 75 percent of women are working (against 57 percent on average in OECD countries). Of them, seven out of 10 are choosing to work in public services, and many work part-time as they work in the very demanding health sector. So they are not applying to positions in business. And they don't apply to the line management positions. This has been a man's world for so many centuries. It takes more than 10 years of a quota law to change this. It will take generations.Q: Did the quota law help?A: The quota law was an important tool, but it is not enough. We still have a long way to go in Norway. The law was good to put women, and to get diversity, into the boards. But what you need to do is to build the talent pool within an organisation. Because you can be 'quotad' into a board, but you cannot be 'quotad' into a management position. You have to want it and you have to learn the game.When I say game, people say, 'But I don't want to be part of a cynical game'. It is not a cynical game. It's like sports. If you want to be a national-level athlete, you make a decision that you will train a lot, with people who are better than you, that you will lose often and you will not be in the top three. And you will have years of training ahead of you. Leadership is training.

Hon Hai also did not give details about the product lines at the plant. China has seen a surge in the number of strikes at its factories in recent years as the economy slowed and a worsening labor shortage has shifted the balance of power in labor relations. Smartphones and social media have also helped workers become more aware than ever of the changing environment. The labor dispute was first reported by U.S.-based watchdog China Labor Watch (CLW), which said the workers went on strike to demand higher pay after Hon Hai cut overtime due to reduced orders from client Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) (HPQ.N). The workers rely on overtime pay to plump up their meager salaries and this is the second strike this year due to the HP cuts, CLW added. HP declined to provide immediate comment.Labor disputes have erupted at Hon Hai factories in the past, and not only in China.

146,"  BEIJING/TAIPEI Oct 9 More than 1,000 employees went on strike at a China factory owned by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer, demanding higher wages and better benefits, a labour watchdog said on Thursday.The workers held the strike at the factory run by Foxconn, Hon Hai's trade name, in the southwestern city of Chongqing on Wednesday, after the company ""significantly"" cut workers' overtime hours in the wake of reduced orders from client Hewlett-Packard Co (HP), said U.S.-based China Labor Watch (CLW).It was unclear if the strike had continued into Thursday, Kevin Slaten, a programme coordinator with CLW, told Reuters by telephone from New York.Slaten estimated the factory employs about 100,000 workers. Pictures provided by CLW of the strike which were reviewed by Reuters showed about a thousand workers in front of the gate to an industrial zone holding red banners that stated: ""We want to eat and raise our families"" and ""We aren't robots"".The Taiwanese company is frequently plagued by labour disputes, a growing point of tension in China where disputes often flare up over workers' rights and compensation. Critics of such strikes say people use them as a negotiating tactic to improve wages, benefits and severance packages. Hon Hai declined to provide immediate comment.CLW said it was the second strike this year at the same factory related to HP production cuts. HP also declined to provide immediate comment. Hon Hai assembles Apple Inc's iPhones, iPads and laptops, as well as computers and servers for HP and Cisco Systems Inc. The factory in Chongqing is not listed as a certified Apple supplier.Other Taiwanese companies have seen similar protests. Workers at a plant in Dongguan owned by Taiwanese touch-screen maker Wintek Corp went on strike in mid-September to protest what they considered poor holiday benefits. Hon Hai has come under fire from labour groups before, particularly in China where many of its production facilities are located. Worker's deaths have been closely scrutinised and reported following a spate of employee suicides in China in 2010.In July, a Hon Hai employee was found dead outside the company's campus in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. The company said it was working with authorities on finding the cause.Last month, Hon Hai said it was in talks with union representatives in Brazil to end a strike at one of its plants in the South American country.

The deal also reverses its long troubled $13.5 billion acquisition a decade ago of storage software maker Veritas.Slowing PC sales have hurt its security sales, while sluggish demand for its storage and data management software has diminished the value of Veritas, which was seen as a ""cash cow"" when it was purchased.""Symantec has been a headache name for tech investors over the last decade,"" said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. ""It's nice to see the board make a decision that strategically makes sense for the company and its investors."" The break-up, which was announced on Thursday, comes during a banner year for spinoffs. More than 60 are expected to be completed this year, the most since 2000, according to Spin-Off Research.Among the recently announced spinoffs, Hewlett-Packard Co  is separating its PC and printer unit from its corporate hardware and services operations. Online auction company eBay Inc is spinning off its electronics payment service PayPal.A number of potential buyers, including Cisco Systems Inc  and NetApp Inc, are likely to show interest in  the two surviving Symantec businesses, Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski said in a note. ""Post split, you have two companies, one focused more on cash flow and one focused more on revenue. So, put together, can it help revenue? I think it can, certainly, but you have to execute,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solar Asset Management.Symantec's revenue fell 3 percent to $6.7 billion in its most-recent fiscal year as its storage business struggled. That unit's operating income dropped 19 percent to $574 million as revenue fell 4 percent to $2.5 billion, according to the company's 10-K annual report. Historical figures for the new security division were not immediately available, though the company said it had revenue of $4.2 billion last year.Michael Brown will continue as Symantec's CEO, while Thomas Seifert will be its chief financial officer. John Gannon will be general manager of the information management business prior to the spinoff, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2015, Symantec said.Shares in the new business will be distributed tax-free to Symantec shareholders at a ratio that has yet to be determined.J.P. Morgan acted as Symantec's adviser.Symantec shares closed down 2.3 percent at $23.44 on the Nasdaq on Thursday. They were quoted at $23.50 in extended trade.

154,"  (Adds details, background, analyst comment; updates shares)By Anya George TharakanOct 22 Data storage equipment maker EMC Corp  cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast, hurt by lower bookings at its VMware Inc unit and a strong dollar.Shares of EMC, which is under pressure from activist investor Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp to spin off VMware, fell as much as 4 percent in early trading.VMware shares declined as much as 9 percent.The unit, owned 80 percent by EMC, forecast current-quarter revenue largely below analysts' estimates on Tuesday due to a delay in the closing of a large U.S. government deal and lower bookings in Germany, Russia and Japan.A surge in the dollar is also hurting EMC, which gets 45 percent of its revenue from international markets.The U.S. dollar index rose 7.7 percent in the third quarter. ""Although guidance was slightly lower than the Street, we believe investors remain laser-focused on the company's plans to enhance shareholder value,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note.Elliott is also pushing EMC to pursue other merger opportunities to maximize long-term value.EMC has said that it planned to keep the company together.The company, however, held talks with Hewlett-Packard Co  for a merger but no deal materialized, sources told Reuters this month. ""We hope the board and management team at EMC is evaluating the right ownership structure/a potential spin off of VMware as this topic remains at the epicenter of investor frustration and activism around the EMC story,"" Ives wrote.EMC's so-called ""federation"" comprises four main businesses - its core data-storage unit, virtualization software unit VMware, enterprise security business RSA and cloud-computing software maker Pivotal.Each unit has its own chief executive and management and develops its own business strategies and products, which sometimes leads to overlaps and competition between units.Separately, EMC said on Wednesday that it would buy most of Cisco Systems Inc's stake in their joint venture, VCE, and merge it into its business. EMC cut its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $1.90 per share from $1.91 and its revenue forecast slightly to $24.5 billion from $24.58 billion.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.91 per share and revenue of $24.54 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to EMC shareholders rose slightly to $587 million, or 28 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $586 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.

155,"   By Stephanie Nebehay and Kate Kelland | GENEVA/LONDON  GENEVA/LONDON The World Health Organization said on Thursday it was still trying to slow the rate of new infections but had ""reasonable confidence"" that the Ebola virus plaguing three West African countries had not spread into neighboring states.Asked whether countries such as Guinea Bissau, Mali and Ivory Coast might have cases of the disease crossing their borders without knowing about or reporting them, WHO assistant director general Keiji Fukuda said he considered that unlikely.""I think that there is reasonable confidence right now that we are not seeing widespread transmission of Ebola into the neighboring countries,"" Fukuda told a news briefing in Geneva. ""It remains a big concern for everybody, but we think that right now we are not seeing it. We think it would be very difficult to miss, basically.""He conceded that some Ebola cases could go undetected or unreported by authorities ""for a few days for a week or two"".""But if you're really having outbreaks in which lots of people are dying, given the extensive coverage in all the countries, it doesn't matter what country that you are in, you simply would not be able to cover up having lots of people die for mysterious reasons.""Last week, the WHO said it would send teams of experts to Mali and Ivory Coast to check their preparedness.The economic damage of a major outbreak in Ivory Coast would be felt around the world, since it and next-door Ghana produce about 60 percent of the world's cocoa beans. Although Senegal and Nigeria managed to contain the disease imported by travelers, Ebola is still raging in the three countries at the heart of the epidemic.The WHO's Emergency Committee advising on Ebola said screening people leaving Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea by air, land and sea remained critical for reducing its spread.SCREENING IMPACT  At a minimum, exit screening should consist of ""a questionnaire, a temperature measurement and, if fever is discovered, an assessment of the risk that the fever is caused by Ebola"", the independent experts said after closed-door talks.""It is important to realize that exit screening is not going to stop everything. It is important to reinforce the message of the importance of the questionnaire, it has to be done in a good way,"" said Isabelle Nuttall of WHO's health security cluster. To date, 36,000 people leaving Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been screened and 100 were ""deferred from traveling"", she said in response to a query on the latest data.None had Ebola, spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said by email. The committee reiterated that there should be no general ban on international travel or trade due to the Ebola epidemic.On entry screening of passengers, introduced by some states, the experts said they could have a ""limited effect"" when added to exit checks. But the advantages and disadvantages should be weighed carefully and decisions made on a case-by-case basis.At least 4,877 people are known to have died, but the true toll may be three times as much.The response to the disease is now based on a ""70-70-60 plan"" to get 70 percent of patients in isolation and 70 percent of bodies buries safely within a 60-day period ending on Dec. 1. But the elements needed to achieve that - bed spaces, treatment centers, laboratories, dead-body-management teams and volunteers - are still far short of what is required. Fukuda, asked when he expected the rate of new infections to slow down, said: ""It's clear that it remains quite a challenge right now, we see the numbers still going up. We still see an extensive effort trying to catch up to that curve and then get beyond the curve.""The WHO originally appealed for 12,000 local staff and 750 foreign experts, but it has raised those targets to 20,000 and 1,000 respectively. Fukuda said there were only 600 foreign experts so far.

HP hopes a new take on the old PC can re-ignite customer interest, though it is careful to play down expectations.

Its biggest departure from the traditional computer is a display-mounted 3D scanner and projector that creates a digital image of objects placed on the mat.

President Xi Jinping set out his vision during a September 2013 visit to Kazakhstan and on Saturday he announced an initial $40 billion for a ""Silk Road fund"" to invest in infrastructure and industrial and financial cooperation, aiming to ""break the connectivity bottleneck"" in Asia.The modern-day Silk Road starts at Tuanjie Village, the name - meaning ""solidarity"" -  given to a railway station encircled by container depots in Chongqing, a city of 30 million where laptop maker Hewlett Packard and Apple supplier Foxconn have factories, among others.The first stirrings of this new Silk Road predate Xi's plan: a direct train to Duisburg in Germany left Chongqing in 2011.A map published by state news agency Xinhua envisages two routes: an overland one snaking through Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Iran en route to Vienna in Austria; and a maritime route from Chinese ports to Belgium's Antwerp. Details remain sketchy, but Xinhua said the plan would focus on China's Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative, building roads, railways, ports and airports across Central and South Asia.""It is China's wish to have an independent route,"" said Henrik Christensen, president of global logistics at KTZ Express, part of Kazakhstan Railways, which helped develop the Chongqing-Duisburg route. ""The cost of it is so mind-blowingly big and I would say that the only country in the world that could ever dream of this is China,"" he said.     One consideration may be the potential for trouble and disruption in the South China Sea, where China is in dispute with several countries over territorial rights.Another is the fact that the biggest container shipping lines are European, such as AP Moeller Maersk A/S.There are more than 240 Chinese shipping firms but they carry only a quarter of the country's trade, the Ministry of Transport said in September, when the government announced tax and regulatory reforms to modernize the sector.                Based on Reuters calculations, state-backed firms have already invested at least $5 billion in transport infrastructure over the past decade along routes that run through Central Asia and weave around Sri Lanka as well as along the Red Sea.The maritime route links the Chinese ports of Fuzhou and Guangzhou with ports in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Greece. Some don't see much connection there. ""Of course it's lovely to call it a Maritime Silk Road and talk about a lot of synergies, but in truth what really are the synergies between these ports?"" said Jonathan Beard, head of ports and logistics at consultancy ICF International.LOSS-MAKING Firms such as China Merchants Holdings, China Railway Construction Corp, Cosco Pacific and China Communications Construction Company have built or manage about 10 ports and have offered investment in at least five rail projects in Kyrgyzstan, Kenya and elsewhere.  China's Exim Bank financed 85 percent of the cost of the $361 million first phase of Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port, which was constructed by China Harbour Engineering. A Chinese-Turkish consortium led by China Railway Construction built the $4 billion Ankara-Istanbul high-speed rail line in Turkey.The train services from Chongqing to Duisburg, and from other Chinese cities such as Chengdu and Wuhan to Europe, are loss-making and subsidized by local governments in China to support demand, according to Chinese rail officials.

Under the 10-year agreement, HP will provide computing capacity and data storage to host Deutsche's operations, the two companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday. Deutsche will retain activities such as IT architecture and information security.The HP deal will allow the bank to reduce costs and launch new products and services more quickly, Deutsche Bank Chief Operating Officer Henry Ritchotte said in a statement. The companies did not specify the exact value of the contract.The deal does not directly affect a 2003 accord Deutsche concluded with IBM to run its retail banking operations in Germany, including those of its high street branch network separately listed as Postbank.

""It was my mistake. I cared more about her feelings than anything else. I thought it should be her choice"" whether to tell others at the firm and start an investigation, he said.Whether Kleiner reacted appropriately to allegations of sexism is at the heart of the suit, filed by former partner Ellen Pao.The case, brought in 2012, helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion about gender issues in Silicon Valley. In the suit, Pao alleges she suffered discrimination and retaliation after Nazre pressured her into a 2006 affair which she soon ended.     Pao alleged in her lawsuit that Lane and other partners did not initially respond to her complaints. Eventually, Lane told her to consider marriage to Nazre, she said in her suit. The discriminatory conduct spread to other partners, leading her to miss out on a key promotion, she alleges.Vassallo, who testified in the case last week, said Lane had told her to be ""flattered"" by Nazre's advances, although she later said she believed he was joking. But Kleiner did eventually start an investigation into Nazre's actions after she told more partners.The firm has vehemently denied Pao’s allegations. Kleiner’s lawyer, Lynne Hermle, said in court last week that the firm treated women fairly and did not promote Pao because she lacked talent.

Whether it reacted appropriately is at the heart of the suit, filed by former partner Ellen Pao.The case, brought in 2012, helped spark a broad and ongoing discussion about sexism in Silicon Valley.In the suit, Pao alleges she suffered discrimination and retaliation after ending a brief affair with another partner, Ajit Nazre. When she told Lane and two other partners about the situation they didn't initially respond, she alleged. Eventually, Lane told her to consider marriage to Nazre, she said in her suit.Meanwhile, Pao says, the discrimination and retaliation toward her spread beyond Nazre to other partners, leading her to miss out on a key promotion.The firm has vehemently denied Pao's allegations. Kleiner's lawyer, Lynne Hermle, said in court last week that the firm treated women fairly and didn't promote Pao because she lacked talent. ""She did not come close"" to the qualifications needed to take on a more senior role, Hermle said.But Pao's attorney, Alan Exelrod, said the firm systematically failed to promote women to senior investing partner. He said Pao excelled at her work, including lining up patent firm RPX as an investment. The company raised $160 million in an initial public offering just three years after Kleiner's investment. ""Was there a level playing field for Ellen Pao at Kleiner Perkins?"" Exelrod said to the jury, which started hearing the case last week. ""We will prove to you in this case that there was not.""Lane joined Kleiner Perkins in 2000, after leaving software giant Oracle.

The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is not public. Representatives for Novetta, Arlington Capital Partners, Morgan Stanley and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment.McLean, Virginia-based Novetta offers data analytics services to government clients working with large sets of data. Its customers include national intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM Corp , as well as defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co and General Dynamics Corp , could show interest in Novetta, according to the sources.Representatives from General Dynamics, Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin, and IBM declined to comment. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. A deal for Novetta would be just the latest example of a private equity firm selling a government services portfolio company.Last month, government services contractor Engility Holdings Inc, acquired TASC, a provider of professional services to government agencies for $1.3 billion. TASC was controlled by affiliates of the private equity firms KKR & Co LP and General Atlantic LLC.On Sunday, Science Applications International Corp  a provider of information technology and engineering services to governments, said it would acquire Scitor Corp, a smaller peer, for $790 million.

219,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal judge in California on Tuesday invalidated four Hewlett-Packard Co patents for being too abstract, marking a setback in the company's patent infringement lawsuit against competitor ServiceNow Inc. Hewlett-Packard last year accused its competitor, a Santa Clara, California-based software company, of infringing eight patents on software for managing computer networks. But the federal court in San Jose, California said four of them were too abstract to deserve legal protection. The ruling involves one of the biggest companies to have its patents struck down in the wake of a highly influential 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Alice v. CLS Bank, which experts say has placed thousands of software-related patents in peril. That ruling stated that when an idea is too abstract, or basic, to deserve a patent, it does not become eligible for a patent if run on a computer. Since that high court decision last June, more than 20 lower-court rulings have used the ruling to invalidate software patents, according to a Reuters tally. By contrast, only a handful have upheld the soundness of the patents involved. In her ruling on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Beth Freeman said she was invalidating the patents because even if Hewlett-Packard may have been first with an innovative idea, ""this does not entitle HP to a patent.""Hewlett-Packard said the company will press forward with its lawsuit on the four patents Freeman's ruling left intact. “We are disappointed in the court’s ruling, and are considering next steps as this is a rapidly evolving area of the law,"" the company said in a statement.ServiceNow declined to comment on the decision. Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett Packard closed down 0.85 percent at $32.67 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.The case is Hewlett-Packard Co v.

223,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Hewlett-Packard Co won preliminary approval from a U.S. judge to settle shareholder litigation on Friday involving the information technology company's botched acquisition of Autonomy Plc.The ruling, from U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco, comes after HP failed to win approval of two previous proposed deals. Breyer had written that the last deal may not have been fair for shareholders because it could have forced them to give up claims beyond the Autonomy deal.However, Breyer said the latest settlement appears to be limited solely to HP's conduct involving Autonomy. In a statement HP said it is pleased with the ruling. HP announced a $8.8 billion writedown in November 2012, just over one year after buying Autonomy, and linked more than $5 billion to accounting fraud and inflated financials by Autonomy executives. The British company and its executives have denied any wrongdoing.Under the terms of the settlement, shareholder attorneys agreed to drop all claims against HP's current and former executives, including Chief Executive Meg Whitman, board members and advisers to the company. HP, in turn, agreed to some governance reforms.

Unigroup has since come in with a higher offer, but without NDRC approval, and is now in talks with the regulator for permission to pursue the unit valued by HP at $5.5 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said.China's government generally backs a single contender as major cross-border acquisitions progress into advanced stages.Both contenders have closed significant cross-border technology deals in recent years, with Huaxin buying an 85 percent stake in Alcatel-Lucent's ALUA.PA enterprise computing business, and Unigroup receiving a $1.5 billion investment from Intel Corp (INTC.O).SENSITIVE INDUSTRIES  Huaxin has contested the late involvement of Unigroup, which pulled off a similar transaction without approval two years ago.Under Chinese regulations, the NDRC must approve outbound investments worth more than $2 billion or which are in sensitive industries - which could apply to the server and networking equipment sector where Beijing is looking to develop its domestic industry amid fears of foreign cyberspying.Following former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of cyberspying programs involving American technology firms, Western tech companies have struggled for customers in China, and are now seeking local partners or selling off assets altogether to Chinese buyers.Huaxin vice president Liu Jun said bidding for an asset in a sensitive industry should be restricted to approved firms, and the NDRC would not give permission to another bidder. The NDRC and Unigroup declined to comment. A Hewlett-Packard spokesperson said the company does not comment on speculation. PREVIOUS CASES Unauthorized bidding is highly unusual in China - but not unheard of.In 2011, Sany Heavy Industry (600031.SS) president Xiang Wenbo heard that rival Zoomlion (000157.SZ) had obtained NDRC approval to buy Putzmeister Group, and flew to Germany to trump the deal, sparking a public feud with Zoomlion. Three years later, Tsinghua Unigroup took publicly traded semiconductor firm RDA Microelectronics private despite objections from Shanghai Pudong Science and Technology Investment Co, which had obtained NDRC approval.Xiong Jin, a partner at King & Wood Mallesons, said the NDRC's only recourse is to restrict Unigroup's capital from leaving China, but the saga highlights how the agency otherwise lacks an enforcement mechanism to punish unauthorized bidders.Hewlett-Packard sounded out around 10 Chinese prospective buyers since putting H3C on the block a year ago. The U.S. firm has not yet picked a preferred bidder and is in no rush to sell, while the two Chinese companies are traveling to HP's Palo Alto  headquarters to lobby their case, said an individual with direct knowledge of the matter.State-owned China Electronics Corp (0085.HK) was in talks for months with HP - which is advised by Credit Suisse - until a top government shareholder voiced lukewarm assessment of the prospective acquisition, another person said.Controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing, Unigroup has positioned itself as a champion for China's technological development after it acquired chipmakers RDA and Spreadtrum in deals totaling $1.6 billion last year.

""I see that disconnect everywhere I go. I see people just disgusted, honestly, with the way the playing field is tilted against them, the disconnect between what they're thinking about and what they perceive people in Washington are thinking about,"" Fiorina said.A breast cancer survivor who lost a stepdaughter to drug addiction, Fiorina is a multimillionaire who has known adversity.She was forced to resign from HP in 2005 as the tech company struggled to digest a $19 billion merger with then-rival computer maker Compaq. Around the time of her ouster from HP she was derisively dubbed the ""anti-Steve Jobs"" by one respected tech news website, though the Compaq merger was eventually seen as a success.Fiorina is at the bottom of a Reuters/Ipsos online poll of actual and possible Republican White House candidates, with less than 1 percent support.She has gotten a warm reception at events in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire but she suffered an     embarrassment on the first day of her campaign when a critic took over a website with her name in it to highlight job losses at HP. Visitors to the carlyfiorina.org site saw the message, ""Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain. So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard.""The site showed ""sad-face"" emoticons to symbolize what it said were 30,000 job losses at the company. Fiorina's real campaign web site, www.carlyforpresident.com, featured a video from her about the presidential bid and other messages.In 2010, Fiorina lost the election for a U.S. Senate seat in California to Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, failing to benefit from a wave of pro-Republican sentiment nationally.She said on Monday that her first phone call as president would be to the prime minister of Israel to assure the Jewish state of America's support.The second call, she said, would be to the supreme leader of Iran to warn him of U.S. sanctions unless he allowed unfettered access for inspectors to Tehran's nuclear program.",2015-05-04,HPQ,"Mon May 4, 2015 | 5:27pm EDT","UPDATE 4-Republican former CEO Fiorina enters 2016 race, hits Clinton",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-election-fiorina-idUSL1N0XV0F820150504?type=companyNews

It's a terrible decision to have to make,"" Fiorina said in an interview taped on Monday with Katie Couric of Yahoo News.""But sometimes there are tough decisions that must be made to strengthen a company for the long haul, which we clearly made. ... So it was a tough time I managed through. But we transformed a company from failing to succeeding,"" Fiorina added. Fiorina said a quote attributed to her on the carlyfiorina.org website that ""I wish I would have done them all faster"" was taken out of context, and that when she decided to fire an executive ""a lot of people came up to me and said, 'I wish you'd done that sooner.'""She also gave her account of her departure from Hewlett-Packard as the company dealt with a $19 billion merger with then-rival computer maker Compaq.

243,"   By Paul Sandle | LONDON  LONDON British IT entrepreneur Mike Lynch said Hewlett-Packard Co had failed to produce a ""smoking gun"" to back its claim he masterminded a complex fraud that led it to overpay by more than $5 billion when HP bought Autonomy in 2011.The U.S. company is suing Autonomy founder Lynch and former Autonomy finance director Sushovan Hussain for in excess of $5 billion in damages over their management of Autonomy, which it acquired for $11.7 billion.Autonomy was supposed to be the foundation of a shift into software and services for the Silicon Valley computer maker, but the deal quickly soured, with HP accusing Autonomy's management of ""systematically"" hiding the performance of the company through improper deals and accounting practices.HP said in its court filing it believed it was acquiring a rapidly growing company that was gaining market share, but it turned out Autonomy was not growing as quickly as it appeared and was losing market share.As a result, it said it overpaid for Autonomy by at least 3.2 billion pounds, or about $5 billion. Lynch said HP's claim was ""a simple rehash of previous leaks and insinuations that add up to one long disagreement over accounting treatment"".""That's not fraud,"" he told Reuters in an interview.

245,"  WASHINGTON May 5 Republican U.S. presidential candidate Carly Fiorina is defending her record as a corporate executive after a critic took over a website with her name on it to highlight job losses at Hewlett-Packard Co while she served as CEO.Fiorina, who announced her candidacy on Monday in the 2016 race, said she would run on her record at Hewlett-Packard, but added in reference to the carlyfiorina.org website: ""Obviously, would I have preferred that we bought up every conceivable domain name? Yes.""Visitors to carlyfiorina.org came across the message, ""Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain. So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard.""The website showed sad-face emoticons to symbolize what it said were 30,000 job losses at the tech company for which she served as chief executive from 1999 to 2005. ""When you managed through a technology recession, every technology company - every one - laid people off. It's a terrible decision to have to make,"" Fiorina said in an interview taped on Monday with Katie Couric of Yahoo News. ""But sometimes there are tough decisions that must be made to strengthen a company for the long haul, which we clearly made. ... So it was a tough time I managed through. But we transformed a company from failing to succeeding,"" Fiorina added.Fiorina said a quote attributed to her on the carlyfiorina.org website that ""I wish I would have done them all faster"" was taken out of context, and that when she decided to fire an executive ""a lot of people came up to me and said, 'I wish you'd done that sooner.'"" She also gave her account of her departure from Hewlett-Packard as the company dealt with a $19 billion merger with then-rival computer maker Compaq.""I was fired in a boardroom brawl over a two-week period at Hewlett-Packard because we had board members who were leaking confidential information,"" Fiorina said. "" ... I know that when you're leading - which means you're challenging the status quo - you're going to make some enemies along the way. I made some enemies in the boardroom.

247,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has rated Hewlett-Packard Company's (HP)  $5 billion delayed draw senior unsecured term loan at 'A-'. HP will use  borrowings under the term loan for general corporate purposes, including funding  expenses related to the company's planned separation by the end of the current  fiscal year ending Oct. 31, 2015. Commitments under the term loan will be available until the earlier of Nov. 1,  2015, or the date of the separation with certain fees and reduced unutilized  commitment amounts for extensions beyond Nov. 1, 2015. The ratings for HP and  its wholly-owned subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems LLC (EDS), are on Rating  Watch Negative and a full list of current ratings follows at the end of this  release. The Negative Watch continues to reflect Fitch's expectations for lower business  diversification, increased operating volatility at HP Enterprise (HPE)from lower  recurring revenue, risks from dis-synergies (including procurement) and  uncertainty regarding the ultimate liquidity profile and capital structure at HP  Inc. (HPI) and HPE, pro forma for the split.  The Negative Watch also reflects Fitch's belief that there is minimal strategic  rationale for HPI to maintain a strong investment grade rating and potential for  debt-financed acquisitions at HPE, given lower pro forma free cash flow (FCF).  Fitch expects overall organic revenue trends to stabilize in fiscal 2015, driven  by demand strength in industry standard servers (ISS), notebooks and converged  storage. These trends will offset weakness in networking, Enterprise Services,  and printers, and result in flat- to slightly-lower growth, on a constant  currency basis. Nonetheless, significant foreign currency translation headwinds  will result in low- to mid-single-digit negative revenue growth. Fitch expects HP to augment organic growth with acquisitions, including the  company's proposed purchase of wireless networking company, Aruba Networks, Inc.  (Aruba), for $2.7 billion in an all-cash deal. This deal would add $800 million  to $1 billion of annual revenues, although growth rates for Aruba are  anticipated to be robust over the intermediate term. HP expects the deal to  close in the second half of 2015 and is subject to customary regulatory  approvals. The company's restructuring efforts will limit profit margin compression and  Fitch expects operating income margin to remain in the high single digits.  Significant cash charges related to the foreign currency headwinds and the  separation will meaningfully reduce FCF (Fitch defined) to $3.5 billion to $4  billion for fiscal 2015, following more than $7 billion in each of the past two  fiscal years.  The company will use cash flow for share repurchases and dividends, resuming its  shareholder-returns target. Given the company generates nearly two-thirds of  sales offshore and Fitch's assumption that the vast majority of cash is located  overseas, Fitch believes debt levels could increase slightly to support  shareholder returns in fiscal 2015. Nonetheless, Fitch expects credit protection measures will remain solid for the  ratings. For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Jan. 31, 2015, Fitch estimates  core leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA excluding debt related to the  financing business) of 0.6 times (x), while total debt to operating EBITDA  unadjusted for financing debt was 1.4x.  HPI will consist of HP's Printing (consumer and commercial hardware, supplies  and managed print services) and Personal Systems (consumer and commercial  notebooks, desktops, workstations and tablets) segments, which Fitch expects  will represent just under half of HP's total revenues for fiscal 2015 with  operating profit margin just under 10%.  HPE will consist of HP's Enterprise Group (servers, storage, networking and  technology services), Enterprise Services (infrastructure technology  outsourcing, and application and business services), Software, and HPFS  segments, which Fitch expects will represent 51% of total revenues in fiscal  2015 with operating income margin just over 10%.  Fitch expects HPI will assume the vast majority of HP's existing core debt ($8.2  billion at Jan. 31, 2015), reflecting HPI's lower inorganic growth opportunities  and stronger FCF profile from lower capital intensity and cash conversion cycle  and greater recurring revenue. Fitch assumes HPE will assume all debt associated  with HP Financial Services ($10.9 billion at Jan. 31, 2015).  KEY RATINGS DRIVERS HP's ratings and Outlook reflect: --Solid liquidity provided by nearly $12.9 billion of cash (primarily offshore),  $7.5 billion of undrawn committed credit facility capacity, and consistent  annual FCF (post dividends) in excess of $5 billion for the past four fiscal  years;  --Significant reduction in core debt;  --Strong worldwide market share, including leading unit market share in servers  and printers and second largest share in PCs, IT services and networking; --More than 30% of HP's total revenue is recurring, primarily via printer  supplies, outsourcing and technology services, and software maintenance; --Geographically diversified revenue base with majority of revenue derived from  outside the U.S.  Ratings concerns center on: --Sustainability of PC demand as commercial migrations attributable to  Microsoft's end of support for Windows XP subsides; --Aggressive industry pricing pressure in PCs and servers that has pressured  profitability, mitigated by HP's realization of cost savings from restructuring  actions;  --Long-term hardware revenue and profitability pressures if commercial customers  aggressively adopt cloud computing in lieu of on-premise and the market for  cloud services remains highly concentrated;  --Event risk in terms of significant acquisitions;  --Continued profitability pressures in HPE; --Potential dis-synergies related to the separation, particularly in  procurement, that could prove difficult and may place HPI and HPE at a  competitive disadvantage relative to larger rivals, such as Lenovo Group  (Lenovo) and Dell Inc. (rated 'BB' with a Positive Outlook by Fitch).  Fitch believes liquidity was solid at Jan. 31, 2015 and supported by: --$12.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (primarily offshore); and --$7.5 billion of undrawn committed credit facility capacity.   Fitch's expectations for strong FCF (post dividends) in excess of $5 billion  beyond the near-term also support liquidity. The term loan also provides  near-term liquidity to fund separation related expenses. HP's revolving credit facilities consist of a $4.5 billion credit facility  expiring in April 2019 and a $3 billion facility expiring in March 2017. Minimum  interest coverage of 3x is the sole financial covenant.  Total debt was $19.1 billion as of Jan. 31, 2015, consisting of short-term debt  of $3.5 billion (primarily the current portion of long-term debt) and long-term  debt of $15.6 billion.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Revenues decline by mid-single digits in fiscal 2015, reflecting relatively  flat constant currency growth and significant FX headwinds. Strength in ISS,  notebooks, converged storage will offset weakness in Networking, Enterprise  Services, and Printers to achieve flat growth on a constant currency basis.  --Profitability expands slightly through the forecast period, due to past  restructuring and strengthening mix.  --FCF of $3.5 billion from significant cash charges associated with separation  and FX headwinds. --Half of FCF used for share buybacks and dividends, potentially resulting in  higher core debt levels given that a majority of FCF is generated overseas. Fitch maintains the Rating Watch Negative on the following ratings: Hewlett-Packard Company  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-';  --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Senior credit facilities 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'; --Commercial paper (CP) 'F2'. Hewlett-Packard International Bank PLC --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --CP 'F2'. Electronic Data Systems LLC --Long-term IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'.

A person familiar with the matter said an announcement could be made as soon as Thursday.A Hewlett-Packard spokesperson in Singapore declined to comment.

Huaxin is still waiting to hear from HP about its decision, a spokesman for the Shanghai-based firm said. Under Chinese regulations, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) must approve outbound investments worth more than $2 billion or which are in sensitive industries - which could apply to the server and networking equipment sector where the government is looking to develop its domestic industry amid fears of foreign cyber spying. HP has previously valued the unit, H3C Technologies Co, at $5.5 billion and had sounded out around 10 Chinese prospective buyers since putting it on the block a year ago, people knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.Both Unigroup and Huaxin have closed significant cross-border technology deals in recent years, with Huaxin buying an 85 percent stake in Alcatel-Lucent's ALUA.PA enterprise computing business, and Unigroup receiving a $1.5 billion investment from Intel Corp (INTC.O).

274,"  Carly Fiorina has raised $1.4 million since launching her U.S. presidential bid in May, a slow start for the former Hewlett-Packard Co chief executive compared with others in the crowded Republican field.In addition to the candidate's fundraising, Carly for America, an outside super PAC supporting her presidential campaign, said it has raised $3.4 million so far, for a combined take of $4.8 million.By comparison, some of her rivals for the Republican nomination for the November 2016 election who have released preliminary fundraising totals said they raised $8.3 million to $10 million in the three months through June, not including super PAC money.Fiorina is considered a long shot for the nomination, earning just 1.2 percent of support in a recent Reuters poll of the likely Republican field. The former executive's light fundraising so far shows she is fighting for attention from donors as well.    Her campaign manager, Frank Sadler, announced the campaign's $1.4 million fundraising total in a memo dated Monday. He said Fiorina's bid was launched from a ""standing start,"" putting her at a disadvantage to Republicans who built campaign infrastructures before formally joining the race. ""We won't raise as much as others at this early stage of our campaign, but we will raise what we need to go the distance,"" Sadler said in the memo.Fiorina's intake was considerably less than that of Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who said he raised about $10 million in the second quarter. Cruz said outside groups brought the total donated by his supporters to about $51 million since he launched his campaign in March. Another Republican candidate, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, reported that he had raised $8.3 million in the last three months and $10.5 million since March, when he formed an exploratory committee. Carson announced his candidacy in May.Others have not released fundraising numbers yet, including Republican front-runner Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor. Candidates must report fundraising figures for the fiscal quarter ended on June 30 to the Federal Election Commission by July 15. During Fiorina's 2010 bid for a U.S. Senate seat from California, she loaned her campaign about $6.78 million. Her campaign still finished in debt and only repaid some staffers and vendors this year, a few months before Fiorina announced her run for president.

On Wednesday, the California Sixth Appellate District Court of Appeal unanimously reversed a ruling from the lower court that denied plaintiffs' motion to certify a nationwide class. It also restored several claims that HP violated California consumer-protection laws and breached the computers' warranty.

Over the past 18 months, Renzi has tackled the labour market, the banking sector, education and the public administration, among other areas, even though few reforms are yet operational and their long-term impact remains to be seen.Renzi turned up at the meeting to reel off his achievements in a speech followed by two hours of questions from foreign and domestic participants on the future of Italy.All the executives said there was much more to be done to bring Italy's growth in line with the rest of Europe, tackle stifling bureaucracy and corruption, speed up the justice system, cut taxes and keep control of tottering public finances.But the overall atmosphere was in sharp contrast to last year's gloomy discussions over the crisis and impatience at the lack of progress, and an internal poll showed 69 percent of participants had an excellent or good assessment of Renzi.""My view of the government is very positive.

Renzi turned up at the meeting to reel off his achievements in a speech followed by two hours of questions from foreign and domestic participants on the future of Italy.All the executives said there was much more to be done to bring Italy's growth in line with the rest of Europe, tackle stifling bureaucracy and corruption, speed up the justice system, cut taxes and keep control of tottering public finances.But the overall atmosphere was in sharp contrast to last year's gloomy discussions over the crisis and impatience at the lack of progress, and an internal poll showed 69 percent of participants had an excellent or good assessment of Renzi.""My view of the government is very positive.

The other company, HP Inc, will comprise the computer and printer businesses, which have been hit hard by a relentless decline in sales of personal computers.""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring,"" Whitman said in a statement.The job cuts, aimed at saving $2.7 billion a year, will result in a charge of about $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said. HP had more than 300,000 employees as of Oct. 31, 2014. Job cuts have become a way of life at the company in recent years as it has digested a series of acquisitions that failed to revive its fortunes.Chief Financial Officer Cathie Lesjak said last month that HP expected the previously announced total of 55,000 job cuts under Whitman to increase by up to 5 percent by the end of October.In the third quarter ended July 31, HP's revenue from personal computer and printer businesses, its largest, fell 11.5 percent. Of the units to be housed in HPE, which will be run by Whitman, sales in enterprise services dropped 11 percent, while revenue at the enterprise group rose 2 percent.HPE will have revenue of more than $50 billion, and is expected to report adjusted profit of $1.85 to $1.95 per share in 2016, HP said on Tuesday.The business is expected to report free cash flow of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion in 2016, at least half of which is expected to be returned through dividends and share buybacks.The stock fell 1.4 percent to $26.73 in extended trading.Maxim Group analyst Nehal Chokshi blamed the market reaction on the cash flow target, which he said looked short of the contribution needed from the enterprise unit to meet analysts' forecasts.(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru; Writing by Christian Plumb; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Richard Chang)",2015-09-15,HPQ,"Tue Sep 15, 2015 | 7:57pm EDT","UPDATE 3-HP to cut up to 30,000 more jobs in enterprise business",http://www.reuters.com//article/hp-redundancies-idUSL4N11L59S20150915?type=companyNews

308,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the long-term ratings  of Hewlett-Packard Company (Hewlett-Packard) to 'BBB+' from 'A-', removed the  ratings from Rating Watch Negative and assigned a Stable Outlook . The  short-term ratings are affirmed at 'F2'. At the same time, Fitch notes the  change in the company's name to HP Inc. (HPI) from Hewlett-Packard following the  completion of the company's separation from Hewlett-Packard Enterprises Inc.  (HPE) on Nov. 1, 2015. Fitch's ratings affect $6.8 billion of debt. A full list  of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings reflect expectations for solid operating results despite secular  demand challenges in HPI's core markets. The business separation will support  operating profit margin expansion and solid annual free cash flow (FCF; Fitch  defined as after dividends). A commitment to conservative financial policies  through the rating horizon and investments in adjacent growth markets in the  long term should offset Fitch's expectations for sustained top-line pressures in  core markets. Fitch expects HPI's core printing and PC market will remain challenged for the  foreseeable future, likely declining in the low- to mid-single digits annually.  Reduced demand for printing, particularly among consumers, should continue  pressuring printer sales and highly profitable ink replacement cartridges, which  Fitch believes contribute significant recurring revenue.  To offset core printing market declines, HPI will focus on markets expected to  deliver at least double-digit growth over the foreseeable future (including A3,  graphics, and 3D printing), albeit from very small revenue bases. Fitch believes  meaningful growth from investments in these markets likely will occur beyond its  forecast period (through fiscal 2017). Fitch expects PC unit sales to continue declining in the mid- to high-single  digits as consumers extend replacement cycles and increasingly prefer  larger-screen smartphones to PCs for non-productivity-based uses. Fitch does not  anticipate significant uplift from Windows 10, but ongoing consolidation of the  PC market by the top 3 vendors (HP, Lenovo and Dell) and increased thin client  and mobility sales could offset core market declines. Profitability should expand from restructuring and efficiency initiatives,  despite negative revenue growth and increased investments in growth markets.  Fitch believes cost take-outs will drive operating EBIT margin to mid-single  digits from low-single digits pro forma for the separation. As a result Fitch  expects more than $1 billion of annual FCF through the rating horizon. Fitch expects HPI's financial policies will remain conservative through at least  the intermediate term as the company focuses on resuming positive revenue  growth. Fitch expects total leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) to remain  below 1.5x and solid liquidity and annual FCF, although the company may use FCF  for a combination of acquisitions and shareholder returns..  The ratings and Outlook also reflect Fitch's expectations for: --Strong liquidity and conservative financial policies supported by solid cash  and investments, an undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) that will fully  backstop a CP program, solid annual FCF and total leverage below 1.5x; --Strong share positions in each of its core markets, including laser and ink  printing and the $170 billion core PC market, all of which are facing secular  headwinds but provide substantial scale to support investments in growth  markets; --Significant geographic, market, customer and product diversification, which  should reduce operating volatility, despite exposure to cyclical demand  patterns;  --Large printer and PC installed base, providing substantial and highly  profitable recurring revenues and platform for increasing supplies and services  penetration. The ratings also consider Fitch's expectations for: --Long-term secular declines in printers and PCs, which will likely decline in  the low- to mid-single digits through at least the intermediate term and require  HPI to urgently gain traction in growth markets; --Growth markets to develop beyond the intermediate term, potentially testing  shareholders' patience for more aggressive financial policies;  --Aggressive pricing pressures, particularly in PCs, where Fitch anticipates  second- and third-tier players will aggressively seek to regain declining market  share;  --Acquisition activity to gain intellectual property (IP) in growth markets that  are likely to be expensive for the attendant incremental cash flows. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for HPI include: --Core printing and PC markets declining in the low- to mid-single digits  through the intermediate term, resulting in slightly negative revenue growth  through the forecast period (fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017); --Growth initiatives begin gaining traction in fiscal 2016 but have only modest  impact through the forecast period; --Cost reductions and efficiency initiatives support consistent-to-slightly  stronger operating profit margins, despite top-line headwinds and increased  investments in growth markets; --HPI will use FCF for a combination of acquisitions and shareholder returns;  --Total debt for HPI of $6.8 billion. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded if Fitch expects:  --Organic constant currency revenue growth will remain negative beyond the  intermediate term, driven by investments in growth markets failing to offset  secular declines in core markets;  --Profitability will remain closer to mid-single digits, indicating more  significant than anticipated top-line pressures or insufficient restructuring,  resulting in lower annual FCF and pushing total leverage closer to 2x. Positive rating actions are not anticipated in the intermediate term but could  occur if Fitch expects:  --Sustained positive revenue growth, driven by significant penetration in growth  markets, offsetting secular declines in core printing and PC markets;  --HPI will achieve high-single-digit operating profit margin, driving  significantly higher annual FCF and enabling the company to maintain total  leverage below 1.5x. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes HPI's liquidity is strong and supported by: --$4.5 billion of cash and investments, the vast majority of which is located  overseas but is available in the short term via inter-company loans;  --A $4 billion RCF expiring in 2019 that could fully backstop a commercial paper  (CP) program. In addition, more than $1 billion of annual FCF also will support liquidity. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded the following ratings for Hewlett-Packard Company and  assigned Outlooks as indicated: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; assigned a Stable  Outlook --RCF to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; --Senior Unsecured Debt to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the short-term IDR and CP at 'F2'. Fitch has withdrawn the expected ratings for the HP Inc. record, which served as  a placeholder entity until the separation was effected.

A unanimous three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court and said the administrator, Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc, in 2012 ignored the fact that plaintiff Donald Godmar could not work because he was taking morphine, sleeping 20 hours a day and could not drive.

329,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Ingram  Micro, Inc. (Ingram) including its 'BBB-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior  unsecured debt rating. Approximately $1.2 billion of debt Ingram's debt  outstanding as of Oct. 3, 2015 is affected by Fitch's action. The Rating Outlook  remains Stable. A full list of the current rating follows at the end of this  release. Today's affirmation follows Ingram's announcement that it has agreed to merge  with Tianjin Tianhai in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $6  billion. The affirmation was driven by Fitch's expectation that the ownership  change will not result in significant changes to Ingram's capital structure,  financial policies, or operating strategies. Fitch expects that Ingram's new  owners will perpetuate the historically conservative management of Ingram's  credit profile and that the financing put in place by HNA Group (HNA), a Chinese  conglomerate and parent of Tianjin Tianhai, will not require a material call on  the liquidity and cash flow generated by Ingram. The acquisition is part of  Tianjin Tianhai's strategy of investing in supply chain and logistic industries.  HNA has indicated that they will not significantly change Ingram's capital  structure, strategic direction, or management team. HNA has also indicated that  they do not intend to close or integrate facilities, warehouses, or systems.  In accordance with the terms of the transaction, Tianjin Tianhai will acquire  Ingram's outstanding equity interests for $38.90 per share, representing a 39%  premium relative to Ingram's average closing share price during the trailing  thirty day period ended Feb. 16, 2016. The transaction is expected to close in  the second half of 2016, subject to customary regulatory review. Approvals of  both Ingram Micro's and Tianjin Tianhai's stockholders are required to approve  the merger. Both boards have already approved the transaction. In line with the  terms of the transaction Ingram will suspend its dividend and share repurchase  program. Upon closing of the transaction Ingram will become part of the HNA  group and will operate as a subsidiary of Tianjin Tianhai.  Change of control provisions for the revolver and securitization facility would  be triggered; however,  Fitch believes these facilities may be renegotiated with  Ingram's lenders. Fitch acknowledges the heightened event risks related to the  change of control provisions included within Ingram's outstanding senior  unsecured notes. The change of control provision requires a credit rating  downgrade below investment grade.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for stable operating  performance, consistent annual free cash flow (FCF) through the cycle, and solid  credit protection measures. Fitch expects low- to mid-single digit revenue  growth in constant currency over the intermediate term. Ingram's focus on  value-added services for the faster growing small- to medium-size businesses  (SMB) space, including mobility and supply chain solutions, will be key to  accelerating revenue growth. Fitch believes cloud computing growth and data center solutions for the SMB  market will continue to present risks and opportunities, with wholesale cloud  computing and data center solutions adoption by customers potentially shrinking  Ingram Micro's addressable market. At the same time, these trends should  increase complexity, which favor value-added services and wholesale  distributors' wide product and service offerings. Fitch expects operating EBITDA margin will remain thin but expand slightly over  the intermediate term, driven by operating efficiencies and headcount  reductions. Fitch also expects operating EBITDA margin will remain above 1.5%  through the cycle. For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Oct. 3, 2015, Fitch  estimates operating EBITDA margin was 1.69%, versus 1.62% for the comparable  prior year. Fitch expects consistently positive annual FCF through the intermediate term  with fluctuations driven by working capital investments to support growth.  Countercyclical inventory supports cash flow within the context of negative  revenue growth. Fitch does not expect any material change to existing financial policies  (outside of the suspension of dividends and share repurchases) and expects  credit protection measures to remain solid for the rating through the  intermediate term. Total debt adjusted for rental expense to operating EBITDAR  (adjusted leverage) should remain below 3.5x over the intermediate term and was  2.4x for the LTM ended Oct. 3, 2015. Operating EBITDA to gross interest expense  should remain near 10x or better over the intermediate term and was 9.1x for  this LTM period. Ratings strengths include: --Broad customer and geographic diversification; --Scale of operations and  geographic reach gives Ingram a competitive advantage in attracting and  maintaining suppliers; --Leading industry positions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific;  --Importance of wholesale distribution model to both original equipment  manufacturers (OEMs) and value added resellers (VARs). Rating concerns include: --Exposure to the cyclicality of IT demand and general global economic  conditions, including current FX headwinds associated with the company's  presence overseas. --Low-margin and high working capital nature of the wholesale distribution  model, which can lead to volatility in profitability and FCF, although lower  inventory has historically provided a substantial source of liquidity during  cyclical downturns.  --Significant reliance on Hewlett-Packard and Apple as suppliers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: --Ingram's acquisition by HNA does not significantly change Ingram's capital  structure, operating profile, or strategy. --Low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in constant currency, driven by top  line growth for the technology solutions businesses. --Operating EBITDA margin will remain thin but expand slightly over the  intermediate term. --Consistently positive annual FCF through the intermediate term with meaningful  fluctuations driven by significant working capital investments to support  growth. --Ingram will manage borrowings to maintain adjusted leverage below 3.5x over  the intermediate term. --Operating EBITDA to gross interest expense will remain near 10x or better over  the intermediate term. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative  rating action include: --Ingram's new ownership structure results in significant changes to Ingram's  current financial, operating, or strategic profiles; or --Fitch's expectations for adjusted leverage sustained above 3.5x, driven by:  (i) structurally lower operating EBITDA from sustained revenue declines or  competitive pricing; or (ii) negative FCF from lower profitability in  conjunction with diminished working capital efficiency. Fitch does not anticipate positive rating action, given Ingram Micro's low  profitability and significant working capital needs; however, positive rating  actions could result from: (i) expectations for structurally higher FCF of $750  million to $1 billion from sustained revenue growth and modest profit margin  expansion; and (ii) management's commitment to managing borrowings to maintain  adjusted leverage below 2x. LIQUIDITY Liquidity was solid as of Oct. 3, 2015 and consisted primarily of $945 million  in cash and cash equivalents ($463 million in the U.S.), an undrawn $1.5 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility expiring January 2020 and  approximately $675 million of capacity under a North American accounts  receivable securitization program which expires April 2018. Ingram also has  several additional committed and uncommitted receivable financing facilities  which can provide further liquidity.  Ingram's debt primarily consisted of the following as of Oct. 3, 2016: --$300 million of 5.25% senior notes due June 2017; --$300 million of 5% senior notes due June 2022;  --$500 million of 4.95% senior notes due June 2024. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Ingram's ratings as follows: --IDR at 'BBB-';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB-' --Senior unsecured credit facility at 'BBB-'.

330,"   By Alan John Koshy  HP Inc (HPQ.N) said it was accelerating its restructuring program and now expects about 3,000 people will exit by the end of fiscal 2016 instead of over three years as it announced in September.Then, Hewlett-Packard Co had said it expected to cut about 33,300 jobs over three years, of which up to 3,300 were to be cut in HP Inc. It said then that 1,200 people would leave the company by the end of 2016.The restructuring will result in charges and associated cash payments of about $300 million in the current year, the company said.""This move is basically HP Inc embracing the tough pricing environment and shifting their focus to building their portfolio,"" says Shannon Cross, an analyst for Cross Research.HP Inc (HPQ.N), which houses former Hewlett-Packard Co's legacy hardware business, reported a near 12 percent drop in quarterly revenue, as it struggles with weak demand for PCs and printers.Revenue in the company's personal systems business fell 13 percent in the first quarter ended Jan. 31, while it declined 17 percent in its printing division from a year earlier. PC sales have been falling sharply worldwide, and the launch of Windows 10 has so far failed to rekindle demand. Printer demand has been hurt as corporate customers cut printing costs and consumers shift to mobile devices.The company, which is reporting results independently for the first time since being spun off from Hewlett-Packard Co, forecast adjusted profit of 35-40 cents per share for its second quarter ending April 30. Analysts on average were expecting 39 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.HP Inc maintained its 2016 adjusted profit forecast at $1.59-$1.69 per share.The company's earnings from continuing operations fell to $650 million, or 36 cents per share, in the first quarter from $770 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.

375,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for HP Inc.  (HP), including the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at  'BBB+/F2', on HP's acquisition of Samsung's printer business. The Rating Outlook  is Stable. Fitch's action affects $10.8 billion of total debt, including the  undrawn $4 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). A full list of ratings  follows at the end of this release. Fitch expects the acquisition of Samsung's printer business to strengthen HP's  modest position in the A3 copier segment by adding laser print intellectual  property (IP) and engines to HP's product offerings. The deal also adds  Samsung's $1.8 billion of fiscal 2015 revenue, primarily in the A4 segment,  bolstering HP's strong A4 segment leadership. Operating EBITDA was not disclosed  but Fitch believes Samsung's printer business profitability is likely well below  that of HP's, given lower scale.  HP believes there are meaningful cost synergies related to the deal by  leveraging the A4 segment supply chain and elimination of duplicate  non-revenue-generating costs. HP expects $150 million to $200 million of costs  associated with the integration, which will be paid within the first three years  after close. At the same time, Fitch believes integration risks are meaningful,  given potential complexities around cross-border deals. HP will migrate  Samsung's A4 segment products to HP branded products over time, benefitting the  company's relationship with Canon, which provides original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) services for HP's A4 segment products.  HP announced it entered into a definitive agreement to buy Samsung's printer  business for $1.05 billion in cash. Fitch believes HP is likely to use available  cash (the majority of which Fitch believes is located outside the U.S. as of  July 31, 2016) to fund the transaction. In connection with the deal, Samsung has  agreed to buy $100 million to $300 million of HP common stock after the deal  closes. HP expects to close the acquisition within 12 months, subject to  regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.   Fitch expects mixed operating results for HP in the near term with  restructuring-driven profit margin expansion and solid cash flow offsetting  revenue growth below Fitch's expectations at separation from Hewlett Packard  Enterprise. HP's solid third fiscal quarter (3Q16) performance in personal  computers (PCs) may have signalled an inflection point after the Personal  Systems Group (PSG) segment declined by mid-single digits in constant currency  in 1H16. The company and other top providers should continue gaining share in PC  shipments with HP performing particularly well in premium and gaming models.  Constant currency organic revenue declines for the Printing segment should  continue moderating through fiscal 2017, driven by secular headwinds in consumer  printing and excess channel inventory for supplies that caused the company to  recently shift its go-to-market strategy. HP is focusing on profitable growth,  which has contributed to profit margin expansion, and growth markets, including  3D printing, packaging and the A3 segment. The acquisition should enable HP to  address the business market with both laser and proprietary PageWide technology,  providing optimal technologies across departments. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Leading Share Positions: Fitch believes HP's ratings benefit from the  company's market leadership in A4 segment laser and inkjet printing and PCs,  particularly in the U.S. HP's extensive installed base of inkjet printers drives  significant recurring revenue from replacement ink. The company's market  positions also result in significant scale, enabling cost leadership, supporting  research and development (R&D) investments and brand equity, particularly within  consumer markets. --Solid Annual Free Cash Flow (FCF): Fitch expects solid annual FCF of $1.5  billion to $2.5 billion, with potential upside from cash taxes, up from Fitch's  original expectations of more than $1 billion at separation. Greater than  expected profit margin expansion from restructuring, Fitch's expectations for  improved working capital efficiency following the company's inkjet supplies  model shift and HP's capex-light model enabled by OEM printing and EMS PC  relationships will drive solid FCF. -- Secular Demand Headwinds: Fitch expects secular demand headwinds within HP's  core markets will continue pressuring organic revenue growth. Fitch expects the  A4 segment, in which HP is a leader with 30%-35% share, will continue  contracting within the consumer market, while the business market should remain  stable. HP expects higher-margin ink supplies will stabilize by the end of  fiscal 2017. PC unit shipments are expected to continue declining but moderate  (to low- from mid- single digits) through the intermediate term from an aging PC  installed base and HP to benefit from share consolidation. --Significant Offshore Cash Build: Fitch believes HP's significant offshore cash  balances could drive incremental borrowings to fund domestic cash uses and  pressure credit protection measures. HP has committed to returning to  shareholders pre-dividend FCF not used for acquisitions. Given Fitch's estimate  that HP generates the vast majority of FCF outside the U.S., the company  continues relying upon various strategies to access foreign cash, which could  include repatriation, to support shareholder returns. Should HP exhaust  tax-efficient strategies to access foreign cash, the company would need to  curtail shareholder returns or borrow to maintain its current pace of stock  buybacks.  --Reasonably Conservative Credit Metrics: The aforementioned potential financial  policies adjustments notwithstanding, Fitch expects HP to manage debt levels to  maintain reasonably conservative credit protection measures. Specifically, Fitch  expects total leverage (total debt/operating EBITDA) below 1.5x through the  intermediate term, although Fitch's negative rating sensitivity provides  headroom up to 2x. Fitch estimates total leverage was approximately 1.3x for the  latest-12-months (LTM) ended July 31, 2016. --Significant Revenue Diversification: Fitch expects HP's significant and  well-diversified installed base and addressable markets reduces operating  volatility, despite formidable demand headwinds in core markets and exposure to  cyclical demand patterns. The company's initiatives in the A3 segment for  business customers could add modest volatility, given business customers' uneven  spending patterns. However, the company continues to have a healthy mix of  consumer and commercial customers, a variety of products across core end  markets, and significant sales outside the U.S. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for HP include: --Constant currency organic revenue growth of 3% in fiscal 2016, driven by  continued but moderating headwinds in printing and stabilizing PC demand; --Positive constant currency organic revenue growth by the end of fiscal 2017  and the continuation of positive constant currency organic growth through the  intermediate term, driven by stabilizing PC shipments, healthier channel  inventory for inkjet supplies and expansion into A3 segment, 3D printing and  graphics;  --Operating EBITDA margins expanding into the double digits, driven by  restructuring actions and a focus on profitable growth; --Relatively consistent debt levels, given total leverage is already approaching  HP's articulated 1.5x target; and --FCF used for acquisitions and shareholder returns, supported by ongoing access  to offshore cash. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded if Fitch expects: --Negative constant currency organic revenue growth beyond the near term, likely  from share losses in the A4 printing segment, weaker than expected PC shipments,  extended ink supplies inventory glut or lack of traction in the A3 segment;  --Total leverage above 2x, likely from incremental borrowing to support ongoing  shareholder returns, given the majority of FCF is offshore. The ratings are unlikely to be upgraded in the absence of Fitch's expectations  for: --Sustained positive revenue growth, driven by significant penetration in growth  markets, offsetting secular declines in core printing and PC markets;  --HP will sustain operating EBITDA margins in the mid-teens, driving  significantly higher annual FCF and enabling the company to lower the total  leverage target closer to 1x. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes HP's liquidity is sufficient as of July 31, 2016 and supported  by:  --$5.6 billion of cash and investments, the vast majority of which Fitch  believes is located outside the U.S.;  --An undrawn $4 billion RCF that fully backstops commercial paper (CP) programs  in the U.S. and Europe. Fitch's expectation for $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity, although Fitch estimates a significant majority of cash flow is  offshore.  Total debt was $6.8 billion at July 31, 2016 composed of senior unsecured debt  with staggered debt maturities. Fitch affirms the following: HP Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --CP Rating at 'F2.

382,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Wednesday unveiled its first-ever desktop computer and a free update to its Windows operating system that allows edits using 3D simulations, in hopes of reinvigorating its computing business.The Windows 10 Creators Update, coming in early 2017, lets mobile devices scan an object on all sides so it can rotate 360 degrees in a photograph. It also allows for three-dimensional graphics in Microsoft's popular PowerPoint presentation software, and a new ""Paint 3D"" application allows edits in 3D simulations.Sales for Microsoft's computing business have declined since 2015. With the new features, Microsoft is hoping to stand out from the pack and win over creative types who have long preferred products from rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O).""Microsoft has its work cut out in trying to convince potential customers that its products are more than just the workhorses they've always been for many,"" analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research said in a note. ""That won't change overnight.""Microsoft shares closed 0.6 percent lower at $60.63.The technology company's desktop computer, the Surface Studio, has a touch-screen monitor that can lie flat and be drawn on with a stylus. Microsoft also said it would introduce a new Surface Book laptop whose battery life is 30 percent longer at 16 hours. At $2,999 and up, the Surface Studio will be ""out of reach for the vast majority of consumers,"" Dawson said.The upgrade, for Windows 10 only, has limits as well. While more than 400 million devices run on Windows 10, far more computers still have Windows 7 installed, according to data from NetMarketShare. That means the majority of users will not see any changes.Nonetheless, analysts said the upgrade puts Microsoft at the forefront of mass-market 3D technology, with the potential to please average users and intensive gamers alike. ""Microsoft is getting ahead of the curve,"" Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. ""Their marketing efforts to illustrate the 3D ability seems to be ahead of Apple's.""Apple has scheduled an event on Thursday where it is expected to unveil updated Mac computers.Microsoft's update targets gamers in particular, who are keen on using new virtual reality headsets and have been turned on to augmented reality games since the July launch of hit mobile app Pokemon Go. Business partners HP, Lenovo, Dell and others will introduce virtual reality headsets, starting at $299, that work with the new Windows 10, Microsoft said.""We are building Windows for each of us (and enabling) people to experience computing in new ways,"" Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at a New York event to launch the new products.Revenue for the Windows and computing unit fell 1.8 percent last quarter to $9.29 billion, Microsoft said on Thursday. It forecast division sales of as much as $11.6 billion for this quarter, well below year-earlier results of $12.7 billion.Nonetheless, Microsoft is riding high on its fast-growing cloud business, which companies can use to host their websites, apps or data. Shares of Microsoft have doubled since August 2013, with Nadella restoring investor confidence by focusing on mobile and cloud computing rather than PCs.
