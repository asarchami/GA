0,"  LONDON Feb 20 New rules for European sovereign credit ratings are set for some early tweaking after Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch left investors baffled about how they time their announcements.The 'big three' have taken differing approaches to guidelines that mean sovereign rating dates are now laid out in an annual calendar.Decisions must be announced on a Friday, but S&P has already ventured off-schedule twice, while Moody's has confused bond buyers by not publishing anything on some of its planned dates.The greater clarity on the dates of reviews has been widely welcomed but in practice the timings of announcements have varied widely.""It is a bit inconsistent, the way the different agencies are interpreting the new rules,"" Gerard Moerman, Head of Rates & Money Markets at Aegon, one of Europe's big bond funds, said.""If something is on the agenda they should at least confirm the rating and publish a few comments explaining why. I'm fine with the agenda, but they should stick to it.""The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), Europe's watchdog in charge of the new rules, said such changes often take a bit of getting used and can be worked on. ESMA told Reuters it was ""monitoring how the new regime is working in practice, and will consider further clarification on practicalities as needed.""As part of that monitoring process it is expected to look at the reasons given by agencies for off-schedule rating changes. It could also peer at why S&P might publish as early as 5 in the morning in Europe and Moody's just before midnight, or not at all.It has the power to raid and fine agencies or even take away rating licenses if it feels they have deliberately broken the rules. One of the easiest options to bring them into line, however, is with 'question and answer' documents that give a tighter steer on how the rules should work in practice.ON THE BALL  ESMA is due to publish an annual credit rating supervision report on Friday although it is not expected to include any fresh guidance on the calendar issues.Alan Reid, managing director for Europe at number four rating agency DBRS, was critical of the lack of communication from the supervisor in the run up to January's introduction of the new rules.His firm was the first to set out its rating dates in mid-December but he said he heard almost nothing beforehand to say what was expected. ""In the end we just decided to publish our dates,"" he added.While there has also been confusion that Moody's has opted to schedule three reviews for each country whereas others have stuck to the required two, investors and ESMA are keen for agencies not to be constrained by the new schedules.S&P has gone off plan for both Ukraine and Turkey so far as growing political turmoil threatens to undermine their economies.""The criticism the industry had was that during the euro crisis the rating agencies were way behind in, for instance, downgrading some periphery countries,"" said Aegon's Moerman.  ""We want them to be on the ball.""",2014-02-20,MCO,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 9:57am EST",Rating agencies keep investors guessing on European timings,http://www.reuters.com//article/ratings-esma-idUSL5N0LI3XR20140220?type=companyNews
1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has revised the Rating Outlook on Dun &  Bradstreet Corporation (DNB) to Negative from Stable and affirmed the Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release.  Fitch's action follows DNB's announcement that it intends to acquire Dun &  Bradstreet Credibility Corporation (DBCC) for approximately $320 million in  cash.  The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2015  and is subject to certain regulatory approvals. The Negative Outlook reflects  Fitch's expectation that the company's credit metrics will remain elevated and  outside the thresholds for a 'BBB' rating longer than anticipated due to the  incremental debt that would be issued to fund the DBCC acquisition.  Fitch  expects pro forma leverage to be at approximately 3.5x by the end of 2015 and  leverage to approach 3x by the end of 2016. The DBCC announcement follows the  $125 million acquisition of NetProspex, announced in January 2015, and  incremental operating investments which are expected to continue in order to  drive top-line growth as part of DNB's long-term sustainable growth strategy.  Fitch believes the acquisitions of DBCC and NetProspex are in line with the  company's stated strategy to target acquisitions that can improve DNB's  operational capabilities and accelerate revenue growth. Specifically, the  acquisitions of DBCC offers DNB access to management expertise and a platform to  address the declines experienced within its small business channel.  Fitch continues to believe that DNB can successfully execute its investment  strategy and improve its operating performance over the next two to three years.  However, Fitch notes there is limited capacity within the current ratings for  operational missteps in light of the additional debt and de-levering delays back  to Fitch's target leverage of 3x. Fitch notes that DNB has solid free cash flow (FCF) generation ($197.6 million  after dividends for the year ended December 2014), strong EBITDA margins (above  30%), and levers that provide DNB with the ability to pay down debt. Management  is committed to an investment grade rating and Fitch believes DNB will  prioritize debt repayments in order to de-lever.  In 2010, Dun & Bradstreet divested their Self-Awareness Solutions business to  DBCC, formed by private equity firm Great Hill Partners and senior management,  and entered into a data license partnership.  As a part of the transaction, DBCC  was granted a license to use D&B's brand specifically for the 'credit-on-self'  solution (under a royalty arrangement), which allowed small- and medium-sized  businesses in North America to manage and build their own credit.  DNB retained  the core and widely used 'credit-on-others' DNBi business. DBCC has since been  able to turn around the operation and successfully grow a customer base of small  businesses. The acquisition could potentially remove the drag on DNB's  small-business channel. The acquisition also brings the management team at DBCC  under DNB. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Solid Competitive Position: The ratings are supported by DNB's ability to  consistently generate strong FCF, high barriers to entry related to its  database, and the company's ability to leverage its database into multiple  revenue-generating products. --Ability to De-lever: While leverage will remain elevated, Fitch believes  management will prioritize debt payment in order to de-lever back to 3x  leverage. Fitch believes that DNB's FCF generation provides the company with the  ability to pay down debt barring materially leveraging transactions including  acquisitions and share buybacks.  --Investment Initiatives: Fitch believes that management is focused on returning  DNB to low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth, supported by operational  investments. The investment in products and services (mostly personnel) will  predominately be a recurring addition to operating expenses. In 2014, $80  million in investment was allocated towards improving content, modernizing  delivery, and globalizing the salesforce. The company has initiated cost  reduction actions designed to offset about half of these investments. This  investment initiative is reflected in Fitch's revenue, EBITDA and FCF  expectations. --Limited Revenue Diversification: More than 60% of total revenue is from DNB's  Risk Management Solutions (RMS) division. The ratings incorporate the pressures  in North America's RMS, specifically the DNBi Subscription product  (approximately 58% of North America's RMS or 33% of total revenues), which  reported a 4% decline in 2014 due to a carry-over from lower sales in prior  quarters and competition from low-cost alternatives. --Debt-Funded Share Repurchases: Fitch does not anticipate material debt-funded  buybacks in 2015 outside of purchases to counter the dilutive effect of shares  issued under the company's stock incentive plans and employee stock purchase,  and also until leverage reaches 3x. There is currently a $100 million share  repurchase program in place that can be used for this purpose. --China Investigation: Ratings reflect the ongoing investigation associated with  Shanghai Roadway DNB Marketing Services' (Roadway; which has been shut down)  potential violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Currently,  the timing and potential fines related to these investigations are unknown.  Given the relatively nominal size of the operations, Fitch believes any fines  would be manageable within the company's consolidated credit profile. LIQUIDITY PROFILE DNB has adequate liquidity, supported by approximately $396 million of  availability under its $1 billion credit facility due 2019 (reduced by $604.5  million in borrowings) and $319.4 million in cash ($312.6 million held outside  of the U.S.), as of Dec. 31, 2014. The company's maturity schedule is manageable  and consists of $300 million in senior notes due November 2015, $450 million in  senior notes due 2017, a $604.5 million revolver balance due 2019, and $300  million in senior notes due 2022. Fitch expects DNB to have sufficient liquidity  and access to the capital markets to meet all debt maturities.  The company's 2014 FCF (after dividends) was $197.6 million, with a solid  FCF?to-debt ratio of 12%. Fitch expects annual FCF (after dividends) to be  approximately $200 million to $250 million in 2015 and 2016.  DNB's total pension plans were underfunded by $576.5 million on a pre-tax basis  at year-end 2014, under U.S. GAAP calculations. Roughly 70% of the pension  obligation is related to the U.S. qualified plan, which is $262.1 million  underfunded on a pre-tax basis at year-end 2014, and which was frozen in 2007.  Fitch believes the company will have sufficient liquidity to handle its funding  obligations in accordance with the Pension Protection Act, which is reflected in  Fitch's FCF expectations. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case include: --Mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2015 (includes growth from acquisition) and  then improving growth in the low-single digit range. --Margin pressures in near term due to investment initiatives as well as lower  margins from acquired operations. --Fitch expects pressure on DNBi to persist offset by growth in Other Enterprise  Risk Management (subgroup of RMS) and the Sales and Marketing Solutions segment. --Modeled share buyback activities to address dilution in the short term with  prioritization for de-levering. --Maturing $300 million in senior notes due 2015 are expected to be refinanced. RATING SENSITIVITIES Given the Negative Outlook, Fitch does not expect a positive rating action  during the rating horizon. The Outlook could be stabilized as the company  demonstrates progress in reducing leverage to 3x by the year end of 2016 along  with traction in the company's turnaround of its RMS business (evidenced by  improved revenue and EBITDA margin performance). The ratings may be downgraded if Fitch believes leverage will be sustained above  3x and/or if the company is unable to demonstrate traction in its revenue  turnaround. Also, a change in financial policy indicating more aggressive  shareholder returns that would drive leverage beyond 3x would pressure the  ratings. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: --IDR at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Bank credit facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'. --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.

2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published Moody's Corporation's  (MCO) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (LT IDR) and specific senior unsecured  issue ratings of 'BBB+', and its Short-Term (ST) IDR of 'F2'. In addition, Fitch  has published a first-time 'F2' rating of MCO's commercial paper (CP) program.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. See the complete list of ratings at the end of  this release. As of June 30, 2016, Moody's had approximately $3.4 billion of  debt outstanding. The notes outstanding under MCO's $1 billion CP program will rank pari passu  with MCO's other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness. Proceeds from  borrowings under the CP program are expected to be used for general corporate  purposes. Moody's $1 billion revolver, expiring May 2020, provides liquidity  back-up to the CP program.  KEY RATING DRIVERS High Barriers to Entry: MCO's rating segment (Moody's Investors Service)  operates with limited competitive threats as a leading Credit Rating Agency  (CRA) with a meaningful and defensible share of the global ratings business. The  global scale, significant infrastructure required to comply with increasing  regulation standards and long history of investor acceptance serve as  impediments to new entrants. Fitch notes that brand, reputation, and existing  coverage are self-reinforcing and generally a prerequisite to win new  businesses, creating challenges for other CRAs outside the largest three  agencies, competing at the regional geographic and niche product levels. Entrenched Role of NRSROs: Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating  Organizations' (NRSRO) ratings are codified within a number of federal and state  regulations and statutes and are a critical element for asset managers and  financial institutions to meet a variety of legal and regulatory requirements.  Dodd Frank removes references to NRSROs in certain regulations in order to  reduce the reliance and the required use of NRSROs' credit ratings. However,  Fitch believes financial market participants will continue to rely on credit  ratings given the absence of viable alternatives. Fitch also believes NRSROs  will remain favored by investors compared to unregistered agencies given the  more stringent oversight and compliance necessary to meet NRSRO requirements. Diversification: Fitch notes that MCO's MIS segment is dependent on both dollar  volume and number of ratable debt issues, which tend to be closely linked to the  health of the major economies as well as government fiscal and monetary  policies. MIS generates recurring contractual annual fees to monitor existing  ratings, mitigating the more volatile fees from new issuance. As of year-end  2015, approximately 39% of MIS's reported revenue was recurring. Fitch also  notes MCO's analytics segment (MA) accounts for more than 15% of MCO's operating  income with more than 70% of MA's sales comprised of recurring revenue in 2015.  Conservative Leverage: MCO continues to target solid investment-grade ratings  and historically has maintained Fitch-calculated unadjusted gross leverage  around 2x. As of the LTM period ended June 30, 2016, Fitch-calculated leverage  was 2.1x and Fitch expects no material change at the end of 2016 barring  material acquisitions. FCF margin (after dividends) and FCF-to-debt of 20.3% and  20.5%, respectively, are strong for a 'BBB+' rating. There is flexibility to  exceed the 2.5x target within the current rating to accommodate potential  strategic M&A activity, as Fitch believes MCO can delever within 12-18 months  given its good FCF margin. While EBITDA margin and FCF generation could support  slightly more leverage at the current rating, the regulatory and litigation  event risk (discussed below) weighs upon the rating's leverage tolerance.  Share Repurchase and Dividends Growing: Management expects to complete  approximately $1 billion in share repurchases in 2016. Dividends have  consistently grown at a five-year CAGR of 26% through 2015. Absent large  acquisition activity, Fitch expects FCF will continue to be dedicated toward  shareholder returns. In addition, Fitch believes management will issue debt to  support its capital allocation strategy to the extent leverage remains within  the 2x-2.5x range.  Regulatory and Litigation Uncertainty: The ratings recognize several potential  overhangs on MCO's credit profile, namely regulatory and litigation-related  uncertainties. Fitch believes MCO carries a meaningful level of liquidity,  providing financial flexibility to address regulatory and/or litigation risk. In  addition, given the time it takes for legal and regulatory matters to be  processed (cases can take years before a settlement may be reached), MCO can  preserve additional liquidity if it believes a case may result in a material  cash payment. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Moody's include: --Low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth; --Stable EBITDA margins; --Base case assumes that shareholder returns continue in the form of share  repurchases and dividends. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Given the regulatory and litigation risk overhang, Fitch does not  expect any positive near-term rating momentum. Fitch would consider an upgrade  in the absence of material litigation or regulatory overhang, diversification  increasing from MA's subscription revenue growth, and a stated commitment to a  leverage target below 1.75x.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --Acceleration of regulatory and litigation-related event risks combined with  material operating or financial metric deterioration; --Any debt financing transaction that drove unadjusted gross leverage over 2.5x,  without the expectation of delevering below 2.5x within 12 to 18 months.  LIQUIDITY Moody's liquidity is strong and supported by $427 million of readily available  cash and short-term investments as of June 30, 2016, $1 billion in revolving  credit facilities (all of which was available as of June 30, 2016) and expected  FCF generation. MCO's revolver, which provides liquidity backup to its $1  billion CP program, matures in May 2020. Scheduled maturities are well-laddered  and manageable considering that expected FCF generation, reliable market access  and backup liquidity all add to Moody's overall financial flexibility. Moody's  next scheduled maturity is not until 2017 when $300 million of unsecured notes  come due.
