0,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Jan 13 If the stock market rally continues, last year's laggards may be this year's winners.Many of the sectors that could do well are late bloomers in the five-year bull run. They may not seem like obvious choices, yet are worthwhile if you're contrarian or slightly defensive.Assuming economic fundamentals and corporate earnings remain solid, it could be a decent year for stocks overall and even better for companies that were neglected in 2013.""I'm optimistic,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial in Chicago, who predicts three-percent GDP growth and the creation of up to three million jobs this year.""I haven't felt bullish in a long time,"" Swonk said at the annual economic outlook luncheon of the Executive Club of Chicago on Jan. 9.REAL ESTATE REBOUND A surge in institutional buying came in 2012 among homebuilding stocks. But last year, Wall Street moved on and real estate underperformed every sector in the S&P 500 except for basic materials, rising just 6 percent for the year through Jan. 10, according to Morningstar.This year could be different if the economy continues to create more jobs and spur long-term demand for all kinds of real estate, from single-family homes to commercial storage units. The most recent Case-Shiller Home Price index report showed U.S. home prices posting their strongest annualized gain in seven years. There's still much pent-up demand for homes and commercial properties. With mortgage rates expected to remain relatively low, the real estate sector still has some promise.Exchange-traded funds that invest in real estate investment trusts are a worthy consideration, especially if you are looking for extra yield.Consider the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF, which holds developers and property managers like Simon Property Group Inc, American Tower Corp and Public Storage . The fund was up only 1 percent last year, but yields nearly 4 percent. It charges 0.46 percent for annual expenses.MATERIALS MAKE SENSE  The materials sector was the most unloved group among the Standard & Poor's industry sectors last year, gaining less than 3 percent for the year through Jan. 10.  A highly-cyclical basket of metals, chemical, mining and paper stocks, this cadre tends to do best during mature economic cycles.But laggards can become leaders if U.S. economic growth - pegged at more than four percent in the 3rd quarter - continues.The Materials Select Sector SPDR owns stocks like Monsanto, Dow Chemical Co and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold. The SPDR charges 0.18 percent for annual management expenses and outperformed the materials sector as a whole, gaining 26 percent last year.ENERGY SURGE  Energy was another lackluster sector last year, returning a modest 10 percent for the year ending Jan. 10, compared to the best-performing technology group, which gained 56 percent. Improving demand for energy globally bodes well for companies that produce oil and natural gas, though.The Vanguard Energy ETF owns leading producers and service companies such as ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp  and Schlumberger NV. The fund charges 0.14 percent for annual expenses and returned 26 percent last year.UTILITIES STILL DEFENSIVE Companies that produce or distribute power, natural gas and water seldom light up any investor's radar screen during bull rallies. These high-dividend companies only become alluring when investors retreat from the most popular sector of the moment or there's widespread uncertainty.Since the bull rally will fizzle at some point, it's always good to have a fallback. Utilities fit that bill. Although these companies were firmly in the bottom tier last year, they could rebound if the market runs into trouble.Consider an ETF such as the iShares U.S. Utilities, which holds blue chips such as Duke Energy Corp, Dominion Resources and Exelon Corp. The fund returned almost 15 percent last year and yields about 3 percent with a 0.46 percent annual expense ratio.Feeling skittish about picking a lackluster U.S. sector and hoping it rebounds? A wiser choice would be to spread your portfolio among every sector through a broad-based world stock fund such as the iShares MSCI ACWI Index ETF, which holds the biggest stocks from around the world such as Apple , Nestle SA and General Electric Co. The fund rose 22 percent last year and charges 0.34 percent for annual expenses.",2014-01-13,DOW,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 2:52pm EST",COLUMN-Will last year's stock market laggards be 2014's winners?,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-wasik-laggards-idUSL2N0KN1K720140113?type=companyNews

In November, Loeb disclosed a $1 billion bet on Softbank, the parent company of Sprint. ""More recently, Sprint has surfaced as a source of meaningful upside potential in the context of a rumored merger proposal for T-Mobile,"" Loeb wrote in the letter.Loeb said gains last year, when his flagship fund rose 25.2 percent, were largely driven by technology, media and telecommunications stocks, adding that he expects to see more gains this year in his current core investments: Softbank, Sony and T-Mobile. Investment positions at Loeb's $14 billion Third Point are closely watched, in part because he is known for his frank talk to the corporate world and a history of shaking up management, as he did at Yahoo.Improving global economic conditions, for example, should also help and Loeb sounded a more optimistic note on earnings, saying, ""We expect earnings to rise modestly and the economy overall to surprise to the upside,"" compared with Wall Street's more pessimistic forecasts. Loeb, who made a big bet on Japan last year, said the ""Japan portfolio"" disappointed later in the year because Sony underperformed. But he said he remains optimistic for this year, noting that he expects Japan to be a ""high-beta trade.""Loeb also said that he added shares of biotechnology company Intrexon Corp, where the fund first invested in a private funding round in 2011; that company went public in August. ""Most attractive to us is Intrexon's potential to transform multiple industries, including the health, food, and energy markets,"" he wrote.The fund also owns a stake in Ally Financial, noting that it is confident of Chief Executive Mike Carpenter's ability to guide the company through a restructuring.",2014-01-21,DOW,"Tue Jan 21, 2014 | 12:07pm EST",Loeb's Third Point likes T-Mobile in addition to Dow -letter,http://www.reuters.com//article/hedgefunds-loeb-idUSL2N0KV0ZD20140121?type=companyNews

That means the Dow investment exceeds $1 billion, the amount he paid for a stake in Japan's SoftBank Corp (9984.T), announced last November.

The business is expected to benefit in the current quarter as farmers buy seeds ahead of the planting season. Margins are expected to expand by 3-4 percentage points in the near term.Margins rose 7 percentage points in the fourth quarter at the performance plastics unit, which supplies plastics to toy makers, builders and car makers among other industries.The business has reported four straight quarters of margin expansion and is the company's biggest, accounting for more than a fourth of total sales in the quarter.The business, along with the performance materials and feedstocks-and-energy units, is part of the company's petrochemical businesses which Loeb wants to be spun off.Dow Chemical expects a recent run up in natural gas prices to eat into margins at its performance plastics and performance materials units in the first quarter, but remains poised to benefit from an abundant supply of gas in the United States.

Dow Chemical depends on its commoditized raw materials businesses to keep costs down at its high-growth specialty chemicals businesses - a strategy that some analysts said was working, as was evident from the strong fourth-quarter results.""As long as earnings estimates and the stock are going higher, I think Andrew has people's support,"" UBS analyst John Roberts said.DuPont, the target of billionaire Nelson Peltz, on Tuesday said it would buy back $5 billion in stock after reporting quarterly profit above market estimates, helped by early seed shipments and strong insecticide demand.Investor activism is speeding up restructuring in the chemical industry, said Dhaval Patel, a managing director at North American fund TIAA-CREF, which oversees about $564 billion in assets, and holds Dow Chemical shares.""You are seeing companies take the right steps, whether it is increasing dividend, buybacks, selling non-strategic assets or acquiring assets in areas that are more exciting or interesting."" SEEDS OF GROWTH Dow Chemical's agriculture business has been its fastest growing business in fiscal 2013 and Liveris expects the value of the unit to double over the next 5 to 7 years.Sales at the business rose 13 percent in the fourth quarter and contributed 12 percent of total revenue, driven by demand for insecticides and herbicides in North and Latin America.The business is expected to benefit in the current quarter as farmers buy seeds ahead of the planting season. Margins are expected to expand by 3-4 percentage points in the near term.Margins rose 7 percentage points in the fourth quarter at the performance plastics unit, which supplies plastics to toy makers, builders and car makers among other industries. The business has reported four straight quarters of margin expansion and is the company's biggest, accounting for more than a fourth of total sales in the quarter.The business, along with the performance materials and feedstocks-and-energy units, is part of the company's petrochemical businesses which Loeb wants to be spun off.Dow Chemical expects a recent run up in natural gas prices to eat into margins at its performance plastics and performance materials units in the first quarter, but remains poised to benefit from an abundant supply of gas in the United States.The company increased its buyback from $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion, all of which it will buy back this year.Dow Chemical, which has paid quarterly dividends since 1912, raised its first-quarter dividend by 15 percent to 37 cents per share.Net income available for common stockholders was $963 million, or 79 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31.Dow Chemical posted a loss of $716 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier due to a $990 million charge related to job cuts, plant closures and write down of the value of its lithium-ion battery business.Adjusted profit was 65 cents per share in the latest quarter, beating the analysts' average estimate of 43 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 3 percent to $14.39 billion.Dow Chemical shares were up 3.6 percent at $44.64 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

South Africa's central bank raised interest rates for the first time in six years. This followed a dramatic rate hike by Turkey's central bank, designed to defend its crumbling currency.But the euphoria that followed Turkey's move faded, with European indexes falling into negative territory and Wall Street slipping in morning trading.""Our markets are so linked together that if something pulls a trigger, it's like a domino effect.

23,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Emily Flitter | BOSTON/NEW YORK  BOSTON/NEW YORK Feb 6 In the past, billionaire investor Daniel Loeb would often wait for an industry conference before revealing his investment ideas. Not anymore.The hedge fund manager and some other prominent investors have now turned to Harvest Exchange, a new website designed for investors, to release news of their big bets. Such announcements -- including Loeb's bet on Dow Chemicals and Kyle Bass' bet on General Motors -- often lead to big swings in share prices as other investors pile on.Peter Hans, one of the founders of Harvest Exchange (HVST.com), said he hopes the platform can help bring into the open information and ideas that have traditionally circulated in private circles of elite investors.It's too early to tell whether Harvest, which launched only in December, will accomplish that goal or merely end up becoming yet another platform - along with a myriad of traditional and newer business news sites - where investors can talk up their books, often anonymously.Hans, 35, and co-founder Andrew Parmentier, 39, tapped contacts they amassed during their years on Wall Street as professional money managers and invited them to post on the website. The site's third founder is Michael Perrone, 37, a web designer who had previously managed Oprah Winfrey's Oprah.com website.They launched their site at a time when new regulations are making it easier for once super-secretive hedge funds to say  more about how they make money. The site's founders, friends of  both Loeb and Bass, approached them and requested they post on it. Bass, who manages the $2 billion hedge fund Hayman Capital Management, which gained prominence with a bet against the Japanese yen and the overheated subprime market, went public on the Harvest website with his bet on General Motors Co. Over the next week, GM's stock rose 4 percent.Last month, Loeb published a post on Harvest about Third Point's stake in Dow Chemical Co shortly after telling his clients about it by letter. Dow Chemical's stock rose 8 percent because of the activist investor's interest, sending many investors scrambling to the website to find his presentation about the investment.Loeb declined to comment. Bass said in an interview that he is preparing to post on the site again soon to talk about his views on Argentina. Despite Argentina's current troubles, he sees value in the country and expects Argentine bonds to trade higher in the coming years.""There is ownership of the ideas here, and the idea is to invite discourse by giving ideas an open airing,"" Bass said.He added that the site's following will likely be so broad that it can ""be a place to publicize stock ideas that appeal to people like your mother, as well as a place to discuss complicated global macro trends."" Thanks to postings by Bass and Loeb, the site has reached 10,000 members. Khai Nguyen, who runs Harvest's business development operations, called it the ""Loeb effect,"" according to an email seen by Reuters.Registration for the site is free, and Hans said the firm has not yet settled on a way to monetize it. As for making money from investment ideas posted on the site, Hans said:""There are investment perspectives on Harvest that are worthy of doing more research on and acting on, and that is how I typically conduct my own investments.""In recent years, other widely followed investors such as  billionaire activist Carl Icahn and PIMCO's Bill Gross have been experimenting with blogs and Twitter.Harvest Exchange lets users publish posts in a similar format, but it is tailored for investors.""It allows you to say more than on Twitter, but you don't have to present a full white paper,"" said fund manager Travis Cocke, whose $17 million Voss Capital posted its year-end investment performance letter on the site.",2014-02-06,DOW,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 5:48pm EST",'Loeb effect' buoys social media site for investors,http://www.reuters.com//article/hedgefunds-harvestexchange-idUSL2N0LB0YN20140206?type=companyNews
24,"  Dow Chemical Co's ""lack of transparency"" makes it difficult to determine whether the petrochemical giant should be split up or kept together, hedge fund titan Daniel Loeb said on Wednesday.The harsh words escalate the tension between the largest U.S. chemical maker and Loeb, operator of the $14 billion Third Point hedge fund.Loeb, who last month said Dow Chemical had become the largest equity investment held by Third Point and urged the company to spin off its lucrative but slow-growing petrochemical unit and focus on specialty materials, issued the remarks a day after Dow Chemical said an internal review found breaking up the company would not help shareholders.By digging in its heels, Dow Chemical wants to show it doesn't plan to give in easily to Loeb's demands the way that Yahoo! Inc and other companies have in the past.Loeb's foray against Dow Chemical marks the third time in less than a year that he has demanded changes at a major global company, including asking Sony to separate its entertainment division and demanding that Sotheby's find a new chief executive officer.Dow Chemical's CEO, Andrew Liveris, dismissed the breakup idea almost as soon as Loeb announced the idea to investors while at last month's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Both Liveris and Loeb attended the forum, though they reportedly did not meet.The Midland, Michigan-based company, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday night, disclosed the findings of the internal review. The company said that a breakup could actually hurt shareholders by hindering its ability to buy supplies in bulk and share scientific research.Dow Chemical's attempt to remake itself as a ""vertically integrated science company"" remains ""the right strategy to maximize value for all of our shareholders in the short and long term,"" executives said in the filing.Third Point on Wednesday took umbrage, saying in a statement to Reuters in response to questions about the filing that Dow Chemical's ""lack of transparency"" makes it difficult to determine how its decision was reached. The hedge fund said it was prepared to sign a non-disclosure agreement with Dow Chemical in order to review the company's records and arrive at its own conclusion.""Transparency is essential considering Dow's undistinguished track record of capital allocation decisions,"" Third Point said.Dow Chemical declined to comment, saying that it had nothing to add beyond its regulatory filing. Loeb has not disclosed the size of his stake in Dow Chemical. Loeb had said in a letter to investors, which was seen by Reuters, that Dow Chemical is now his largest investment. That indicates the investment exceeds $1 billion, the amount he paid for a stake in Japan's SoftBank Corp, announced last November.Shares of Dow Chemical fell 1 percent to close Wednesday at$46.37. Loeb's Third Point ranked as one of the hedge fund industry's best performers last year. But Loeb started this year on a down note with his fund off 1.8 percent.(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder and Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-02-12,DOW,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 4:50pm EST",Loeb's Third Point blasts Dow Chemical 'lack of transparency',http://www.reuters.com//article/us-dowchemical-thirdpoint-idUSBREA1B23920140212?type=companyNews

The Midland, Michigan-based company, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday night, disclosed the findings of the internal review.The company said that a breakup could actually hurt shareholders by hindering its ability to buy supplies in bulk and share scientific research.Dow Chemical's attempt to remake itself as a ""vertically integrated science company"" remains ""the right strategy to maximize value for all of our shareholders in the short and long term,"" executives said in the filing. Third Point on Wednesday took umbrage, saying in a statement to Reuters in response to questions about the filing that Dow Chemical's ""lack of transparency"" makes it difficult to determine how its decision was reached.The hedge fund said it was prepared to sign a non-disclosure agreement with Dow Chemical in order to review the company's records and arrive at its own conclusion. ""Transparency is essential considering Dow's undistinguished track record of capital allocation decisions,"" Third Point said.Dow Chemical declined to comment, saying that it had nothing to add beyond its regulatory filing.Loeb has not disclosed the size of his stake in Dow Chemical. Loeb had said in a letter to investors, which was seen by Reuters, that Dow Chemical is now his largest investment. That indicates the investment exceeds $1 billion, the amount he paid for a stake in Japan's SoftBank Corp, announced last November.Shares of Dow Chemical fell 1 percent to close Wednesday at $46.37.Loeb's Third Point ranked as one of the hedge fund industry's best performers last year.

The German firm did not specify on Tuesday what it meant by a slight increase in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). But analysts had on average forecast a gain of almost 10 percent, and BASF shares fell more than 1.5 percent.""It seems that the company does not want to become too positive, too early,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Markus Mayer, who also pointed to lower-than-expected earnings at some of BASF's speciality chemicals businesses. The German group's fourth-quarter EBIT, adjusted for one-off items, rose 18 percent to 1.45 billion euros ($1.99 billion), beating the 1.38 billion euro average estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts, helped by strong margins at its oil and gas as well as its basic petrochemicals divisions.""In the Asian emerging markets and in Eastern Europe, we forecast a significant increase in automotive production,"" the maker of catalytic converters, insulation foam and coatings said.Demand from consumer goods makers in Japan and the United States and from the electronics industry would also shore up earnings in a generally challenging economic backdrop, it added. BASF's largest U.S. rivals, Dow Chemical Co and DuPont, last month sought to boost shareholder value with share buyback programmes after posting forecast-beating quarterly earnings.But BASF, which spent about 10 billion euros on its own stock between 1999 and 2008, reiterated it would focus on expanding and upgrading its network of plants.At 1030 GMT, its shares were down 1.6 percent at 81.92 euros, worse than the 0.4 percent decline of the STOXX Europe 600 Chemicals index.",2014-02-25,DOW,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 5:54am EST",UPDATE 2-BASF sees car and consumer industries nudging profit higher,http://www.reuters.com//article/basf-results-idUSL6N0LU0FD20140225?type=companyNews

For 2013, sales totaled $7.1 billion.One key to Dow's rise in the agriculture seed and chemical kingdom is the company's new GMO seed and herbicide combination branded the ""Enlist Weed Control System."" U.S. regulators have indicated they are poised to grant needed approvals, and after more than two years of scrutiny, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's final public comment period closes on Tuesday.""Enlist is the most important release we've had,"" said Kittle.Dow pegs the market opportunity for Enlist at about $1 billion. It plans to offer Enlist corn and soybean, the two most widely planted U.S. crops, next year in concert with Dow's Enlist Duo herbicide, which the crops are engineered to tolerate.""We are moving ahead assuming we will have regulatory approvals,"" said Tim Hassinger, vice president of Dow crop protection. ""We feel very good.""Enlist is aimed at replacing Monsanto's biotech ""Roundup Ready"" crops, which make up roughly 90 percent of U.S. corn and soybean plantings every spring. Dow is currently a small player in both, with an estimated market share in U.S. soybean seed of about 2 percent and a 4 percent share in corn.Monsanto's Roundup Ready cropping system has dominated U.S. agriculture because it is easy to use. Farmers can spray Roundup herbicide directly on top of their crops, then watch the weeds die and the crops flourish because a genetic alteration makes the crops impervious to the weedkiller.But heavy use of Roundup has triggered an explosion of herbicide-resistant ""superweeds"" that farmers have found it hard to fight. ROCKY ROAD Dow and its competitors have been racing to come up with a replacement crop and chemical combination. Monsanto is also developing a new biotech cropping system, and Monsanto spokeswoman Gayla Daugherty said Dow's advancement through the regulatory system is ""good news for ag technology.""While Dow is poised to be the first to garner regulatory approval, Monsanto hopes to be next in line.Tough competition is only one of many hurdles Dow has faced. Even though Enlist combines a 60-year-old herbicide component known as 2,4-D that is found in hundreds of commonly used lawn care products, with glyphosate, the chief ingredient in long-used Roundup, the new herbicide has many critics.The component 2,4-D has a reputation for drifting easily through the air and sometimes kills not just weeds but also crops beyond the fields where it is sprayed.Also, 2,4-D was one of the ingredients in the Agent Orange defoliant used in the Vietnam War that later was linked to illnesses in soldiers and Vietnamese civilians. Opponents, citing USDA estimates for a dramatic increase in the use of 2,4-D, have said they fear potential health and environmental problems stemming from increased herbicide pollution in soil, air and waterways.The USDA estimates that the use of 2,4-D will rise 74 percent even without Enlist to 44.5 million pounds by 2020, up from 25.6 million pounds in 2011. If Enlist is approved, USDA has said usage could rise to 176 million pounds by 2020.""The admission that 2,4-D use will increase that much is huge. That is the biggest thing,"" said Bill Freese, a researcher with the Center for Food Safety, which opposes approval of Enlist.Dow has said research shows the Enlist system is safe if properly used, but critics argue that Dow has falsely made that claim in the past. Dow's Dursban insecticide was a widely used household pesticide for decades until numerous health concerns led the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to phase out certain uses in 2000 because of risks found with the active ingredient, chlorpyrifos.The EPA is currently wrapping up its evaluation of the Enlist Duo herbicide. EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn said the EPA final regulatory decision will be coordinated with the USDA's final decision after both agencies review the public comments about Enlist, which are accepted through Tuesday.SPRAY BOOTH TESTS  Dow researchers have acknowledged some past problems with 2,4-D. But they have said Enlist is much improved, thanks to a new formulation that dramatically reduces the pesticide's ability to drift off-site or travel through the air as vapor.It has been no easy task. Researchers set up a high-tech laboratory ""spray booth"" where technicians have taken tens of thousands of measurements of droplets of 2,4-D to formulate a spray that is less able to drift on the wind.Dow researchers also had the new 2,4-D tested in a state-of-the-art wind tunnel in Queensland, Australia, and measured air concentrations levels over field tests.""When we first started, we didn't know if we could do this,"" said Dow senior research scientist Steve Wilson. ""But we've been at this for years. And we are where we need to be.""Many farmer groups have said they are eager for the new herbicide and crop combination.""These new products like Enlist will help us address some of the weed resistance issues. It is something we need,"" said Ray Gaesser, an Iowa corn and soybean farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, which has urged the USDA to approve Enlist.Still, more hurdles lie ahead. Dow has not yet won China's approval for import of Enlist crops, and Dow officials said they may go ahead with commercialization in the United States even without Chinese approval. Such an approach could jeopardize some U.S. grain sales to the world's second-largest economy. A similar scenario involving a biotech corn developed by Syngenta has caused some shipments of U.S. corn to be rejected by Chinese importers.There is also a possibility that weeds will become resistant to Enlist, as they have to Roundup.Dow officials have said they hope to extend Enlists' longevity by encouraging farmers to also make use of other herbicides.""The last thing we want to do is invest all this in Enlist and have resistance develop,"" said Hassinger.

Farmers' plans to sow more soybean than corn this year is also hurting DuPont as corn is more profitable for the company and corn plantings need more pesticides.DuPont said lower-than-expected corn plantings in Brazil, North America and Ukraine would likely hurt its farm unit in the first half of the year.However, Chief Executive Ellen Kullman told reporters on a call that the company's ""growth fundamentals in agriculture continue to be excellent both in the United States and on a global basis.""DuPont reaffirmed its 2014 operating earnings forecast of $4.20-$4.45 per share.""I think the theme is an ongoing recovery in most of DuPont's end markets, lean corporate management, and new products and solutions driving sales,"" said Eric Linser of Avant-Garde Advisors, a wealth management firm that owns DuPont shares. First-quarter operating earnings rose in five of DuPont's seven units, including in industrial biosciences, nutrition and health and performance materials businesses.As part of a strategy to move into less volatile businesses, the company is hiving off its performance chemicals unit, which has weighed on results since 2012 due to weak prices for a white pigment used in toothpastes, sunscreens and other products.Operating earnings in the business, which also makes materials used in non-stick cookware and refrigerants, fell 20 percent in the quarter.INVESTOR ACTIVISM  Analysts speculate that the planned sale of DuPont's performance chemicals unit was at the behest of Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management disclosed a stake in the company last year.Peltz called DuPont's stock undervalued, but did not spell out how he seeks to increase value. DuPont unveiled a $5 billion share repurchase program earlier this year.A number of chemical companies, including Dow Chemical Co , have come under investor pressure to separate less stable businesses and raise shareholder returns.Hedge fund titan Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC has urged Dow Chemical to spin off its lucrative but slow-growing petrochemical units and focus on specialty materials.Smaller rival Chemtura Corp said on Thursday that it would sell its agrichemicals business to Platform Specialty Products Corp for about $1 billion to focus on specialty chemicals.Net income attributable to DuPont dropped to $1.44 billion, or $1.54 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $3.35 billion, or $3.58 per share, a year earlier.DuPont's net income plunged as the company sold its performance coating business, which added almost $2 billion to earnings in the year-earlier quarter, to Carlyle Group in February.Operating earnings were $1.58 per share, in line with analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell nearly 3 percent to $10.13 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $10.45 billion.

If the index ends higher, it will be the fifth straight daily rise for the benchmark.With fewer than one-fifth of S&P 500 companies having reported results so far, about 62 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with the 66 percent average over the past four quarters. About 52 percent have beaten revenue forecasts, about even with the 54 percent average over the past four quarters. ""There have been some strong results from prominent companies, but in general the season has been less than exciting,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.""We're still struggling with top-line growth.

49,"   By Carey Gillam | April 30  April 30 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday that it was planning to grant approval to a new herbicide developed by Dow AgroSciences that is designed to be used with new genetically engineered corn and soybeans and combat weed resistance.The new herbicide, dubbed Enlist Duo, contains a combination of the herbicides 2,4-D and glyphosate, and has been heavily criticized by groups who say commercialization of Enlist will harm the environment and worsen weed resistance problems.Regulatory approval of the herbicide and crops have been delayed for more than a year after the EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which must grant approval of the crops genetically engineered to be tolerant of Enlist Duo, were inundated with pleas to reject Dow's applications.The USDA said in January it was prepared to grant approval and is expected to finalize that decision in the next few months. And on Wednesday, the EPA said it too was prepared to grant approval and would accept public comments for 30 days on its decision. The EPA said it would impose requirements on Dow, including ""robust monitoring and reporting to EPA,"" grower education and remediation, and it would ""allow EPA to take swift action to impose additional restrictions on the manufacturer and the use of the pesticide if resistance develops.""Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical, developed what it calls the Enlist Weed Control System as millions of acres of farmland have become choked with weeds resistant to glyphosate, the chief ingredient in the popular Roundup herbicide sold by Dow rival Monsanto Co.. More than 86 percent of corn, soybean and cotton growers in the U.S. South and 61 percent in the U.S. Midwest reported hard-to-control weeds on their farms, according to Dow.""Enlist Duo herbicide will help solve the weed control challenges growers are facing and will be another option to further reduce the potential for development of herbicide-resistant weeds,"" said Damon Palmer, Dow's commercial leader for the U.S. market. Dow officials have said Enlist corn and soybeans should be on the market by 2015 - roughly two years after the initial target launch date. Enlist cotton should follow them at some point in the future, they added.Critics say that 2,4-D and other herbicides of its class have been independently associated with deadly immune system cancers, Parkinson's disease, endocrine disruption and reproductive problems.""Biotechnology is taking agriculture backwards by facilitating a massive increase in use of this toxic herbicide, which formed part of Agent Orange used in Vietnam,"" said Bill Freese, a science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety,  a non-profit group that has sought to block approval of the Enlist products.(Reporting by Carey Gillam; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-04-30,DOW,"Wed Apr 30, 2014 | 5:25pm EDT",U.S. regulator set to approve Dow's Enlist herbicide,http://www.reuters.com//article/agriculture-dow-enlist-idUSL2N0NM2IK20140430?type=companyNews
50,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Ernest Scheyder | BOSTON/NEW YORK  BOSTON/NEW YORK May 1 Dow Chemical Co's  ""integrated strategy"" is costing shareholders billions of dollars and executives should work harder to boost results and transparency, activist investor Daniel Loeb said on Wednesday.In his most-detailed comments about the company since adding it to his $14.3 billion hedge fund Third Point's portfolio in January, Loeb praised management for taking some positive steps but made clear that more work needs to be done.The company, the largest U.S. chemicals company by sales, could make an additional $2.5 billion annually in earnings before income taxes, depreciated and amortization (EBITDA) if it focused more on selling ethylene, propylene and other basic petrochemicals on the open market and less on using these materials to make foams, glues and other consumer products, Loeb said.""Management needs to focus on what is driving this underperformance and how to cure it,"" Loeb wrote in a letter sent to investors on Thursday. Reuters obtained a copy.""Dow's integrated strategy,"" Loeb wrote, ""does not maximize profits.""Loeb contrasted Dow Chemical with rival Lyondell Basell , and wondered why, despite Dow's far higher production capacity, the two companies generate essentially the same EBITDA in their respective basic chemicals businesses. Shares of Lyondell, which only emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2010, have more than doubled in the past two years. Lyondell, Loeb wrote, ""is focused on being the lowest cost commodity petrochemical producer,"" a strategy he said Dow should emulate.Loeb, one of the hedge fund industry's most closely watched investors, said management did the right thing in raising Dow's dividend in January and in promising to become more transparent.Yet the dividend remains below pre-recession levels and, Loeb wrote, Chief Executive Andrew Liveris and other executives could do more to be transparent.That goal would not be achieved by joining the Feedstocks & Energy and Performance Plastics segments, as the company suggested it could do on its first quarter earnings call, Loeb wrote. And Loeb blasted Dow Chemical's opaque pricing. The company sells material at cost between units, an uncommon practice in the industry that while technically not in violation of accounting rules, does raise eyebrows. For example, a Dow Chemical plant that produces ethylene sells the chemical at cost to a plant that makes polyester resins.Exxon Mobil Corp and other large chemical producers typically sell basic chemical in-house at market rates, better helping investors gauge an ethylene plant's profitability.""The priority should be to implement a consistent, marketbased transfer pricing methodology across and within all segments so shareholders can clearly understand each business unit's underlying profitability,"" the hedge fund said in the letter. Midland, Michigan-based Dow Chemical declined to comment on Loeb's letter.Dow's share price has climbed 12.39 percent this year and was one of the bright spots in Third Point's portfolio, Loeb said.News in January that Loeb's Third Point had taken a position in Dow Chemical helped push the stock price higher as investors expected the billionaire investor to engage with management and push for changes. When he announced his stake in January, Loeb urged a spin off and by February Loeb had harsh words for the lack of transparency which he said made it hard to say whether the company should be split up or kept together.Now he sounded a more tempered note, offering both praise and suggestions after having had several meetings with the company in the last months, people familiar with the talks said.The tone stands in sharp contrast to his current all-out battle with Sotheby's where Loeb is criticizing the auction house for spending too much money and prescribing dramatic overhauls as he and two other dissident candidates are waging a proxy fight to join the 270-year old company's board.Third Point holds about 5.1 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.",2014-05-01,DOW,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 4:31pm EDT",Loeb's Third Point again nudges Dow Chemical to improve,http://www.reuters.com//article/dow-thirdpoint-idUSL2N0NN1II20140501?type=companyNews

Prices of U.S. Treasury debt fell, while European shares scaled six-year highs, underpinned by fresh takeover activity and renewed speculation about monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank.       On Wall Street, eight of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors rose as advancing stocks topped declining shares by almost 4 to 1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market.     The Dow set both an all-time peak and record close, while the S&P came within 16 basis points of an all-time high before slightly pulling back from its high of the day.     Weak economic data during the harsh winter and surprising strength in the bond market had kept money in fixed income, said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York. But an improving economic outlook has drawn investors back into stocks.     ""I hate to make day-to-day rationalizations of the behavior of the market, but the key point is, falling unemployment and rising economic growth ultimately mean that both interest rates and stocks prices are likely to move higher,"" Kelly said.     Estimate-beating results from Italian lenders UniCredit  and Banca Popolare di Milano reinforced optimism about a recovery in Italy, whose shares have outperformed Germany and France over the past year.     MSCI's all-country world index gained 0.7 percent, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300's index of leading shares rose 0.67 percent to close at 1,364.48.     The Dow Jones industrial average rose 112.13 points,  or 0.68 percent, to 16,695.47. The S&P 500 gained 18.17 points, or 0.97 percent, to 1,896.65, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 71.99 points, or 1.77 percent, to 4,143.859.     Equity markets shrugged off a weekend referendum in Ukraine, where pro-Moscow rebel organizers said nearly 90 percent had voted in favor of self-rule, possibly adding fuel to a conflict spinning increasingly out of control.      U.S. Treasuries yields rose before a heavy week of data that includes retail sales and consumer price reports, which will be watched for signs of economic strength, as well as whether inflation is rising from levels below the Federal Reserve's targets.     Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 8/32 in price to push their yield up to 2.6539 percent.      The euro traded near break-even against the dollar and yen, ignoring the weekend referendum in Ukraine.     Against sterling, however, the euro fell to a 16-month low on growing bets the European Central Bank will ease monetary policy just as the Bank of England prepares to raise rates.     The euro's gains were trimmed after dovish comments from Austria's central banker, Ewald Nowotny. He told reporters it would take more than a cut in interest rates to combat low inflation in the euro zone.     The euro rose 0.01 percent against the greenback at $1.3758 . The dollar rose 0.27 percent against the yen at 102.13.     Crude oil futures rose as investors braced for a possible supply disruption after the Ukraine referendum prompted the European Union to widen sanctions to Russian individuals and Crimean companies.      Top global oil exporter Saudi Arabia volunteered to supply more crude in the event of a shortage.      Brent crude settled up 52 cents at $108.41 a barrel.  U.S. crude gained 60 cents to settle at $100.59 a barrel.

As the frigid winter and chilly spring yield to summer, quarterly corporate results are only now laying bare the tens of millions of dollars of added freight costs for shippers.Few expect the frenzy to last, as emergency needs ebb and shippers return to more affordable rail. But the spike has shone a light on a critical capacity squeeze in the North American freight system, one that could mean higher transport costs as the trucking industry lags behind a pick-up in the economy.Though the spill-over business has made many winners in the trucking sector, industry leaders said they did not have enough drivers or trucks to meet the demand, and long term, trucks are an inadequate stop-gap for the problems of rail.JUST TRUCKIN' Some of the nation's biggest freight shippers, including Cargill, global grains trader Bunge and Wal-Mart Stores declined to talk about how or where they turned to road freight this winter. But data from other operators and sources familiar with those companies' operations shows it was a widespread, and costly, trend. ""I'm not going to call this a once in a decade-type winter, but boy ... it (had) a very unusual effect on transportation,"" Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in an April 23 earnings call.The company reported $100 million in overall lost sales due to the extremely cold weather. Dow is a customer of Quality Distribution, a leading truck company that reported severe weather affected truck deliveries and availability.Domtar Corp, a major paper and personal products maker, spent an extra $5 million on freight due to a shortage of railcars and extreme weather conditions. It also had to pay more for truck drivers during a period of high demand.Customers turned to trucks because they ""lost confidence in the ability of the railroads to meet their inventory needs,"" railroad operator Genesee & Wyoming Inc's chief executive officer, Jack Hellmann, said earlier this month. The vast majority of trucks are secured a year or more ahead of time, so companies seeking trucks for emergency back-up turned to online forums where available trucks advertise their availability and receive bids from needy shippers.That often causes a short-term spike in rates during the winter, when transit tends to slow down. But this year's rally was much sharper and widespread than usual. Rates for refrigerated trucks and rigs hauling standardized containers, which rarely rise in winter, also surged.Next day prices for trucks were up nearly 20 percent, the transportation intelligence group FTR Associates estimated.Shippers sending metals or lumber on flatbed trucks, for example, saw costs rise as much as 20 cents a mile from January to March ($1.55-$1.75) on the spot market, according to DAT Solutions, which runs a matching service for carriers. LOOMING SQUEEZE Few trucking analysts expect a repeat of this year's winter rail woes any time soon, but some hope it may draw new investment to a neglected but important corner of the economy.Nearly 70 percent of all domestic freight tonnage is sent by road, according to the American Trucking Association, yet the industry never fully recovered from the financial crisis.In 2008 nearly 3,000 trucking companies, mainly small and owner-operators, went out of business, according to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. An estimated 200,000 drivers were laid off between January 2007 and February 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.In March, there were 30,000 unfilled driver jobs, according to the ATA.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury note's yield slipped below 2.44 percent, its lowest level since July. ""We are due for a sideways trending market for a short while, a period of consolidation following a four-day rally and also with the broad equities being at or near all-time highs,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.""This is a split-personality market with the S&P at or near all-time highs in anticipation of an improving economy and higher earnings, while the bond market and yields continue to drop, suggesting maybe caution is warranted.""The drop in fixed-income yields could lift the prices of dividend-paying stocks.

The Dow Jones Transportation Average extended its run into record territory, ending at a lifetime high of 8,075.88 after hitting a record intraday high of 8,102.44. On Tuesday, the DJ Transportation Average closed above 8,000 for the first time. When the transports sector does well and is confirmed by a similar move in the Dow industrials, the trend signals an improved outlook for the U.S. economy and the stock market.A total of 225 stocks on the Big Board and Nasdaq touched 52-week highs, while 59 issues hit 52-week lows. Notables touching 52-week highs included ConocoPhillips and Dow Chemical.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.32 points or 0.25 percent, to 16,633.18. The S&P 500 lost 2.13 points or 0.11 percent, to end at 1,909.78. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 11.99 points or 0.28 percent, to 4,225.08. The S&P 500 index hit 1,914.46 during the session, an intraday record high. It remains in the 1,910 area seen as technical resistance.

58,"  FRANKFURT, June 2 Dow Chemical expects Europe's chemical industry to face a competitive disadvantage against U.S. rivals which pay far less for electricity and raw materials due to shale gas extraction, the group's chief executive said in an interview in German business daily Handelsblatt.""Europe either must obtain cheap gas or pull out of certain markets and businesses,"" Dow Chemical's Chief Executive Andrew Liveris told the newspaper.In the United States, electricity prices are falling thanks to gas derived from fracking - the hydraulic fracturing of rock. On the contrary, in Europe's largest economy Germany companies like BASF and Lanxess pay some of the highest power prices in the world thanks in large part to the country's decision to phase out nuclear power and push into green energy. The top U.S. chemicals maker also expects stronger competition from firms in Asia and the Middle East. Liveris wants to expand production at lower-cost locations and invest more in research and development, the newspaper said.(Reporting by Kirsti Knolle, editing by David Evans)",2014-06-02,DOW,"Mon Jun 2, 2014 | 2:05pm EDT",Dow Chemical sees competitive disadvantage for European rivals -paper,http://www.reuters.com//article/chemicals-usa-europe-idUSL6N0OJ4U320140602?type=companyNews
59,"  * Syngenta declines to comment on report of Monsanto talks* Shares rise nearly 6 percent, biggest gainers on pan-European index   (Adds Dow comment)By Katharina BartZURICH, June 24 Syngenta's shares jumped on Tuesday after a media report that the Swiss crop chemical maker had been in talks about a $40 billion takeover by U.S. rival Monsanto Co to create the world's largest agrochemical company.Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, and Syngenta had held preliminary talks about combining, partly to allow the U.S. company to benefit from lower Swiss holding taxes, according to a report from Bloomberg. The talks were later abandoned, the report said.A Syngenta spokesman declined to comment on the report. Monsanto spokesman Lee Quarles said the company did not comment on ""rumors and speculation,"" and had nothing to say about the reported talks.Syngenta shares closed 5.7 percent higher at 345.8 Swiss francs ($390), the biggest gainer on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index.Monsanto shares were down 0.7 percent at $121.26 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.Analysts are expecting more deals in the sector as larger players like Monsanto, Bayer and BASF look to bulk up and broaden their reach in crop protection and seeds.In April, Chemtura Corp agreed to sell its agrochemical business to rival Platform Specialty Products Corp  for about $1 billion. And Denmark's Auriga Industries, which controls Danish crop-chemical maker Cheminova, said on June 13 that it was reviewing strategic options.Companies in Asia are also looking for more expertise in agrochemicals and seeds, in part due to governments such as China's wanting to increase domestic production and safeguard food security.The reported talks with Monsanto put pressure on Syngenta Chief Executive Officer Mike Mack to bolster the company's performance and to give money back to shareholders, said several analysts, including those at Deutsche Bank and MainFirst.""This steadily increasing M&A story plus the activism theme we are seeing in U.S. chemicals mean that management teams in Europe are under more pressure to improve balance sheet efficiency and/or share prices,"" said Deutsche Bank analyst Virginie Boucher-Ferte. She rates the stock a ""buy"" with a 400-franc target price.A number of chemical companies in the United States, including DuPont and Dow Chemical Co, have come under investor pressure to separate less stable businesses and increase shareholder returns. ""Dow Chemicals' agro segment might also be available as management is under pressure to increase shareholder value,"" analysts at German brokerage MainFirst wrote in a note to clients.Dow AgroSciences spokeswoman Kenda Resler Friend said there are no such near-term plans to divest the agricultural unit.""The business is delivering on its significant technology investments and meeting farmer needs for increased productivity, and continues to outperform the industry under Dow's ownership,"" she said.DuPont officials were not immediately available for comment.Deutsche Bank said this shareholder activism was likely to spread to Europe, raising the stakes for Syngenta and peers such as Germany's BASF. Syngenta's shares have lagged those of European rivals, falling 1.2 percent over the past year compared with a nearly 21 percent rise in the European chemicals sector.The company is aiming to increase cost cuts to $1 billion a year by 2018 after disappointing investors with an 11 percent fall in 2013 profit.CEO Mack has changed Syngenta's sales model so that a single account manager sells farmers everything from seeds and pesticides to fertilisers and support services, and he aims to boost sales to $25 billion by 2025 from $14.69 billion in 2013.TAX TREATMENT The tax aspect of Monsanto's potential deal with Syngenta appears to have been similar to that of U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's  failed attempt to buy rival AstraZeneca for nearly 70 billion pounds ($119.06 billion) last month.That deal would have allowed Pfizer to reincorporate in Britain and pay a significantly lower corporate tax. The U.S. company would also have been able to use tens of billions of dollars it has parked overseas, avoiding high U.S. taxes for repatriating the huge cash pile.While Switzerland has long competed against its European neighbours to attract big corporations, it has recently moved toward more cooperation with the European Union after disagreements over corporate taxation have strained relations with the bloc for almost a decade.Last week, Switzerland said it would abolish some corporate tax regimes, such as different treatment of domestic and foreign revenues.

The Nasdaq Biotech index jumped 2.2 percent in its fourth straight day of gains.Apple Inc gave one of the biggest lifts to the market, rising 2.6 percent to $97.19 as concerns faded about the iPhone maker's margins. Dow component Microsoft Corp  rose 0.1 percent to $44.87 after the company said it aimed to get its money-losing Nokia phone unit to break even within two years. ""Earnings season has been going very well, beating on both the top and bottom line, which suggests companies will continue to execute well,"" said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta.Among the companies that reported results after the market closed, Facebook Inc posted stronger-than-expected revenue growth and its stock climbed 3.5 percent to $73.80 in extended-hours trading. TripAdvisor Inc shares tumbled 9.4 percent to $97.25 in after-hours trading after the travel website company reported earnings that missed expectations.The shares of Dow component AT&T Inc shares slipped 1.4 percent to $35.38 in extended-hours trading after the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider reported revenue that missed analysts' forecasts.About 68.5 percent of the S&P 500 components have reported earnings above expectations, topping the long-term average of 63 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. On the revenue side, 63.1 percent have beaten forecasts, above the historical average of 61 percent. Overseas issues continued to limit the market's gains. Two Ukrainian fighter jets were downed near the area where a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet was shot down last week, a spokesman for Ukraine's military operations said Wednesday.Violence also continued in the Gaza Strip, though U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said indirect truce talks between Israel and Hamas had made some progress.""There's a battle going on in the market between earnings and geopolitical issues, and right now, it looks like earnings have a slight edge,"" said Gayle, who helps oversee $50 billion in assets. ""These are big areas of concern, but they've yet to translate to anything tangible from an economic standpoint.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 26.91 points or 0.16 percent, to end at 17,086.63.

71,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO, Sept 14  CHICAGO, Sept 14 Cargill Inc's lawsuit against Syngenta AG over rejections of genetically modified U.S. corn by China may be just the start of legal challenges against global seed makers over trade with one of the world's biggest markets.Trading giant Cargill said in court documents on Friday that it had lost more than $90 million because Syngenta sold Agrisure Viptera corn, known as MIR 162, to U.S. farmers without first obtaining import approval from China, which has turned away boatloads of U.S. crops containing the variety over the past year.The lawsuit will be a test case of who is ultimately responsible for such rejections that damage international trade: the seed companies that develop unapproved GMO traits or the merchants who sell grain that may be contaminated with it.""Let's face it, it's dollars and cents,"" Illinois farmer John Brink said about the motivation for seed companies that launch U.S. sales without approval from all major importers.""If they can get it out there a growing season earlier, it's more money in the pocket, more money for the company, more money for the shareholders.""Cargill filed its case as U.S. farmers are preparing to harvest their first crop of another GMO variety of Syngenta corn called Duracade, which China has not approved for import.Nearly 90 percent of corn in the United States, the world's top grains producer, is now genetically engineered, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as farmers embrace technology that helps kill weeds and fight pests.Approvals of the crops from importers are critical as the coming harvest is expected to be a record 14.395 billion bushels - outstripping domestic demand of 11.855 billion, which mostly goes to animal feed or ethanol production.China is one of many countries that is cautious about GMO crops. Some consumers worry about the safety of the crops for animal and human consumption, and there are concerns over their impact on the environment, including increased resistance of weeds.Farmers like Brink place the blame for China's rejection of U.S. corn containing Viptera squarely on Syngenta. And global grain trader Archer Daniels Midland Co has said it too is considering legal action against the seed maker over the variety.Illinois-based ADM ""has not yet made a formal decision on what actions it will take,"" spokeswoman Jackie Anderson told Reuters in an email. ""Wide-scale planting of traits that aren't approved by key importing countries diminish the competitiveness of American grain and feed exports,"" she added.Bunge Ltd, another major grain trader, did not reply to a request for comment.Syngenta began selling corn seed containing MIR 162 to U.S. farmers in 2010 after winning approval from U.S. authorities. China has been considering an application to approve the variety for four years.Cargill said in its lawsuit that approval from China for imports ""typically takes two to three years,"" while approval for cultivation can take longer. Syngenta had applied for both.Beijing began rejecting U.S. shipments of corn containing MIR 162 in November, costing the agriculture industry up to $2.9 billion, according to the National Grain and Feed Association. RECKLESS CONTAMINATION? Cargill's claims that Syngenta recklessly contaminated the U.S. grain supply by selling MIR 162 without import approval from China are baseless, Syngenta spokesman Paul Minehart said in a statement.Syngenta ""strongly upholds the right of growers to have access to approved new technologies that can increase both their productivity and their profitability,"" he said.Cargill itself took a risk by agreeing to sell U.S. corn to China, knowing the variety was in production, said a grain exporter for a rival company who asked not to be named.""Any time you do business with China, there's a risk,"" the trader said. ""You try to make your trade with that in mind."" ""Cargill, like any grain trading company, saw a margin and a way to make money,"" he added. ""They saw an opportunity and they went after it.""Farmers and grain merchants need to keep MIR 162 corn separate from other varieties to prevent accidental shipment to unapproved markets. MIR 162 is approved for shipment to other major buyers of U.S. corn such as Japan and Mexico.Cargill has said it asked farmers to provide advance notice when they were delivering MIR 162 corn to its grain elevators. However, MIR 162 corn can still be found throughout the U.S. corn supply, effectively closing the lucrative Chinese market to U.S. supplies, according to the lawsuit.""Syngenta should have never even sold it until it was approved,"" said Caleb Hamer, a farmer in Black Hawk County, Iowa, who did not plant MIR 162 corn. ""Asking us and then the end users to keep it segregated is a whole can of worms that nobody wants to deal with.""For Duracade corn, Syngenta has teamed with grain merchant Gavilon, owned by Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp, to work with farmers to keep the GMO crop out of unapproved markets. The world's biggest traders, including Cargill and ADM, have said they will limit their handling of Duracade corn because China has not approved it.Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical Co, is awaiting U.S. approval to begin selling Enlist, yet another type of GMO corn that is not approved for import by China. Dow officials have said they may go ahead with commercialization in the United States even without Beijing's approval.Dow is ""actively participating in industry-led initiatives, as well as directly engaging with the appropriate regulatory authorities to secure approvals in China,"" spokeswoman Kenda Resler Friend said.Monsanto Co, the world's largest seed company and top developer of GMO crops, did not reply to questions about its crop commercialization policies. But Monsanto leaders have been actively working to curry Chinese favor for GMO crops.Exports of GMO crops, or crops that inadvertently contain traces of GMOs, have been a problem in the past. Many foreign buyers of alfalfa from the U.S. Pacific Northwest routinely test U.S. alfalfa supplies to make sure they do not contain GMOs.U.S. processors and exporters became hypersensitive to issues related to GMO corn after a variety unapproved for food use known as Starlink was discovered in a U.S. shipment to Japan in 2000. Sales to the biggest U.S. customers at the time - Japan and South Korea - dried up overnight. The subsequent tracing, sorting, testing, separating and certifying of GMO cost the industry millions of dollars.

72,"   By Carey Gillam  The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday gave final approval to new genetically modified corn and soybeans developed by Dow AgroSciences that, while heavily criticized by environmentalists and some farmers, are portrayed by Dow as an answer to weed resistance problems that limit crop production.Approval of the specialty corn and soybeans to be sold as part of a branded ""Enlist Weed Control System"" means the traits could be on the market for the 2015 U.S. planting season, according to Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical. Dow is still awaiting approval from the Environmental Protection Agency for Enlist herbicide, which the genetically altered Enlist corn and beans are designed to tolerate.Like the popular Roundup Ready system developed by rival Monsanto Co., farmers who plant Enlist crops can spray their fields with Enlist herbicide and kill weeds but not the crops.Corn and soybeans containing Monsanto's Roundup Ready trait, which can tolerate sprayings of Roundup herbicide, make up roughly 90 percent of U.S. corn and soybean plantings every spring.But heavy use of Roundup has triggered an explosion of herbicide-resistant ""super weeds"" that are hard for farmers to fight and which can choke off crop yields. The prevalence of resistant weeds has more than doubled since 2009 and so-called ""super weeds"" now infest roughly 70 million acres of U.S. farmland, according to Dow.Because weeds have not yet developed resistance to Enlist, the system addresses the problem. “Enlist will help farmers increase their productivity to meet the growing demand for a safe and affordable food supply,” Tim Hassinger, president of Dow AgroSciences, said in a statement. Dow pegs the market opportunity for Enlist at about $1 billion. Monsanto is also developing a new biotech cropping system.Enlist combines a 60-year-old herbicide component known as 2,4-D with glyphosate, the chief ingredient in long-used Roundup. Opponents say the use of 2,4-D can cause potential health and environmental problems, including increasing weed resistance. And they fear the chemical will damage neighboring farm fields. Fruit and vegetable farmers are particularly concerned that 2,4-D drift will lead to crop damage. But Dow has said the Enlist system is safe if properly used.""The USDA approval of Enlist after such a fundamentally flawed review process is a slap in the face to farmers,"" said Marcia Ishii-Eiteman, senior scientist with Pesticide Action Network (PAN). ""Thousands of farmers have warned USDA of the crop damage, economic losses and health risks they will face from pesticide drift, if these 2,4-D resistant seeds hit the market.""Ishii-Eiteman hinted at a lawsuit, saying PAN would pursue ""legal options"" to protect farmers.

74,"  * Commercial production expected to start in first half 2015* Plant to produce cadmium-free quantum dots in South Korea* Demand from display makers seen rising* Nanoco shares rise more than 27 pct   (Adds details, analyst comment, background; updates shares)By Aashika Jain and Roshni MenonSept 24 Nanoco Group Plc said commercial production of quantum dots, used to make vibrant screen displays, is expected to begin in the first half of next year at a plant in South Korea being built by its partner, Dow Chemical Co.Shares of the British nanotechnology company rose more than 27 percent on Wednesday to their highest in more than 10 months.The launch of quantum dot production, which analysts said was probably linked to a supply agreement with a big display manufacturer, signals a major breakthrough for Nanoco and the quantum dot industry.""Nanoco is today on the threshold of major growth in its revenues, earnings and cash flows,"" Liberum analysts Eoin Lambe and Janardan Menon wrote in a note. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals, 10,000 times finer than a human hair, that can convert electrical energy into light and be manipulated to produce precise colors for display.They are cheaper and consume less power than organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), their rival technology at the sharp end of the display business, but cannot yet be produced in the same quantities.With demand expected to soar, the handful of companies able to make quantum dots are partnering with big display makers to set up industrial-scale manufacturing.Dow Chemical, which holds exclusive worldwide rights to sell Nanoco's quantum dots for use in electronic displays, said on Wednesday it would begin construction of the manufacturing plant in Cheonan, South Korea. Unlike those produced by competitors, quantum dots using Nanoco's technology do not contain cadmium, a toxic metal, the use of which is restricted in many countries. Cheonan will be the world's first large-scale, cadmium-free quantum dot plant.'MILLIONS OF TELEVISIONS' Quantum dots are already in use. Amazon.com Inc's  Kindle Fire HDX 7 and Sony Corp's Triluminos TV, for example, already use them in their screens. It is their wider adoption in television screens as a much cheaper alternative to OLED technology that promises growth.Touch Display Research, a market research and consulting firm, forecasts that the global market for quantum dot displays and lighting components will rise to $9.6 billion by 2023 from $508 million in 2014.Dow Chemical said the new plant would ""enable the manufacture of millions of quantum dot televisions and other display applications to meet growing consumer demand.""Analysts at Liberum and Canaccord Genuity said Dow would have been unlikely to build a plant without the commitment of at least one large customer.Among the largest South Korean display makers, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd declined immediate comment and a spokeswoman for LG Electronics Inc said the company had not decided whether or not to release quantum dot TVs.For Manchester-based Nanoco, founded in 2001, the start of construction of the plant triggers an unspecified ""milestone payment"" from Dow. The Liberum and Canaccord analysts estimated this payment at about $2 million.The Liberum analysts forecast Nanoco's revenue could rise to 51 million pounds ($84 million) by 2017. The company reported revenue of 3.93 million pounds for the year to July 31, 2013. The company has yet to turn a profit since listing in May 2009.Nanoco's shares were up 25.4 percent at 148.3 pence at 1023 GMT.

It will depend on if and how they will be carved out of their contractual arrangements and the tax implications of their separation, the people cautioned. Initial estimates place their value between $3.5 billion and $4 billion, the people added.Logical buyers might include companies in the sector such as Axiall Corp and Westlake Chemical Corp, as well as private equity firms experienced in chemicals such as Apollo Global Management LLC, the people said. Representatives for Axiall and Westlake did not respond to requests for comment, while Apollo declined to comment.

78,"   By Jonathan Stempel | Sept 30  Sept 30 A federal appeals court rejected Dow Chemical Co's bid to throw out a $1.06 billion verdict imposed after customers accused it of conspiring to artificially inflate polyurethane prices, saying enough evidence supported the class action award.The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver on Monday said new U.S. Supreme Court limits on class actions did not require Dow customers to sue individually, even if some could have avoided price hikes by negotiating or using rival products.Dow is ""extremely disappointed"" in the decision and will appeal, including to the Supreme Court if necessary, the Midland, Michigan-based company said in a statement on Tuesday.The decision shows that large class actions can still be sustained even after the Supreme Court, in 2011 and 2013 decisions favoring Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Comcast Corp , made it harder to show that common questions predominated and damages could be readily determined.Polyurethanes are chemical products used to make consumer and industrial goods such as car seating, footwear, insulation and mattress foam. Several companies including Dow had been accused in a 2005 lawsuit of conspiring to fix prices of urethane chemicals in the preceding six years.Dow was the only defendant not to settle, only to be found liable in February 2013 by a federal jury in Kansas City, Kansas, for $400 million of damages.That sum was tripled under antitrust law to $1.2 billion, and then reduced to $1.06 billion because of other settlements. Writing for a unanimous three-judge 10th Circuit panel, Circuit Judge Robert Bacharach said jurors ""could have inferred"" from the evidence that a conspiracy caused polyurethane prices to be higher than they would have been absent collusion.In upholding the class action, he wrote that ""price-fixing affects all market participants, creating an inference of class-wide impact even when prices are individually negotiated,"" permitting liability to be determined ""in a single stroke.""The panel also rejected Dow's argument that there was no basis for the $400 million award, saying an expert witness for the plaintiffs had estimated even greater damages and that jurors had discretion to impose a lesser amount. In its statement, Dow said the U.S. Department of Justice closed its own probe into alleged price-fixing in December 2007, without bringing charges.""Dow has always denied plaintiffs' allegations of price fixing and will continue to vigorously defend this litigation,"" it said.Roberta Liebenberg, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Defendants that previously settled included Germany's BASF SE and Bayer AG, and Huntsman International LLC.

79,"  (Adds background and updates share price movement, details in Third Point assets)By Svea Herbst-BaylissBOSTON, Sept 30 Third Point LLC, the hedge fund run by Daniel Loeb that is known for pushing companies to perform better, has taken a ""significant"" stake in eBay Inc and has had discussions with its chief executive officer, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Third Point's involvement comes on the same day that eBay, under pressure from billionaire activist Carl Icahn, said it will spin off its PayPal payments unit into a separate, publicly traded company. EBay's share price rose 7.8 percent. Third Point, a closely watched hedge fund with $17 billion in assets, occasionally pushes companies in which it invests to make management or operational changes. Those companies have included Yahoo Inc and Sotheby's. Loeb also pushed for a spinoff at Dow Chemical Co earlier this year.With eBay, Loeb urged the company months after Icahn began loudly calling for eBay to offload PayPal. The source with knowledge of Third Point's interest in eBay did not say what changes the hedge fund sought, or whether it worked in tandem with Icahn.Loeb declined to comment on Tuesday. (BREAKINGVIEWS-PayPal forced to rev after eBay's belated U-turn )Icahn said on Tuesday he was happy with the spinoff decision, adding it came later than it should have but sooner than he expected.

83,"   By Carey Gillam  The Environmental Protection Agency gave final approval on Wednesday to a new herbicide developed by Dow AgroSciences that has faced broad opposition, ordering a series of restrictions to address potential environmental and health hazards.EPA said it was applying ""first-time-ever restrictions"" on its approval of the herbicide, called Enlist Duo, which is designed to be used with new genetically modified crops developed by Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical.The herbicide was developed by Dow as an answer to severe weed resistance problems that are limiting crop production around the country. EPA said the approval lays out a template of new requirements for future approvals of herbicides designed for use with genetically modified crops. Dow will be required to closely monitor and report to EPA to ensure that weeds are not becoming resistant to Enlist Duo, the agency said. As well, EPA is ordering a 30-foot in-field “no spray” buffer zone around application areas. It has also banned use when wind speeds are over 15 miles per hour.Initially, Enlist Duo will be allowed only in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. EPA will take public comments until Nov. 14 about approving the product for use in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska Oklahoma, Tennessee and North Dakota. EPA will review its approval of Enlist Duo in six years rather than the usual 15 years.The EPA decision comes after the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave final approval last month to Enlist corn and soybeans, which have been altered to tolerate being sprayed with Enlist Duo herbicide. The specialty crops and the herbicide are to be sold as a branded ""Enlist Weed Control System"". Like the popular Roundup Ready system developed by rival Monsanto Co, farmers who plant Enlist crops can spray over the crops in their fields with Enlist herbicide and kill weeds but not the crops.Heavy use of Roundup herbicide triggered an explosion of herbicide-resistant ""super weeds"" that are hard for farmers to fight and which can choke off crop yields. Such weeds now infest roughly 70 million acres of U.S. farmland, according to Dow. Enlist Duo combines a 60-year-old herbicide component known as 2,4-D with glyphosate, the chief ingredient in Roundup. Using the 2,4-D in combination with glyphosate should help farmers kill weeds that are resistant to Roundup, Dow officials say. Dow pegs the market for Enlist at about $1 billion, and hopes to start selling the system for the 2015 U.S. spring planting season. There has been broad opposition to Enlist Duo. Critics say use of 2,4-D has been linked to a range of health problems, including reproductive problems, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Parkinson’s disease. They also fear the new herbicide could drift into neighboring farm fields, harming crops there. And they say that in the long run it will only increase weed resistance problems.  The EPA received more than 400,000 comments about Enlist Duo. In one letter, dated June 30, 2014, the Environmental Working Group nonprofit advocacy organization listed the names of more than 77,000 people asking EPA to deny approval. But the EPA said its scientists used ""highly conservative and protective"" assumptions to evaluate the human health and ecological risks of Enlist Duo and that usage as approved will protect the public, agricultural workers, and endangered species.  The agency said it evaluated the risks to all age groups, from infants to the elderly, and took into account exposure through food, water, pesticide drift, and as a result of use around homes. ""Our decision reflects sound science... and is protective of everyone and the environment,"" said Jim Jones, assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention.

86,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Nov 9 Private equity firm Golden Gate Capital is in the lead to acquire Angus Chemical Co, a specialty chemicals subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co, for more than $1 billion, according to three people familiar with the matter.Golden Gate has so far outbid other buyout firms, including Onex Corp and Metalmark Capital Holdings LLC, in the auction for Angus, the people said. The negotiations are ongoing and the outcome could still change, the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Golden Gate Capital and Metalmark declined to comment, while representatives for Dow and Onex did not respond to requests for comment. Based in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, Angus makes additives used in a variety of products including paints, personal care and cosmetics and life science utilities.Dow, which has narrowed its focus to packaging, electronics and agriculture, has a $4.5 billion share repurchase program and is also looking to raise as much as $6 billion from asset sales. Last month, Dow said it expected to raise more than $2 billion by selling its Angus and AgroFresh Inc subsidiaries, as well as its sodium borohydride business. It has also earmarked its epoxy business and some chlorine and derivatives assets for sale.Dow, the No. 1 U.S. chemical maker by sales, is facing investor pressure to sell off less-lucrative businesses and return more money to shareholders. Activist investor Daniel Loeb has also urged the company to separate its commoditized raw materials businesses from its specialty chemicals operations. Dow has repeatedly rebuffed the demand, saying that keeping the businesses together helps keep costs down. Its plastics business has benefited from a shale boom in the United States that has pulled down prices of raw materials such as ethane and naphtha, giving the company an edge over oil-dependent European rivals.Private equity firms are keen to buy the unloved assets of industrial conglomerates because the complexity of such corporate carveouts can make their price tag more attractive than that of traditional leveraged buyouts.Last year, for example, Carlyle Group LP acquired DuPont's performance coatings business for $4.9 billion. It renamed the unit Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. Axalta is set to go public this week in a $945 million initial public offering.

89,"   By Carey Gillam  Dow AgroSciences' decision to severely restrict U.S. introduction of its Enlist genetically modified crops and herbicide - billed as the company's most important product launch ever - came after extensive talks with U.S. grain leaders who fear roiling trade with China, a company executive said on Thursday.The deep involvement of the grain industry in defining a GMO crop launch and the controls on it underscore the lengths to which U.S. companies go to avoid angering China. Over the last year, China has shown reluctance to approve new GMO grain for import and has rejected more than 1 million tonnes of U.S. corn containing traces of unapproved GMO traits.Dow AgroSciences' application for Chinese approval of its Enlist genetically modified corn has languished for about two years. Its Enlist soybeans are also awaiting approval. Both are genetically engineered to withstand treatments of Dow's new Enlist Duo herbicide. ""We want to make sure that we respect their (China's) process,"" Joe Vertin, Dow AgroSciences' global leader for Enlist, said in an interview. Vertin said after the company received U.S. regulatory approvals this fall it held talks with national corn and soybean grower groups, grain trading groups and others on how to proceed. The agricultural unit of Dow Chemical evaluated several proposals before coming up with what Vertin called a ""unique"" strategy.That plan, unveiled on Wednesday, allows only for seed production of its new Enlist soybeans. Farmers who grow Enlist corn seed will be required to feed the harvested grain to their  livestock and agree to have the process audited. Farmers will  be invoiced for Enlist corn seed only after China import approval is granted.  Enlist Duo herbicide will be sold for use on both the beans and corn.The program is for 2015 and will be re-evaluated for 2016, depending on China's position.  Vertin would not specify the acreage targeted for the launch. But he said the company is optimistic for broad adoption at some point.  ""As we look at any biotech trait...  it's a gradual process,"" he said.Dow's program is stricter than that of Syngenta AG, which also is trying what the industry calls a ""stewarded launch.""  Syngenta is requiring farmers who plant its Agrisure Duracade GMO corn to feed the harvest to livestock or deliver it to a facility that will not export it to China.

94,"  (Adds comment from DuPont and Dow)By Carey GillamNov 17 Crop-devouring armyworms are showing increasing resistance in some U.S. farm fields to a popular type of genetically modified crop that should kill them, scientists said on Monday.The evolution of insect resistance ""is a great threat"" long- term to the sustainability of the GMO crop biotechnology that has become a highly valued tool for many U.S. farmers, according to Fangneng Huang, an entomologist at Louisiana State University (LSU) and lead researcher for a three-year study.The study was published on Monday in the PLOS One online journal (www.plosone.org) for peer-reviewed research, after being presented at the Entomological Society of America annual meeting in Portland, Oregon.The research documents resistance by fall armyworms in the southeastern United States to the Cry1F protein found in many  corn products developed by Dow AgroSciences and DuPont  to fight off the destructive pests. It is the latest evidence in recent years showing that insects are developing resistance to crops that have been genetically modified to kill them.Like ""super weeds"" that have developed resistance to glyphosate-based herbicide and make it harder for farmers to keep fields from being overrun with weeds, the armyworms are starting to devour corn crops that should repel them, said Dominic Reisig, an entomologist at North Carolina State University. Armyworms can be a problem for farmers in many U.S. states, but the resistant armyworms have been documented only in some areas of Florida and North Carolina. The range of these resistant armyworms is unknown, researchers said.They said farmers should plant more non-GMO corn as a refuge and possibly increase the use of pesticides to control the resistance.The GMO corn at issue contains Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) genes. Bt corn, popular with farmers throughout the Americas, has been on the market roughly 18 years. Newer types of Bt corn with multiple modes of action are still showing effectiveness, Huang said. ""We don't know how long they can last,"" Huang said.Officials with Dow said fall armyworm resistance is nothing new and not a significant problem. DuPont said the company was trying to help farmers manage fall armyworms, and said the Cry1F protein still offers benefits.Researchers have also expressed concerns about Bt resistance in western corn rootworm.The study was conducted by researchers from LSU, North Carolina State University, the University of Florida, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the University of Minnesota and the University of Georgia.

U.S. interest rates eased as the dollar gained, and the euro declined.Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 ended at new record highs, with each rising more than 1 percent on the week in the fifth straight week of gains for U.S. equities. ""This is a one-two punch for global growth,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.The Dow Jones rose 91.06 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 17,810.06 on Friday. The S&P 500 gained 0.52 percent to 2,063.50 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.24 percent to 4,712.97. The Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent for the week.European shares, oil and other growth-sensitive commodities all leapt on China's move to cut rates to 5.6 percent, following recent data that showed its huge economy was heading for its worst year in almost a quarter of a century. China's rate reductions were its first in more than two years. They came as ECB head Mario Draghi spoke of his determination to use more aggressive measures, such as large scale asset purchases, to ensure the euro zone does not slump into a new crisis.Both the euro zone and China have lagged the momentum of the United States, stimulus-driven Japan and faster-growing Britain over the last month, but a ramping up of the ECB's rhetoric and Beijing's actions will stoke hopes of a turnaround.Germany's DAX and France's CAC rose nearly 3 percent. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 2.1 percent.The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was up 0.76 percent. The dollar index was up 0.82 percent, as the euro gave up more than 1 percent and was last at $1.2385.The yen was up against the dollar. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday the yen's fall over the past week was ""too rapid."" It was one of the strongest warnings against a weak yen since the aggressive stimulus efforts began two years ago, and saw the currency leap off a 7-year low to 117.72.Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were up 6/32 in price to yield 2.31 percent from 2.34 percent late Thursday.The rate cut by China added to a positive mood among oil traders, many of whom expect the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to trim production at what looks to be a landmark meeting in Vienna on Nov. 27. Brent traded above $80 a barrel and was last up $1 to $80.35.Copper and gold also got a lift, with the red metal up 0.50 percent. Spot gold climbed back over $1,200 and was last traded at $1,200.80 an ounce, ahead nearly $7, as traders cheered the prospect of more global stimuli.

102,"  (Corrects number in paragraph 5)* Energy intensive industry says needs regulatory shelter* Gas price can do more than ETS reform to displace coal* EU politicians to vote on early carbon market reformBy Barbara LewisBRUSSELS, Feb 10 One goal for U.N. climate talks is to stop industry fleeing Europe to escape regulatory costs, a Dow Chemical director said on Wednesday, adding there was no need to intervene in the EU carbon market to drive up prices. The European Union has sought to lead efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions with its Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world's biggest carbon market. But it is currently negotiating reforms, with some countries saying emissions permits are too cheap to spur a shift to a low-carbon economy.EU nations are also preparing to submit national emissions cuts ahead of a U.N. conference in Paris at the end of the year to seek a global climate change deal. Preparatory talks take place in Geneva this week.""We need European leadership, but we should not lead by so much we close our own shop,"" Howard Chase, director of government affairs at Dow Chemical Europe, said in an interview. Energy intensive businesses such as the Dow Chemical Company -- which uses the equivalent of around 800,000 barrels of oil per day, roughly 1 percent of daily production -- have campaigned for exemptions from some EU regulations.Without exemptions, they say industry will leave Europe for nations where environmental rules cost less. Environmental campaigners disagree and say investment in low carbon energy will give Europe a competitive edge. Dow Chemical is focusing for now on investment in the Middle East and the United States, where shale exploitation has reduced the cost of energy, needed by Dow as a feedstock and for power.Chase said falls in gas prices, as a knock-on from cheaper oil and the impact of liquefied natural gas exports, would displace more coal -- the most carbon intensive fossil fuel -- than intervention on the ETS.He disagreed with calls from Britain and Germany that EU carbon certificates -- at around 7 euros a tonne -- are so cheap that action to cut a surplus of carbon allowances is needed from 2017, four years earlier than the European Commission's original proposal.""If you're an industrial operator, the scheme is the scheme is the scheme. We should not be interfering with it in the current trading period,"" Chase said.A European Parliament committee votes on the issue on Feb. 24, when parliament sources say it could support a 2017 date for action. That would require backing from the full parliament and member states, not all of which agree with Britain and Germany.

The company, however, has not agreed to activist investor Dan Loeb's demand to spin off its low-margin petrochemical businesses, arguing that keeping its units together helps save costs.Dow averted a proxy battle with Loeb by agreeing to add four independent directors to its board last November. Dow said first-quarter sales fell nearly 15 percent to $12.37 billion due to the strong dollar and fall in oil prices. Analysts on average had expected $13.04 billion.The decline in global crude prices has decreased Dow's competitive advantage by reducing the cost difference between natural gas-derived ethane, its key raw material, and oil-derived naphtha, used by its European and Asia rivals.Rival DuPont also reported lower-than-expected sales on Tuesday and said it expects full-year operating earnings to be at the low end of its forecast due to a strong dollar.

The only exception was the agriculture business.Margins at the company's performance plastics unit, its biggest by sales, rose 5.6 percentage points.

109,"   By Joshua Schneyer, Sarah N. Lynch and Brian Grow | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating allegations that Andrew Liveris, chairman and chief executive officer of industrial giant Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N), misused company funds for personal benefit, according to people familiar with the matter.It is not clear whether the SEC investigation is limited to the spending allegations or is broader in scope. Also unclear is whether regulators have ordered Dow, Liveris or other company officials to hand over documents or testify as part of the government's investigation.But Reuters has learned that the SEC did issue subpoenas for thousands of pages of documents and testimony that were part of a whistleblower-retaliation lawsuit brought last year by a former Dow employee, Kimberly Wood. Wood, a fraud investigator at Dow, alleged that company money had financed vacations, sports junkets and other perks for Liveris and his family. Dow settled with Wood earlier this year, and both parties agreed not to discuss the case.  A Dow spokesman did not have immediate comment for this story.The SEC investigation does not mean that regulators have found any wrongdoing. Such investigations can lead to civil cases against companies and their employees, or they can end with no charges, sometimes months or years later.  In May, a Reuters investigation showed that Wood was not the only Dow employee to question whether Liveris, one of the world's best-known CEOs, used his position for his personal benefit. A series of internal examinations by Dow's auditors, including former chief auditor Doug Anderson, spanned a period from 2008 to 2013.Upon leaving the company in 2013, Reuters found, Anderson sent a memo to top company officials labeled ""DOW CONFIDENTIAL."" In it, he raised concerns about what he called ""suspected ethical and compliance issues or violations."" Both Anderson's memo and Wood's lawsuits raised questions about whether spending that involved Liveris was properly accounted for by Dow and accurately disclosed to shareholders and the SEC. In response to the Reuters story, Dow issued a statement to media outlets last month saying the article was inaccurate and included matters that were ""long since closed.

Union Pacific, down 5.7 percent at $92.12 after posting a lower quarterly profit, led the decline in transportation shares and was among the S&P 500's biggest drags. ""The initial take on big earnings reports has been lukewarm at best,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston.""The strong dollar certainly has been mentioned a lot, and I think there are still questions about demand in the economy and what would translate into revenue growth for most reporting companies.""Caterpillar shares fell 3.6 percent to $76.88 and touched a four-year low. The world's largest construction and mining equipment maker reported sales declines in key markets in a sluggish global economy. American Express was down 2.5 percent at $77.01 after its revenue missed expectations, while diversified manufacturer 3M  was down 3.8 percent at $149.50 after cutting its full-year forecast.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 119.09 points, or 0.67 percent, to 17,731.95, the S&P 500 lost 12 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,102.15 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 25.36 points, or 0.49 percent, to 5,146.41.After the bell, however, Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures  turned positive following results from Amazon, whose shares jumped 18 percent in extended trading. Also jumping after the close, Visa shares were up 7 percent following results.During the regular session, all of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were lower with the utilities index leading the decline with a 1.5 percent fall along with the materials index, also down 1.5 percent. Dow Chemical's 5.2 percent drop to $47.45 weighed the most on the sector. Dow Chemical warned of soft demand in China after posting stronger-than-expected results.Second-quarter S&P 500 earnings have been mixed, with 75 percent of companies so far beating analysts' profit expectations and just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.The S&P 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months' earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.Qualcomm fell 3.8 percent to $61.78, a day after the chipmaker said it may break itself up as it delivered its third profit warning this year.NYSE decliners outnumbered advancers 2,099 to 965, while on the Nasdaq, 1,908 issues fell and 869 advanced. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 40 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 143 new lows.About 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.5 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

Out went the tile in the lobby. In the rebranded H Hotel, guests walk on Crema Marfil marble from southeast Spain.Also gone are the old restaurant and its $9.95 lunch buffet with dessert bar. Now the hotel boasts a fine-dining establishment where, planning documents show, prices would be ""2 notches up"" from what the market will bear. The H has a private dining room with bullet-proof glass, where CEO Andrew Liveris, a regular visitor to the White House, can entertain VIPs.By most accounts, the H Hotel is a source of pride here in Dow's hometown of Midland, population 42,000.The remodeling didn't go off without a hitch, though. At completion, it exceeded its $25 million budget by an estimated $13 million. This year, the company settled a lawsuit by one of its former investigators, Kimberly Wood. She alleged she was fired years after she investigated the H Hotel and other spending issues relating to CEO Liveris, according to documents filed in her case.Wood was assigned to scrutinize the renovation after a senior manager complained about the role of a person who figured large in the project, but was neither an employee of Dow nor its contractors: the wife of Andrew Liveris, Dow's chief executive.In a whistleblower-retaliation complaint filed last year, Wood claimed that the ""H Hotel cost overrun was the direct result of the meddling by the CEO's wife, Paula Liveris.""""MISPERCEPTIONS"" BY EMPLOYEES That view is rejected by Dow and by an outside law firm it hired to examine the matter in late 2009. After a three-week inquiry, the lawyers cleared the company of violating any of its own policies.The firm disputed the notion that Paula Liveris exercised undue influence on spending decisions. Rather, its report concluded there were ""misperceptions by some Dow employees about the role and authority of Ms. Liveris.""Other project participants, including the chief architect, offer a different perspective.""Once Paula became involved, the budget was taken off the table and we didn't really talk about it anymore,"" said David Greusel, a former principal at a unit of global architecture firm HOK, which headed up the renovation. ""There was clearly a difference in the design direction. Paula Liveris definitely made choices that we had not made at the outset.""A former Dow executive involved in the project kept for his own use a timeline that he said he created to chart cost increases. By his accounting, decisions advocated by Paula Liveris and a friend who assisted her, local artist Maria ""Mica"" Jones, led to cost increases totaling about $5.8 million.Dow's former top auditor, Doug Anderson, testified in Wood's wrongful-termination lawsuit against the company that he grew concerned about the hotel project in 2009. That year, Wood and a supervisor reported at the time, a Dow manager involved in the hotel came forward to voice concern about the role Paula Liveris had played. He claimed that two employees had been pulled off the project and later left Dow, Wood reported, one after trying to limit the role of Paula Liveris and the other for proving ""ineffective"" in dealing with her.Dow's external report concluded that no employees were retaliated against. One of the two employees removed from the project provided Reuters with a statement saying he retired voluntarily. The external report also said that ""Ms. Liveris did not exercise any authority, implied or actual, over the project budget, and that any perception to the contrary is erroneous and is not supported by the evidence.""""COMPLETELY FALSE"" The H project provides insight into the way the Dow CEO's personal life has intersected with his role as head of the company. Liveris, 61 years old, has led Dow for 11 years.Cost overruns are common in construction, and the H's were readily absorbed by Dow, with $58 billion in annual revenue in 2014. Still, governance specialists said it is rare for the CEO of a large publicly traded company to let a spouse play a prominent part in a deca-million-dollar capital project.""I can't think of a similar example,"" said Robert Daines, co-director of the Rock Center on Corporate Governance at Stanford University. ""The governance concern is whether she was picked for her expertise, or as sort of a perk for the CEO to give his wife a position of prominence.""Former auditor Anderson said in his deposition that he believed the presence of Paula Liveris put other participants in a predicament. ""Who is going to tell the CEO's wife you don't belong here, get out of here, I'm not going to do what you say, when by all appearances and everything else, she's there with the blessing of the CEO?"" he testified.Anderson, who left Dow in 2013, said he was barred by a confidentiality agreement from commenting about the company.Dow says the company has a tradition of inviting executive spouses to pitch in on community projects. Members of the planning group that handled the renovation say Paula Liveris herself never signed off on expenditures. Those were submitted by the project team and approved by David Kepler, the Dow executive who was supervising the project.Kepler, now retired, told Reuters that blame for going over budget rested with others, including two of his subordinates and outside architects. Any notion that ""there was significant overspending and that it was due to interior design choices made by Paula Liveris and Mica Jones is completely false,"" Kepler said.Documents detailing Dow's handling of the renovation are among thousands of pages of records subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Reuters reported in June that the SEC is investigating allegations that CEO Liveris may have misused company funds for personal benefit.Previously, Reuters reported about disputes Liveris had with Anderson and Wood over his spending, including Super Bowl getaways with family and friends.Dow disclosed in 2011 that Liveris reimbursed the company $719,923 for expenses described as ""not primarily business related,"" without detailing them.According to two people familiar with the matter, the SEC has sought information regarding the CEO's spending. It has also inquired in recent months about the terms of confidential severance agreements that Dow has required former employees to sign. The agency, the people said, has asked whether these agreements contain provisions which could impede potential whistleblowers from bringing concerns to the SEC.Dow declined to comment on the SEC investigation.ADVISORY TEAM About 130 miles northwest of Detroit, Midland is a prosperous community, thanks primarily to Dow, its largest employer. But the city is served mainly by chain hotels and casual restaurants. Andrew and Paula Liveris, according to planning documents and interviews, wanted to create a first-class facility in line with Dow's global stature and the couple's exacting standards.The H would aid in revitalizing downtown Midland, wooing hires to the area and entertaining Dow clients and employees from around the world. The renovation also would accommodate a leadership training facility Dow wanted. That facility now occupies a wing of the H.The initial scope was relatively modest. After architects were solicited to bid in January 2006, the estimated cost was less than $16 million. The proposal focused on Dow's training academy and one ""fine dining"" restaurant.Ahead of the first design meeting in February 2006, Liveris told project managers that his wife would act as his representative.Her appointment wasn't the CEO's idea, according to the outside attorney's review. It was suggested by Dow's former head of human resources, Julie Fasone-Holder, who felt Liveris would be too busy to keep close watch over the project. In his stead, she recommended that Paula Liveris volunteer her time and talents.The CEO endorsed the idea. A friend of the couple, Mica Jones, described by Dow as a ""well-known local artist,"" also joined the effort.Paula Liveris attended the initial design session for the H in February 2006, meeting minutes show. In one early 2006 memo, she and Jones are listed as members of the ""Design Advisory Team.""Kepler told top architects and designers ""to feed design information to Paula and Mica who will provide their perspective and counsel,"" according to minutes from a June meeting. ""Paula wants two to three options for the restaurant along the lines of the best restaurants from Chicago or New York.""A NEW DESIGNER That summer, Paula Liveris and Mica Jones recommended hiring a new design architect, according to Greusel: Mark Johnson, based in suburban Detroit.""Once Mark Johnson was on the job, the design just became very different,"" said Greusel, the lead architect. ""To my impressions and tastes, we had gone up a notch from upscale. And it still went higher.""The hiring of Johnson alone, according to the project timeline kept by the former Dow executive, cost an estimated $300,000 more in design fees. Johnson took on the key role of designing the restaurants and executive dining areas, ""per Paula Liveris's request,"" the former executive wrote in an August 2006 entry in his timeline.The former executive provided the information to Reuters on condition of anonymity, saying the severance agreement he signed contains a clause that bars him from discussing his experience at Dow.Johnson declined to comment.Dow says it concluded that more design expertise was needed because HOK's team specialized in sports facilities.By late 2006, the project was bigger and fancier. The finishes would be luxe, ""obtained from around the world,"" says the website of a construction firm that helped run the project. ""Millwork species include cherry, bamboo, walnut, rift white oak (some of which was fumed), maple, makore fiddleback and wenge."" Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer for Dow, responded to Reuters questions about the added luxuries by saying the renovation balanced high-end items with frugal materials, including ""the pervasive use of cement floors, pavers from Michigan, and normal carpeting.""TRIP TO THE MALDIVES Costs swelled. By July 2007, the H's projected budget rose from $25 million to $30 million. Part of that increase, the Dow executive who kept the private timeline wrote, was $2.5 million ""for selecting higher end products by Mrs. Liveris and Jones.""The budget rose again in December - to $33 million. In the timeline, the former Dow executive attributes that bump to $3 million for a ballroom and public corridors. The designs by another company Dow hired, the Anderson/Miller firm, ""used higher end material specified by Mrs. Liveris and Jones,"" the former Dow executive wrote in his private timeline.Anderson/Miller declined to comment.The CEO's wife held great sway over many details, say six people who worked on the project.For instance, an early planning document called for the lobby and vestibule to be floored in limestone tile and carpet. Paula Liveris wanted marble, say three participants. Project and construction managers warned that the hard polished marble could pose a risk of guests slipping. The marble prevailed.Dow spokeswoman Rebecca Bentley said ""the marble used in the H Hotel lobby meets all applicable building codes,"" and she cited the hotel's ""excellent safety record.""As the renovation wound down in late 2008, Dow incurred at least one more expense. Jones received ""two first class tickets to anywhere in the world,"" according to a report written by Dow's external lawyers. Jones and her husband ended up going to the Maldives, the Indian Ocean archipelago known for its beaches and lagoons.Kepler said the gift was his idea, and he found it appropriate, given ""the time Mica spent on the project.""The cost was at least $67,000: about $40,000 for first-class airfare, plus $27,000 to cover the couple's income taxes.In an interview, Kepler said he couldn't recall the final cost of the project. Dow spokeswoman Bentley didn't provide an exact figure.But the internal report written by former fraud investigator Wood and her supervisor, dated Nov. 17, 2009 and marked ""preliminary,"" says that the project went $13 million over budget.Kepler said around ""90 percent"" of the increases stemmed from structural alterations unrelated to interior design. The CEO's wife and her friend had no impact on those costs, he said.CORKAGE FEE Located on Main Street, the chemical company's hotel has sleek white interiors and eating establishments whose names evoke the Periodic Table of Elements. There's Bar Oxygen, Café Zinc, and Table - its main restaurant. Table's menu is pricey for a small city in the Midwest: The Premium Black Angus Petite Filet goes for $40. Index cards from planning meetings that Paula Liveris attended show the thinking that helped shape the restaurant. One mentions New York's renowned French restaurant Le Bernardin - noting that ""Andrew likes the atmosphere.""The CEO became an important customer. After Table opened, according to a separate June 14, 2010 report by Wood, Dow sent to the H two cases of wine the company had purchased. It was Penfold's Grange Shiraz, valued at $354 a bottle, and Liveris ""wanted to be served"" the wine at the hotel's restaurants, the report said. Hotel managers thought wait staff would lose out on tips if the CEO drank from this stock. So, they imposed a corkage fee of $30 a bottle.When Liveris was told by email, ""he wrote that the fee was 'outrageous,'"" Wood reported. The hotel cut the ""personal-use fee"" for Liveris to $15 a bottle. Dow declined to comment.In many ways, Table was the success its planners envisioned. Reviews on websites such as OpenTable rate the restaurant highly. But Table struggled financially, too.The H's former general manager, Lynne Luongo, said Table didn't turn a profit ""or struggled to break even"" during her tenure. Kepler said the H is ""meeting its revenue targets ahead of plan.""""TIME FOR RETIREMENT"" In the spring of 2008, Dow began assigning blame for the busted budget.On May 22, 2008, according to the external report Dow later commissioned, Kepler told Liveris that an extra $15 million to $18 million was needed to finish the hotel. When Liveris asked what went wrong, Kepler replied that ""there is some significant coaching still needed on some of the folks involved,"" and then wrote, ""I will take accountability.""While Kepler kept his job, two of his subordinates on the project didn't: Mike Hayes, a Dow vice president supervising the project, and Peyman Zand, a Dow director handling construction. Both worked closely with Paula Liveris.On May 24, according to Wood, Liveris messaged Kepler and two other executives that it was ""time for retirement"" for Hayes, without saying why. In the email, subject-lined ""Hayes,"" Liveris suggested another executive who could take over the H project. The email is cited in a complaint Wood filed with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.The next day, Kepler forwarded the CEO's email to Dow's general counsel and its HR chief and wrote: ""I agree with the position to have (Hayes) retire  I have a call with Andrew on Tuesday, let me talk to him on this subject and then we can develop a plan.""Asked about the emails, Kepler said he couldn't recall them.SAYING ""NO"" A week later, Dow's external report shows, Kepler informed Liveris that he was removing Zand and Hayes from the project.Hayes decided to retire voluntarily and amicably about a month after the email exchange, he wrote in a statement made in response to Wood's OSHA complaint. Hayes also wrote that Paula Liveris bore no responsibility for cost overruns. Hayes shared his statement with Reuters, but declined to talk for this article.Zand was moved to a new job, according to the external report commissioned by Dow. His new boss found Zand ""unable to perform,"" according to the external report, and Dow eliminated his position later that fall. The report said Zand made no claim of retaliation.Dow's internal investigation into the hotel matter began after Zand's successor on the H project raised concerns, according to the report Wood co-authored. She and her supervisor wrote that the successor, Paul De Pree, ""said he had accepted the position on one condition - that Kepler back him when he said no to Paula.""According to their report, Hayes told Paula Liveris in April 2008 that she could continue working on areas such as the hotel's restaurants, but not on other parts of the hotel. De Pree, Wood and her boss wrote, ""stated that Mike Hayes told him that he said 'no' to Paula and this is why he was no longer in that position.""De Pree also claimed that Zand became ""ineffective in dealing with Paula and Mica and was terminated because the project was out of control,"" Wood reported.LAWYER'S RECOMMENDATION Dow, in its response to Wood's OSHA complaint, said that nothing in the May 2008 email chain about Mike Hayes ""links Mr. Hayes's fate to, or even references, any disagreements with Ms. Liveris regarding the H Hotel."" Hayes later sent CEO Liveris an email of thanks for handling his retirement ""in such a thoughtful manner."" He added: ""I will depart as one of the strongest ambassadors for the company that you could ever hope to have."" Hayes provided the email to Reuters.De Pree still works at Dow and could not be reached for comment. Zand, asked to comment, said he signed a confidentiality agreement and has ""moved on"" from Dow.In their report, Wood and her boss recommended that Dow investigate further. The next month, in December 2009, Anderson told the board's audit committee about the H's budget problems and the concerns about the CEO's wife.The audit committee decided to hire Michael Horowitz, a top lawyer who now serves as inspector general of the U.S. Department of Justice, to handle an external inquiry. His law firm, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, submitted its report in January 2010. Dow shared the report with Reuters.Cadwalader wrote that it interviewed three Dow employees: Kepler, the company's controller, and the executive who fired Zand. The report also noted interviews that Wood's team conducted with four employees: Kepler, Hayes, a Dow staff lawyer, and De Pree, referred to in the external report not by name but as ""the complainant."" The external report said that De Pree ""also expressed concern about possible retaliation against him/her for having come forward with this information, and asked that his/her identity not be disclosed.""A number of key players - the Liverises, Jones, Zand, De Pree, Anderson, architect Greusel and designer Johnson - aren't among the people listed in the report as having been interviewed by the Cadwalader lawyers.Horowitz declined to comment. Dow spokeswoman Bentley called the external probe ""exhaustive."" She said Cadwalader ""concluded unequivocally"" that Hayes was not retaliated against by the company. Nor was Zand, Bentley said, citing the report.While absolving Dow of the concerns raised in its internal investigation, Horowitz did offer a recommendation: that the chemical giant consider creating new guidelines to handle the participation of ""non-employee spouses"" in projects to avoid ""similar misperceptions"" in the future.Dow declined to say whether it followed the attorney's advice.

135,"  * Breen joined in February, named interim CEO in October* Succeeds company veteran Ellen Kullman* Investor Nelson Peltz will welcome move - analysts   (Adds official company name in paragraph 13, recasts some background)By Shubhankar ChakravortyNov 9 DuPont 's interim Chief Executive Edward Breen will keep his job permanently, setting the stage for the executive best known for the turnaround and breakup of Tyco International Plc to complete a wider overhaul of the chemicals and seed producer.Breen's appointment after less than a year with DuPont was announced on Monday and follows the October resignation of his predecessor, company veteran Ellen Kullman, and intense pressure for change from activist shareholder Nelson Peltz.""Breen's appointment will likely be seen as a sign that DuPont's board of directors is considering more radical steps than it did prior to Ellen Kullman's departure,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst James Sheehan. Unlike Kullman, who was with DuPont for nearly three decades and had been CEO since 2009, Breen is a newcomer. As Tyco's CEO from 2002 to 2012, he split into six companies the sprawling conglomerate that was beset by scandal and strategic flipflops.Analysts say Peltz and other investors are likely to welcome Breen's appointment.Peltz's office was not immediately available for comment. As interim CEO, Breen had already started planning changes at DuPont. The company said last week it would consolidate some businesses within two units - one that makes nylon and polyester and another that makes materials such as Kevlar, a synthetic fiber used in body armor.Breen has also said DuPont is in talks with rivals about its agriculture business. Media reports have predicted a possible deal with either Syngenta AG or Dow Chemical Co .DuPont, which has faced sliding sales for nearly two years, has been looking to save about $1.6 billion annually by 2017. Breen has said he will revisit the company's budget allocation. ""We expect further cost cutting ... DuPont might consider $2 billion of additional cost takeout, bringing it closer in line with Peltz's vision for the company,"" Sheehan said.Under Kullman, DuPont successfully fended off an attempt by Peltz's Trian Fund Management to land board seats this year.But Peltz is considering a second attempt to get board seats, people familiar with his thinking told Reuters a day after Kullman's departure.Peltz has urged DuPont, officially known as E I du Pont de Nemours and Co, to separate its volatile materials businesses from more stable areas.DuPont shares, which hit a 17-year peak in March, had dropped by nearly a third from that level just before Kullman's exit, but have made up some of their losses since.The stock was up slightly at $66.27 in early afternoon trading on Monday.

EPA said its study assumed the components did not have such ""synergistic effects.""""The information suggests that EPA's analysis may have understated the phytotoxicity of the product,"" the EPA said in the court filing.Dow Chemical said it has sent the EPA all of its data to provide further assurances for Enlist Duo. The company did not rule out changes to instructions for use on the existing product label. Dow told Reuters on Wednesday it will respond to the EPA's petition by the court's Dec. 7 deadline and expects any questions to be resolved in time for U.S. farmers to use it next season.POSSIBLE PROBLEMS The move by the EPA is tied to a lawsuit filed by U.S. farmer and environmental groups, who are trying to get the regulatory approval of Enlist Duo permanently overturned. The critics claim the EPA had not adequately analyzed the impact of 2,4-D before granting approval. This current regulatory issue could create a problem for Dow and its plans to sell off its agribusiness division, at a time when mergers and acquisitions talk is roiling.Dow said last month it would ""review all options"" for its farm chemicals and seeds unit, which has reported falling sales for nearly a year.If new federal regulatory approvals for Dow's Enlist Duo are not eventually granted by the EPA, it could negatively impact Dow's EBITDA in 2020, Bernstein analyst Jonas Oxgaard wrote Wednesday, and reduce ""the sales price of Dow ag by $2-$3 billion.""Regulatory delays could be a boon for Syngenta AG  and Bayer CropScience, whose products compete against Enlist Duo, said Oxgaard. CRITICS CHEER Environmental groups cheered the EPA's move, as some research has linked the herbicide's component to declines in bee and butterfly populations and cancer risks in humans.Seed companies that already have licensing agreements to use Enlist technology in their own products say they are unlikely to see much immediate impact.Stine Seeds currently has no products on the market, said spokesperson David Thompson, while DuPont Pioneer ended a multiyear product development agreement with Dow in January, and does not have any seeds in the market containing Enlist technology, spokesperson Jane Slusark said.Monsanto told Reuters its own next generation herbicide platform Xtend, which combines the herbicide dicamba with glyphosate, was unlikely to face similar problems.""Monsanto's patent submissions have not made claims of synergistic activity between glyphosate and dicamba,"" Monsanto spokesperson Sara Miller said.Dow Chemical's shares closed down 2.7 percent at $51.92 on Wednesday.

144,"   By Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) has struck a deal to sell a part of its global herbicide business, as low crop prices continue to drive talk of consolidation in the agriculture industry.Dow on Monday said it agreed to sell a portfolio of weed killers known as dinitroanilines to privately held Gowan Company. The deal comes a month after Dow said it was reviewing all options for its farm chemicals and seeds unit, which has reported falling sales for nearly a year.The companies did not disclose terms of the deal. It is expected to close by the end of the year, they said.The farm sector is struggling to cope with falling crop prices and diminished demand for crop protection products, which have hurt sales in the agricultural businesses at companies including Dow, Monsanto Co (MON.N) and EI du Pont de Nemours & Co (DD.N).     Dow's sale includes global product registrations and trademarks for herbicides including Treflan, which can be sprayed on field corn, cotton and some fruit and vegetables, according to a statement. A formulation and packaging facility in Alberta, Canada, is also part of the deal.Dinitroanilines, or DNA herbicides, have been a part of weed management programs for more than 50 years, according to Dow. The company will ""invest in innovative and differentiated products,” Ramiro De La Cruz, vice president of crop protection for Dow AgroSciences, said in the statement. A company spokeswoman did not immediately answer questions seeking more information.""We are grateful for the opportunity to defend and evolve the DNAs for niches that have long been our sweet spot, such as vegetables and turf,"" said Juli Jessen, chief executive of Gowan Group. Dow rival Monsanto has said it is studying every possibility for consolidation in the seed and agrochemical sectors.Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, abandoned a $45 billion bid for Syngenta AG SYNN.VX in August and since then, nearly all of the major players in the farm chemicals and seeds business have been the subject of consolidation talk.

145,"   By Brian Grow and Joshua Schneyer | ATLANTA/NEW YORK  ATLANTA/NEW YORK For Dow Chemical Co chief executive Andrew Liveris, a merger with rival DuPont Co would come at a convenient moment, as he faces fresh pressure from a major investor and an ongoing federal investigation into the CEO’s spending.According to people familiar with the matter, Dow and DuPont are in advanced talks to combine the storied companies into a chemicals giant with sales of more than $90 billion. DuPont’s new chief executive, Ed Breen, would likely retain a CEO role, and Liveris could be appointed executive chairman. The combined entity would then be split into three parts, say the people familiar with the matter.Dow and DuPont haven’t confirmed the talks and declined to comment on the matter.For Liveris, Dow’s chairman and CEO, a merger could help fend off the possibility of renewed attacks by activist hedge fund Third Point. The fund, led by investor Daniel Loeb, last year pressed for a break-up of Dow in an effort to boost a share price that hasn’t gained much during Liveris’s 11-year tenure as CEO. A deal also could resolve questions about succession at Dow. Members of the company’s board have recently considered whether Dow should replace Liveris as CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter. Liveris has spoken publicly about the possibility of his retiring in coming years. But the threat from activists and an SEC investigation also have factored into the board’s thinking, this person said. News of the merger discussion comes less than a week before the Dec. 14 expiration of a year-long truce between Dow and Third Point. Liveris came under attack last year from the activist investor, which had acquired a 2 percent stake in Dow.Loeb launched a campaign chastising Liveris for alleged “broken promises” – from cutting dividend payments to ill-timed acquisitions. Those steps, Loeb contended, left Dow undervalued. Third Point pushed at the time for a break-up of Dow by spinning off its petrochemicals business from its specialty chemicals unit.A truce began last November, when Dow agreed to appoint two new board directors of Third Point’s choosing, and two more selected by the company.With the truce about to end, analysts and other investors say they were expecting the possibility that Third Point might launch a proxy battle, in an effort to replace Liveris and others on Dow’s board.Dow did not respond to questions for this article.Whether Loeb will resume his campaign against Liveris is unclear. Third Point declined to comment.A Dow investor at another fund said pulling off the largest-ever chemical industry merger would likely curb Third Point’s pressure on Dow. Following the news of the potential merger, Dow’s share price surged as much as 11.8 percent on Wednesday to $56.91, its highest level ever during Liveris’ tenure as CEO.Questions about how long Liveris would continue running Dow already had been swirling at company headquarters in Midland, Michigan. POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS In October, Liveris announced the formation of a new leadership team – elevating long-time Dow executive Jim Fitterling to chief operating officer, and giving chief financial officer Howard Ungerleider the additional title of vice chairman.Those two Dow executives were viewed as the leading internal candidates to replace Liveris as CEO. One director described a transition as potentially only months away, according to a person familiar with the matter.But some members of Dow’s board of directors were also evaluating the possibility of replacing Liveris with an external candidate, according to the person familiar with the matter. Those discussions remained informal, and it isn’t clear how far along they were, the source said.Dennis Reilley, chairman of the board's compensation and leadership development committee, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Three other Dow board members also didn't reply to requests for comment. The uncertainty at Dow has been driven in part by a federal investigation of the company stemming from a series of internal inquiries into Liveris’s own spending practices.Reuters reported in June that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating allegations that Liveris may have misused company funds for personal benefit, according to people familiar with the matter. Documents detailing internal inquiries into Liveris’s spending and other issues are among thousands of pages of records subpoenaed by the SEC.Dow hasn't commented on the SEC’s investigation, but has said that the spending allegations were long ago investigated. The company disclosed in a 2011 proxy that Liveris had reimbursed the company for $719,923 of expenses described as “not primarily business related,” without detailing them. The matter is closed, the company says. ""Reuters has simply recycled old allegations that the company made public long ago and addressed through independent review, enhanced audits, and improved controls,” Dow said in a statement in June.Last year, a former fraud investigator at Dow, Kimberly Wood, alleged that company money had financed vacations, sports junkets and other perks for Liveris and his family. Dow settled a lawsuit with Wood earlier this year, and both parties agreed not to discuss the case.Dow's in-house auditors conducted a series of internal examinations into the CEO’s activities from 2008 to 2013, Reuters reported in May. The SEC investigation does not mean that regulators have found any wrongdoing. Such investigations can lead to civil cases against companies and their employees, or they can end with no charges, sometimes months or years later.HOMETOWN'S FATE HANGS IN THE BALANCE Australian-born Liveris, 61, has spent 11 years leading Dow. He has earned more than $20 million annually, served as an adviser on manufacturing to U.S. President Barack Obama, and is often a featured speaker at events such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.A merger with DuPont could offer him an elder-statesman role leading the board of the new company, while Breen - known for his skill at splitting up companies - would oversee day-to-day operations as CEO.News of a potential deal raises questions for the residents of Midland, Michigan, the small city where Dow has been headquartered since the late 1800s. One consequence might be more layoffs in Michigan, where Dow has already substantially downsized under Liveris.In July, Liveris announced plans to build a new 150,000-square-foot headquarters building on Dow’s corporate campus, as a symbol of “Dow’s commitment to Midland,” the company said in a statement at the time. Dow broke ground on the project this fall.In August, in response to Reuters reporting on Dow and Liveris, more than 100 community leaders and businesses in Midland ran advertisements in the local newspaper praising the company and its chief executive.“We, the residents and local businesses of Midland, are proud that Dow calls Midland ‘home,’” the ad said. “We proudly support Dow leadership and CEO Andrew Liveris, just as Dow has supported us since 1897.”Dow did not respond to a request for comment on what would happen to its presence in Midland in the event of a merger.

The prospect of a merger between chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont boosted those shares. Dow Chemical  was last up 11 percent while DuPont was last up 12 percent. The dollar was sharply lower in afternoon trading, as the severe selling that characterized last week's plunge against the euro after disappointment over European Central Bank policy moves appeared to have resumed. The euro rose to $1.0966 after hitting a high of $1.1030, a level not seen since early November; it was seen as something of a surprise ahead of the Dec. 15-16 Federal Reserve meeting on U.S. monetary policy.""This is just an old-fashioned clean-out in a thin market that's jittery ahead of next week,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.""I think the dollar is going to bounce back, though, particularly if you have continued risk aversion in other markets, in equities and commodities.""

149,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Sneha Banerjee  Dec 9 Merger talks between Dow Chemical Co  and DuPont are likely to have been precipitated by shareholder pressure and weakening demand for crop-protection chemicals, and such a deal would have been unlikely even a few months ago.Stocks of both companies jumped 12 percent on Wednesday - Dow's to a record high of $56.80. DuPont hit a high of $74.62.The Wall Street Journal first reported on Tuesday that the companies were in advanced talks to merge to become a $120 billion chemicals giant, and then split into three companies focused on agriculture, specialty chemicals and materials.""I think a deal like this couldn't have happened 3-6 months ago,"" said Sachin Shah, a merger arbitrage strategist at Albert Fried & Co, noting the companies' sluggish stock performance had made a deal more doable.Dow Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said as recently as October that his company was not in the market for ""big M&A"". The deal, which Reuters sources and other media said would be presented as a ""merger of equals"", would value DuPont's stock at as much as $82 and Dow's at as much as $68, trading firm Dragonfly Capital founder Greg Harmon said.Dow and DuPont are struggling to cope with falling demand for farm chemicals, even as the companies' plastics units have reported a rise in margins thanks to low natural gas prices. Reports of the potential deal comes a week before the expiry of a standstill agreement between Dow and Daniel Loeb, under which the activist investor was to refrain from publicly criticizing the company for a year.Dow added four independent directors to its board in November 2014, averting a proxy fight with Loeb, who had been calling for a split of the company's petrochemical business from its specialty chemical units.DuPont, similarly, faced pressure from Nelson Peltz to separate its agriculture, nutrition and biosciences units from its building and safety materials divisions. Peltz lost a proxy battle for DuPont's board seats in May, but Chief Executive Ellen Kullman stepped down in October, having lost the confidence of the company's shareholders.Her successor, Ed Breen - known for overseeing the breakup of conglomerate Tyco International Plc - was key in getting talks going with Dow, analysts and investors said.(Reporting by Swetha Gopinath and Kanika Sikka in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)",2015-12-09,DOW,"Wed Dec 9, 2015 | 10:12am EST","Dow-DuPont talks driven by investor pressure, weak farm demand",http://www.reuters.com//article/dow-ma-dupont-idUSL3N13Y48K20151209?type=companyNews

151,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Chemical titans DuPont and Dow Chemical Co have agreed to combine in an all-stock merger valued at $130 billion in a first step toward breaking up into three separate businesses, a move that pleased activist investors and could trigger more consolidation.The ""deal of three centuries,"" as Wells Fargo analyst Frank Mitsch dubbed it, combines two of the biggest and oldest U.S. chemical producers and will generate cost and tax savings.Dow and DuPont shares fell on Friday after spiking earlier in the week following reports of negotiations. The deal, announced on Friday, will face intense regulatory scrutiny, analysts said, especially over combining their agricultural businesses, which sell seeds and crop protection chemicals, including insecticides and pesticides.Executives from both companies said the agrichemicals businesses have little overlap and any asset sales would likely be minor.Potential tax savings were one reason for the complicated merger-before-breakup deal, analysts said. ""They need to merge first in order for the subsequent spinoffs to qualify as tax-free transactions in the United States,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst James Sheehan. Dow shareholders would own 52 percent of the new company after preferred shares are converted, the companies said.

Dow also will assume full control of silicone products maker Dow Corning, its joint venture with Corning Inc.The three-way split into material sciences, specialty products, and seeds and agrichemicals, is likely to occur 18 to 24 months after the merger deal closes.Credit rating agency Moody's reaffirmed its A3 rating for DuPont, but changed its outlook to negative, citing among other factors the complexities of combining the agricultural businesses. It kept Dow's ratings at Baa2 and outlook stable. ""VERY SUPPORTIVE""  The proposed merger puts pressure on rivals such as BASF and Bayer AG to consolidate as falling crop prices curb sales.""The biggest impact will certainly be in the agriculture market, where the seeds and crop chemical industries are to undergo rapid consolidation,"" SunTrust's Sheehan said.It could also prompt a renewed flurry of takeover bids for European rivals, with Syngenta AG the most likely target.Monsanto Co may take another shot at Syngenta, according to analysts. It abandoned a $45 billion offer for the Swiss company in August.Monsanto said Friday it would not act rashly and likes its position in the marketplace. Rivals such as Bayer, BASF, Solvay SA and Eastman Chemical Co might benefit in the near term while Dow and DuPont integrate, said Nomura analyst Aleksey Yefremov. He noted the two companies' cultures differ, with DuPont more ""research and growth-driven"" and Dow focused on tight cost controls and reasonable innovation. ""There is a big execution risk,"" Yefremov said. ""It's a very large transaction.""One DuPont shareholder described the deal as merely ""OK.""""Our initial take is, given the commodity nature of Dow’s business and the resulting low barriers to entry, the valuation is not obviously attractive,"" said Grayson Witcher, portfolio manager at Mawer Investment Management Ltd.DuPont, part of the Dow Jones industrial average, closed down 5.5 percent to $70.44 on Friday. Dow Chemical was off 2.8 percent at $53.37. Major market indexes closed down about 2 percent and posted their biggest weekly losses since August.REGULATORY SCRUTINY U.S. antitrust enforcers will not look at the deal as simply a combination of two conglomerates but examine their many products to determine where competition will be lost. Regulators will be especially concerned about the agricultural sector, which could see big divestitures, antitrust experts said. ""It's hard to know whether the fixes would work,"" said John Taladay of law firm Baker Botts LLP.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, said there could be problems in dominance of seed sales.""The (seed) market is already dominated by Monsanto. You're almost creating a duopoly in the market, and that's a problem,"" she said. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over antitrust policy, will listen to farmers' concerns, Chairman Chuck Grassley said in a statement.""DuPont and Dow are two titans of American industry and the proposed merger demands serious scrutiny,"" he said.Klein and Co, Lazard and Morgan Stanley are Dow's financial advisers.

167,"   By Michael Flaherty  One of Ashland Inc's (ASH.N) largest shareholders is urging the chemical maker to halt plans to spin off its Valvoline business and instead seek a buyer for its specialty chemicals unit, according to a slide presentation seen by Reuters.     Elmrox Investment Group LLC, which says it owns more than $100 million in Ashland stock, said Valvoline would be more valuable as a stand-alone company and suggested it be structured as a master limited partnership.As for the specialty chemicals arm, which makes compounds that go into personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and energy industry fluids, Elmrox says the division could be acquired for roughly twice the multiple the entire company currently commands.Elmrox cited the proposed merger of DuPont (DD.N) and Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) as an example of industry consolidation.The hope is for Ashland shareholders to collect some change-in-control premium while the ""iron is hot"", Don Bilson, head of event-driven research at Gordon Haskett, wrote in a research note.  ""That said, we don’t see the market for chemical deals to be red hot at the moment,"" Bilson said in the note.Ashland shares opened lower on Wednesday, hitting $93.62 and then rebounded, inching up 0.3 percent to around $96.50 toward the end of the session. Last year, Covington, Kentucky-based Ashland said it would spin off Valvoline, its engine lubricants unit, into a publicly traded company, as it seeks to shed assets that are not part of its core specialty chemicals business. The spinoff would help mark the final step in Ashland's decade-long shift from an oil refiner to a specialty chemicals maker, the company said in September.Prior to Elmrox's push for change, which includes suggesting the company grant the investor representation inside its board room, activist Jana Partners had targeted Ashland. Jana bought a 7.4 percent stake and pushed for changes in the company’s structure and better capital returns, a campaign that helped lead to sales of several non-core businesses. Jana sold its stake early last year, according to filings. Elmrox says in its presentation that if Valvoline, which makes motor oil and automotive chemicals and also operates retail repair shops, was structured as a master limited partnership and the chemicals business sold, Ashland investors could see total value of more than $250 per share.""We are confident that our planned separation of Ashland into two great independent, public companies is our best path forward to enhance shareholder value,"" Ashland spokesman Gary Rhodes said in a statement.

Negotiations are in final stages but nothing has been signed, the two sources said.It will likely be announced on Wednesday, when Syngenta is scheduled to release 2015 results, the people said.One source said minor adjustments to the price were still being discussed.Syngenta shares closed 3.7 percent higher at 392.30 francs in European trade on Tuesday. ChemChina's offer would be at a premium of about 24 percent to Syngenta's Monday close of 378.40 francs.Syngenta will not have to pay a considerable breakup fee if the buyout fails, the two sources said. While this potentially leaves the door open for peers including U.S. seed company Monsanto Co or BASF SE to top ChemChina's offer, the people said that Syngenta was not actively soliciting counter bids.Syngenta last year spurned takeover approaches from Monsanto, arguing it can create value on its own.Last month, Monsanto's CEO said attempts to re-engage Syngenta about a potential takeover had been difficult but that he believed there was still ""a significant opportunity"" for integration between the companies.Syngenta declined to comment. ChemChina was not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours. Bloomberg had reported earlier on Tuesday that the deal worth 43.7 billion Swiss francs was near. (bloom.bg/20DQ4KP)Any deal would likely be reviewed by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which probes transactions with potential national security implications, but two CFIUS experts said they doubted that the inter-agency group would stop it.""It looks like they (Syngenta) have a lot of U.S. operations but it doesn't look like they are sensitive,"" said one CFIUS expert, adding that he would be ""very surprised"" if the company failed to register the merger with the agency.It is rare for CFIUS to stop a deal, although it did block Philips' sale of high-end lights to China's GO Scale Capital just last month. Given other mergers in agricultural chemicals, such as DuPont's and Dow Chemical Co's agreement to combine, Syngenta Chairman Michel Demare recently conceded that ""going it alone is hardly possible,"" given what shareholders were expecting.The likely takeover price would nominally match Monsanto's revised cash-and-stock bid made last August but the value of that offer would have fallen along with Monsanto's share price.ChemChina's move marks another instance of the country's quest for Western technology and distribution networks.Similar transactions include last year's buyout of Italian tyre maker Pirelli by ChemChina. In January, ChemChina announced the acquisition of German industrial machinery maker KraussMaffei Group for about $1 billion.The Chinese government is keen to boost farming productivity as it seeks to cut reliance on food imports amid limited farm land, a growing population and higher meat consumption.A global glut of corn and soybeans has depressed grain prices for the past three years, prompting U.S. farmers to reduce spending on everything from equipment to seeds and pesticides. The cutbacks, along with pressure from investors and a desire to bolster profit, have sent many of the world's largest agricultural companies scrambling to cut deals.The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that net farm income sank to $55.9 billion last year, down nearly 55 percent from an all-time high in 2013. Prices for U.S. corn have halved from three years ago.

177,"   By Joshua Schneyer and Swetha Gopinath  Dow Chemical’s (DOW.N) chief executive Andrew Liveris, fresh from orchestrating a $130 billion merger with U.S. rival DuPont, on Tuesday announced plans to retire by mid-2017, a step he takes after years of pitched battles with an activist shareholder unhappy with his leadership. On a quarterly earnings call with analysts, Liveris said he would step aside by the second half of next year. The news represents a victory for Daniel Loeb, the head of New York hedge fund Third Point. The fund has a 2 percent stake in Dow and Loeb has been questioning Dow’s leadership since 2014, amid slumping share prices.    A 40-year veteran of Dow, Liveris has been CEO of the Midland, Michigan-based company since 2004. Over that period, the Australian engineer has become one of the world’s best known CEOs, delivering keynotes at the Davos World Economic Forum, and serving on an advisory panel to U.S. President Barack Obama. On Tuesday, Liveris suggested that he will stick around long enough to see through Dow’s merger with DuPont, which envisages combining the storied U.S. chemicals companies and then splitting them into three separate businesses. If the plan succeeds, the firms that emerge will be global powerhouses in the plastics, specialty chemicals and agricultural seeds industries. Liveris will leave “when we are set up to be spun off, but no later than the end of Q2 2017.”   When the merger was announced on Dec. 11, the companies said that Liveris planned to take on the role of executive chairman of the combined firm, while DuPont’s CEO Edward Breen would become CEO. Although Liveris could still be executive chairman for a short time, his plans to depart quickly took some on Wall Street by surprise. The announcement may have helped boost Dow’s share price on Tuesday, when it rose by  5.8 percent to $45.03, a three week high. It came after Dow also reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street’s expectations. “Investors now have some certainty about when Mr. Liveris will be stepping down,” said Arun Viswanathan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York. “That was likely a factor in today’s stock performance. There had been uncertainty about what future role he might play once the merger is complete.” INVESTOR CONCERNS  Loeb has said he approves of the merger plans, but called for removing Liveris from the company’s leadership to allow new blood to take the helm. The move may quell investor concerns about any future power struggle between Liveris and Breen, an executive best known for splitting up U.S. manufacturer Tyco in the wake of an accounting scandal. It was not immediately clear what role, if any, Loeb and Third Point played in negotiating the timeline for Liveris’s departure. The Dow chairman and CEO, age 61, had said in the past that he was contemplating retirement. Liveris said the timeline would “enable successful leadership handover.” A Dow representative said his plans had nothing to do with any pressure from Loeb. ""We thank Mr. Liveris for his role in effectuating the Dow/DuPont merger and wish him success in his next chapter,” Loeb said in a statement. “We look forward to engaging constructively with the new management teams at the combined Dow/DuPont’s post-merger spin-cos as they create significant value for shareholders."" Dow and DuPont expect their merger to close later this year, while spin offs into three separate companies could happen next year.For the past year, the tension between Dow and Third Point has largely played out behind the scenes. After Loeb launched a damning 2014 public campaign accusing Liveris of “broken promises” to Dow shareholders during his tenure, Dow and the hedge fund reached a one-year agreement to refrain from criticizing each other. As part of the deal, four new independent directors were appointed to Dow’s board, two of whom were designated by Third Point. That agreement ended in December, and Loeb began expressing concerns once again about Liveris. In a letter to the company’s board, he reportedly questioned whether the DuPont merger was rushed to completion to avoid a public conflict with Third Point. He also opposed Liveris remaining on as a key executive after the merger.INTERNAL AUDIT   In addition to sparring with Loeb, Liveris also has been contending with a controversy over his spending of Dow funds. Reuters reported last year that internal auditors at Dow had for years questioned whether the CEO was spending company funds on non-business items including family vacations. Dow says any spending issues were resolved long ago. In a 2011 proxy statement, Dow said that Liveris had reimbursed more than $719,000 in primarily non-business expenses that the company’s Customer Events department had failed to bill him for due to processing errors.Reuters reported last June that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had taken an interest in the matter, launching an investigation into Dow. The misspending allegations were laid out in now settled lawsuits filed by a former Dow fraud investigator, Kimberly Wood, who said she was fired after repeatedly questioning the CEO’s spending. The SEC has declined comment on its investigation. Also on Tuesday, Dow said it was naming its chief operating officer, James Fitterling, as the company's new president. Fitterling will report to Liveris until the CEO departs. A 32-year veteran of Dow, Fitterling has served in various executive roles and his elevation to president may signal that he is being groomed for one of the leading post-merger executive positions.Ahead of the merger, Dow is targeting an additional $300 million in cost savings this year, building on the $345 million it realized last year.It also plans to cut 500 more jobs, taking its total workforce reduction to 2,200, Liveris said, adding that the company has laid off 1,200 employees so far. Dow employed 49,500 people worldwide in 2015.Dow’s fourth quarter adjusted profit of 93 cents per share handily beat the average analyst estimate of 70 cents.

179,"  (Adds details, quote)PARIS Feb 17 French oilseed producer Avril announced a partnership with Dow Chemical Co unit Dow AgroSciences on Wednesday to develop protein-rich rapeseed.The deal will be based on non-genetically modified (GMO) seed technology developed by Dow AgroSciences in Canada, which boosts protein content by 20 percent, Avril's Deputy Director General Michel Boucly told reporters.""Dow has developed a canola with the same level of oil but enriched with protein and they are launching it on the Canadian market in 2016. We are not pleased at all because they are our competitors so we negotiated (...) an exclusive license deal to develop this technology for French producers,"" he said.Dow's canola, a type of rapeseed which is grown in the spring, will be adapted to be cultivated in the winter as virtually all other rapeseed in France. It will then be made available for seed makers. The new seeds will not be available until 2025. Boucly noted the protein would be non-GMO as opposed to imported soybean. GMOs are controversial in Europe, notably in France.Avril, which is owned by oilseed crop growers, declined to give financial details of the partnership, but said it would contribute to Dow's research through its financial arm Sofiproteol.""The idea is that there be more protein from France and less imported,"" Avril Director General Jean-Philippe Puig said. Avril produces biodiesel, vegetable oil, oleochemical solutions, animal feed and other food products such as eggs.It sees the protein market as the one with the most potential with a deficit estimated at 58 million tonnes in 2030. ""By 2030, vegetable protein demand will be 15 percent higher than offer,"" Boucly said, pointing to people in emerging economies eating more meat as well as higher demand in developed countries.Avril had sales of 6.1 billion euros ($6.8 bln) in 2015, down 5 percent from 2014 due mainly to a slump in crude oil prices which affected its biofuels activities, lower feed demand from a declining livestock sector and difficulties in passing on higher vegetable oil prices to supermarkets.Dow is in the process of merging with chemical maker DuPont  to form a chemical and seed producer.The deal, announced in December, will face intense regulatory scrutiny, analysts said, especially over combining their agricultural businesses, which sell seeds and crop protection chemicals.

193,"  (Adds details, analyst comment, share price)March 31 British nanotechnology company Nanoco Group Plc said on Thursday that its full-year revenue would be less than expected due to lower royalty payments from Dow Chemical Co after the two amended a licence agreement.Nanoco's shares fell as much as 8 percent to 42.28 pence in early trading on the London Stock Exchange.The company partnered with Dow Chemical in 2014, giving the U.S. company exclusive right to use its cadmium-free quantum dot technology to mass produce quantum dots. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals, 10,000 times finer than a human hair, that can convert electrical energy into light and be manipulated to produce precise colours in display.Nanoco said on Thursday that the agreement was amended to make it a non-exclusive one, which would result in Dow paying the British company lower royalty rates and no earn-out income. ""Nanoco is expected to use other partners to speed up its penetration of other markets outside of Korea,"" analysts at Liberum wrote in a note. The brokerage added that amended agreement also potentially made Nanoco a more appealing acquisition target than it was when its technology was exclusive to Dow.Prior to the announcement, analysts expected Nanoco's revenue to rise to 4.99 million pounds ($7.2 million) for the year ending July from 2.03 million a year earlier.Last year the company's rival Nanosys signed a multi-year agreement with South Korean television maker Samsung Electronics Co.

Last month Loeb wrote to investors that savvy bets on the energy market had helped the portfolio gain 4.6 percent in the second quarter, beating the broader Standard & Poor's stock market.""We came into the year with a short credit portfolio that we reversed sharply in February, getting long over $1B in energy credit,"" Third Point said in its latest quarterly letter to clients.

Among Loeb's biggest holdings, he cut his stake in Dow Chemical Co by 20 percent as the firm sold 5 million shares. At the end of the second quarter he owned 20 million shares.Third Point made nearly two dozen new investments in U.S. stocks, which were revealed in quarterly 13F filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filings show what stocks funds owned at the end of the last quarter.  Third Point also exited Signet Jewelers, a widely owned stock that fell 34 percent in the second quarter.
