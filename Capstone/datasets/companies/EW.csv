0,"  Jan 15 A U.S. jury strengthened Edwards Lifesciences Corp's efforts to protect sales of the company's transcatheter heart valve implants, by ruling that a competing product from Medtronic Inc infringes its patent.Medtronic will appeal the award of more than $390 million in damages made by the jury in a federal court in Delaware and oppose any request for an injunction, the company said on Wednesday.Edwards said later in the day the ruling that Medtronic willfully infringed its patent entitled it to seek increased damages of up to three times the value of the award, in addition to attorneys' fees.It said it would move to enforce the verdict and seek a permanent injunction against Medtronic's CoreValve heart valve implant.""This (type of prolonged dispute) is fairly uncommon,"" Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang said. Unlike the two rivals, most companies would have opted to cross-license their patents after such extended litigation, she said. Wang said continuing the litigation could help Edwards protect its monopoly in the U.S. transcatheter aortic valve replacement market through 2016-2017, when some of its patents face expiry.Edwards will lose protection in December 2017 for its U.S. Cribier transcatheter heart valve patent, which covers its most important product line - the Sapien system.The Sapien system allows surgeons to replace diseased heart valves by threading the new valve into place through an artery via a catheter, sparing patients chest cracking and open heart surgery. Edwards reported transcatheter heart valves sales of $172 million for its third quarter ended Sept. 30.In 2010, a jury in the same Delaware court awarded damages to Edwards after it found that Medtronic infringed Edwards's Andersen transcatheter heart valve patent. That decision was upheld on appeal and Medtronic made an initial payment of $84 million to Edwards last year. However, additional damages are still pending, Edwards said.Last July, a German court also ruled that CoreValve, approved for sale in Europe, infringed Edwards's patent.Medtronic said it expected U.S. approval for the CoreValve implant system by the end of its fiscal year ending April 2014.The U.S. market for transcatheter aortic valve replacements is expected to reach $2 billion by 2016, BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch told Reuters last February.Shares of Irvine, California-based Edwards closed up about 2 percent at $71.89 on the New York Stock Exchange.

8,"  (Adds independent doctor comments)By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell PiersonWASHINGTON, March 30 The minimally invasive aortic heart valve replacement system from Edwards Lifesciences Corp performed better than a rival product sold by Medtronic Inc in the first head-to-head study of the two, according to data from a small German trial presented at a major heart meeting on Sunday.The results are unlikely to be seen as decisive given the size and limited scope of the study. But they could provide the Edwards sales force with a valuable marketing tool as the two companies vie for market share with their competing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, systems.Both systems employ a catheter to thread the new valve through an artery into place in the heart, sparing patients too frail for open heart surgery from the invasive chest cracking procedure. The Edwards Sapien XT uses a balloon to expand the compressed valve once it is in position in the diseased valve, while the Medtronic CoreValve has a special self expanding valve using an alloy that reacts to body heat to open.The results were presented at the American College of Cardiology's annual scientific sessions in Washington.In the 241-patient study conducted at five German hospitals, doctors using the Edwards balloon expandable system reported a success rate of 95.9 percent compared with a 77.5 percent success rate for those using the Medtronic alternative.A successful procedure was defined as one in which the valve was implanted in the correct position and provided a tight enough seal to prevent blood leakage across the valve.Patients receiving the Edwards valve also reported improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness, chest pain and dizziness 30 days after the procedure at a higher rate than those in the Medtronic group: 94.3 percent versus 86.7 percent.""We have two main types of valves available for this procedure, and until now, there was no conclusive data about their relative effectiveness,"" Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Wahab, the study's lead investigator, said in a statement. NO DIFFERENCE IN DEATH OR STROKE RATES But the definitions of effectiveness used as the primary goals for the German study may be viewed as limited in value.Virtually all doctors who perform heart valve replacements, typically in patients aged 80 and older, agree that the most important clinical results for these procedures are rates of death and stroke. By those all-important measures, there was no significant difference between the two TAVR systems 30 days after the procedure. ""Medtronic believes that physicians will look to more rigorous trials with hard clinical endpoints when evaluating these valves to provide reliable guidance on TAVR device selection,"" Medtronic said in a statement.Medtronic also took issue with the method used to assess aortic valve leakage in the independent German study, calling the angiography readings ""the least effective measure for determining aortic regurgitation.""The researchers plan to follow the patients for five years to compare the longer-term health outcomes of the two groups, which is likely to yield more meaningful information.""It's possible some of these differences might not persist over time,"" said Dr. Saul Vizel, a cardiologist with Cambridge Memorial Hospital in Cambridge, Ontario, who was not involved in the study. ""The jury is still out for sure, because they're doing one-year and two-year follow-ups and people will wait for those.""Dr. Patrick O'Gara, incoming president of the American College of Cardiology from Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, also was not ready to declare a  winner based on the German study. ""I would like to see a larger trial with more endpoints,"" O'Gara said. ""It would be premature to overinterpret these findings.""Not surprisingly, Edwards Lifesciences had a more favorable view of the findings than Medtronic.""This independent, multi-center randomized study is consistent with the experience in Europe, where more clinicians choose Sapien XT over CoreValve for the treatment of their patients,"" Edwards spokeswoman Sarah Huoh said in an emailed statement. ""These data are reflective of the findings of multiple, real-world European registries.""TAVR procedures have been performed in Europe since 2007 but are relatively new in the United States. The first Sapien system gained U.S. approval in 2011, and Medtronic's CoreValve was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January.The CoreValve uses a smaller, potentially easier-to-maneuver, catheter than the original Sapien. Edwards expects U.S. approval of the next-generation Sapien XT with a similarly smaller catheter in the coming months.More than 100,000 people in the United States have severe aortic stenosis, with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart surgery, making them potential TAVR candidates.Industry analysts expect the Sapien XT and CoreValve to be important future growth drivers for Edwards and Medtronic.""We now have new valves coming out that will probably be even better,"" Abdel-Wahab said. ""These results can help inform the design of future devices.""

11,"   By Susan Kelly  Shares of Edwards Lifesciences Corp jumped 13 percent on Monday after a U.S. court temporarily halted sales of competitor Medtronic Inc's heart valve implant that uses a less-invasive procedure to spare patients from open-heart surgery.The ruling, by a U.S. District Court in Delaware on Friday, came after earlier court decisions that found Medtronic's CoreValve infringed on Edwards' Sapien transcatheter valve product.The court agreed to postpone implementation of the ruling for seven days to allow Medtronic to appeal.Medtronic on Monday said it filed a motion in appeals court seeking an emergency stay of the preliminary injunction.The lower court on Friday ordered both companies to come to an agreement that would help physicians at facilities currently trained to use the CoreValve system to a make a clinical judgment as to which device to implant. Analysts said the ruling came as a surprise and that the court would still have to weigh the injunction against the public interest.""How does a judge take a product off the market that has shown an ability to reduce mortality,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note to clients.Medtronic, in its motion on Monday, said if the injunction were permitted to go into effect, ""treatable patients may unnecessarily die in the name of already expired patent rights.""

Edwards said it has petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to extend its patent on Sapien, known as the Anderson patient, to early 2016.Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills said he believes Edwards is likely to accept either a lump-sum award for damages from Medtronic or continuing royalties.""While we believe Edwards has a better chance than we previously thought of being granted a permanent injunction against Medtronic, we still expect Edwards to ultimately cash in via other forms of equitable relief in lieu of a final injunction,"" Mills said.Edwards shares pared gains but were up at $81.62 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Medtronic shares fell 2 percent to $58.01.(Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago and Sweta Singh; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Bernard Orr)",2014-04-14,EW,"Mon Apr 14, 2014 | 2:17pm EDT",Edwards shares up on injunction against Medtronic heart valve,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-medtronic-stocks-idUSBREA3D1C120140414?type=companyNews

17,"   By Susan Kelly  Medtronic Inc agreed to pay more than $1 billion to rival Edwards Lifesciences Corp to settle patent litigation and keep its CoreValve artificial heart valve on the U.S. market.The settlement announced Tuesday ends years of litigation between the two companies over technology for implanting replacement valves that spares patients from open-heart surgery.  The U.S. market for the procedure is expected to top $500 million this year and double in size by 2018, Jefferies analysts predict. Edwards was first to market with its Sapien technology in 2011 in the United States, while Medtronic received U.S. regulatory approval for CoreValve in January.""We think it is an important breakthrough in many ways for people with this disease, and we are focused on aggressively rolling this out as quickly as we can,"" Medtronic Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said in an interview.Medtronic, the world's largest standalone medical device maker, also posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and gave an initial forecast for its 2015 profit that disappointed some investors. Its shares slumped about 1 percent midday.   Edwards stock fell 1.8 percent as investors braced for further market share shifts to Medtronic. ""Edwards could have forced Medtronic off the market. The settlement caps the potential of the litigation win,"" said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy.        Medtronic said it would give Edwards a one-time payment of $750 million, plus royalties through April 2022 based on a percentage of CoreValve sales. A minimum annual payment was set at $40 million a year.CoreValve replaces diseased aortic heart valves in patients considered too frail for open-heart surgery, which requires separating the chest bone. Medtronic was the first device maker to compete against Edwards' Sapien valve.In April, a U.S. court issued an injunction that would have stopped Medtronic from selling CoreValve. The injunction was later suspended while an appeals court reviewed the case. Earlier court decisions had found that CoreValve infringed Edwards' Sapien product. Medtronic said net earnings declined to $448 million, or 44 cents a share, in the quarter ended April 25, from $969 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier.The company recorded $746 million in  charges for the Edwards settlement and a product liability settlement for its Infuse bone-growth stimulator.

""We think that the leadership of FDA on the device side is trying to really be more friendly to innovation.""The Food and Drug Administration has heard the frustration from doctors who wonder why technology that's being developed in the United States is not be available sooner for American citizens when they're good, Mussallem said.Devices can be approved in Europe as long as safety is established without going through the lengthy clinical trial process required by FDA. ""They really are being very thoughtful about trying to improve their performance and bring breakthrough technologies earlier,"" Mussallem said of FDA leadership. ""Our hope is that the vision that they've talked about...actually gets implemented."" The FDA did not immediately provide a requested comment on the topic. TAVR systems - Edwards' most important growth driver - are used to replace diseased heart valves without the need for chest cracking open heart surgery. Each new version the company has developed has been smaller and easier to use than the prior iteration, but each much go through its own U.S. clinical trials process. Edwards, the market leader, expects the global TAVR market to exceed $3 billion by 2019.""Sapien 3 is performing at a very high level in Europe,"" the CEO said. ""Not only is its profile very small, but it appears to be able to reduce leak at a substantial rate, which is often associated with mortality, so this is a big deal. ""There is a great deal of anticipation from U.S. clinicians to get that,"" Mussallem said.The FDA has signaled a willingness to use 30-day results, rather than the usual one-year trial, for the company to demonstrate the device's approvability, he said. If that proves to be the case, Edwards could file for approval within a month.

Edwards said it voluntarily implemented a temporary pause in the program to assess valve thrombosis, or clotting, observed in patients. The company said it remains committed to transcatheter mitral valve replacement.""While the program freeze is certainly disappointing, it doesn’t necessarily change its competitive positioning much in a market where everyone is still in the very early stages of development,"" J.P.

61,"   By Susan Kelly  Edwards Lifesciences Corp on Tuesday raised its full-year sales and profit outlook following strong first-quarter results and said approval for expanded use of its minimally invasive heart valve implant could come sooner than previously expected.The company, whose shares have climbed more than 20 percent since data released earlier this month showed the device to be a better alternative to open heart surgery in a new patient group, said it is aiming for U.S. regulatory approval of an expanded label indication at the beginning of the fourth quarter. It previously forecast approval by the end of the year.  Chief Executive Michael Mussallem, on a conference call, said the strong study data could prompt regulators to speed approval of the valve for patients at intermediate risk for complications with open heart surgery, but noted it is difficult to predict regulatory timelines.The Irvine, California-based company is ramping up its manufacturing capacity to meet an anticipated increase in demand, Mussallem said.""With the big production increase, that's a bit of a strain on our manufacturing operation, but we expect to be able to handle all that,"" he said.
