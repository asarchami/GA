1,"   By Kevin Murphy | KANSAS CITY, Missouri  KANSAS CITY, Missouri Southwest Airlines suspended two pilots from flying on Monday after their jetliner with 124 passengers landed at the wrong airport near Branson, Missouri, late on Sunday, a spokeswoman said.A Southwest captain, who has worked 15 years for the airline, and a first officer were removed from flying duties pending a federal investigation of the landing, said Michelle Agnew, a Southwest spokeswoman.The Boeing 737-700 landed at M. Graham Clark Downtown Airport instead of at Branson Airport, the main commercial air strip near Branson, which has a much longer runway, Southwest said in a statement. The airports are about 7 miles apart.The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the mistaken landing but had no other comment, spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory said. The plane left Chicago Midway Airport on Sunday on a flight to Dallas Love Field with a planned first stop in Branson, a musical entertainment and tourism mecca in southwest Missouri.Southwest is looking into ""all the circumstances"" that led the captain to land at the wrong airport, Agnew said. After landing at the wrong airport, passengers were taken by ground transportation to the correct airport and then were flown to Dallas on another jet later on Sunday, she said. Southwest apologized to passengers, is refunding the cost of their tickets and giving them travel credits, she said.The airplane took off on Monday afternoon with a new flight crew, Agnew said. It was bound for Tulsa, Oklahoma, for refueling and would go back in service, she said.

23,"   By Karen Jacobs  Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) is looking for opportunities to add service in markets where other merged carriers have scaled back, the budget carrier's Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on Monday.The growth opportunities are ""very exciting for all of our employees who want to do more,"" Kelly said in an interview.Kelly said Southwest was paying ""close attention"" to cities such as Memphis, Tennessee - a former Northwest Airlines hub and a market where Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) reduced flights in last year - as well as Cleveland, a Midwestern city that United Continental Holdings (UAL.N) recently said it would drop as a hub.Kelly, who began his career at Southwest as a controller more than 20 years ago and was named CEO in 2004, noted that when American Airlines reduced operations in Nashville in the 1990s, Southwest raised its daily departures in that market to about 80 from 18.He also said that Southwest became the largest carrier in St. Louis, Missouri, since American scaled back there following its acquisition of Trans World Airlines.""Memphis is a smaller community, it probably has smaller potential than the two examples I provided there, but we're going to pay very close attention to it,"" Kelly said in an interview in Atlanta. ""We're excited about being able to grow there and we'll do as much as we can. Cleveland, I think, is the same way.""Southwest has new opportunities to add flights after recently acquiring takeoff and landing rights at New York's LaGuardia and Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C., that American Airlines Group (AAL.O) agreed to sell to settle a U.S. Justice Department suit challenging its merger with US Airways, which was completed in December.The budget carrier also plans to start international service under its own brand this year - initially to Aruba, the Bahamas and Jamaica - as it completes the integration of AirTran and retires that brand.New nonstop flights from Southwest's base at Dallas Love Field are due to start in October when U.S. flight restrictions there expire. With the new access gained in New York, Southwest has outlined plans to expand service between LaGuardia and Nashville, Houston Hobby, Chicago (Midway), and Akron-Canton, Ohio.Kelly declined to comment specifically on where Southwest planned to add flights from Reagan National, but said that large- or medium-sized cities the carrier already serves could be targets.As it faced rising labor costs, the Dallas-based Southwest added seats to planes, raised baggage fees at its AirTran unit and curbed flying to unprofitable markets to improve results. Southwest is also retiring older Boeing 737 jets in its fleet to help reduce maintenance costs. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline that has not been restructured in bankruptcy. Even so, Kelly said Southwest was still a lower-cost carrier compared with major rivals though he conceded that rising fuel prices have eaten into that cost advantage.""We've had to raise our fares simply because fuel prices are so much higher today in the billions of dollars a year compared to where they used to be,"" Kelly said. ""But we still have significant cost advantages - even including that - relative to the legacy carriers.""He said the effect of Southwest's presence in a market is often realized in airfare increases that don't materialize.""The evidence in a market is harder to see at times because our competitors have always matched our fares,"" Kelly said.Southwest shares were down 1.35 percent to $21.14 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Karen Jacobs, editing by G Crosse)",2014-02-10,LUV,"Mon Feb 10, 2014 | 3:39pm EST",Southwest looks to grow where rivals downsize,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-southwest-ceo-idUSBREA191VC20140210?type=companyNews

30,"  * Flight cancellations aid key revenue measure* Analyst cuts profit estimates for some carriersMarch 10 Major U.S. airlines on Monday said cancellations of thousands of flights would hurt first-quarter profit, but some added that revenue would still show improvement.Flight cancellations tend to add to airline costs during the first quarter, when winter storms hit the hardest. Five U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines Inc, American Airlines Group Inc, JetBlue Airways Corp, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc - said that winter storms had led to more than 78,000 canceled flights among them.Some airlines cited a noticeable increase in their canceled flights tied to bad weather this year, with American Airlines saying its 28,000 cancellations for January and February more than doubled from the year earlier.Delta said that as of the end of January, its cancellations from bad weather had topped all of those for 2013. Delta told a J.P. Morgan investor conference disruption from winter storms hurt revenue for the current quarter by $90 million as it canceled 17,000 flights. The storms dented pretax profit for the quarter by about $55 million, Delta added.The carrier said it expected operating margin, a measure of income to costs, of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent for the first quarter, compared with a prior view of 6 percent to 8 percent. Cancellations can help unit revenue, an important measure of pricing power and how full planes are, as more travelers are put on remaining flights.Delta said unit revenue would rise 3 percent to 4 percent in the current quarter, compared with its prior view of a 2 percent to 4 percent increase. American added it still expected unit revenue to rise about 2 percent to 4 percent in the period.United said it halted 23,000 flights tied to weather in the first two months of 2014. The company had disclosed last month that disruption from the storms would hurt first-quarter unit revenue. JetBlue told the same conference it canceled nearly 4,000 flights because of the winter storms, and Southwest said it halted about 6,500 flights in January and February.JetBlue forecast a 1 percent to 2 percent rise in first quarter unit revenue, while Southwest outlined expected growth of 3 percent.Cowen & Co airline analyst Helane Becker cut her first quarter profit estimate for Delta to 30 cents a share from 32 cents in a note to clients, citing the updated outlook. She raised her quarterly estimate for Southwest to 17 cents a share from 14 cents, but also cut her estimate for JetBlue for the period to 6 cents a share from 13 cents.Shares of the major U.S. airlines ended mixed, with Delta down 0.5 percent to $35.17 and United off 2.3 percent to $46.66. American was off 0.2 percent to $38.96 and JetBlue fell 1.8 percent to $8.87.

American agreed to divest the rights under a deal with the U.S. government that cleared the way for its merger late last year. With the additional access, Southwest will be increasing service at Reagan National to 44 daily departures from 17.New York-based JetBlue Airways also won takeoff and landing rights, or slots, at Reagan National from American, and said earlier this month it planned flights to markets including Charleston, South Carolina, and Hartford, Connecticut. The U.S. Justice Department stipulated that slots being sold should go to low-fare carriers to boost competition at Reagan National, a popular, gate-restricted airport that serves the political and business communities.The new flights from Southwest could bring lower fares between Washington and some big U.S. hub cities such as Chicago, said Robert Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington, New York.

United Continental Holdings ranked second in complaints in 2011 and 2012, and dropped to third in 2013, the study shows. American Airlines was fourth in 2011, third in 2012, and fourth in 2013.At United, complaints spiked in 2012 to 4.28 per 100,000 passengers, its highest in the five years studied, after technology changes during the merger with Continental caused outages and led to poorer service. United's complaint rate improved to 2.14 in 2013.United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said customer satisfaction has improved as the airline focused on enhancing service. American, which merged with US Airways in December to form the world's biggest airline, stood out in terms of complaints about flight delays and cancellations, the study shows.Spokesman Matt Miller said American, under new management headed by former US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker, has improved in on-time performance and mishandled bags.Delta Air Lines, the third-largest carrier behind American and United, improved its score from 1.96 complaints per 100,000 passengers in 2009 to 0.59 complaints in 2013.

41,"  * American, Southwest top expectations as JetBlue trails* United posts wider loss* Carriers say key revenue measure to rise in current periodApril 24 American Airlines Group and Southwest Airlines posted profits that beat forecasts in the first quarter, even though harsh winter weather prompted many flight cancellations in the seasonally weak period.JetBlue Airways disappointed as wage increases raised its costs. United Continental Holdings posted a wider loss as revenue fell.All the carriers said revenue in the current period was looking up. Warmer weather should encourage more leisure travel in the current quarter, airlines said, boosting second-quarter unit revenue, a key measure of pricing power and how full planes are. United said it expects unit revenue to rise 1 percent to 3 percent in the three months ending in June, while American forecast a rise of 4 percent to 6 percent.Southwest, which benefited from higher fares and lower costs in the first three months of year, said the second quarter was ""off to a great start,"" citing strong April bookings and revenue trends. It forecast a 6 percent to 7 percent rise in unit revenue for April.. ""The demand environment is healthy heading into what should be a very strong spring and summer travel season,"" said Jim Corridore, an equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ.Share prices reflected the results. American was up 2.2 percent to $37.91 on Thursday and Southwest gained 0.8 percent to $24.27. United sank 9.3 percent to $41.78 and JetBlue was off 2.9 percent to $8.34.Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst and founder with Atmosphere Research Group, said United Continental needed to make improvements. United has been working to win back customers after system changes it made after its 2010 merger hurt customer service. ""It's clear that weather aside, United is not offering a product that travelers like and is losing market share,"" Harteveldt said. ""While United has made some improvements, it's still not strong enough.""United's first-quarter loss was $609 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $417 million. The company said during a conference call that it was taking actions to improve revenue that include better matching plane size to flight demand, and added it expected domestic unit revenue to rise 4 percent to 6 percent in the current period.American's first quarter results were aided by proceeds from sales of takeoff and landing rights at Reagan National Airport near Washington it had to make under an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. Harteveldt said American and Delta Air Lines  were ""firing on all cylinders,"" keeping costs under control and garnering more revenue from premium travelers.Delta on Wednesday forecast stronger than expected operating margin and unit revenue increase for the second quarter, sending its shares to a new year high above $37.00. On Thursday, its shares were up 0.6 percent to $37.30.

The deal is subject to approval of the City of Dallas, and Virgin America said it was confident the city would clear it.American agreed to give up takeoff and landing rights and gates at various airports to settle the U.S. lawsuit that sought to block its merger with US Airways. Virgin America recently won takeoff and landing rights at New York's LaGuardia Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that American divested. Southwest Airlines Co, which controls 16 of 20 gates at Dallas Love Field, and Delta Air Lines Inc have also expressed interest in the two Dallas Love Field gates.In a statement, Delta said designating the two Love Field gates as ""common use gates"" managed by the City of Dallas was the best option for their use. ""While American was bound by its merger settlement with the Department of Justice to release its gates, any sublease proposed by American must be approved by the City Council,"" Delta's statement said.

62,"   By Karen Jacobs  Major U.S. airlines posted earnings gains on Thursday, aided by higher airfares and summer demand, and the two largest carriers announced moves to return more cash to investors. American Airlines Group (AAL.O), the largest by traffic, capped off a strong second quarter by announcing its first cash dividend since 1980 and a share buyback. United Continental Holdings (UAL.N) also said it would repurchase $1 billion in stock.The buybacks mark a significant change as the four largest U.S. airlines, all the products of mergers, now focus on capital deployment and raising returns for investors. American's 2013 merger completed a consolidation period that has helped put the U.S. industry on sound financial footing.""The companies are obviously seeing their fundamentals good enough and improving at a fast enough pace that allows them to"" start dividends and buybacks, said Kris Kelley, a research analyst with Janus Capital Group.Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) resumed a dividend and buyback last year and Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) also pays dividends. Among the smaller carriers, Alaska Air Group (ALK.N) pays a dividend. ""The conversation (around airlines) has definitely changed,"" Kelley said. ""Investors are starting to look at these stocks as actual companies rather than just proxies for the global economy.""American, Alaska Air, Southwest and United had second-quarter profit that topped average analyst estimates, buoyed by price increases and summer demand that helped keep seats full.United's results showed benefits from cost-cutting, and Southwest said revenue of $5 billion was a quarterly high. American said its net profit of $1.5 billion excluding charges was also a record. JetBlue Airways (JBLU.O) reported higher quarterly profit as well on Thursday, following strong results from Delta on Wednesday.""Demand has remained strong and airlines have continued to refine their route networks ... fine-tuning their schedules and the aircraft they fly, and becoming more aggressive in how they manage their seats,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder and travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group.He said airlines were becoming more targeted in how they conduct fare sales, extending promotions to a select group of customers rather than having massive sales across all routes and seats. U.S. airlines have better aligned available seats with demand and retired less efficient airplanes to improve operations while charging extra fees for items such as seat upgrades to boost revenue.  The airlines are also keeping a close eye on costs. United has cut staff, while Delta and Allegiant Travel (ALGT.O) said this week they had recently offered voluntary retirement or buyout options in efforts to keep costs down.Shares of airlines were mixed, with United up 2.8 percent to $47.29 and Southwest up 0.2 percent to $28.94. American and Delta eased less than 1 percent, and Alaska was off 3.9 percent to $47.73.

81,"   By Douwe Miedema | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Last month's move by the U.S. commodities regulator to let Southwest Airlines Co keep its multibillion-dollar oil trades secret for 15 days offered the world's biggest low-cost carrier a break it has been seeking for three years.However, the decision to grant the airline an exemption from rules calling for greater derivatives transparency raised concerns about its market impact and sparked a debate among regulators, according to people familiar with the approval process.All other swap trades except Southwest's must be reported ""as soon as technologically practicable.""The Dallas-based airline has argued that its deals are so specific that immediate disclosure could cause the market to move against it, adding tens of millions of dollars to its costs.For years, that argument was not enough to sway the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and its former chairman, Gary Gensler. One concern was that granting an exemption to just one company is unusual and could hurt others in a similar position.    Also, the waiver could set a precedent that would encourage others to seek similar special treatment, restoring a veil over bigger parts of derivative markets.The agency is already looking into problems the Mexican government is facing in its vast oil hedging program after news organizations, including Reuters, reported on the country's trades using publicly available swaps trading data, said one person familiar with the agency's procedures.A CFTC spokesman said Tim Massad, Gensler's successor, had issued the waiver to Southwest after his staff had done proper analysis to confirm the company’s claims, and the relief was a lot narrower than what the company had originally requested.But the person familiar with the approval process said the decision caused ""a big stink"" within the agency.     When Southwest talked to the Commission in 2012 and in 2013, ""they couldn't prove their case,"" the source said. Barring new evidence or a further appeal, Southwest's plea appeared to reach a dead end more than a year ago.    The company had another shot at an exemption when Gensler left this year. It made its case to then-interim Chairman Mark Wetjen, who told the staff to start another study but doubted that a waiver was warranted, said a second source familiar with the CFTC's thinking.     Only after Massad's arrival in June did things start moving. It is unclear what led to his decision to grant the waiver.LOBBY GROUP     Even those who see merits in granting a waiver have taken issue with the decision to give it to just one company. While the agency frequently issues exemptions from its rules, they generally apply to a wider industry or class of participants, or address a problem specific to one company.""I'm surprised that they didn't apply it across the market,"" another person familiar with the situation said.With its low-cost tickets and clever marketing, Southwest has wide popular appeal. It says it has been on Fortune magazine's list of most-admired companies in the world for 20 consecutive years, and many on Capitol Hill support it. Southwest hired Delta Strategy Group, a Washington lobbying firm replete with former CFTC staffers to make its case in Congress. Since it started its campaign, the House has passed two bills that would write the waiver into law, although it is far from certain that they would win approval in the new Congress.""I SEE YOU""     Rodney Davis, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Illinois, who introduced one of these bills, welcomed the CFTC's waiver.    ""It's a good first step to help a company out,"" Davis told Reuters. ""The rule was not initially designed to impact companies like Southwest.""      Southwest's hedging program, among the largest and longest-running in the industry, is best known for sparing the airline the pain when oil surged to nearly $150 a barrel in 2008.     While other carriers' energy bills soared, Southwest was buying its jet fuel at half-price because of swaps and options positions it had locked in.    But the size and frequency of its trades in long-term oil contracts allow a small group of dealers at banks to figure out Southwest's positions by crunching the public data, even though the transactions are anonymous, the company says.    The airline ""began to get phone calls from other participants in the market saying: 'I see you guys are out there trading,'"" Southwest Treasurer Chris Monroe told Reuters.    That meant Southwest had to pay higher prices after the transparency rules came into force in 2012.Monroe told a Senate committee last year that reporting the trades would add $60 million to Southwest's $6 billion annual fuel bill.Shedding light on derivative markets that were at the epicenter of the financial crisis is a core goal of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform, but non-banks are complaining they sometimes end up as unintended victims.    Yet critics say the waiver allows Southwest to operate in secret, a privilege others do not have. Another concern is that no single player should be so dominant that its trades alone can move prices.The CFTC's action ""looks anomalous and seems to warrant an expanded explanation,"" said Bart Chilton, a former Democratic commissioner who left the agency in March.

82,"   By Catherine Ngai and Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Some major U.S. airlines including Delta and Southwest are rushing to finance losing bets on oil and revamp fuel hedges as tumbling crude prices leave them with billions of dollars in losses, according to people familiar with the hedging schemes.In theory, airlines are among the top beneficiaries of a six-month slump that halved crude prices to five-year lows. Oil is the biggest variable cost for airlines, often representing a third or more of their total operating expenses.But now, carriers such as Delta Air Lines and even Southwest Airlines, known for a successful hedging program that locked in cheap fuel prices before they rose a decade ago, see some of the benefits of cheap fuel eaten away by hedging costs.That is largely because they have used common but risky hedging strategies, among them a ""costless collar"": selling financial options that pay off when oil prices fall and using the proceeds to buy protection against soaring costs when prices climb, according to three people familiar with the programs.The two carriers have been moving quickly to strategise how to meet demands from brokers and banks for additional collateral to cover potential losses from a strategy that made perfect sense just six months ago, those people said. The airlines have also held a series of meetings that included airline executives, brokers and consultants, according to the people, who declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.With oil prices tumbling faster and further than anyone had anticipated, the collar hedges left the airlines with insurance against high costs they no longer need and on the hook for protection they sold against a further slide, with potential liabilities on the rise.Southwest spokesman Chris Mainz said the meetings were part of a routine, although a rapidly changing market called for close attention.""We continue to benefit from declining fuel prices,"" Mainz said in an email. ""Obviously we're going to move faster when the price drops in the 40 percent range. (Our fuel team) have been very busy actively managing our portfolio to respond to the changes we are seeing in the market.""Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said the Atlanta-based carrier was not surprised by the slide, having been prepared to meet its financial obligations if needed. BOON TO RIVALS Southwest, Delta and other carriers that sources declined to name, will benefit from the drop in oil prices because they hedge only a portion of the fuel they buy. Southwest, for example, expects to cover only 20 percent of its fuel consumption with hedge contracts this quarter. Delta expects a $1.7 billion gain from lower fuel prices in 2015, despite $1.2 billion in estimated hedge losses.Yet rival American Airlines, which has not entered any hedge contracts since late 2013, are set to see a greater boost to their bottom lines. Industry consultants say hedged airlines have a few choices to deal with the price slide, including selling forward positions on crude oil or jet fuel, changing the prices at which they hedge or selling assets, such as planes.What airlines exactly plan to do remains unclear, people familiar with the discussions said.A lack of disclosure requirements makes it almost impossible to tell how or when airlines have hedged, and none would discuss details of their strategies.Collar transactions looked well suited to the market when prices hovered around $100 per barrel for most of the past four years, allowing airlines to cap their fuel costs at little or no cost, analysts said.""(Costless) collars are an effective strategy that works best when prices stay within a range,"" said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis, at Mobius Risk Group. ""But it becomes a very different animal when the market goes against that.""  In their October quarterly filings, Southwest and Delta said they used a mix of options and fixed-price swaps.Southwest also explained that collar trades ""carry more risk than purchased call options"" because of possibly greater liability when the contracts expire.The world's biggest low-cost carrier said that a 25 percent decline of crude prices from Sept. 30 would probably force it to pay $615 million in cash collateral, aircraft collateral and letters of credit. Delta said it would pay $800 million to counterparties if oil fell 20 percent between Oct. 1, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2015.  Brent already has tumbled 36 percent since then to trade at about $60 a barrel on Monday.These hedges weigh on the costs of their future fuel consumption, too.At current prices, Southwest says it expects to keep only about 80 cents of savings for every $1 in oil price decline, while Delta puts this figure at about 65 cents. American instead will reap the full benefit of cheap fuel.And every cent counts. Delta has said that one cent change in the price per barrel of oil is worth $40 million to the carrier.

86,"   By Susan Heavey | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. government on Thursday fined Southwest Airlines Co $1.6 million in what it said was the biggest civil penalty levied against an airline for violating rules barring long waits for passengers in planes on the runway.The Department of Transportation said Southwest had failed to abide by the rules last January when 16 of its aircraft were delayed on the tarmac at Chicago Midway International Airport. Passengers were not given the chance to get off the planes after three hours, and the airline did not have enough staff in place to avoid the delays, it said.""We have aggressively enforced, and will continue to aggressively enforce, our tarmac delay rule to ensure carriers have adequate resources to minimize passengers' exposure to lengthy tarmac delays,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement.In a statement, Southwest pointed to severe weather it said hampered its efforts in the incident.

The debtors, including several affiliates, face $12 million of creditor claims.Founded in 1989, SkyMall said it sold more than 30,000 products it calls ""cool stuff,"" including novelty items ranging from personalized socks to dog beds to a $2,499 football helmet signed by Notre Dame players and coaches. It says it reaches 650 million air travelers a year. But in a court filing, Chief Financial Officer Scott Wiley said financial strains grew as travelers spent less time in the air browsing catalogs and more time on their smartphones and laptops, and amid increased competition from online rivals such as Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc. Wiley also said Delta Air Lines Inc ended its contract with SkyMall on Nov. 30, and Southwest Airlines Co  planned to stop carrying the catalog on April 1.SkyMall revenue totaled $33.7 million in 2013, but only about $15.8 million in the first nine months of 2014, a court filing shows.The case is In re: SkyMall LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Arizona, No, 15-bk-00679.

Southwest, the largest U.S. carrier by domestic traffic, said it canceled about 80 flights on Tuesday due to the grounding and was expecting ""very minimal impact"" to its operations on Wednesday. The Federal Aviation Administration approved a proposal that would allow the Dallas-based carrier to continue operating the aircraft for a maximum of five days while it completes the checks within the next few days, the airline said.An ice storm battered parts of Texas on Monday, cutting off power to thousands of homes and leading to hundreds of traffic accidents and more than 1,500 airline flight cancellations.

103,"   By David Morgan | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Five U.S. aircraft, including a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 and an Atlas Air Boeing 747 cargo plane, landed at the wrong airports in recent years due to preventable air traffic control errors, U.S. safety experts said on Monday.While no injuries were reported in the incidents, which occurred from July 2012 to November 2014, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended changes to U.S. air traffic control procedures to avoid future problems, which can involve aircraft landing on shorter-than-expected runways - sometimes at night.The NTSB said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should require controllers to withhold landing clearance until an aircraft has passed all airports that could be confused with its destination. It also recommended making changes to altitude warning software to ensure an aircraft does not descend toward the wrong airport.The FAA said it takes landings at wrong airports ""very seriously,"" and will respond to the NTSB recommendations within 90 days. The wrong landings cited by NTSB occurred in areas where multiple airports lie within 10 miles (16 km) of each other.     Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 took off from Chicago Midway International Airport on Jan. 12, 2014, for a 7,140-foot (2,176-meter) runway at Branson Airport, nearly Springfield, Missouri. But the aircraft, with 124 passengers and 7 crew members aboard, landed instead on a 3,738-foot runway six miles away, after being wrongly directed there by air traffic controllers. ""Visible tire marks"" showed where the jet stopped on the runway, NTSB said. In November 2013, Atlas Air Flight 4241 left New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas. But the 747 cargo plane mistakenly landed at Colonel James Jabara Airport about five miles away, after the two-member flight crew failed to correctly identify their destination.""Several other operations occurred at (the airport) while the 747 was on the runway, further negatively impacting flight safety,"" NTSB said. In that case, minimum safe altitude warning software that could have sounded an alarm as the plane descended instead assumed that the flight had changed destinations, NTSB said.Three other wrong airport incidents occurred in 2012 and 2014, including a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster that landed on a 3,580-foot runway in Florida, four miles from its intended 11,420-foot runway destination.

109,"  (Adds detail, industry background, byline)By Jeffrey DastinMay 13 Southwest Airlines Co's board of directors on Wednesday raised the company's quarterly dividend and authorized a new $1.5 billion share buyback program, according to a news release.The board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 7.5 cents per share, up from a previous dividend of 6 cents per share. Southwest estimated the new dividend payments will amount to $200 million annually, based on shares outstanding on May 11.The low-cost carrier said the first $300 million of the planned $1.5 billion buyback would be accelerated but did not give a timeline for the repurchase program. Strong demand for U.S. travel and cheap jet fuel have added millions of dollars to the balance sheets of U.S. airlines, including Southwest. Delta Air Lines Inc earlier on Wednesday announced plans to return $6 billion to its shareholders through 2017.Southwest returned almost $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends last year. ""In recognition of our strong financial position, performance and cash flow outlook, the board's actions today further reinforce our commitment to create value for our shareholders,"" Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said in the news release.The Dallas-based also said it had decided that its firm orders for 31 aircraft from Boeing Co next year would be for the 737-800 model rather than the lower-capacity 737-700. Based on those plans, the company estimated that it will spend about $1.1 billion to pay for aircraft purchases this year and between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion for 2016.Southwest expects 2016 carrying capacity to be up 6 percent to 7 percent, a rise from an April forecast for a 5 percent increase.The airline, taking into account aircraft it will retire, expects its fleet will number about 715 planes by the end of 2016.Southwest shares were down nearly 1 percent at $41.87 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

117,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Victoria Bryan | June 8  June 8 Major U.S. airlines' shares tumbled on Monday amid fears that the carriers are grabbing for market share at the expense of profits.Shares in Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co, United Continental Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc all fell sharply despite a bullish outlook on industry profitability issued Monday by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) at its general meeting in Miami.Global airlines should earn $29.3 billion this year, nearly double last year's level, and average net profit margins should nearly double to 4 percent from 2.2 percent, the industry group forecast. [ID: nL5N0YU265]Wall Street, however, focused on concerns that big U.S. airlines are casting aside years of disciplined efforts to limit capacity and boost profit margins for each mile a passenger flies.In a series of moves over the past few weeks, Delta, Southwest, American and other carriers have announced plans to add more planes or put more seats on existing aircraft on certain routes.Raymond James on Monday cut its ratings for Delta and United Continental to ""outperform"" from  ""strong buy,"" and for American to ""market perform"" from ""outperform.""Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said in a research note that while he expected the industry to maintain capacity discipline, the industry's recovery ""is likely to be somewhat muted vs. previous expectations due to the softer than expected U.S. economic growth.""Delta shares were down 4.6 percent, while American fell 4.2 percent, with Southwest losing 2.5 percent and United slumping 4.9 percent.MORE SEATS  Industry executives gathered at the IATA conference said it made sense to set a course for increased overall revenues and profits at a time when fuel costs are low and air travel is expected to grow. In a growing market, sticking to a focus on revenue per passenger-mile by limiting the number of planes or seats could result in a company missing out on revenue.""I don't know that anywhere you will find a major airline in the face of almost a 50 percent drop in fuel prices reducing its capacity at the same time,"" Delta President Ed Bastian said at a news conference at IATA. ""We are continuing sustainable momentum and continuing with the discipline that the marketplace is expecting.""Delta last week warned investors profit margins could be lower than it previously expected.United's Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said during an investor conference Thursday that increasing capacity by squeezing more seats onto aircraft - instead of buying new planes - could dilute unit revenue but is ""earnings accretive"" overall.IATA's official forecast was bullish on capacity. ""A focus on efficiency is seeing supply matched more closely than ever with demand and is expected to produce a record high load factor of 80.2 percent,"" IATA said in a statement, referring to the proportion of seats sold on an average flight. However, the group's chief economist, Brian Pearce, took a more cautious line, noting margins remain narrow.'FEELS DIFFERENT' ""To the extent that capacity does come into the market ahead of the demand from consumers that's going to make it difficult for the airlines to sustain profitability,"" Pearce said.U.S. airlines will account for more than half of the industry's total profits this year, IATA said. Total industry revenues are expected to dip to $727 billion from last year's $733 billion, but lower fuel costs and record load factors are boosting profits, IATA said.Monday's selloff reflected the fear that airlines will repeat their history of overshooting the market, adding too many seats and then selling them off at firesale prices.""The real question is, is this a one-time catch up for fuel prices being lower or is this airlines behaving like airlines used to and just increasing capacity because times are good,"" American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said Sunday, responding to the concerns of investors.This cycle ""feels different,"" Parker said, because industry executives remember what happened in the past, before the Great Recession drove airlines to tighten capacity and cut costs.Air Canada Chief Executive Calin Rovinescu said he too sees little risk of a damaging capacity war.""People were undisciplined in the past, but they will be more disciplined this time,"" Rovinescu told Reuters on Sunday. ""However, we will see rational growth where it makes sense to do it.""Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital, said Monday he is using the weakness in airline shares as a buying opportunity.""We still think earnings will be great this year for the airlines,"" Bradshaw said.JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker also took a positive view during a presentation to investors last month, arguing that airlines risk leaving money on the table if they do not keep pace with rising demand.""Capacity has been growing for several years, and guess what: profits have been growing faster,"" Baker said.

118,"  Shares for the top four airline carriers in the United States could rise 15 percent to 50 percent due to less competition and falling fuel costs, according to the June 22 edition of Barron's.Barron's noted the 2015 forecast for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for American Airlines Group (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), United Continental Holdings (UAL.N) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) is for 40 percent growth to $29.2 billion. That compares to when Wall Street forecasted 2015 EBITDA to rise 7 percent to $22.7 billion in June 2014 before fuel costs started to fall.The report said a drop in revenue per available seat, an important metric watched by investors, is a brief bump rather than a sign of a longer-term challenge. On Friday, American Airlines closed at $39.97 a share, Delta closed at $41.35, United Continental closed at $52.01, and Southwest closed at $33.86.

119,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) has agreed to make room for rival Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) in its gates at Dallas Love Field Airport while the carriers await a long-term resolution of their dispute in court, the airlines said Wednesday.Southwest will allow Delta to continue operating five daily flights between Love Field and Atlanta, according to a Delta spokeswoman. The agreement averts potential havoc for customers, with a gate-sharing arrangement between the carriers set to expire on July 6. The two airlines had scheduled overlapping flights from identical gates at the space-constrained airport. The conflict has drawn in city and federal officials, with the city of Dallas suing the carriers last week in part for placing it in a bind.U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas strongly encouraged Southwest to make room for its competitor temporarily, according to a source familiar with the matter. The airlines confirmed to the court Wednesday morning that Delta could remain at Love Field at least through Labor Day, the source said. The court on Wednesday canceled a hearing on the issue that was set for June 29, according to an electronic court order. It pushed back deadlines to respond to competing motions by Southwest and Delta to July 17.Delta has sold almost 20,000 tickets to Love Field through May 2016 and said a mass cancellation would ""cause significant harm to Delta's operations,"" according to a court filing. Southwest holds 18 of 20 gates at Love Field, its headquarters. It has planned to increase flights from Love Field in August, contingent upon regaining all takeoff and arrival slots from Delta.The airline plans to proceed with the ramp-up despite Delta's accommodation by working closely with Delta to ensure efficient gate usage, according to the source, who requested anonymity because the source was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Delta has 45 daily flights from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport but wants a foothold at Love Field, which some travelers prefer for its renovated terminal and proximity to downtown Dallas. It has petitioned to add eight flights in addition to the five it operates currently.The spat is part of a larger fight for passengers in the Dallas market that has investors concerned that airlines will discount fares and hurt revenues because of a surge of flights from the city.

The airline plans to proceed with the ramp-up despite Delta's accommodation by working closely with Delta to ensure efficient gate usage, according to the source, who requested anonymity because the source was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Delta has 45 daily flights from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport but wants a foothold at Love Field, which some travelers prefer for its renovated terminal and proximity to downtown Dallas. It has petitioned to add eight flights in addition to the five it operates currently.The spat is part of a larger fight for passengers in the Dallas market that has investors concerned that airlines will discount fares and hurt revenues because of a surge of flights from the city.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Cynthia Osterman)",2015-06-24,LUV,"Wed Jun 24, 2015 | 7:46pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Southwest grants Delta temporary right to keep Dallas flights,http://www.reuters.com//article/delta-air-lines-southwest-idUSL1N0ZA2GZ20150624?type=companyNews
121,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | June 30  June 30 JetBlue Airways Corp on Tuesday began charging its lowest-fare customers for checked bags, an anticipated move that leaves Southwest Airlines Co as the only U.S. carrier to let all travelers check a bag for free.The New York-based carrier said travelers who book the lowest ""Blue"" fare can check a bag on a one-way trip for $20 during online check-in or $25 at an airport ticket counter. To avoid the charge, customers can book a ""Blue Plus"" fare that typically is $15 more than the base ticket price, it said.JetBlue announced in November that it would roll out bag fees by this summer, estimating it would earn some $65 million in 2015 and more than $200 million within several years from charges associated with new fare options. Consumers reacted negatively while investors heralded the change. The budget airline had long resisted charging for free travel benefits.""Half of the customers don't even check bags,"" Marty St. George, JetBlue's executive vice president for commercial and planning, said in an interview. ""In effect what's happening is, the customers who aren't checking bags are paying for the customers who do."" The airline's approach to fares lets customers pay for what they need, he said. For example, travelers can book a ""Blue Flex"" ticket - generally $100 more expensive than the one-way base fare - to have two checked bags and no fees for changes or cancellations.U.S. airlines grossed $864 million in baggage fees in the first quarter, amounting to 2.2 percent of total operating revenues, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. That is the highest amount in baggage fees they have  ever collected during the first quarter. Travelers have criticized airlines not only for new charges  but also for obfuscating the real cost of travel. Customers cannot easily compare fares across airlines, hidden in fine print, because websites such as Expedia list prices without ancillary fees, according to Charlie Leocha, chairman of consumer advocacy group Travelers United.St. George said JetBlue still has the best product of any airline despite fees. He said ""Blue"" customers get free snacks and satellite television and can pre-select a wider range of seats than on other airlines, a flexibility that matters more to travelers than checked bag fees.JetBlue said it lowered flight change fees as part of the fare restructuring.

But carriers have started taking flights off their fall schedules and postponing aircraft deliveries in response to Wall Street concerns that adding more flights and seats could erode fares and margins.    Mergers, new fees imposed on passengers and caution about adding capacity have boosted U.S. airline earnings after a decade of bankruptcies following the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Its unit revenue fell 4.7 percent in the second quarter. The airline also trimmed its plans for capacity growth in 2016 to better match supply to demand.The forecast third-quarter drop, which Southwest described as ""modest"" in a statement, relieved investors who were worried about prices falling in light of Southwest's rapid expansion from its headquarters at Dallas Love Field Airport.

125,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | July 23  July 23 At least two U.S. airlines have started hedging their fuel costs after a months-long hiatus. The early result: more losses.Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc have added new hedges against a rise in oil prices just months after bets last year cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. With U.S. crude prices falling 21 percent since early June, Southwest appeared to regret the decision.""We were concerned that market prices would continue to escalate, so we did add some positions for the second half of this year,"" Southwest's Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo said on an investor call Thursday.At July 20 prices, those hedges will cost Southwest $308 million when they settle this year. Through 2018, Southwest said its hedge book is $1.3 billion in the red, although that could change if prices rise.Contracts now cover 40 percent of its expected fuel use in 2016 and 2017, up from 10 percent and 30 percent covered, respectively, as of April, filings show. ""We're mostly focused now on working our current position off, burning that position off in the most cost-effective way,"" Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said on the call.Cheap oil has been a boon to airline profits, typically offsetting hedge losses because fuel comprises about a third of airlines' operating expenses. Southwest earned $608 million last quarter, and United posted a $1.19 billion profit. While hedging can insure against soaring fuel costs as it did for Southwest a decade ago, in recent months carriers that did not hedge such as American Airlines Group Inc have emerged as winners.The oil glut, which depressed prices more than 50 percent since June 2014, resulted in hedged airlines doling out cash to parties on the other side of the bets and paying to exit contracts before more losses piled on.When prices crept up this spring, locking in fuel prices again seemed smart until July trading reversed the rise. United has begun building a ""small"" hedge for 2016 and will be ""opportunistic"" when considering more, its Chief Financial Officer John Rainey told investors Thursday.By contrast, Delta Air Lines Inc has not ""materially"" changed its hedges since February, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said last week.""We've been kind of sitting back, watching the market,"" he said.Losses from old hedges are expected to cost United and Delta more than $200 million each this quarter.

United has limited service from the worst battleground, Dallas. Southwest has just completed construction of a $156 million international concourse at Houston Hobby Airport and will start flying to six international destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean on Oct. 15. Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told reporters Thursday that United has had a ""monopoly"" of flights from Houston south, until now.United flies from a different airport that is further from Houston's center, George Bush Intercontinental.""Historically when low-cost carriers come into the market, the pricing structure changes,"" Compton said, referring to the different fares that an airline offers depending on the supply of seats. ""You'll see that in Houston."" ""It's hard for me to say, 'well, it will be like Chicago,'"" he said, citing United's hometown where it faces fierce competition from Southwest and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O).Compton said a significant chunk of United's Houston operation and revenue comes from connecting customers through the hub. United flies to many places from Houston that Southwest does not serve, such as Buenos Aires and Tokyo, meaning current overlap will be limited. ""Each market is unique,"" he said.

Excluding special items, profit was $623 million, or 94 cents per diluted share, compared with the average analyst estimate of 92 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Southwest forecast that unit revenue, or sales relative to the total mileage of the seats it flies, would rise about 1 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the year prior. It attributed the increase to ""favorable booking"" trends thus far in October and to revenue it has generated from an amended marketing agreement for credit cards with Chase Bank USA NA.The forecast unit revenue increase breaks a two-quarter-long decline in that measure as Southwest added capacity and competed for share in hotly contested U.S. cities such as Dallas - its headquarters - pressuring ticket prices. Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel called the unit revenue rise a ""very positive indication going into 2016,"" saying he had expected it to stay flat.Investors closely follow the unit revenue gauge as an indicator of long-term health in the airline business. Southwest reported that its capacity plans remain unchanged, expecting to increase available seat miles about 7 percent in 2015 and about 5 percent to 6 percent in 2016, each compared to a year earlier.It said it expects unit costs in the fourth quarter, excluding fuel, profit-sharing and other expenses, will be ""comparable"" with the year prior, including the impact from a tentative contract it has reached with pilots at the airline.The airline said it returned $549 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks in the third quarter.It said its operating margin in the quarter was 20.3 percent, helped by lower fuel prices.

Southwest's stock plummeted 9 percent as a result.Kelly said a U.S. State Department warning about travel after the Nov. 13 Paris attacks that killed 130 people may have impacted U.S. bookings.

""We're just being cautious about what to expect here in December and the Christmas season,"" Kelly said to reporters of the revised forecast, speaking during a gathering of aviation executives and analysts known as the Wings Club.

He called U.S. Gross Domestic Product growth of around 2 percent ""anemic.""Kelly also said the U.S. Federal Reserve should raise interest rates, adding that a hike would benefit Southwest because of its low debt and ""will actually boost our interest income because we've got $4 billion sitting in (the bank) not making a whole lot.""Shares of Southwest were up about 2 percent in early afternoon trading Thursday.

151,"  (Adds comment from United, Delta, Southwest and JetBlue, analyst comments, detail on pricing process)By Jeffrey DastinNEW YORK Jan 5 The top U.S. airlines said Tuesday that they have raised fares in the first industry-wide hike since June, moves that may offset increasing labor costs but draw the ire of customers.Fares increased $3 one-way for U.S. domestic flights on American Airlines Group Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co  and JetBlue Airways Corp, each company told Reuters.The price hike comes at a precarious time for the industry, which is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for potentially conspiring to limit flights and keep fares high. The airlines have denied collusion.The federal agency declined to comment on the fare rise.Airlines have long monitored each others' prices and quickly responded to changes, much like gas station owners watch the signs of their competitors. Carriers file fares with the Airline Tariff Publishing Company, a distributor that has a product for price tracking primarily used by industry insiders.This week's fare hike began with changes by Delta on Monday, the airline confirmed. Southwest was the next to follow suit, two analysts said.""The industry has never met a Southwest fare increase it didn't match, for as far back as our records go,"" JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a research note. ""Just as Southwest often plays the spoiler role, competitors consistently follow Southwest's lead to the upside."" U.S. airlines regularly adjust their fares, but an industry-wide match is far less common. A $3-rise occurred last in June when Southwest also matched a change by Delta, Baker said in a prior note.CONSUMER IMPACT  Tuesday's news is another indication that airlines are not translating savings from a year's decline in fuel prices into lower ticket prices, a break from a decade ago when more airlines vied for customers.Consumers will have little choice but to accept the hike because the five airlines control more than 80 percent of the U.S. travel market, following four high-profile mergers.The price hike is unlikely to decrease demand for corporate travel, as employers accept higher fares as the cost of doing business, industry consultant Robert Mann said. Airlines are betting the rise will boost revenue even if leisure travel dips, he said.However, competition is still high on the busiest U.S. routes. The lowest leisure fares were on average 24 percent lower from a year earlier for the top 1,000 domestic routes, according to a late December report by travel consultancy Harrell Associates.Mann said the price hike will help the airlines manage growing labor costs and prepare for new contracts with wages likely to balloon.He said it may have the side effect of leaving planes emptier, a plus when winter cancellations force airlines to rebook customers onto other flights.

While U.S. airlines regularly adjust their fares, hiking prices for nearly all domestic flights is less common and an industry-wide match even less so. The moves come as the U.S. Justice Department investigates whether carriers have worked together illegally to keep fares high by signaling plans to limit flights.

153,"  (Recasts with potential merger, strategy shift, adds analyst)By Jeffrey DastinJan 5 Spirit Airlines Inc on Tuesday named board member Robert Fornaro as chief executive officer in a move analysts say may nudge it towards a merger with Frontier Airlines and improve its results after a year of unit revenue decline.Fornaro headed AirTran Holdings Inc for nearly four years until Southwest Airlines Co bought it in 2011. Analysts say his record of dealmaking may in the long run seal a merger of Spirit and Frontier, which have a common low-cost model and plane types.Shares of Spirit were up nearly 6 percent at the close of trading.The U.S. carrier has grown rapidly in the past five years by marketing ultra-low fares with heavy restrictions. Recent moves by larger Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc to match those prices have hurt its unit revenue and slashed 46 percent from its stock in 2015. Fornaro replaces Spirit's decade-long leader, Ben Baldanza, who will assist with the transition, the company said in a news release. The reason Baldanza left was not immediately clear.A tie-up of Spirit and Frontier would give the carriers scale to ""compete better against larger airlines by leveraging cost efficiencies,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a note Tuesday.Baldanza has said Spirit did not need a merger to grow, according to the note. The managing partner of Frontier's owner Indigo Partners, Bill Franke, has said he expects low-cost airlines in the United States to consolidate. Indigo sold its stake in Spirit before buying Frontier in 2013.A decline in fuel prices last year allowed larger carriers, which have high costs associated with long-haul flying and premium-cabin travel, to profitably chop their fares in line with Spirit's. Price battlegrounds, combined with Spirit's around 30-percent growth in flight capacity, pushed the carrier's operating revenue per seat down 17.5 percent in the third quarter. Spirit has said the decline would continue in the fourth quarter and into 2016.""Spirit's focus will remain delivering a customer-friendly product and providing the lowest total price to the places we fly,"" Fornaro said in the news release.In the near term, Fornaro may help boost Spirit's employee morale and brand, which has gained notoriety for its edginess and for customers' occasional misunderstanding of their fares' restrictions, industry consultant Robert Mann said.""He has a history of constructive relationships on the property and with his suppliers,"" Mann said.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Alan Crosby)",2016-01-06,LUV,"Tue Jan 5, 2016 | 7:06pm EST","UPDATE 1-Spirit Airlines appoints new CEO, seen as M&A harbinger",http://www.reuters.com//article/spirit-airlines-ceo-idUSL1N14P1YB20160106?type=companyNews
154,"  (Adds details, quotes and background)Jan 8 Southwest Airlines Co must make room for rival Delta Air Lines Inc in its gates at Dallas Love Field Airport, a U.S. district court ordered on Friday.The decision lets Delta maintain its five daily flights between Atlanta and space-constrained Love Field, sparing the carrier from having to cancel the flights of thousands of passengers who have already booked their trips.Southwest, which controls 18 of 20 gates at Love Field, accused Delta of trespassing on its airport property as a gate-sharing agreement between them was set to expire in the summer of 2015. The budget carrier then accommodated Delta pending a resolution in court. ""This isn't the end of this case, and we are evaluating our future options,"" Southwest said in a statement. ""Southwest plans to continue serving our customers with 50 nonstop destinations with 180 flights a day.""Love Field, the headquarters of Southwest, has been key to the low-cost carrier's growth strategy since a law that capped flying from that airport to several states expired in October 2014. Southwest had originally expressed concern that accommodating Delta would lead to flight delays or prevent it from ramping up to 180 flights per day from the airport starting in August 2015. Coordinating with Delta to ensure efficient gate usage let the ramp-up proceed, however.""The Court finds the chaos and inconvenience of disrupted service by removing Delta from Love Field before the legal issues are decided would be a great disservice to the public,"" U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas wrote in the order. Southwest is enjoined from adding flights on any of its gates shared with Delta, and it must inform the U.S. district court if it ever reduces flight service from Love Field, the order said.Delta said Friday it was pleased to continue its Love Field service.Delta also operates tens of daily flights from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, where Southwest is barred by contract from expanding unless it relinquishes rights at the newly renovated and more central Love Field.

155,"  (Adds detail on stock buyback, flight capacity, unit costs, hedge liability, share movement, background)Jan 21 Southwest Airlines Co on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter profit in line with analysts' expectations and said it expected flat unit revenue in early 2016 as strong U.S. travel demand halted a monthslong decline in the measure.The U.S. budget airline, whose shares rose 0.4 percent in premarket trading, also said it would soon start a $500 million accelerated stock buyback.Earnings before special items rose 46 percent to $591 million, or 90 cents a share, as the plummeting cost of jet fuel added $189 million to Southwest's bottom line. Analysts on average expected 90 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said it expected first-quarter unit revenue, which compares ticket sales with flight capacity, to be ""in line"" with a year earlier. The measure fell 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. ""We've seen a continuation of strong demand and softer yields,"" or fares per mile per passenger, Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said in a news release.For months, lower fuel prices have ramped up competition within the United States, enabling large domestic carriers to chop fares in line with budget airlines that have lower operating costs. Cheap oil has also forced Southwest to pay hefty sums to counterparties in hedge contracts that the carrier acquired for protection in case of rising energy prices. As a result, it will not reap the full benefit of cheaper fuel.The Dallas-based airline said it expected to lose $1 billion from hedge contracts in 2016, as of Jan. 15 prices. Southwest said it still expected to increase its flight capacity by 5 percent to 6 percent in 2016 and that results from its new international flights from Houston had been encouraging so far.The company said it would retire certain older planes in its fleet no later than mid-2018, increasing its new aircraft delivery schedule to accommodate this. This will contribute a rise of about 1 percent in unit costs this year.Including special items such as the change in the market value of Southwest's outstanding hedges, the company earned $536 million in the fourth quarter.

A similar inquiry by the Justice Department was disclosed on Thursday by rival United Continental Holdings Inc, which said it was asked in October to provide documents and oral testimony about the scanning of international mail carried under its U.S. Postal Service contracts.The three airlines said they are fully cooperating with the investigation. Another airline, budget carrier Southwest Airlines Co, does not carry mail directly for the U.S. Postal Service and is not a party to the inquiry, a company spokesman said on Friday.

164,"   By Noel Randewich  Wall Street suffered its first loss in four sessions on Thursday after a mixed bag of quarterly reports and a warning by Verizon Communications that a strike by workers would likely impact its bottom line.The benchmark S&P 500 index in recent days had rallied to within 1 percent of its May record high, buoyed by a softer dollar and recovering crude prices. But investors had little patience for quarterly scorecards failing to meet already toned-down expectations.""Earnings have been decent, outperforming, but outperforming expectations that have been dramatically lowered,"" said Charlie Johnson, a sales trader at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. ""So it's like a shell game.""  Crude fell about 1 percent, but hovered near five-month highs after the International Energy Agency said 2016 would see the biggest fall in non-OPEC production in 25 years.

Nine of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower, with the telecom sector down 2.74 percent, thanks largely to Verizon.After the bell Alphabet posted first-quarter revenue a little below expectations and its stock dropped 5.5 percent. Microsoft fell 3.5 percent after its quarterly report.During the session, Travelers fell 6.05 percent after the property and casualty insurer reported a 17 percent fall in profit. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow. Of the S&P companies that have reported so far for the first quarter, 77 percent have beaten profit estimates, compared with the 63 percent that surprise in a typical quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.S&P 500 companies are expected to post a 7.2 percent fall in profit on average, and then a less drastic 2.6 percent dip in the second quarter.""We think the market has already discounted the weak first quarter and possibly even some negative earnings in the second quarter,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

165,"  (Corrects Boeing headquarters to Chicago in sixth paragraph)April 21 Southwest Airlines Co would ""absolutely"" consider a new version of Boeing Co's 737 jet that the planemaker is said to be mulling, the budget airline's Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said on a conference call with media on Thursday.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Boeing is considering whether to build a replacement of the smallest 737 MAX jet that could fly farther and fend off competition from Bombardier Inc's fledgling CSeries aircraft.Southwest only flies 737s from Boeing. As of March 31, it had on order 346 new planes to be delivered through 2027 and options to buy 191 more. Boeing is locked in a fierce battle for market share with Airbus Group SE, which has outsold it recently in narrowbody jets. However, both manufacturers are anxious to protect their jet market duopoly against newcomers like Canada's Bombardier, which looks poised to win a large order for the CSeries from Delta Air Lines Inc.Boeing has called the model under consideration the 737 MAX 7X. It would seat around 150 passengers rather than 126, according to the report. Chicago-based Boeing was not immediately available for comment. An industry source added weight to the media report, saying Boeing may have pitched this idea to Delta without winning a favorable response for the time being.According to the article, the new interim model would be a ""shrink,"" or shorter-fuselage version of the 737 MAX 8.Analysts say such aircraft tend to be difficult to sell because they inherit part of the extra structural weight of the larger plane and are often considered inefficient.

175,"  * Germania deal could be worth over $2.5 bln at list prices* Virgin Atlantic seen ordering A350s, cancelling A380s* Boeing expected to relaunch smallest version of 737 MAX   (Adds sources in paragraph 14, Boeing plans in paragraph 17)By Tim HepherFARNBOROUGH, England, July 10 German airline Germania is close to placing an order with European planemaker Airbus for around 25 A320-family jets, two industry sources said on Sunday, as aviation chiefs gathered for an industry summit clouded by economic worries.The privately-held German carrier operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing jets but has said it aims to harmonise its fleet by switching to all-Airbus aircraft when it takes older Boeing 737-700s out of service.The potential order, which could be worth over $2.5 billion at list prices, will disappoint Boeing which tried to wrestle back its former customer on the eve of Britain's Farnborough Airshow, the sources said, asking not to be named.Germania officials could not immediately be reached for comment. An Airbus spokesman said, ""We do not comment on confidential talks which may or may not be happening with our customers.""Germania currently operates a medium-haul fleet of 10 Boeing 737-700s, as well as eight Airbus A319s and four A321s.Swiss affiliate Germania operates three Airbus jets, according to latest statistics from the planemaker.The airline first ordered Airbus jets in 2010, having previously operated mainly Boeing airplanes. Chief executive Karsten Balke told Reuters last year it still had purchase rights for further Airbus aircraft and would use them ""when we get the right price"".Berlin-based Germania focuses on Europe, North Africa and the Middle East and recently announced a co-operation with Spanish carrier Air Europa.If confirmed, the order could be announced at the upcoming July 11-17 Farnborough Airshow, the sources said. However, the showcase for order announcements, which alternates each year with the Paris Airshow, is expected to be quieter this year as airlines await direction from a faltering economy after several years of strong demand.Among other potential deals, Airbus was said on the eve of the show to be close to securing an order worth some $3 billion for 8-10 A350 jets from Virgin Atlantic.But the same airline looks set to cancel a long-standing order for six Airbus A380 superjumbos, industry sources said.Boeing is expected to firm up at least part of a deal for up to 20 747-8 freighters from Russia's Volga Dnepr, boosting its declining jumbo jet programme, and could announce a new Asian customer for its 737 MAX 200 jet aimed at low-cost carriers.The U.S. company announced a preliminary deal with Volga Dnepr last year.Boeing is meanwhile expected to relaunch the smallest version of its 737 MAX series by adding more seats to make it more economical for airlines, after negotiating the change with buyers including Southwest Airlines.Airbus is expected to talk up the recent sales success of its A321neo, the largest member of its medium-haul family, as Norwegian Air considers upgrading about 30 of the 100 A320neo it has on order to the larger 185-seat A321neo.

Its reservations website, www.southwest.com, appeared to not allow booking or check-in and had a notice saying, ""We're working hard to get you where you want to be... Thank you for your patience.""Southwest spokesman Dan Landson said a team is working to resolve the issues that began Wednesday afternoon following an outage. It will take time before the budget airline resumes a normal operation, he said.Flight tracking website FlightAware.com showed that Southwest had delayed 157 flights so far on Wednesday, or about 3 percent of its operation.Systems were gradually coming back online, Landson said. The airline tweeted at 4:55 p.m. Eastern (20:55 GMT) that ""flight status and check-in are functional in our site waiting room."" No further details were available. The company's shares were down 1.6 percent at $42.03 at the closing bell.The glitch follows several high-profile computer problems faced by U.S. airlines in recent months.

Shares of the budget airline, which also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, fell as much as 11.3 percent, their biggest intraday percentage drop in a year. Chief Executive Gary Kelly, in an interview to CNBC, termed the glitch ""unusual"". ""The technology is restored as of about 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. this morning and now the operation just needs some time today to catch up,"" he said. ""So, it will be another tough day today but not nearly as bad as yesterday.""As of 7:30 a.m. ET (1130 GMT), Southwest had canceled more than 220 flights on Thursday, a spokeswoman said in an email. ""We canceled nearly 700 flights Wednesday and hundreds more were delayed,"" she said. The outage was caused by the failure of computer equipment supporting the carrier's network. The No.4 U.S. airline by traffic said it expected revenue per available seat mile (RASM) to fall 3-4 percent in the current quarter. ""While solid traffic demand has continued into July thus far, the fare environment remains challenging,"" Kelly said in a statement.RASM, a key indicator of an airline's performance, measures sales against flight capacity. Southwest's total costs rose 2 percent to $4.11 billion in the second quarter. However, unit cost fell 2.6 percent, helped by lower fuel costs. Cheap fuel has increased competition in the U.S. airline industry by allowing large carriers to slash fares to levels offered by budget airlines. It has also forced Southwest, the largest hedger among U.S. airlines, to pay hefty sums to counterparties in hedge contracts acquired for protection against a rise in energy prices, limiting its ability to benefit from cheaper fuel.Southwest's net income jumped 35 percent to $820 million, or $1.28 per share, in the quarter ended June 30. Excluding items, Southwest earned $1.19 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.21, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Operating revenue rose 5.3 percent to $5.38 billion.  Southwest said it expected to buy back $250 million in shares as part of an accelerated repurchase program.  Southwest Airlines shares were down 8.9 percent at $38.31 in morning trading.

The incident forced Delta to cancel 2,300 flights over three days and highlighted airlines' fragile technology infrastructure.Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, now expects an operating profit margin of 18 percent to 19 percent in the third quarter, compared with a prior outlook of 19 percent to 21 percent.

Domestic unit revenue, a closely watched measure that compares sales to flight capacity, also showed ""solid improvement"" as fall schedules took effect, the company said in a regulatory filing. The airline said capacity growth in the United States, its biggest market, would slow to 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter from 5.7 percent in the first half of the year. The fewer seats airlines offer, the more likely they are to avoid deep discounts to fill them.For months, new flights as well as attacks from Paris to Istanbul have forced airlines to sell cheaper tickets, hurting their unit revenue.  Southwest, which has ramped up flights from Dallas and contributed to rivals' woes, on Wednesday said it expected capacity to rise less than 4 percent in 2017, compared with anticipated growth of 5 percent to 6 percent this year.""The data point should ease some concerns that elevated growth from Southwest next year could further pressure domestic pricing trends,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.

209,"  (Add comments from ATL COO)By Steve BittenbenderLOUISVILLE, Ky. Oct 5 A replacement model of the fire-prone Samsung Note 7 smartphone began smoking inside a U.S. plane on Wednesday, the family that owns it said, prompting fresh investigations by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Aviation Administration.A problem with the replacement for the Note 7 model would create a new, embarrassing and potentially costly chapter to a global scandal which has hurt Samsung's reputation. It also could add new dangers for consumers.Indiana passenger Brian Green's phone began emitting smoke inside a Southwest Airlines Co flight to Baltimore from Louisville, Kentucky, his wife Sarah told Reuters after speaking with her husband. She said that Green had replaced the original phone about two weeks ago after getting a text message from Samsung. Samsung Electronics Co said in a statement it was working to recover the device and to understand the cause. ""Until we are able to retrieve the device, we cannot confirm that this incident involves the new Note 7,"" the South Korean company said.The world's largest smartphone maker announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones in 10 markets last month due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire.The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is in touch with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Samsung and the phone's owner to gather facts, Chairman Elliot Kaye said in a statement, reminding consumers that they could get refunds for the troubled model. The FAA said in a statement that it had confirmed a Samsung phone caused the smoke on the Southwest flight and that it was investigating the incident.Technology news site The Verge, which earlier reported the incident, quoted Brian Green as saying the phone was a replacement, and it posted a picture taken by him of the packaging. The picture showed an identifying label with a black box, which Samsung has described as the indicator of a replacement phone. A spokeswoman declined to comment on the picture. Samsung customers in China have reported problems with phones that have the same battery as the global replacement model, but Samsung has said it examined the Chinese phones and found the batteries were not at fault.Joe Kit Chu Lam, chief operating officer at battery maker Amperex Technology Limited (ATL) said: ""We have not been contacted by any government agency or been asked to assist any investigation. We will cooperate if required."" Reuters reported last month that China's ATL would become the main supplier of batteries for Note 7 phones after the phone recall.Green picked up the new phone at an AT&T Inc store on Sept. 21, the Verge said.

226,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Pilots at Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) voted to ratify a new contract that hikes wages and alters retirement benefits, their union said on Monday, following more than four years of talks.The approval marks a step toward better labor relations at the U.S. budget airline after recent picketing by workers and calls by union leaders for two executives to resign.Shares were up 3 percent at the market's close.The new contract raises pay by 15 percent upon ratification, followed by increases of 3 percent annually through 2020, the Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association said in a news release.The deal, reached with the help of U.S. mediators, moves pilots from a company-matching pension plan to one where they are not required to contribute to receive benefits, the union said. It also protects pilots' work in case Southwest chooses to market flights on non-U.S. airlines.More than 84 percent of voting pilots approved the deal, with turnout at 96 percent, the union said. Southwest is ""starting to put behind some of the rancor that has punctuated the place for the past couple years,"" industry consultant Robert Mann said.A July computer outage that forced Southwest to cancel more than 2,000 flights added to workers' discontent. Weeks afterward, leaders from four unions submitted a vote of ""no confidence"" for Southwest's chief executive officer and chief operating officer.""Even the most ardent labor supporters start to ask questions when you can’t run a clean operation,"" said Mann.
