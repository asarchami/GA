0,"   By Soham Chatterjee  Garmin Ltd handily beat quarterly profit estimates and forecast a strong 2014 as sales of GPS-based fitness, aviation and outdoor products more than made up for shrinking sales of personal navigation devices, a market it once dominated.Garmin shares jumped as much as 12 percent to $52.72 - their highest in six years. The stock, however, is still a far cry from the high of $124 it hit in 2007, when personal navigation devices were high in demand and featured on most year-end gifting lists.Garmin said on Wednesday it expects revenue to grow 10-15 percent from businesses other than its personal navigation device unit, where revenue is expected to fall 10-15 percent.The forecast implies that sales from personal navigation devices will account for less than half of the company's revenue this year.Sales from the personal navigation devices unit fell 12 percent to $382.5 million in the fourth quarter, while sales from all other units combined rose 14 percent to account for nearly half of the company's total sales of $759.7 million.Much of that was driven by strong sales in the company's aviation and fitness businesses.Aviation unit sales jumped 25 percent to $87.4 million in the quarter. The unit makes audio panels and collision avoidance systems for aircraft makers such as Textron Inc's Cessna and Bombardier Inc's LearJet.Sales at its fitness business, which makes products such as GPS-enabled ""Forerunner""-branded watches to count calories and monitor heart beats, rose 14 percent to $118.6 million. The company said it expects higher-margin, newly-launched products such as ""VIRB"" outdoor action-recording camera, ""vivofit"" health-monitoring bands and cycling computers to generate revenue growth in 2014.Gross margins are expected to rise to 54-55 percent from 52 percent in 2013.""We are particularly impressed with the revenue guidance. Garmin typically guides conservatively at the beginning of the year so we think the company must be feeling very good about its business,"" Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Spinola said.Dutch rival TomTom - Europe's largest maker of navigation devices - said last week it expects the personal navigation device market to continue to decline this year due to a slump in demand for personal sat-navs and a tepid recovery in the auto industry. Navigation devices - once a duopoly of Garmin and TomTom - lost relevance as mapping apps became a standard feature on Apple Inc's iPhones and phones powered by Google Inc's Android operating system.To counter the fall in sales, the companies charted different strategies to sustain growth.

5,"  American Andrew Talansky was the surprise winner of the Criterium du Dauphine after he overcame a 39-second deficit to beat pre-race favorites Alberto Contador and Chris Froome on Sunday.The final stage had been expected to be a showdown between Tour de France champion Froome, who had led the race for the first six stages, and Spaniard Contador who had outclassed the Briton on Saturday to lead the overall standings by eight-seconds.But Talansky surged past the favorites during the 131.5 km eighth stage from Megeve to Courchevel to win by 27 seconds.""Moments like this make the sacrifices worthwhile,"" an emotional Talansky told reporters.While Contador trailed in more than a minute behind Talansky in the final stage, Froome struggled to maintain contact and ended up finishing outside the top 10 in the general classification.  Froome's fellow Team Sky rider Mikel Nieve won Sunday's stage in three hours 20 minutes 29 seconds.Froome said he had been suffering from a crash on stage six. ""I've felt completely blocked up through my front of quads since the crash and I've not been able to engage the same types of muscles that I used in the earlier stages,"" he said.Looking ahead to the Tour de France, Froome added: ""(Contador's) shown he's in great form ahead of the Tour though, and we're definitely going to have a battle on our hands in July."" Talansky produced a stunning late breakaway to cross the line in fourth, nine seconds behind Nieve.

6,"   By Julien Pretot | OYONNAX France  OYONNAX France After a long talk with Garmin-Sharp sports director Robbie Hunter, Andrew Talansky remounted his bike and wiped tears off his face, a bleak mask of pain.The American rider, suffering from lower-back pain after two crashes earlier in the Tour de France, had stopped some 100km into the 11th stage to sit on a crash barrier by the side of a sun-drenched road.Race organizers announced that Garmin-Sharp had abandoned the Tour, but Talansky - aka the Pitbull - was back on his bike, accompanied only by his pain.Ironically, his team set a hard pace in front of the bunch, possibly to prepare a stage win for their Dutch rider, Tom-Jelte Slagter, making it harder for Talansky to finish inside the time cut.He crossed the line 32:08 minutes behind stage winner Tony Gallopin, of France.""He had a very tough day. We had hoped he could have a better day. It's typical of cyclists and especially of Andrew,"" said Charles Wegelius, the team's other sports director. ""It's very disappointing to come to this race with the kind of expectations that Andrew had. He deserved much better than this, so that's cruel.  ""It came from these two crashes in two days. He needed some reassurance from Robbie about the situation he was in,"" Wegelius added. ""Robbie talked him to the finish line. For someone with this character it's only natural to make it to the finish line.""  On Monday, Spain's Alberto Contador also showed that riders are tough guys, riding 15km - almost 10 of them uphill - with a shinbone fracture before pulling out of the race.Talansky was his team's leader after having won the Criterium du Dauphine, the warm-up race for the Tour, beating Contador and defending champion Chris Froome.Shaking and crying as he reached his team bus, Talansky said: ""My back is hurting but I wanted to finish for my team mates. ""I continued for my team, for my mates. They trusted me for that Tour, I could not stop after all they had done for me.""The Tour being merciless, Talansky was fined 50 Swiss francs ($55.64)for taking shelter behind the team car as he was looking to make it back into the peloton.After a solid start to the Tour, Talansky had initially crashed at the end of the seventh stage and fell off his bike again last Sunday in the first stage in the Vosges massif.($1 = 0.8986 Swiss Francs) (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by XXXX)",2014-07-16,GRMN,"Wed Jul 16, 2014 | 2:02pm EDT",Pitbull Talansky rides through the tears for sake of team,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-cycling-tour-talansky-idUSKBN0FL2BH20140716?type=companyNews
7,"  Severe back pain, two crashes and a chest infection forced American Andrew Talansky to become the latest top rider to abandon the Tour de France on Thursday.""I'm absolutely heartbroken. I built my season around the Tour, and the team has supported me every step of the way,"" Talansky, winner of the Criterium du Dauphine warm-up race in June, said in a Team Garmin-Sharp statement.""I had hoped the rest day would allow some time to recover from my crashes. I was hopeful that I could get through yesterday and I tried to be there for the team, the way they have been there for me this whole time,"" he added. ""But it proved to be too much."" Back pain forced the 25-year-old to stop by the roadside on Wednesday, the 187.5 km 11th stage from Besancon to Oyonaxx, but he got back on his bike to cross the line well behind the peloton despite initially looking poised to retire.His team issued a statement praising the American, whose nickname is ""Pit Bull"", saying: ""We are proud of his ride yesterday, of his tenacity and his courage. He was determined to finish the stage, no matter how far back he was. That's the heart of a champion.""  Team doctor Kevin Sprouse said Talansky was suffering the cumulative effects of multiple crashes during the first part of the Tour, an upper respiratory infection and lower back pain that made it hard for him to pedal. Italy's Vincenzo Nibali of Astana leads the 21-stage race by two minutes and 23 seconds from Team Sky's Richie Porte of Australia.  Defending champion Chris Froome, two-time winner Alberto Contador and sprint specialist Mark Cavendish have already been forced out of the race due to injury after all suffered heavy crashes in a treacherous first half of the Tour.

8,"   By Julien Pretot | NIMES France  NIMES France It all ended in tears for Garmin-Sharp domestique Jack Bauer after his chance of realizing a boyhood dream and winning a Tour de France stage was snatched away from him in the final 50 meters after a 222km breakaway.With team leader Andrew Talansky injured and gone, the Garmin-Sharp domestiques have been given a free ride on the Tour and Bauer almost made the most of the opportunity on Sunday's 15th stage.The New Zealander formed the breakaway of the day with Swiss Martin Elmiger of the IAM team and after a tense finale, he was caught as the line approached by the chasing bunch.""It's just a bitter, bitter disappointment. It's a childhood dream to win a stage of the tour and for a domestique, like myself, I'm normally working for others,"" said Bauer, who broke down in tears after the finish of the stage won by Norway's Alexander Kristoff. ""This was my first chance to be up the road and with the change in the wind and the weather, me and Martin realized we had a chance for the win.""Swirling winds and tough weather, with heavy rain and storms, as well as multiple roundabouts in the final kilometers, made it hard for the chasing pack. The duo had a 13-second lead with one kilometer left and had started the usual cat-and-mouse mind game to win a two-man sprint.Bauer was fresher than Elmiger but he was missing a few drops of juice to go all the way.""I faked to be tired but felt I had more punch left. I left it until 400 meters to go. I thought I had it,"" said Bauer. That's when the peloton, with sprinters speeding at over 60 kph, whizzed past him.""I thought I had it but then I realized in the last 50 meters, that I had nothing,"" he said. Bauer, like other riders in the Garmin-Sharp team, had his leash loosened after American Talansky, who had an outside chance of a podium finish before the start of the race, withdrew with back pains earlier this week. Before he could fight for the stage win, he had to jockey for a spot in the breakaway.""A break is not just a group of people who are stronger than the other 180 riders and they just ride away. It's a shuffle at the start of the stage, it's a positioning thing, it's a motivational thing after two hard days,"" said Bauer. ""A lot of people wanted a sprint finish but for us it was important. After losing Talansky and not really having many stages in the last week that suit, today was a day we wanted to gamble that a break would stay away. It was so close but so far.""

9,"   By Julien Pretot | BERGERAC France  BERGERAC France Ramunas Navardauskas finished off Garmin-Sharp's plan to win the 19th stage of the Tour de France, a 208.5-km ride from Maubourguet on Friday as Italian Vincenzo Nibali retained the overall leader's yellow jersey.Five days after team mate Jack Bauer was caught by the peloton a few meters from the line after a 222-km breakaway, the Lithuanian attacked on a short climb close to the finish and never looked back.German John Degenkolb took second place seven seconds behind and Norway's Alexander Kristoff finished third after the main bunch was split by a late crash on roads made slippery by torrential rain earlier in the day.    All the riders from the main pack were credited with the same time as the incident happened with less than three kilometers left.""I was the first to crash, I did not know what happened,"" said Slovakian Peter Sagan, who had been tipped as one of the stage favorites.    Nibali still leads France's Thibaut Pinot by 7:10 and another Frenchman, Jean-Christophe Peraud, who crashed but said he was fine, by 7:23, ahead of Saturday's decisive time trial, a 54-km solo ride between Bergerac and Perigueux.Garmin-Sharp, without team leader Andrew Talansky after the American pulled out due to lower back pain, only had a stage win in mind. They had Tom-Jelte Slagter in the day's breakaway and the Dutchman served as Navardauskas's launchpad after the climb.""The plan was to attack in the climb and to have one of our riders in the breakaway so he could take a strong relay to help me,"" Navardauskas told a news conference.""It's almost amazing to keep the peloton at bay,"" said Navardauskas, who had his team mate's misfortune in mind. ""Until the last 10 meters I was afraid to turn back,"" he added.Navardauskas powered away from the pack on the fourth-category climb of the Cote de Monbazillac 13 kilometers from the finish.Pinot's FDJ.fr team led the peloton in the descent and on the flat portion leading to the line, Cannondale and Tinkoff-Saxo chased the Garmin-Sharp rider who was 25 seconds ahead with five kilometers left.With just under three kilometers remaining, Peter Sagan was involved in the crash as well as France's Romain Bardet who is fifth in the overall standings and his AG2R-La Mondiale team mate Peraud. ""I was caught in the crash, I tried to avoid it but I couldn't. Romain crashed in front of me,"" Peraud told reporters.""Obviously the rain did not help, especially in a finale with a lot of turns and nervous sprint in the end. We crashed, it's classic.""Pinot, instead, was well placed by the front of the peloton and avoided the crash.""We knew it would be a nervous stage, it was important to be near the front. I did not crash, it's all good,"" the 24-year-old Frenchman said.

20,"   By Julien Pretot | MALLORCA, Spain  MALLORCA, Spain Years of scepticism toward scientific and technological innovation have been wiped out recently as cycling has been recovering from major drugs scandals, according to former professional rider and now team manager Jonathan Vaughters.American Vaughters, a former team mate of Lance Armstrong's who admitted to doping during his career, launched Slipstream Sports in 2005 and Garmin-Chipotle -- now Cannondale-Garmin after a merger with the Italian team. They started in the elite in 2008 on a strong anti-doping stance.A pro racer from 1994-2003, the 41-year-old Vaughters has seen the worst in cycling, but also experienced from the inside the fight against doping, which took a major turn in 2008 when the International Cycling Union (UCI) introduced the biological passport.The focus could then turn on to innovation to gain an advantage over rival teams.""When I started racing I had a SRM (a power-measuring device), I was one of the firs with Stefano Della Santa and (Greg) LeMond, it was three guys in the peloton who had a SRM,"" Vaughters told Reuters at a Cannondale-Garmin training camp.""Now it's standard that everyone measures power. ""In 2008 with David Millar we did lot of wind-tunnel testing we had fast equipment, we had a big advantage. Nowadays that advantage is gone,"" he said.All teams now measure power and look to take the edge through minor gains on positioning, suits and bikes.  ""The scepticism regarding technological developments has eroded because in old cycling, in the end someone would say we can gain five watts in the wind tunnel if we exact your position and use the perfect skinsuit and use this special material or whatever... and then the team doctor says, yeah, but we can gain 50 by doping,"" Vaughters said.""We were a little bit demoralized regarding technological development and innovation."" Riders now are known for trying to lose weight in order to improve their power ratio, an effort they would not necessarily have had to make when doping was rife in the sport.""When I was racing, losing one kilo, two kilos who cares, you know, because you could make a big difference with EPO -- now you come down to losing one or two kilos it's a big advantage.""Team Sky were the first to advertise their taste for technological innovation when they started in the elite in 2010, trying to reproduce British track cycling's hunt for marginal gains on the road.  ""What they did so well is execute and systematize, because they had a huge budget they were able to execute and systematize all the advances across the board of the team,"" Vaughters said.""In other teams maybe we had the means to do wind tunnel testing for one or two riders -- it's a smaller scientific operation.""While Cannondale-Garmin still operate with only one coach, others, like French outfits FDJ and AG2R-La Mondiale, have beefed up their staff with four and three coaches respectively. ""You can see the racing is more compressed, it's a tighter margin between the top riders so the riders become open to technological innovation, they become willing to experiment,"" Vaughters said.
