Horton Inc's  sales pace picked up in January ahead of what it said would be a ""very strong"" spring selling season as Americans become more comfortable with higher mortgage rates in a stabilizing U.S. economy.The largest U.S. homebuilder's shares rose as much as 10 percent after higher selling prices boosted its profit by 86 percent in the first quarter, making it the most profitable first quarter since 2006.The company, which caters mostly to first-time home buyers, said its average sales price rose 10 percent to $275,600 in the quarter, indicating that the company may not have to resort to heavy discounts to promote sales.D.R. Horton warned in November that it could step up discounting if demand did not pick up by the spring selling season - traditionally the strongest period for U.S. homebuilders. ""January sales are accelerating into the spring and we have a supply of spec homes available to meet that demand,"" Chief Executive Donald Tomnitz said on a conference call with analysts.Spec homes, or speculative homes, are houses a company builds in expectation of future demand. D.R. Horton has one of the strongest inventories of spec homes among U.S. homebuilders.Orders booked by D.R. Horton increased to 5,454 homes in the first quarter ended Dec. 31 - seasonally the slowest selling period for U.S. homebuilders.The fact that orders didn't dip again after falling 2 percent in the preceding quarter was encouraging, Morningstar Inc analyst James Krapfel said. ""Potential homebuyers are getting more comfortable with the higher interest rate environment and returning to buying homes,"" he said.U.S. consumer confidence rose in January as consumers grew more optimistic about both business conditions and the job market, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday.The Dow Jones Home Construction index was up 5 percent on Tuesday morning. GROWING INVENTORY D.R. Horton has lagged some peers in the housing market recovery due to weaker land assets. It took a bigger hit when demand slowed over the summer.Orders at No. 3 builder Lennar Corp and largest luxury builder Toll Brothers Inc stayed strong through the recent slowdown as they have a wider presence in city centers thanks to their strategy of buying land through the economic downturn of 2008-2010.But Tomnitz said the company was better prepared to handle growing demand in the spring selling season.D.R. Horton had 16,800 homes in inventory as of Dec. 31 of which 9,300 were speculative homes. Its average community count for the quarter was up 13 percent from a year earlier.D.R. Horton's net income almost doubled to $123.2 million, or 36 cents per share from $66.3 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose 33 percent to $1.64 billion.The company's shares were up at $23.06 on Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

2,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani | April 15  April 15 A resurgent U.S. housing market has created an unforeseen land shortage that could take the shine off an otherwise promising year for homebuilders.To keep up with demand, builders who neglected to buy land during the downturn must now pay top dollar for prized city-center locations. Their profit margins are likely to be squeezed this year, even as house prices rise.""Builders waited so long to buy land that, when the recovery happened, it was very strong and they got caught short,"" said Tobias Welo, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments.The quickest solution for the big players, according to some analysts and fund managers, will be to snap up small, privately owned builders facing the opposite problem: plenty of land but limited access to bank finance.The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index has regained much of the ground lost in the second half of 2013, when rising mortgage rates and wider economic uncertainty broke an 18-month winning streak for homebuilder stocks.With anecdotal evidence from homebuilders and mortgage brokers suggesting a pick-up in demand for residential housing, analysts are forecasting an average 18 percent jump in the value of the leading U.S. homebuilders this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.The average forecast covers D.R. Horton Inc, PulteGroup Inc, Lennar Corp, KB Home and Toll Brothers Inc.David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, expects new home construction in the United States to rise by about 25 percent this year, up from 18 percent last year.But his forecast is conditional on homebuilders buying enough land in sought-after urban areas. If they don't, he said, the rate of increase could be half his original estimate. James Krapfel, analyst at Morningstar Inc, forecast new home construction growth at 16 percent this year - a slower rate than last year - due in part to the shortage of developed land.Not everyone is affected equally. Lennar, the third-largest U.S. homebuilder, and Toll Brothers, the biggest luxury builder, bulked up their land banks with a string of low-cost land acquisitions during the 2008-2010 economic downturn.Toll Brothers has accumulated a bigger land bank than most - enough to last more than 12 years, compared with an average 7.4 years for the top five U.S. homebuilders, according to data published by Tri Pointe Homes Inc in November.Less acquisitive during the downturn, D.R. Horton, the largest U.S. homebuilder, and PulteGroup, its nearest peer, are more likely to feel the shortage, analysts said.PulteGroup has land supply to last about seven years, the data from Tri Pointe showed. D.R. Horton and PulteGroup did not respond to requests for comment for this article.SCOUTING FOR LAND To date, homebuilders have turned the land shortage to their advantage. It has even helped them to raise prices as Americans adjust to higher mortgage rates in a stabilizing economy.For D.R. Horton, the three-month period ended Dec. 31 was its most profitable first quarter since 2006. Its average sales price rose 10 percent to $275,600, with a ""very strong"" spring selling season yet to come. In the same quarter, PulteGroup's revenue growth was driven by a 13 percent increase in its average sales price, even as the company slowed the pace of new-home building.But time is running out for ambitious homebuilders short of land, who must typically spend between two and five years readying raw land for development. Land near city centers, known in the industry as 'A' lots, is especially hard to come by.""The run-up in land prices has been huge. What someone paid for land last year may not even work today,"" said Scott Laurie, chief executive of privately owned Californian builder Olson Homes, which plans to spend at least 25 percent more on land purchases in 2014 than last year.Acquiring smaller, private companies with a foothold in urban locations could be the quickest way for big homebuilders to grow their land banks - and the feeling could be mutual.Private companies have found it more difficult to secure financing since the crisis: U.S. land development financing totaled around $210 billion in the fourth quarter last year, only a third of the level in early 2008, data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp showed. (r.reuters.com/gun97v)Ryland Group Inc has said it wants to buy homebuilders that would add to its land bank, having already acquired Lionsgate Homes in Dallas, which gave it access to 885 developed lots and homes. (r.reuters.com/wyx28v)Tri Pointe and Toll Brothers also announced deals late last year that gave them access to developed lots in California.""The attractiveness of a private builder to a public builder is its land position,"" said Hollis Greenlaw, chief executive of United Development Funding, which manages funds holding more than $1 billion for investment in homes.""They don't need any more homebuilding talent. What they want is those land positions.""

Horton Inc to offer discounts to boost sales in its quarter ended June 30.Lennar said on Wednesday its average selling price rose 15 percent to $332,000 in the quarter ended Aug. 31. Gross margins on home sales improved to 25.2 percent from 24.9 percent a year earlier. The company has been able to raise prices despite a choppy recovery in the U.S. housing market as it mainly caters to buyers looking for a second home. Such buyers are generally more comfortable with volatile interest rates.Lennar also accumulated land with a string of low-cost purchases during the 2008-2010 economic downturn, giving it an edge over competitors like D.R.

16,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani  Many U.S. home buyers are returning to the market after almost a year as interest rates stabilize and regulators propose more relaxed rules on mortgage lending.U.S. homebuilders D.R. Horton Inc and Toll Brothers Inc reported jumps in orders this week at rates not seen since last year.""We're definitely seeing a lot more purchase business than we have in the past,"" said Matt Hackett, underwriting manager at Equity Now, a New York-based mortgage lender.Interest rates fell in October to their lowest since June 2013 after rising steadily for the past year. Although up slightly since, they are still at historic lows.New rules proposed will allow Americans to buy homes with down payments as low as 3 percent. ""The buyers realize that they're never going to get this kind of low interest rate environment,"" said David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.Wayne Wellington, a 47-year old inspector at the Broward County housing authority in Florida, said he wanted to upgrade his current house for a larger property before rates spiked.""Interest rates look like they're on the verge of moving up a little bit and I've got to capitalize now on these wonderful rates,"" he told Reuters. The improvement in buyer sentiment is bringing much needed relief to homebuilders, which reported an underwhelming spring selling season this year. Spring selling is to homebuilders what the holiday season is to retailers.""First-time home buyers are the ones missing from the marketplace (and) part of the reason we've had a relatively slow recovery in housing. Some relaxation in the overly restrictive lending standards will bring the first-time home buyer back,"" Crowe said. The Dow Jones U.S. home construction index rose about 4 percent this year to Monday's close, after doubling between January 2012 and January 2014.Five of the largest U.S. homebuilders - D.R.

23,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani  Dec 4 Homebuilders with a presence in the U.S. south and west are set to gain next year as more Americans swap the frozen north for warmer climes, drawn by some of the country's highest job growth rates.New home construction is projected to rise 24 percent on average next year in eight states along the west and south coasts, compared with the 8 percent forecast for this year, according to the National Association of Home Builders.These states - Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, North and South Carolina, Georgia and California - accounted for about half of the total job growth in the 12 months to September, according to RBC Capital Markets.""Part of (the migration) is job-related,"" said Morningstar Inc analyst James Krapfel, ""but the biggest thing is, people want to live where the weather is just more liveable."" The shift bodes well for D.R. Horton Inc, the largest U.S. homebuilder, and rivals Lennar Corp and PulteGroup Inc, each of which gets a large part of its revenue from these states.RBC analyst Robert Wetenhall expects orders at the three homebuilders to rise about 16 percent on average next year. Their order growth averaged 11.5 percent in the past three quarters. This growth, along with low interest rates and proposed rules to let Americans buy homes with down payments as low as 3 percent, augments the forecast for a more stable housing recovery next year.A widespread land shortage forced PulteGroup and D.R. Horton to slow the rate at which they built homes. The duo have been buying land this year, but their holdings are still less than Lennar's, especially in the west. Lennar, which builds about 40 percent of its homes in the West Coast, southeast Florida and Houston, has best weathered the slowdown in the housing market, thanks to its substantial land assets.At 13.5 percent, the company is expected to post the highest return on equity in 2015 compared with its main rivals, according to Wetenhall.The forecast for KB Home is the lowest at 5.3 percent. Although the company builds almost a third of its homes in California, inconsistent execution has held back its share price, Wetenhall said.The median price targets on the stocks of D.R. Horton, Lennar and PulteGroup have increased in the past month, while KB Home's target was unchanged, according to Thomson Reuters data.

33,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Ankit Ajmera  D.R. Horton Inc's (DHI.N) quarterly results gave a strong indication that first-time home buyers are finally returning to the market as home ownership in the United States becomes cheaper than renting.This will come at a cost to the largest U.S. homebuilder's profit margins in the short term, as its low-priced homes account for a much greater proportion of sales.Longer term, higher demand from Americans in the 25 to 33 age group will be significant for the housing market, indicating underlying strength and the promise of a more steady recovery seven years after the global financial crisis struck.D.R. Horton said sales to this demographic tripled in the quarter ended March 31, helped by more relaxed mortgage rules and rising confidence in the wider economy.""There are signs that the first-time buyer is starting to turn the corner,"" said Morningstar Inc analyst James Krapfel. First-time home buyers accounted for about 30 percent of U.S. home sales last month, according to the National Association of Realtors.Though this is below the 40 percent to 45 percent that the industry generally agrees is needed for a strong housing recovery, the share is growing as more young Americans qualify for mortgages and soaring rents motivate them to buy homes.

34,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Ankit Ajmera | April 22  April 22 D.R. Horton Inc's quarterly results gave a strong indication that first-time home buyers are finally returning to the market as home ownership in the United States becomes cheaper than renting.This will come at a cost to the largest U.S. homebuilder's profit margins in the short term, as its low-priced homes account for a much greater proportion of sales.Longer term, higher demand from Americans in the 25 to 33 age group will be significant for the housing market, indicating underlying strength and the promise of a more steady recovery seven years after the global financial crisis struck.D.R. Horton said sales to this demographic tripled in the quarter ended March 31, helped by more relaxed mortgage rules and rising confidence in the wider economy. ""There are signs that the first-time buyer is starting to turn the corner,"" said Morningstar Inc analyst James Krapfel.First-time home buyers accounted for about 30 percent of U.S. home sales last month, according to the National Association of Realtors. Though this is below the 40 percent to 45 percent that the industry generally agrees is needed for a strong housing recovery, the share is growing as more young Americans qualify for mortgages and soaring rents motivate them to buy homes.The federal government has made mortgages more attractive by lowering premiums on loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, as well as proposing rules to allow down payments of as low as 3 percent.

37,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Ankit Ajmera | June 19  June 19 A six-year lull in deal making among U.S. homebuilders may be drawing to an end as companies look to bulk up on ready-to-build land to feed a surge in demand from home buyers.Most homebuilders had shied away from stockpiling land in the past few years as a choppy economic recovery offered little clarity on when demand would stabilize.But that may be about to change.The Ryland Group Inc and Standard Pacific Corp  merger announced earlier this week - the first big deal since PulteGroup Inc's buyout of Centex in 2009 - is a sign of things to come.Also, U.S. permits for future home construction surged to a near eight-year high in May, suggesting the recovery in the housing market and the broader economy is gaining momentum. A Federal Reserve rate increase could push companies to close deals quickly as borrowing will become more expensive.Mid-cap builders that went public recently such as Tri Pointe Homes Inc, Taylor Morrison Home Corp and William Lyon Homes are expected to be more active dealmakers than their larger peers.""The smaller builders where you do have some private equity ownership, limited trading volumes and the desire to grow, that's where you are more likely to see mergers,"" said Holger Boerner, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. Fidelity owns shares in several homebuilders including D.R. Horton Inc and PulteGroup, the No.1 and No.3 U.S. homebuilders, respectively.Housing experts said favored buyouts will be ones that offer access to customers of varied age groups and to sizeable land assets, especially in hotbeds such as California, Texas, and North and South Carolina. The newly public players could look to buy builders in new regional markets, said Alex Barron, senior research analyst at Texas-based Housing Research Center LLC.Taylor Morrison might look to southeastern states. William Lyon, which currently builds only in the west coast, could head east or even to Texas, Barron said.Shares of Tri Pointe, Taylor Morrison and William Lyon have fallen 7.4 percent on average in the past year, compared with a 10 percent rise in those of the top three builders, D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar Corp.The bigger companies already have a sizable presence in pivotal markets are less likely to indulge in dealmaking, housing experts said.Taylor Morrison, PulteGroup and Lennar declined to comment, while William Lyon, Tri Pointe and D.R. Horton did not respond to emails seeking comment.

The Conference Board, an industry group, said on Tuesday its index of consumer attitudes fell to 90.9 this month from a downwardly revised 99.8 in June. It fell far short of a forecast reading of 100.0.The latest figure was the lowest since September 2014, while the decline was the steepest since August 2011. The report's jobs hard-to-get index rose to 26.7 from June's upwardly adjusted 26.1.Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said the slump in confidence likely reflected recent upheavals in the global economy.""This seems to be an aberration,"" he said. ""Consumers were probably freaked out by the problems in Greece and the Chinese stock market, and the volatility on Wall Street."" Wall Street stock prices and the dollar rose after briefly paring gains on the disappointing consumer confidence data. U.S. Treasuries prices fell on renewed appetite for stocks.HOME PRICE RISE STALLS Other data on Tuesday showed the acceleration in home prices lost steam in the spring, but there were encouraging signs for first-time buyers. The S&P/Case Shiller composite home price index of 20 metropolitan areas in May rose 4.9 percent year over year, matching the pace in April. Economists polled by Reuters had  projected a stronger 5.6 percent increase.Rising home values have bolstered homeowners' balance sheets, but higher house prices and lackluster wage gains have made it difficult for many people to buy a home. The U.S. home ownership rate dropped to 63.5 percent in the second quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, the lowest level since the series began in 1980, Commerce Department data showed.Increasing household formation and an improving labor market, however, are expected to pull more first-time buyers into the market. On Tuesday, No. 1 U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton , which mainly caters to first-time buyers, said its quarterly profit almost doubled from a year ago as orders jumped.Analysts said indicators showing improvement in the housing and job sectors would allow the FOMC to consider normalizing interest rate from the emergency low level it adopted in December 2008 during the global financial crisis.""As long as the general tone of the data shows improvement and inflation is moving toward its 2 percent target, they will feel comfortable to raise rates in September,"" Moody's Sweet said.(Additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak in New York and; Lucia Mutikani in Washington; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Andrea Ricci)",2015-07-28,DHI,"Tue Jul 28, 2015 | 3:31pm EDT","WRAPUP 2-U.S. consumer mood darkens, home price growth stalls",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N10816F20150728?type=companyNews

46,"  (Adds manufacturing data, analyst comments, updates markets)* Existing home sales fall 3.4 percent in October* Sales fall sharply in the West and South* Median home price up 5.8 percent from year agoBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Nov 23 U.S. home resales fell in October as a persistent shortage of properties limited choice for potential buyers and pushed up prices, suggesting some softening in the pace of the housing market recovery after strong gains early this year.Still, housing remains on solid footing, with sales for the full year on track to be the best in eight years. That should see housing take up some of the slack from a chronically weak manufacturing sector.""The housing market is in decent shape but could be a lot better if people decided they were ready to move and listed their homes,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales declined 3.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.36 million units. September's sales pace was unrevised at 5.55 million units and was the second highest since 2007. The drop in sales was expected after contracts to purchase previously owned homes fell for two straight months. But with a tightening labor market, marked by a 5.0 percent unemployment rate, housing fundamentals are fairly healthy.In addition, the government has taken steps to ease lending standards for young adults. However, an anticipated interest rate hike next month by the Federal Reserve could make housing a bit expensive, especially if there is no significant pick-up in wage growth.""There is every reason to expect that the demand for homes will grind higher in the coming months. While interest rates are set to rise, so are incomes, and that will keep housing affordability historically favorable,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.The weak sales come on the heels of reports last week showing a drop in housing starts in October and a dip in confidence among home builders. Economists had forecast sales falling to a rate of 5.40 million units last month.The dollar rose to an eight-month high against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt were up marginally. The housing index rose 0.32 percent as the shortage of houses for sale was seen boosting homebuilders such as D.R. Horton Inc and Lennar Corp. A separate report showed Markit's Purchasing Managers Index hit a 25-month low in early November, highlighting continued weakness in the factory sector. The decline, however, brought the PMI in line with the Institute for Supply Management survey, which has a longer history of tracking the manufacturing sector.PAIN IN THE WEST October home sales were up 3.9 percent from a year ago and held above their average for the year. Sales dropped 8.7 percent in the West from the prior month and fell 3.2 percent in the South. These two regions, which are experiencing strong population growth, have seen large price increases due to tight inventory. The supply squeeze is mostly hurting the lower end of the market, where sales have dropped sharply from a year ago.Last month, the number of unsold homes on the market fell 2.3 percent from September to 2.14 million units. Supply was down 4.5 percent from a year ago, a worrying sign as housing heads into a quiet season, the NAR said.At October's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, up from 4.7 months in September. A six-months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.With inventories tight, the median house price increased 5.8 percent from a year ago to $219,600. October's price increase marked the 44th straight month of year-on-year gains.Although higher prices could sideline potential buyers, especially those wanting to purchase a home for the first time, they are boosting equity for homeowners, which could encourage them to put their homes on the market.Realtors and economists say insufficient equity has contributed to the tight housing inventories. Last month, the share of first-time buyers crept up from September to almost a third. But the share was still the second lowest since 1981 on an annual basis.""First-time home buyers continue to be crowded out by competition from investor sales. Price pressures from low inventory present another headwind to first-time buyers,"" said Derek Lindsey, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-11-23,DHI,"Mon Nov 23, 2015 | 1:41pm EST","WRAPUP 2-Tight inventories, rising prices hurt U.S. home sales",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N13I14F20151123?type=companyNews

55,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Michael Flaherty  PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N) said on Thursday it has appointed three new directors to its board as part of a settlement deal with Elliott Management Corp, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer.Shares of the No. 3 U.S. homebuilder rose as much as 5.3 percent to close at $21.51.The appointment comes as the company searches for a new chief executive after Chairman and CEO Richard Dugas announced his resignation, effective May 2017, bowing to a demand from founder and largest shareholder Bill Pulte.Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, took a 4.7 percent stake in PulteGroup in June.""The final candidate selection (for board's independent directors) was the result of a fruitful collaboration and discussion with Elliott,"" Dugas said.PulteGroup appointed John Peshkin, Scott Powers and Joshua Gotbaum as independent directors, expanding the board's size to 13. Peshkin is a managing partner at private real estate investment group Vanguard Land LLC, while Scott Powers most recently was the executive vice-president of State Street Corp (STT.N). Joshua Gotbaum is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.Peshkin and Gotbaum will also join PulteGroup's previously established CEO search committee.Dugas said he hoped that the CEO search committee would be able to ""wrap up their work"" over the next couple of months.PulteGroup said the homebuilder and affiliates of Elliott have agreed that Elliott will support PulteGroup's slate of director nominees at its 2017 shareholder meeting. PulteGroup's home sales have underperformed those of D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N) and Lennar Corp (LEN.N) in 2015, dropping 0.4 percent to 17,127 homes.D.R. Horton's home sales rose 28 percent last year, and Lennar's increased 16 percent.PulteGroup also said it plans to slow land acquisition, and use cash flows from operations to help fund repurchase of $1.5 billion of shares over the next six quarters. Bill Pulte said in a letter addressed to shareholders that he was satisfied with the initial progress made at PulteGroup toward addressing a prolonged underperformance of its shares. He, however, added that the company still had a lot of ground to cover, especially on cost controls and boosting volumes.PulteGroup's share price has risen about 19 percent since April 4, when Pulte expressed his ""extreme disappointment"" in the leadership of Dugas and asked the board to speed up the succession plan.Elliott believes the buyback, board augmentation and PulteGroup's current land and community investments can almost double the stock to $35-40 per share, said a person familiar with the hedge fund's thinking.
