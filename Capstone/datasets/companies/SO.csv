0,"   By Scott DiSavino  Jan 16 Southern Co's Alabama Power unit plans to run three coal power plants with a total capacity over 1,600 megawatts on cleaner natural gas fuel in the coming years to comply with federal environmental rules.Alabama Power wants to add gas capability to the four 255-megawatt Units 1-4 at the Gaston coal plant in Alabama by 2016 so they can run primarily on gas going forward.Alabama Power said it wants to add gas capability to the units to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which requires power companies to reduce mercury and other air emissions.Since 2009, U.S. energy companies have shut or converted over 22,000 MW of coal-fired power plants. This is partly due to recently weak gas prices from record shale production making it uneconomic for generators to upgrade older and smaller coal units to meet increasingly strict federal and state environmental rules.Alabama Power's four Gaston units will still have the ability to burn coal in case of some sort of gas emergency, but the company noted it was very unlikely the units will ever burn coal again. At the other Gaston unit, the 842-MW Unit 5, Alabama Power said it is adding a baghouse in 2016 so that unit will continue to use coal.Alabama Power said it applied for the Gaston air permits with state regulators in mid 2013. In addition, Alabama Power said it expects to be running both 65-MW Units 1 and 2 at the Gadsden coal and gas plant in Alabama on natural gas in 2015. The Gadsden plant already has the capability to run on either coal or gas.Alabama Power also expects the 138-MW Unit 1, 137-MW Unit 2 and 249-MW Unit 3 at the Barry coal plant in Alabama to be running on natural gas in 2016. The company said the Barry units will lose the capability to use coal going forward.Alabama Power currently operates about 13,600 MW of generating capacity, including about 8,000 MW from coal-fired units, 2,100 MW from gas, 1,700 MW from nuclear and 1,700 MW from hydro, according to federal data.",2014-01-16,SO,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 12:32pm EST",Southern to repower three Alabama coal power plants with natgas,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-southern-alabama-idUSL2N0KP1WA20140116?type=companyNews
1,"  HOUSTON Southern Co (SO.N) Chairman Tom Fanning said on Wednesday that the company is working with the U.S. Energy Department to finalize an $8.3 billion loan guarantee for its two-reactor expansion at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia, the first new reactors to be built in three decades.Southern's Georgia Power unit is leading a utility consortium that is building two 1,100-megawatt Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at a projected cost exceeding $14 billion.""After extensive negotiations on loan guarantees, Georgia power has delivered its documents to DOE,"" Fanning said on a call with analysts.While a series of steps remain to close the federal loan, Fanning said the guarantee represents about $200 million in value to Georgia Power customers who are already paying early costs for the Vogtle units. The new reactors won't begin producing power until late 2017 and late 2018, a year later than initially planned.Federal loan guarantees had been viewed as critical to the once-predicted revival of U.S. nuclear construction due to the regulatory risk and high cost of nuclear construction. Now, only a few new reactors are expected to be built due to lower natural gas prices, anemic growth in electricity demand and the lack of restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide.The only new U.S. reactors under construction are being built by the Georgia Power consortium and SCANA Corp (SCG.N), which is building two reactors in South Carolina.The Vogtle loan guarantee, announced in 2010, was expected to be finalized in 2012, but negotiations bogged down over terms and costs and were complicated by DOE requirements added after the much-publicized bankruptcy in 2011 of solar panel maker Solyndra which had received loan guarantees. Fanning said progress on Vogtle ""is terrific.""He said construction is also going well at Mississippi Power's coal-gasification power plant in Kemper County, Mississippi. Southern added $40 million to bolster its contingency funds for the Kemper plant as its total price tag is now above $5.2 billion, according to a filing with regulators made Tuesday.Fanning said Kemper's gas turbines produced electricity in January using natural gas from its new pipeline as workers continue to install gasifier equipment which will eventually convert coal into synthesis gas to fuel the plant.""We will move towards testing of the gasifier in the second quarter,"" Fanning said.(Reporting by Eileen O'Grady in Houston; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-01-29,SO,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 3:19pm EST",Southern Co working to finalize $8 billion nuclear loan guarantee,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-utilities-nuclear-southern-idUSBREA0S1VK20140129?type=companyNews

4,"  HOUSTON Jan 28 Southern Co will take a $25 million charge in the 2013 fourth quarter as the cost for its coal-gasification power plant in Kemper County, Mississippi, climbs to more than $5 billion, the company said in a filing with regulators on Tuesday.Southern Co, based in Atlanta, is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.Southern has previously taken $704 million in charges related to $1 billion in cost overruns at the 582-megawatt Kemper County plant, one of only two integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plants in the nation. The power industry is closely watching progress at the Kemper plant. Because it will be able to capture carbon dioxide emissions, the Kemper plant has been cited as a model for future coal design by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which has proposed strict limits on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants.Southern said the latest cost increase ""reflects an increase in the contingency for risks associated with start-up activities."" Mississippi Power, Southern's smallest utility, owns the plant and can only recover up to $3.8 billion of the Kemper costs through customer rates and the sale of securitized bonds.

5,"   By Valerie Volcovici | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Feb 12 A group of investors with combined assets of over $200 billion filed shareholder resolutions on Wednesday with ten energy companies, including Exxon Mobil and Southern Co, demanding they disclose their strategies for competing in a lower-carbon future.Led by the New York State Comptroller's office, which alone handles $160 billion in assets, the investors focused on the companies' ""carbon asset risk,"" or the potential for their carbon-intensive assets to lose value as market forces and potential regulation threaten demand for fossil fuels and related infrastructure.The move is part of an ongoing effort by some major institutional investors, coordinated by the sustainability advocacy group Ceres and the Investor Network on Climate Risk, that is focused on holding companies accountable for these so-called ""stranded assets.""The activists have been asking companies whose fortunes are linked to fossil fuels to assess under both a business-as-usual and a low-carbon scenario the risk of stranded assets and the physical risk from the impacts of climate change. ""The energy companies we invest in need to go back to the drawing board to determine the long-term financial risks that climate change poses to their business plans,"" said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.His office also filed shareholder resolutions with Devon Energy Corp, an oil and gas producer based in Oklahoma, and the Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy Corp. The bank HSBC said in a 2013 report that the equity valuation of some oil producers could drop by 40 to 60 percent under a low-carbon scenario, in which countries take measures to reach a long-term United Nations target for lower pollution.In order for the world to achieve the UN-agreed goal of limiting global temperature increases to 2 degrees C, the International Energy Agency said last year that no more than a third of the world's proven fossil fuels can be consumed by 2050. ""These companies are producing the vast majority of climate-changing emissions and now is the time for them to reduce risk,"" said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, which works on corporate social responsibility issues with companies including Coca Cola, Chevron and HP.""If they are not preparing to survive in a carbon-constrained future, we expect shareholders will sit up and take notice,"" Fugere said.In December, a report by the non-profit Climate Disclosure Project showed that many large U.S. companies, from oil majors to retailers, are including the potential for carbon emissions fees in their strategic plans.",2014-02-12,SO,"Wed Feb 12, 2014 | 10:03am EST",Investor group demands fossil fuel companies disclose carbon asset risk,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-climate-disclosure-idUSL2N0LH0PB20140212?type=companyNews
6,"  By Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON Feb 19 The Obama administration will finalize about $6.5 billion in loan guarantees this week for the nation's first two new nuclear reactors in three decades, ending years of delay.U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz will travel to Waynesboro, Georgia, on Thursday to mark the completion of an agreement backing the construction of two new reactors at Southern Co's Vogtle nuclear power plant, the Department of Energy announced on Wednesday.The department issued a conditional agreement for the Vogtle plant totaling $8.3 billion in 2010, offering loan aid to Southern's Georgia Power unit as well as project co-owners Oglethorpe Power and Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG).While loan assistance to Georgia Power and Oglethorpe will be finalized, the planned $1.8 billion loan guarantee to MEAG remains outstanding. In a wide ranging speech at the National Press Club in Washington on Wednesday, Moniz said the Obama administration was committed to promoting innovations in energy technology that would help lower U.S. carbon dioxide emissions - but dodged questions on the Keystone XL pipeline and other contentious issues.Despite criticism of Energy Department's loan program after the bankruptcy in 2011 of solar panel maker Solyndra, Moniz said the federal government must not be limited to strictly funding research and development.""The need to accelerate the pace of change in response to climate change makes it essential that we continue investments ... that get the first movers out there in commercial market pushing the technology envelope,"" Moniz said. Originally expected to be finalized in 2012, the loan aid for the Vogtle expansion was held up by haggling over new conditions requested by the Obama administration in the wake of  Solyndra's failure.Solar panel maker Solyndra folded after receiving a $535 million federal loan guarantee, leading to accusations that the Energy Department had mismanaged taxpayer dollars and favored political allies in doling out funds. REVIVAL ON HOLD When it was offered four years ago, the loan deal for Vogtle was supposed to herald a new era for the U.S. nuclear power sector, which had stalled after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania in 1979.Since then, surging U.S. natural gas production, weak growth in electricity demand  and the lack of a cap on carbon emissions have dampened expectations for a nuclear renaissance.Only a few nuclear plants are expected to be built and Vogtle is the only nuclear power plant to be offered a federal loan guarantee so far.With ""substantial"" funding authority still available, Moniz did not rule out additional loan guarantees. He said the department plans to move ahead with the loan program to back deserving low-carbon projects across the energy spectrum.",2014-02-19,SO,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 4:05pm EST",UPDATE 1-U.S. to finalize loan guarantee for Southern Co nuclear plant,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-nuclear-southern-idUSL2N0LO1VY20140219?type=companyNews

14,"  Southern Co, one of the biggest U.S. power companies, said it hopes to announce plans by the end of the year to build more nuclear reactors, a spokesman said late Wednesday.That makes Southern the first company to pursue new reactors since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced plans earlier this year to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Nuclear reactors produce almost no carbon emissions.The company is already building two new 1,117-megawatt reactors at its Vogtle nuclear site in Georgia and Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning said any new reactors would be of the same Westinghouse AP1000 design.Westinghouse is majority owned by Toshiba Corp, a Japanese conglomerate.Fanning made his comments on Wednesday on the sidelines of a conference in Washington held by the Bipartisan Policy Center, according to a report from Platts.The company is evaluating six possible sites for additional reactors, including existing plants and greenfield locations, Fanning said at the conference. The Vogtle units under construction cost about $14 billion but delays related to licensing have added about $381 million, Southern said.In the past it has taken years to gain the federal and state approvals needed to build a new reactors. Southern applied with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build the Vogtle units now under construction in 2008 and finally gained NRC approval in 2012. Southern expects the first new Vogtle reactor to enter service in late 2017 or early 2018, with the second unit on about a year later.More than a dozen companies have considered construction of new reactors since the so-called nuclear renaissance in the early 2000s when the U.S. government was expected to adopt rules to limit carbon emissions and the cost of fossil fuels like natural gas were high.But until now the government has failed to adopt carbon regulations and gas prices have plunged as the increased use of hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling and other new technologies has opened up the nation's shale fields for economic development. Only Southern and Scana Corp, which is building two AP1000 reactors in South Carolina, are actually building new nuclear units.For a list of other proposed nuclear projects, see (Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-07-24,SO,"Thu Jul 24, 2014 | 9:57am EDT",Southern hopes to build more U.S. nuclear power reactors,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-utilities-southern-co-nuclear-idUSKBN0FT1SS20140724?type=companyNews

16,"  July 24 Southern Co, one of the biggest U.S. power companies, said it hopes to announce plans by the end of the year to build more nuclear reactors, a spokesman said late Wednesday.That makes Southern the first company to pursue new reactors since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced plans earlier this year to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Nuclear reactors produce almost no carbon emissions.The company is already building two new 1,117-megawatt reactors at its Vogtle nuclear site in Georgia and Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning said any new reactors would be of the same Westinghouse AP1000 design.Westinghouse is majority owned by Toshiba Corp, a Japanese conglomerate.Fanning made his comments on Wednesday on the sidelines of a conference in Washington held by the Bipartisan Policy Center, according to a report from Platts. The company is evaluating six possible sites for additional reactors, including existing plants and greenfield locations, Fanning said at the conference.The Vogtle units under construction cost about $14 billion but delays related to licensing have added about $381 million, Southern said. In the past it has taken years to gain the federal and state approvals needed to build a new reactors. Southern applied with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build the Vogtle units now under construction in 2008 and finally gained NRC approval in 2012.Southern expects the first new Vogtle reactor to enter service in late 2017 or early 2018, with the second unit on about a year later. More than a dozen companies have considered construction of new reactors since the so-called nuclear renaissance in the early 2000s when the U.S. government was expected to adopt rules to limit carbon emissions and the cost of fossil fuels like natural gas were high.But until now the government has failed to adopt carbon regulations and gas prices have plunged as the increased use of hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling and other new technologies has opened up the nation's shale fields for economic development.Only Southern and Scana Corp, which is building two AP1000 reactors in South Carolina, are actually building new nuclear units.For a list of other proposed nuclear projects, see     (Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-07-24,SO,"Thu Jul 24, 2014 | 9:47am EDT",Southern hopes to build more U.S. nuclear power reactors,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-southern-co-nuclear-idUSL2N0PZ0XY20140724?type=companyNews
17,"   By Gavin Maguire | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The U.S. Department of Agriculture will provide its first state-level assessments of U.S. soybean production potential on Aug. 12, and traders will watch for projections on production potential among the top Midwest growing states as crops there enter their most critical and rain-dependent development phase.However, much of the crop grown across the U.S. South is in a far more advanced state than that grown across top Midwest states such as Iowa and Illinois. Southern crops could be available weeks ahead of Midwestern supplies.The quantities are substantial. The top 10 growing states across the South produced a record 658 million bushels of soybeans in 2013 and are on course to top 700 million bushels this year thanks to a 12 percent climb in planted area from a year ago and kind growing conditions so far this season.So market trackers gauging the scope and vulnerability of the 2014 U.S. crop must not overlook the advanced state and scale of southern production. Growers there could well fulfill a large share of near-term demand weeks before the majority of the national crop is even ready for harvest.GETTING THE HANG OF IT Helping drive the climb in southern soybean production in recent years has been the steady climb in crop yields, as the region's growers have enjoyed bigger productivity gains than their more established counterparts in the Midwest. While planted acres across the top 10 soybean producing states have grown around 20 percent since 1990 to 17.9 million acres, production in the South has grown by close to 100 percent due to a 70 percent climb in crop yields.These output advances compare with a 16 percent climb in yields and a 50 percent rise in production in the top five states in the Midwest over the same period. Southern growers have been effective at implementing modern practices and techniques in soy production. ENTICING BUYERS As crop production in the South has improved, growers there have had to become adept at marketing their bountiful supplies. Southern states have far fewer traditional soybean demand centers such as crushing facilities than the Midwest.But thanks to the earlier start to the growing season, Southern growers can offer their crops to consumers much earlier than their Midwestern counterparts. Crop originators have been willing to do business with Southern growers in increasing tonnages in recent years, even though those supplies are often farther away from most domestic crushers.Exporters have also shown a keen interest in Southern supplies. Earlier availability and the shorter hauling distance to major ports in the U.S. Gulf helps these crops compete for overseas consumer demand against foreign sellers. Combined, these consumers have ensured steady demand for Southern soybeans, enticing producers to keep dialing up acreage and production across the region.The upcoming USDA report is expected to reveal that Southern growers are on course to deliver a record amount of fresh supplies again this year, which will likely be available to consumers and exporters weeks ahead of the crops grown across the more established areas.If the USDA also reveals that Midwest growers are set to harvest record crops this year, Southern growers could enjoy a big advantage in being able to deliver their crops to market well ahead of the competition.At the very least, the more advanced state of the Southern crop should give producers there greater confidence to secure sales deals, as Midwest growers remain uncertain of their crop’s potential.So market trackers looking for clarity on the outlook for the U.S. soybean market must pay close attention to the South, as a record amount of supplies are set to emerge from the region this year. This could plug demand until the rest of the U.S. crop becomes ready in the fall and potentially set the stage for a downward leg in crop prices.

18,"   By Gavin Maguire | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The 10 largest soybean growing states in the U.S. South collectively produced a record 775 million bushels of the crop this year, and are well on their way to bringing those supplies to market weeks ahead of growers in the Eastern Corn Belt where harvest is being delayed due to wet weather.Southern growers are able to get their crops planted and grown sooner than their Midwestern counterparts in most years, due to warmer year-round temperatures. But last year soggy field conditions delayed harvest in many Southern areas, depriving growers there of the chance to capitalize on the strong export demand in place during the first quarter of the 2013-14 marketing season.This year, Southern growers have been able to harvest their soybeans at a much faster pace than a year ago, and so are in a strong position to participate fully in the strongest export period of the year, and may potentially displace traditional Corn Belt supplies.RECORD PUSH Southern growers have been dialing up soybean plantings and production intentions for the past 6-8 years in response to the relatively stronger price performance of soybeans compared to more traditional Southern crops such as rice and cotton.However, Southern producers have had uneven success rates in terms of soy output, as volatile weather conditions, pests and less crop experience compared to the heart of the Midwest resulted in as many production contractions as expansions on a year-over-year basis over the past decade.That said, the strong soybean prices of 2012 and 2013 paved the way toward a more concerted push into soybeans lately, resulting in a record 17.75 million acres being planted in the crop for the 2014 season across the top 10 southern growing states. Relatively benign weather, coupled with the widespread adoption of improved management techniques, seeds and technologies, also helped propel Sothern output higher, with this year’s collective tally surpassing the 700 million bushel total for the first time and accounting for roughly 20 percent of the national soybean total. With soybean harvest well past the 60 percent mark in states such as Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, much of that fresh production is already refilling the national supply pipeline, and potentially on its way to domestic and overseas purchasers.For many growers across the South, this is a welcome contrast to the situation last year when wet fields prevented many from being able to access their crops and forced them to stand and watch as growers located farther north tapped into the record-strong export demand that prevailed late last year.And timeliness is not the only benefit that Southern soy growers are gaining this year. Closer proximity to Southern export ports is also making their crops more competitive relative to those available farther afield, as brokers and traders can cut down on the cost - and time - of getting those supplies to the export market. Indeed, the current availability of Southern soybean supplies has prompted exporters to step up competition for them, which has driven up the spot cash price of soybeans in places like Arkansas and Louisiana to a rare premium to Decatur, Illinois and other central Midwest locations.MISSING THE WINDOW  For soybean producers in the Midwest, the combination of a slow local harvest alongside above-normal progress in the South has resulted not only in weaker cash prices for their crops, but also a risk that they may miss the most active export season of the year. Soybean exporters traditionally secure roughly 60-70 percent of their full-year export deals within the October to December period, and so those producers who are not able to make their supplies available during that time window risk selling at a time when overall demand may be less competitive. What’s more, with South America having overtaken North America as the primary soybean producer, U.S. growers who miss the export window risk selling their supplies during a period when other origins are the chief price setters, which could be at a discount to U.S. levels.For this reason, Southern soybean growers are likely to be relieved that they have been able to get most of their supplies harvested already this season – even if prices are well below where they were at this point in 2013. For growers still dealing with wet fields in the Midwest, there is still time for conditions to improve enough to get the rest of harvest wrapped up and their supplies to market. But if Eastern Corn Belt fields stay soggy for much longer, many Midwest growers may miss out on this year’s export season, and lose market share to their Southern counterparts.
