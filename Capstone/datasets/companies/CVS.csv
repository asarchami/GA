0,"  Jan 14 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has affirmed and withdrawn the  following ratings for CVS Caremark Corp. (NYSE: CVS):--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+';--Senior unsecured bank facilities at 'BBB+';--Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+';--Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.The Rating Outlook is Stable.Fitch is discontinuing the ratings, which are uncompensated. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect the company's relatively steady credit metrics and  strong liquidity position. Fitch expects CVS to manage its credit profile and  capital allocation within the context of maintaining its publicly stated  adjusted debt/EBITDA (including NPV of lease obligations) ratio of 2.7 times  (x). The ratings also consider CVS's strong positioning in all prescription  distribution channels, with a #2 market position in the retail segment and  pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and a #1 position in the fast-growing  specialty pharmacy business, making it the largest provider of prescriptions in  the U.S. with a 21% share of 2012 prescription volume.The company is well positioned to drive continued market share gains and  capitalize on favorable industry trends for prescription growth such as the  aging population and expansion of coverage to the uninsured, the continued  growth in higher-margin generics and mid-teens growth in specialty pharmacy over  the next five years. Of concern are the ongoing cyclical pressures on the  industry resulting in soft front end sales, the industry-wide pressure on  pharmacy pricing and reimbursement rates in both the retail and PBM businesses,  and any potential hit to profitability from regulatory issues. Ongoing  healthcare reform initiatives could pressure reimbursement rates but be positive  for prescription volume over the intermediate term as the Affordable Care Act is  implemented.CVS and Cardinal Health recently announced an agreement to jointly source their  generics and also announced a three-year extension through June 2019 of Cardinal  Health's existing pharmaceutical distribution agreements with CVS Caremark. The  U.S.-based joint venture is expected to be operational as soon as July 1, 2014,  and will have an initial term of 10 years. In order to reflect an equitable  50/50 joint venture, the agreement includes a quarterly payment of $25 million  over the life of the agreement from Cardinal Health to CVS Caremark. The  payments have an estimated after-tax present value of $435 million. Fitch  expects large pharmacy chain, distributors and service providers to continue to  find ways to partner together to leverage their buying scale and distribution  networks. This was also evidenced by the announcement of a strategic  relationship in March 2013 between Walgreens and Alliance Boots with  AmeriSourceBergen to collaborate on global supply chain opportunities. Retail EBIT Margins Expected to be up Modestly in 2014-2015  The retail segment which accounts for approximately 70% of operating profit  continues to perform well in spite of near-term cyclical pressures and the  company continues to lead the drug retail sector in sales productivity and other  operating metrics. It has had a successful track record in integrating  large-scale retail acquisitions over the past 10 years, while maintaining a  healthy level of growth and improving profitability on an organic basis.  As large-scale retail acquisition opportunities are limited going forward, share  gains will depend on: generating above-average organic growth; store closings or  share losses by weaker independents and regional chains; and small market  fill-in acquisitions and prescription file buys. Fitch expects retail top-line  growth to be in the 3% - 4% range going forward with comparable store sales  growth in the 2% - 2.5% range and square footage contribution in the 1% - 1.25%  range. Operating profit growth is expected to be 9% in 2013 and in the  mid-single digits in 2014 - 2015, which assumes flat to a modest increase in  gross margin, due to the ongoing benefit of branded to generic conversions  offset by reimbursement pressure on the prescription side. As a result, retail  EBIT margins are expected to increase modestly over the next 2 - 3 years on an  expected base of 9.4% to 9.5% in 2013.PBM EBIT Margin Expand In 2013; Expected to be Flat in 2014/2015 CVS has seen positive momentum in its PBM segment since 2011 from a top line  perspective with strong business wins that were accretive in 2012, including the  ramp up of Aetna and the UAM acquisition which contributed $5.5 billion in  incremental revenue in 2012. The company has won approximately $25 billion in  net new business over the past three years. Revenues have grown in the mid-20%  range in 2011 - 2012 and are expected to grow in the 4% to 6% in 2013 to 2015.  CVS recently announced the acquisition of Coram LLC (Coram), the specialty  infusion services and enteral nutrition business unit of Apria Healthcare Group  Inc. for approximately $2.1 billion. Coram is expected to generate approximately  $1.4 billion in revenues during the first 12 months following the close of the  deal (expected end of 1Q'14) and will further strengthen CVS's leadership  position in the specialty pharmacy market where it controls about 20% of the  market with 2013 estimated revenue of $20 billion.Pharmacy services EBIT margin are expected to expand to 4% from 3.6% in 2013  after four years of decline, as the company integrates large scale contracts  such as Aetna Inc. and is realizing benefits from the streamlining initiatives  that it put in place in late 2009 to deliver over $1 billion in cost savings  from 2011 - 2015.Overall EBIT Growth of Mid-Single Digits; Strong FCFFitch expects total EBIT growth including retail to be in the mid-single digit  over the next 24 months, after growing 11%-12% in 2013. CVS continues to  generate strong free cash flow (FCF) providing the company with significant  financial flexibility. Fitch expects $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion in annual FCF  (after dividends which are expected to grow in the 20% to 25% range annually, as  the company targets a payout ratio of 25% to 30% by 2015, and before any sales  leaseback transactions) over the next few years. Fitch expects FCF will  primarily be used toward share buybacks ($4 billion to $5 billion annually), and  any bolt-on acquisitions within the context of maintaining adjusted debt/EBITDAR  at 2.7x. The company's liquidity is also supported by various credit facilities  that support its $3.5 billion commercial paper program.CVS had $10 billion in debt outstanding at Sept. 30, 2013. CVS recently issued  $4 billion of debt (staggered maturities of 3, 5, 10, and 30 years) to fund the  $2.1 billion acquisition of Coram and to pay down commercial paper borrowings  (which stood at $814 million on Sept. 30, 2013). The company has debt maturities  of $550 million each in 2014 and 2015 and $1.2 billion in 2016, which Fitch  expects will be refinanced.",2014-01-14,CVS,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 9:30am EST",RPT-Fitch affirms CVS Caremark at 'BBB+'; withdraws ratings,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-affirms-cvs-caremark-at-bbb-withdr-idUSFit68359520140114?type=companyNews
1,"   By Phil Wahba and Julie Steenhuysen  CVS Caremark Corp will stop selling tobacco products at its 7,600 stores by October 1, the company said on Wednesday, making it the first national drugstore chain in the United States to take cigarettes off the shelves.Public health experts hailed the precedent-setting decision by the No. 2 U.S. drugstore as a step that could pressure other retailers to follow suit. With pharmacies taking on a larger role in the U.S. healthcare system with walk-in clinics and services such as managing health plans, many experts say they should no longer offer unhealthy products like tobacco.President Barack Obama, a former smoker, praised CVS, saying in a statement the move will help wider efforts to ""reduce tobacco-related deaths, cancer, and heart disease, as well as bring down healthcare costs.""CVS expects the decision to hurt profits initially, along with a $2 billion hit to annual sales. But the company, whose Caremark unit is a pharmacy benefits manager for corporations and the U.S. government's Medicare program, believes the move will boost its appeal as a healthcare provider.CVS hopes to replace some sales through signing up customers to smoking cessation programs, which will be a selling point with potential corporate contracts.Analysts said CVS could eventually recoup lost sales through increased use of its healthcare services. But investors focused on the short-term pain. CVS shares fell 1 percent. Larger rival Walgreen Co, which will keep selling cigarettes, rose 3.9 percent, while No. 3 Rite Aid Corp which also will still offer cigarettes rose 2 percent.Shares of cigarette makers Lorillard Inc, Altria Group and Reynolds American all slipped.Pharmacists have long been a source of community health information, and drugstore chains have embraced that tradition by adding walk-in clinics. CVS is the largest U.S. pharmacy healthcare provider, with more than 800 MinuteClinic locations.""I think CVS recognized that it was just paradoxical to be both a seller of deadly products and a healthcare provider,"" U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden told Reuters. CVS Caremark Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan said in a piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association that increased health coverage under the U.S. Affordable Care Act ""comes with a price"" of promoting public health.Experts noted that healthcare organizations and advocacy groups such as Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights have been urging pharmacies for years to get out of the tobacco business.Cornell University communication professor Jeff Niederdeppe cited ""an evolving social climate that has become less and less supportive of the marketing, sale, and use of tobacco products in the U.S.""Some U.S. cities, including Boston and San Francisco, already ban the sale of tobacco products in pharmacies, and nonsmoking advocates hope other chains will follow CVS.

But the habit still kills 480,000 Americans each year, remaining the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.SHORT-TERM HIT CVS said the decision to drop tobacco sales will cost the company 6 cents to 9 cents in profit per share this year. Analysts expect 2014 revenue of $132.9 billion and earnings of $4.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Overall U.S. cigarette sales fell 31.3 percent from 2003 to 2013, according to Euromonitor International.

""We believe the move will be viewed as a positive long-term decision by CVS, despite the near-term profit drag, as it paves the way for increased credibility with both healthcare consumers and payers,"" ISI Group analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note to investors.CVS has been bolstering its position in the healthcare market in recent months and in December, it said it expected pharmacy benefit manager revenue to rise between 7.25 percent and 8.5 percent in 2014, more than double the rate of retail business growth.Tobacco companies shrugged off the announcement even as shares dipped on concerns about potential disruption to sales.""It's up to retailers to decide if they're going to sell tobacco products,"" said Brian May, spokesman for Altria Group, maker of Marlboro and other popular brands.RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said he expected little impact on tobacco companies.

6,"  * All 10 S&P sectors rally after Yellen's statement* House Republicans aim to pass debt-limit bill* Sprint and CVS climb after results, Dean Foods down* Dow up 1.2 pct, S&P 500 up 1.1 pct, Nasdaq up 1 pctBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Feb 11 Wall Street rose for a fourth straight session on Tuesday as Congress agreed to advance legislation extending U.S. borrowing authority and the Federal Reserve's new chief held off from making any changes to its schedule for trimming stimulus.The gains were broad, with all 10 S&P 500 sectors up for the day and about 75 percent of New York Stock Exchange-traded stocks ending higher. About 67 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares closed in positive territory, while the S&P 500 ended just 1.6 percent away from its record closing high.Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives caved in to demands by President Barack Obama and agreed to advance legislation increasing Washington's borrowing authority, removing a potential market headwind. Fed Chair Janet Yellen emphasized continuity in the U.S. central bank's policy strategy of cutting asset purchases by $10 billion a month, saying she strongly supports the approach of her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. In her first public comments as Fed chief, Yellen also said that while the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen recently, labor market conditions needed to improve further.""No one was really expecting a major debt ceiling showdown or changes in tapering, but anticipation is one thing, and the experience is another,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. ""Everyone is more relaxed now that those issues are officially off the table.""The Fed's policies have been credited with driving the market's steep gains in 2013, and those accommodative measures are expected to keep a floor under stock prices for as long as they continue. However, had the pace of ending the program been slowed, it may have raised concerns that the economy was still not strong enough to grow on its own. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 192.98 points, or 1.22 percent, to end at 15,994.77. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 19.91 points, or 1.11 percent, to finish at 1,819.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 42.87 points, or 1.03 percent, to close at 4,191.05.All three indexes scored a fourth straight gain, with the S&P 500 jumping about 4 percent over that period. The index also moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since Jan. 24, a positive sign of near-term momentum. The index has recovered much of its recent weakness, which took the index down as much as 6 percent from its record close on Jan. 15.Sprint Corp rose 2.7 percent to end at $7.90 after the company reported quarterly revenue ahead of analysts' expectations and said it added wireless subscribers in the fourth quarter.CVS Caremark Corp shares climbed 2.7 percent to finish at $68.77 after the company posted higher quarterly profit as it processed more prescriptions. Of the 357 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Tuesday morning, 67.8 percent have beaten profit expectations, above the long-term average of 63 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

16,"  By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK Feb 18 A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday strengthened the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to recover insider trading profit from people who do not personally benefit directly from their alleged illegal trades.By a 2-1 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said former Jefferies Group Inc portfolio manager Joseph Contorinis, convicted in 2010 of insider trading, must give up $7.26 million of alleged illegal profit that he made for the firm's Paragon Fund, plus $2.42 million in interest.""Whether the defendant's motive is direct economic profit, selfaggrandizement, psychic satisfaction from benefiting a loved one, or future profits by enhancing one's reputation as a successful fund manager, the insider trader who trades for another's account has engaged in a fraud, secured a benefit thereby, and directed the profits of the fraud where he has chosen them to go,"" Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote for the majority.The decision could affect how much people convicted of insider trading on behalf of hedge funds may have to pay in related SEC civil cases. Many of these cases are in New York, which is part of the 2nd Circuit.""This is a huge decision, and ratchets up substantially the deterrent effect of prosecutions,"" James Cox, a law professor at Duke University, said in a phone interview.Contorinis, 49, is serving a six-year prison term following his October 2010 conviction for securities fraud and conspiracy over trades in supermarket chain Albertsons Inc ahead of its 2006 buyout by Supervalu Inc, CVS Corp and investors led by Cerberus Capital Management LP. Prosecutors said Contorinis' trades were based on tips from Nicos Stephanou, a friend and former banker at UBS AG, which was advising the Cerberus group on the buyout.U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan, who oversaw the criminal and civil cases, previously ordered Contorinis to forfeit $427,875 in the criminal case. Tuesday's decision upheld the penalty in the SEC civil case.Roberto Finzi, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who represents Contorinis, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. SEC spokesman John Nester said the regulator is pleased with the decision. 'NO INJUSTICE' In his appeal of the civil penalty, Contorinis said he should not have to give up, or disgorge, profit he made for Paragon because he did not personally control that profit.Writing for the 2nd Circuit majority, however, Lynch said there was ""no injustice"" in holding Contorinis liable, given that successful trading could boost his reputation and pay. Circuit Judge Denny Chin dissented. He said disgorgement is supposed to be remedial rather than punitive, and that ""while Contorinis undeniably deserved to be punished, disgorgement was not the proper mechanism.""Cox, the Duke professor, said ""the level of profits that could be subject to disgorgement by employees could be so huge that it would be seen as a punishment.""Stephanou pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy and testified against Contorinis.

17,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 18 A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday strengthened the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to recover insider trading profit from people who do not personally benefit directly from their alleged illegal trades.By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said former Jefferies Group Inc portfolio manager Joseph Contorinis must give up $7.26 million of alleged illegal profit that he made for the firm's Paragon Fund, plus $2.42 million in interest, in an SEC civil forfeiture case.""Whether the defendant's motive is direct economic profit, selfaggrandizement, psychic satisfaction from benefiting a loved one, or future profits by enhancing one's reputation as a successful fund manager, the insider trader who trades for another's account has engaged in a fraud, secured a benefit thereby, and directed the profits of the fraud where he has chosen them to go,"" Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote.The decision could have an impact on how much people convicted of insider trading on behalf of hedge funds may have to pay in related SEC civil cases. Many of these cases are in New York, which is part of the 2nd Circuit.Contorinis, 49, is serving a six-year prison term following his October 2010 conviction for securities fraud and conspiracy over trades in supermarket chain Albertsons Inc ahead of its 2006 buyout by Supervalu Inc, CVS Corp and investors led by Cerberus Capital Management LP. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan, who oversaw the criminal and civil cases, previously ordered Contorinis to forfeit $427,875 in the criminal case. Tuesday's decision upheld the penalty in the SEC case.Roberto Finzi, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who represents Contorinis, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SEC spokesman John Nester said the regulator is pleased with the decision.Prosecutors said Contorinis' trades were based on tips from Nicos Stephanou, a friend and former banker at UBS AG, which was advising the Cerberus group on the buyout. In his appeal of the civil penalty, Contorinis said he should not have to give up, or ""disgorge,"" profit he made for Paragon because he did not personally control that profit.Writing for the 2nd Circuit, however, Lynch said there was ""no injustice"" in holding Contorinis civilly liable, given how successful trading could boost his reputation and pay. Circuit Judge Denny Chin dissented. He said disgorgement is supposed to be remedial rather than punitive, and that ""while Contorinis undeniably deserved to be punished, disgorgement was not the proper mechanism.""Stephanou pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy charges and testified against Contorinis. After spending 19 months in jail, Stephanou was sentenced by Sullivan to time served.According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Contorinis is housed at the Beckley prison complex in Beaver, West Virginia, and not eligible for release until December 2015.Jefferies is now part of Leucadia National Corp, and CVS is now known as CVS Caremark Corp.The case is SEC v.

18,"  March 6 Safeway Inc, the second-largest U.S. mainstream grocery store operator, said private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management would acquire the company in a deal valued at about $9.4 billion.The offer price of $40 per share represents a premium of 1.3 percent to Safeway's Thursday closing stock price of $39.47 on the New York Stock Exchange.The deal combines Safeway with Cerberus' Albertsons chain, creating a dominant grocery franchise on the West Coast. It also creates a grocery network of more than 2,400 stores and 250,000 employees.No store closures are expected, according to the company.Safeway shareholders will receive $32.50 per share in cash plus other distributions with a value of $3.65 per share. Cerberus is a seasoned investor in the supermarket sector. Last March, a Cerberus-led investor group acquired a group of grocery chains from Supervalu Inc, including Albertsons and Jewel-Osco, for $3.3 billion.Cerberus previously owned 650 Albertsons locations as a result of a 2006 deal under which the chain was acquired and its stores broken up between the private equity investor, Supervalu and CVS Caremark Corp. Safeway has been in the hands of private equity before. KKR & Co LP took Safeway private in 1986, and then sold its stake in 1999.Safeway has been trying to streamline its business by selling off non-core units. Last year, it spun off its gift card provider, Blackhawk Network Holdings Inc, into a separate publicly traded company.It also sold off its Canadian business to the operator of Canadian retailer Sobeys for $5.8 billion in cash. More recently, Safeway has revealed plans to leave the Chicago market by early this year. That announcement came after activist investor Jana Partners pressured the company to review strategic alternatives, including exiting weak markets.Reuters first reported that Cerberus was exploring a buyout of Safeway last October.Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Greenhill & Co Inc  advised Safeway on the transaction.

19,"   By Victoria Cavaliere  Residents of southern California were rattled by a 4.1 magnitude earthquake Saturday afternoon, the largest of more than 100 aftershocks following Friday's 5.1 rumbler that caused light scattered damage around the Los Angeles area.Saturday's quake rippled through an area near Rowland Heights, California, about 2:32 p.m., according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The temblor was considered relatively shallow with a depth of 5.6 miles, the USGS said.Aftershocks are expected following earthquakes, according to the USGS. Seismologists said there was about a 5 percent chance that Friday's quake, which struck at 9:09 p.m., was a foreshock to a bigger temblor.No injuries were immediately reported from either Saturday's quake or the more significant earthquake that struck Friday evening outside La Habra, California, which is about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. Friday's temblor displaced at least 50 people in Fullerton, about 5 miles from the epicenter, because of minor damage to homes and apartment dwellings, Fullerton Police Lieutenant Mike Chlebowski said.As well, a water main break in the city forced the closure of some streets due to flooding, he said.The quake also shook items off tables, rattled chandeliers and resulted in scattered damage to cars and property, including setting off a rockslide in the Orange County city of Brea that flipped a car on its roof. Friday's quake was felt as far away as Palm Springs in the east, San Diego in the south and Ventura County to the north. While not large, the event ""seems unusual, of course, because a lot of people felt it,"" said Doug Given, a USGS geophysicist.""These quakes occur in populated areas and people try to put two and two together and predict that something more is coming, but that's simply not the case,"" he said. The quake shut down Metrolink trains to allow for inspection of tracks and cars.

29,"  (Repeats Friday item)* Barclays pares back ambitions to be Wall Street powerhouse* Jenkins doesn't expect talent exodus after U.S. departures* Traders spruce up their CVs, talk to headhunters - source* Barclays to remain largest investment bank in EuropeBy Steve SlaterLONDON, May 9 Where Barclays sees a ""generational shift"", its investment bank rivals are smelling blood.The British bank, which under former chief Bob Diamond poached top staff and customers from competitors in trouble after the financial crisis, now risks suffering the same fate as it radically shrinks its investment banking business.Diamond's successor as Chief Executive, Antony Jenkins, says he does not expect a further exodus of top talent after departures from Barclays' U.S. operation, but some trading staff at least are preparing for the exit as the bank pares back its ambitions to be a Wall Street powerhouse.Barclays announced this week plans to shrink its debt trading business and axe a quarter of staff, focusing instead on U.S. and British clients and products where it ranks in the top five in business such as selling government bonds, stocks and currencies and advising on deals.Tom King, who made his career advising telecoms firms on takeover battles, is tasked with making the strategy work and hailed it as a ""step change"" that was needed in a new era of tougher regulations that have made some trades too expensive.""We're really shifting the investment bank from one that was a business run for revenue to one that is being run for return,"" King said on Thursday.The worry for Jenkins and King is that top staff and clients leave and the business slowly dies, echoing the problems of Credit Suisse First Boston when it bought Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette for $11 billion in 2000, only for many senior bankers there to depart.Jenkins, who previously ran Barclays' retail business and has no background in investment banking, admitted he feared a ""death spiral"" after an exodus of staff from its U.S. business last year. This prompted him controversially to raise bonuses for 2013 despite a fall in profits. King himself left Citigroup for Barclays in 2009 because the bailed out U.S. group was scaling back its investment bank while Barclays, under former debt trader Diamond, was vowing to take on Wall Street after its takeover of the U.S. division of Lehman Brothers.Even before Thursday's announcement, the atmosphere among Barclays' dealers was grim. People who feared the chop were already arriving to work late and leaving early, spending the time in-between sprucing up their CVs and talking to headhunters, said one person within the bank.""Whenever this sort of thing happens the best people will be getting a lot of inbound calls. This won't be any different,"" said a senior banker at a rival.FREEING UP THE TOP FLOORS Jenkins wants his bank to be more balanced and with lower costs to boost profitability.Cutting thousands of jobs could save the bank more than 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) a year based on average pay. Winding down large parts of its trading book will help to reduce the investment bank's use of capital to 30 percent by 2016 from 51 percent last year. The result will be a dismantling of much of the bond trading  powerhouse built up by Diamond in the decade prior to the 2008/09 financial crisis. Much of the former Lehman business, which includes the U.S. equities and advisory desks, will stay at the heart of the smaller firm.For Barclays, that means focusing on its strong ""home"" markets of the United States and Britain, which account for 60 percent of global market business. It will cut back hard in Asia, largely serving only big clients' needs there and Asian customers who want help on overseas deals.There have already been a series of high profile departures in the United States, including Hugh 'Skip' McGee, the head of its Americas business who was the most senior ex-Lehman banker. The bank also lost Ros Stephenson, Paul Parker and Larry Wieseneck.""I'm not concerned at all about the level of departures. What we're seeing is a something of a generational shift,"" Jenkins said on Thursday as he unveiled his plan.""We're seeing some of the senior leadership saying it's the right time for them to move on,"" he said. ""We're seeing low levels of attrition in the people that are going to be running the bank going forward, the next generation of MDs.""Senior sources at the bank concurred, and said many of the senior people had left after missing out on the top job taken by King, a U.S. native who moved to London for a couple of years in 1999 and stayed for over a decade. He is now based in New York. Industry sources said this is part of a wider trend in the industry. ""I feel that banks are in a mode to reduce the senior level,"" a source at another bank said. ""The only way to protect and promote the mid-level talent is by freeing up the top.""Barclays has said it plans to cut 7,000 investment bank jobs in the next three years, with about 2,000 of those this year.It plans to put 340 billion pounds of investment bank assets into a new ""non-core"" unit where they will be run down, so whole teams will be cut. Staff in those areas that the bank wants to keep may have bonuses based on hitting asset reduction targets - something which UBS did as it shrank its business after a bailout by the Swiss state.At Barclays, Eric Bommensath - the former fixed income boss who became co-head of the investment bank with King a year ago - is in charge of the non-core business and no longer sits on the executive committee.CUTTING COSTS Barclays faces risks in carrying out its plan. It will  ""meaningfully reduce"" the number of clients, with most focus on the top 1,000 who deliver 75 percent of the investment bank's revenues.The investment bank will also still be left with 490 billion pounds of assets. While smaller than U.S. players such as JP Morgan, it will remain the largest investment bank in Europe with more assets than the ""core"" businesses of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse after they also pruned operations.Barclays is exiting most commodities business and is likely to retreat from areas including emerging markets and interest rate trading products, structured products, securitisation and cross currency swaps.Areas where the bank is strong - such as rates in the G10 leading economies, foreign exchange and credit trading and debt capital markets - will be less affected. It is also sticking with its equities and advisory operations, which have expanded in the last three years, require less capital and appear set for yet stronger growth.Bankers said that while Barclays lags some rivals with its plans, it won't be the last to take radical action.""In the next year or two, more people will shrink or pull out. We've not seen anything meaningful other than UBS and RBS. Deutsche is going through some change and now Barclays, but there's still a lot more to come,"" a senior rival banker said.""It's a painful process. The key questions are where do you pick your spots, and you need to be disciplined.""

43,"   By Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Some large U.S. retailers are refusing to use Apple Inc's APPL.O new electronic payments service as they commit to developing a rival payments system that would bolster their profits by eliminating credit card transaction fees.Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is among the roughly 50 big retailers that have chosen not to accept Apple Pay, along with Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) and CVS HealthCorp (CVS.N).They say they are working instead on developing their own payment system, called Current C, through the Merchants Customer Exchange (MCX) consortium.The driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N), analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction.""""The economics and benefits of having your own payment system is definitely one of the main reasons,"" said Hitesh Sheth, chief executive of retail technology cybersecurity firm Vectra Networks.Apple did not immediately respond to queries seeking comment. Mastercard criticized the move by CVS and Rite Aid, saying it would limit the options of consumers. ""We are disappointed that both Rite Aid and CVS have decided to block their customers from using the payment method of their choice,"" Mastercard spokesman Jim Issokson said. Apple Pay, unveiled just last month, is a mobile payment app that allows consumers to buy things by simply holding their iPhone6 and 6 Plus devices up to readers installed by store merchants.The retailers shunning Apple Pay have also refused to use mobile payment systems like Google Wallet and Softcard. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said on Monday the company is continually evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies.CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit to two CVS stores showed the NFC (Near Field Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used has been deactivated.Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said Wal-Mart is not participating in Apple Pay at this point. It is focused instead on MCX, as one of the heavyweights in the consortium. Target said that it supports MCX but is also allowing users to make online purchases through its mobile app using Apple Pay.Antitrust experts said CVS and Rite Aid have the right to drop a vendor if they believe they can save money by going around the credit card companies and Apple, both of which will take a piece of the action.But they could run into antitrust trouble if they coordinated on dropping Apple Pay and Google Wallet or if someone else, perhaps a person working with CurrentC, organized their decision to drop Apple and Google’s payment services.""If I was a regulator, I would want to take a look at that,” said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

""The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,"" William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement.The company added that the sky-high prices of the new cholesterol drugs could pave the way for other very costly specialty drugs.CVS' call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians of the high costs of recently approved oral treatments for hepatitis C, especially two brands from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500. Those drugs wipe out the liver virus in more than 90 percent of patients and don't need to be used beyond 12 weeks for most patients. By contrast, CVS warned that the new cholesterol drugs might be needed ""for the duration of patients' lives"" and eventually be deemed appropriate for as many as 15 million Americans.Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting U.S. approval of their rival PCSK9 inhibitors. They are expected to be approved for patients who are genetically prone to high levels of cholesterol - a population that CVS pegs at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used for those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc's  Lipitor. The experimental treatments, in combination with statins,  knocked down their levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by as much as 60 percent more than statins alone.Gilead's Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another of its  anti-viral medicines into a daily pill, won U.S. approval late last year and has a retail price of $94,500. By itself, Sovaldi's list price is $84,000 per treatment.Gilead has acknowledged negotiating price discounts with payers of more than 40 percent for the two hepatitis C brands, as it vies for market share with a newer rival therapy from AbbVie called Viekira Pak.Shares of Amgen were up 0.8 percent on Tuesday on the Nasdaq, while Regeneron's stock gained 2.2 percent. Sanofi's shares slipped 0.3 percent in trading in Paris.

62,"  Feb 17 CVS Health Corp, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy chain operator, has warned that a new class of drugs being developed to lower ""bad"" cholesterol could cost the U.S. healthcare system as much as $150 billion per year.The new class of cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors could be priced in the range of $7,000-$12,000 per year, CVS said. The company's statement follows resistance to ""high-priced"" treatments for hepatitis C, notably Gilead Sciences Inc's  Sovaldi and combination treatment Harvoni.  CVS Health has focused on developing its specialty pharmacy business, which sells drugs to treat complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C and cancer.

63,"   By Caroline Humer | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The entry of copycat biotech drugs into the U.S. market could cut prices of expensive medications by 40 percent to 50 percent, depending on the level of competition among drugmakers, a top executive at CVS Health Corp told Reuters.CVS is one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers and, along with rival Express Scripts, has put unprecedented pressure on global pharmaceutical makers to lower prices for its clients.The comments by CVS Health Chief Medical Officer Troyen Brennan suggest U.S. drug benefit managers will be pressing for much steeper discounts on new biosimilar drugs than the 20 percent to 30 percent widely expected by Wall Street.Depending on how similar treatments are, and on demand from doctors and patients, biosimilar pricing could more closely track the face-off among branded drugs, Brennan said in an interview on Wednesday.Generic versions of traditional pharmaceuticals can usher in discounts of as much as 98 percent. Biosimilars retain a much higher margin due to their more complicated manufacturing process, which can create a new version of a biotechnology drug but not an exact copy.“As a result of that, with these new ones coming on we are probably going to be seeing something that looks like more of a situation where there are multiple brands,"" Brennan said. ""In the past that didn’t give you 98 percent discounts. In the past, that would give you 40 to 50 percent discounts.""  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved on Friday the first biosimilar drug for use in the country, a copy of Amgen Inc's Neupogen cancer treatment that was made by Novartis. Pricing on the biosimilar has yet to be determined.Drugmakers that are racing to develop biosimilars include Pfizer Inc and Hospira Inc. In Europe, Hospira already sells copycat versions of Neupogen and Merck & Co's and Johnson & Johnson Inc's arthritis drug Remicade. Other biosimilar players include Amgen, Biogen Idec, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries and Mylan Inc.Biologic drugs have already been approved in Europe, but pricing varies as each country has a role in negotiating drug costs. Earlier this year, Express Scripts and CVS pitted two novel treatments for hepatitis C against each other to wrest large price cuts from their manufacturers, Gilead Sciences Inc and AbbVie Inc. Brennan said they are likely to use similar tactics as more biosimilars enter the marketplace. That could mean excluding one of the drugs from their reimbursement list for most patients, requiring patients to try the less expensive treatment first or insisting they give prior approval before a patient begins the medication based on their specific medical history, he explained.Brennan sees competitive pressure ahead for drugs that treat auto-immune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and colitis. AbbVie’s Humira for arthritis and Remicade are billion-dollar biotech franchises that are close to facing biosimilar versions made by others. Express Scripts estimates that about $250 billion could be saved in the next decade if biosimilars for 11 different biological drugs are approved in the United States as expected. ""Whenever you are engaging in greater competition, we should be able to take advantage of that to get a lower price,"" Brennan said.

84,"   By Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Target Corp's (TGT.N) sale of its in-store pharmacies to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) may encourage large supermarket chains with struggling pharmacies to look for professional drug store partners of their own.More than 1,660 Target pharmacies will become CVS units in the $1.9 billion deal, the first time a drugstore chain has expanded its pharmacy business within a third party retail store, pharmacy consultants and analysts said.Drug stores in recent years have focused on opening new stores, an effort which has slowed recently.Target pharmacies helped drive overall sales at the chain but lost money, as the government health care program known as Obamacare expanded ranks of insured and increased pressure on costs.""Grocery store chains must be taking the news today and thinking hard about it. Pharmacy is not really a core competence,"" said Todd Huseby, partner, AT Kearney said, citing Safeway and Albertsons as two companies that might consider it. Neither responded to a request for comment. Some supermarkets may have the scale and buying power to make their own pharmacies work, said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consulting firm McMillan Doolittle. They may see the store-in-store format as an opening for a competitor, he said.However, margins are eroding, said Adam Fein, president of advisory and research firm Pembroke Consulting.  ""The future of pharmacy is really about being a low cost buyer of generic drugs and capability to dispense specialty drugs and that is an area of challenge for several supermarket operators,"" he said.Supermarkets with pharmacies such as Kroger (KR.N), Safeway and Stop & Shop saw a 0.6 percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled, but a 0.17 percent decline in prescription market share in 2014 from a year earlier, data from Fein's blog Drug Channels showed.Last year, prescriptions filled at chain drugstores like CVS, Walgreens WBA.N, Rite Aid (RAD.N) rose 5.1 percent, with 1.41 percent growth in prescription market share, while mass merchant chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) increased market share by 0.32 percent. Wal-Mart's health and wellness business has been performing very well, and it sees no need to have pharmacies handled by another company, spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said.Drug store chains could look to stores-in-stores as a way to get ""immediate access to new markets at a much lower cost,"" than building their own stores, said Tom Charland, chief executive at consulting firm Merchant Medicine.

85,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Nathan Layne  Drugstore operator CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) will buy Target Corp's (TGT.N) pharmacies and clinics in a $1.9 billion deal that should help it bargain with drug makers for lower prices, while freeing Target from a costly business where it struggled to make a profit. CVS, the second-largest U.S. drugstore operator with 7,800 stores, said on Monday it will acquire Target's more than 1,660 pharmacies in 47 states with about $4 billion in annual sales. It will also acquire Target's nearly 80 clinics.The pharmacies will continue to be located within Target stores but carry the CVS brand. The move was the CVS' second large acquisition in as many months, coming on the heels of its $10.1 billion deal for healthcare services firm Omnicare Inc OCR.N in May.  The transaction will significantly expand the drugstore chain's retail presence and should bolster its bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies. ""The healthcare industry is evolving rapidly,"" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call. ""In this environment, success is all about effectively managing costs, quality and access.""  For Target, the deal divests a business that was ""modestly negative"" in terms of profits. While Target will lose revenue, its sales, general and administrative costs will drop by $1 billion. Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said the move fits with the company's focus on a handful of categories where it believes it can be most competitive including apparel, items for children and health and wellness-related goods. Target will continue to handle the sale of over-the-counter drugs.Cornell, who has been remaking the retailer's strategy since taking the helm in August, said the deal will allow it to focus resources on reviving its food business, for instance. He also said it should bring more customers into Target stores. The companies hope CVS' price advantages, including in generic drugs, will attract more customers to the pharmacies who then buy other items from Target. ""They bring scale, cost efficiency; they bring expertise that we just could not bring to a space that we were operating as a subscale player,"" Cornell said of CVS. CVS shares were up 0.7 percent at $102.88, while Target shares rose 1.3 percent to $80.51 in morning trading.The two companies said the 80 Target clinics will be rebranded as MinuteClinics, as will the 20 additional clinics they plan to open within three years of the deal closing, expected near the end of 2015..Target and CVS also said they plan to co-develop five to 10 small-format stores, potentially accelerating Target's strategy of finding growth through smaller outlets in urban areas.The deal will also affect both companies' plans for share buybacks. Target said it would likely use some of the expected $1.2 billion in after-tax proceeds for shares repurchases. It doubled its share buyback program to $10 billion last week.In contrast, CVS cut its 2015 share repurchase program by $1 billion to $5 billion as a result of the transaction, which it will finance with debt. The move adds to the strain on its finances, already under pressure from the Omnicare deal.CVS' reduced buyback target led it to lower its 2015 and 2016 adjusted earnings forecast. Barclays is CVS' financial adviser, while Target's is Goldman Sachs.CVS' legal adviser is Fried Frank and regulatory adviser is Dechert LLP.

The move adds to the strain on its finances, already under pressure from the Omnicare deal.CVS' reduced buyback target led it to lower its 2015 and 2016 adjusted earnings forecast.Barclays is CVS' financial adviser, while Target's is Goldman Sachs.CVS' legal adviser is Fried Frank and regulatory adviser is Dechert LLP. Target's legal advisers are Faegre Baker Daniels LLP, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and Dorsey & Whitney.

87,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings does not expect any rating implications  from Target Corporation's (Target) announcement that it has signed a definitive  agreement to sell its pharmacy and clinic businesses to CVS Health (CVS) for  pretax proceeds of $1.9 billion. Target's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  is 'A-' and short-term IDR is 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. Target expects to deploy the after-tax net proceeds of approximately $1.2  billion to support its long-term capital priorities, including share  repurchases.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,  including regulatory clearance, with timing of closing currently uncertain.  Fitch does not expect Target's financial leverage to increase. The transaction  should benefit operating margins, enhance the customer experience around  healthcare, strengthen Target's focus on wellness as a signature category, and  potentially help drive traffic and sales at its stores.  Target could also  benefit over time by co-developing its smaller Target Express stores in  conjunction with CVS, potentially creating a stronger convenience format.   Target's ratings reflect its strong competitive position in the discount retail  sector, improving performance in its U.S. business, and exit from Canada,  closing its remaining stores during April 2015. Cash costs associated with  exiting Canada are expected to total $500 million-$600 million. However, the  disposition results in the elimination of significant operating losses and  capital lease obligations.   Target's U.S. comparable store sales (comps) were up 2.3% in the first quarter  of 2015 (1Q15) following a modest 1.3% increase in 2014 and a 0.4% decline in  2013. The improvement underscores progress Target is making as the company  focuses on merchandise offerings in the apparel, home, baby, kids and wellness  categories.  Transactions rose 0.9% during1Q15, after declining 0.2% in 2014,  and 2.7% in 2013. Fitch expects comp sales growth can improve to the 2% range in  2015 from 1.3% in 2014. This includes the effect of digital sales, which Fitch  estimates at 2%-3% of total sales and expects to grow at 30% or more annually.  For the continuing U.S. segment, the EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points  (bps) to 10.5% for the 1Q15 versus 9.4% in the comparable period last year. The  expansion was due to primarily to lower promotional activity and cost savings  initiatives. Target's margin had declined by 30 bps in 2014 due to heavier  promotional and clearance activity.  Fitch believes there is upside to Target's consolidated margin to above 10% from  9.3% at the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2015 and 9.7% for the latest 12 months  (LTM) period ended May 2, 2015. Expansion will be driven by comp sales growth  and $2 billion of targeted cost reductions over the next two years, offset in  part by investments to drive growth. Margins should also benefit from the sale  of its pharmacy and clinics business to CVS as Target expects the transaction to  be immediately accretive to earnings following deal close.  Adjusted leverage was 2.0x at May 2, 2015, compared with 2.4x at Feb. 1, 2014.  Fitch expects leverage is expected to track at or modestly above 2.0x over the  next few years as EBITDA grows and debt is used to partially finance share  repurchases. Fitch currently expects free cash flow (FCF) excluding  restructuring costs to range from $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually, and along  with incremental borrowings, be directed to share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors, individually or collectively, could lead to a positive  rating action: improved operating momentum in the domestic business, including  consistent comp sales growth of 2%-3%; an improvement in EBITDA margin toward  its historical level of 10% or greater; and adjusted financial leverage of  around 2.0x. The following factors, individually or collectively, could lead to a negative  rating action: operating shortfalls and more aggressive share repurchase  activity that drive adjusted leverage above the mid-2x range for an extended  period. Fitch currently rates Target as follows: --Long-term IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'; --Bank credit facility 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

90,"  (Adds details on CVS deal, updates prices)     * Greek deal reduces safe-haven bond buying     * Focus on Fed after hawkish Yellen speech     * Large CVS bond deal weighs on market      By Karen Brettell     NEW YORK, July 13 U.S. Treasury yields rose on Monday after Greek and euro zone leaders reached a deal that is likely to keep Greece in the single currency and as a large corporate bond deal weighed on the market.     Euro zone leaders made Greece surrender much of its sovereignty to outside supervision in return for talks on an 86-billion-euro bailout to keep the near-bankrupt country within the single currency union.      The news reduced safe-haven buying of U.S. debt and boosted riskier assets including equities.     Drugstore chain CVS Health also came to market with a bond sale of up to $15 billion to finance its acquisitions of Omnicare and Target Pharmacies, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters service.     The CVS deal ""definitely put some pressure on the market,"" said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasuries trading at Credit Agricole in New York.     Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 10/32 in price to yield 2.43 percent, up from 2.38 percent before the Greek deal was announced earlier on Monday. The yields have risen from a low of 2.18 percent on Thursday as hopes for a resolution increased.     Yields also increased as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve is closer to raising interest rates for the first time in nearly ten years, after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Friday she expects a rate hike at some point this year.      ""Everyone is waiting for Yellen's remarks after her comments on Friday, which were fairly hawkish,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.     Yellen is due to give her Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.     Investors now expect that the Fed is likely to begin raising rates at its September meeting.     ""I think they are very close to hiking rates and the market is now finally starting to understand that,"" said Goldberg.     U.S. economic data will be closely evaluated for signs that growth is improving at a pace that will allow the Fed to begin raising rates.     The next major economic report will be retail sales data for June, due out on Tuesday.

102,"   By Deena Beasley  CVS Health Corp, the No 2 manager of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers, will wait until a second new cholesterol-lowering drug is approved by regulators before negotiating for price discounts or adding either of the much pricer new drugs to its list of covered medications.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA's  Praluent, which works by blocking a protein called PCSK9 that helps ""bad"" LDL cholesterol stay in the bloodstream. An FDA decision on a second PCSK9 inhibitor, Amgen Inc's Repatha, is expected later this month.CVS and other pharmacy benefit managers are concerned about the cost of the PCSK9s compared to older cholesterol fighters such as statins, which are available as generics for less than $50 a month. Praluent, given by injection, has a list price of almost $15,000 a year.""It's smart to wait and see what the competitor medication looks like in terms of what the FDA label is,"" Dr Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer at CVS, told Reuters, referring to the type of patients who should be given the drug. Brennan added that ""all bets are off"" in negotiations between CVS and the PCSK9 drugmakers in terms of which, if either, of the drugs would be added to its formulary, or list of covered medications.Currently, doctors seeking to prescribe Praluent have to go through a ""formulary exception process,"" to secure CVS coverage.Brennan said an exclusive agreement for one of the new drugs would be ""a tried and true method"" for obtaining the best pricing, but CVS could have deals to place both drugs on its formulary. He said CVS will institute a ""utilization management program,"" taking into account issues such as patient history of heart disease or diabetes, as well as overall risk for cardiovascular disease. ""We expect patients to first use statins,"" Brennan said. ""If they can't use statins, or can't make (LDL) targets, then they would use PCSK9 inhibitors.""CVS estimates that about 73 million Americans have elevated cholesterol. Brennan forecast that less than 1 percent of current statin users will be switched to PCSK9s in the first year they are on the market. ""That could change as new data comes in on outcome measures,"" he said. Brennan said Praluent will first be used by the small number of people who are genetically predisposed to high cholesterol. ""For those patients, the use of this drug is less expensive than the drugs they were on,"" he said.

In the eight months since the decision, nicotine patch purchases rose 4 percent from a year earlier in the 26 states where it had a market share of 15 percent or greater. The company also said the average number of visits to its retail clinics for smoking cessation counseling nearly doubled.The 1 percent reduction in sales of cigarette packs occurred in 13 of the states where CVS's market share was at least 15 percent.

111,"   By Michael Flaherty and Caroline Humer  Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc. sustained hits on several fronts on Thursday after CVS Health Corp and Express Scripts dropped Philidor from their networks in a sign the fallout from the drugmaker's connection with the specialty pharmacy is spreading.The moves by the nation's two largest pharmacy benefit managers whacked Valeant shares before the market close, and pushed them 10 percent lower to $99 after hours.After coming under pressure this summer, Valeant's stock plunged last week after short-seller Citron Research said that the company was using its drug distributor, Philidor Rx, to inflate revenue numbers.About a dozen Valeant officials held a conference call on Monday to address the accusations, which helped ease pressure on the company's stock. Valeant said it properly accounts for sales through its pharmacy partners and only books revenue once one of its medicines reaches a patient.Valeant's stock recovered throughout the week than sank on the CVS and Express Scripts news. CVS, late on Thursday, said its Caremark program was dropping Philidor. CVS took the step following an audit of Philidor, citing ""noncompliance"" with its provider agreement, the company said.Shortly after the market close, Express Scripts said it too was ending its ties to Philidor.  CVS did not explain the ""noncompliance"" further when contacted by Reuters. Bloomberg on Thursday said Philidor has altered doctors’ orders to wring more payment out of insurers, according to former employees and an internal document, which details how to proceed with a prescription for certain Valeant drugs after they have been rejected.""Valeant’s drugs are provided to patients through many channels, including traditional retail pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, and directly from health care providers,"" said Valeant Spokeswoman Laurie Little in an emailed statement. Philidor declined to comment on Thursday.  CVS and Express Scripts Holdings manage most of the prescriptions filled under health plans run by the nation's largest insurers. Express Scripts manages prescription benefits for 85 million people.  The move by CVS and Express Scripts will have a direct impact on Valeant, though Philidor accounts for a small portion of the Canadian company's revenues.In Valeant's detailed presentation on Monday that spelled out its dealings with Philidor, the company said that the pharmacy accounted for about 5.9 percent of its total sales so far this year.The stock was trading as high as $260 per share in August. The next month, U.S. Democratic politicians singled out Valeant for hiking drug prices on consumers, and a federal subpoena followed. With the stock under pressure, the Citron report last Wednesday sent it into a tailspin.TOP SHAREHOLDER SPEAKS  The CVS announcement came after mutual fund manager Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc., sent a letter to its own investors about the Valeant saga. The Sequoia Fund, which the mutual fund manages, owns 9.93 percent of Valeant and is the company's largest shareholder.While the letter is largely a defense of Valeant's practices, it says that the company needs to move faster with paying down its debt. It also points out that Valeant's aggressive business practices have ""pushed boundaries,"" and that the company needs to better manage its image.""We would stress the importance of taking a more systemic approach to managing business practices with an eye on the company's long-term corporate reputation,"" said the letter dated Oct. 28 and signed by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb President Robert Goldfarb and Executive Vice President David Poppe.Separately, two of the five independent directors of the Sequoia Fund resigned over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing the board’s chairman. A person who answered the phone at Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb said the chairman, Roger Lowenstein, could not be reached. ACTIVISTS HIT Valeant's abrupt slide from a hedge fund darling to a drug company under fire has weighed heavily on two of the best known U.S. activist funds: ValueAct Partners and Pershing Square.ValueAct has been an investor in Valeant since 2006, and played a significant role in instituting the company's strategy and its current CEO, Michael Pearson. Pearson took over in 2008 and built Valeant into a more than $40 billion company with over 100 transactions. ValueAct, with $19 billion under management, now has two directors on the company's board, and was the fourth largest shareholder as of June 30.William Ackman's Pershing Square, Valeant's third-largest shareholder, has scheduled a call on Friday at 9 am EDT to address the drug company's issues. Pershing owned 5.7 percent of Valeant as of June 30, and faced a paper loss of more than $800 million at one point last week.

It also points out that Valeant's aggressive business practices have ""pushed boundaries,"" and that the company needs to better manage its reputation.""We would stress the importance of taking a more systemic approach to managing business practices with an eye on the company's long-term corporate reputation,"" said the letter dated Oct. 28 and signed by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb President Robert Goldfarb and Executive Vice President David Poppe.Separately, two of the five independent directors of the Sequioa Fund resigned over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing the board's chairman.

132,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) said on Tuesday its pharmacy benefit customers spent about 5 percent more on prescription drugs in 2015 than in 2014, a year when drug spending jumped nearly 12 percent.The No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain attributed the lower increase to careful management of its coverage plans, saying it negotiated with pharmaceutical makers for rebates and discounts and had more selective coverage that excluded pricey drugs.It also said fewer new high-priced specialty drugs hit the market in 2015 and that inflation in branded drugs for high volume disorders like diabetes had one of the biggest impacts on spending.Drug spending in 2014 was boosted in part by a pricey new hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences (GILD.O), CVS said. In 2015, AbbVie Inc's ABBV.O competing product hit the market and is estimated to have nearly halved the price of Gilead's treatment. CVS competes against Express Scripts Holding Corp (ESRX.O) and Optum, a unit of UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N). Express Scripts also is expected to release a detailed drug spending report for 2015. CVS Chief Medical Officer Troyen Brennan said that the 2015 overall drug price trend would have been nearly the same as in 2014 if it had not made changes to its main coverage plan, called a formulary, or negotiated such steep discounts. Drug companies have a list price but typically provide discounts and rebates to large buyers.One drug Brennan called out as particularly pricey was Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX.N) Jublia, a toenail fungus treatment whose cost trend for customers rose 950 percent during the year, reflecting a combination of increased use and price. A cheaper oral medication that has better clinical results is preferred, he said. Valeant has been criticized for raising prices of its treatments sharply and for using a pharmacy that used aggressive tactics to push sales of its drugs.(This version of the story corrects eighth paragraph to show Jublia increase was utilization and price, not price alone) (Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Tom Brown)",2016-02-23,CVS,"Tue Feb 23, 2016 | 12:45pm EST","CORRECTED-CVS says 2015 drug spending grew 5 percent, far less than in 2014",http://www.reuters.com//article/cvs-health-pricing-idUSL2N1611PM?type=companyNews

Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken rates both stocks as ""buys,"" but said that most investors choose between the companies, with Walgreens now representing a higher-risk, higher-reward play, and CVS the lower-risk stock as Walgreens undergoes changes under a new CEO. Perhaps reflecting the view that CVS is a safer bet, a greater portion of analysts are recommending its shares, with 85 percent placing ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings on the stock against 58 percent for Walgreen, according to Thomson Reuters data. Walgreens shares are trading at 18 times forward earnings estimates compared with 17.4 times for CVS. But that gap has been wider for most of the past year. ACQUISITION PRESCRIPTION With a market cap of about $93 billion, Walgreens has established itself as a massive international retailer and distributor after completing the acquisition of Europe's Alliance Boots more than a year ago. That company's former executive chairman, Stefano Pessina, was named to head Walgreens on a permanent basis last July. Well-regarded by investors, Pessina has been leading changes that include significant cost cutting, according to analysts. Meanwhile, uncertainty clouds Walgreens' latest big deal - its proposed $9.4 billion acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), which would expand its U.S. drugstore footprint but faces antitrust scrutiny.Seattle-based Smead Capital Management holds more than 860,000 Walgreens shares and views the company as a ""best in class player"" in operating pharmacy outlets and convenience stores, said Tony Scherrer, Smead's director of research.CVS has also been on the acquisition path, with recent deals for pharmacy services provider Omnicare and Target Corp's (TGT.N) fleet of pharmacies. CVS, with a market cap of about $115 billion, is one of the biggest U.S. managers of prescription benefits - a business in which Walgreens lacks a comparable big presence - in addition to being the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by sales behind Walgreens, according to Euromonitor. That pharmacy benefits business, which has been increasing revenue at a faster pace than the pharmacy side, gives CVS an edge, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds in Rye, New York, who prefers CVS shares to Walgreens. CVS should also merit a higher stock market value, he said, because deals in the pharmacy benefits, or PBM, industry have been struck at higher premiums than for drug-store mergers.""I just think with the PBM in particular, (CVS is) going to have a much better growth rate in both revenue and earnings,"" Jonas said.

140,"  CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by store count, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by strong demand for its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services.Revenue in CVS's PBM business rose 20.5 percent to $28.8 billion in first quarter ended March 31, with the growth being boosted by pharmacy network claim volume and demand for specialty pharmacy services.CVS boosted its specialty pharmacy business, which provides drugs to people with expensive chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, with its $10.1 billion acquisition of Omnicare Inc in August 2015.Sales at established CVS stores rose 4.2 percent in the quarter, with front-end same-store sales increasing 0.7 percent, after almost three years of decline. The company's net income fell to $1.15 billion, or $1.04 per share, from $1.22 billion, or $1.07 per share, due to higher interest expenses and acquisition costs.Excluding items, CVS earned $1.18 per share, beating analysts average estimate of $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose 19 percent to $43.22 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $43 billion. However, the company second-quarter adjusted earnings forecast of $1.28-$1.31 per share was below analysts average estimate of $1.35 per share.

142,"   By Amrutha Penumudi and Ransdell Pierson  Allergan Plc (AGN.N), whose $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) collapsed last month, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would buy back up to $10 billion in company stock, helping lift its shares 4 percent.The Dublin drugmaker on Tuesday said the planned $40 billion sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) will close next month and that it will use $8 billion of the money to pay down company debt. Since the U.S. government torpedoed the merger, a deal that would have relocated Pfizer's legal domicile to Ireland to reduce Pfizer's taxes, investors have speculated Allergan might use the Teva proceeds for sizeable new deals.However, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders, in a conference call with industry analysts, said he was more interested for now in ""stepping stone deals"" valued at up to a few billion dollars meant to bolster the company's existing disease areas.Allergan, known as Actavis Inc until it bought Botox-maker Allergan Inc last year and took on its name, said it expects to buy back $4 billion to $5 billion of its shares over the next four to six months and would consider more stock repurchases if  market conditions allow. The company's market value is currently $84.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding special items, the company earned $3.04 per share in the first quarter, topping the average analysts' estimate of $3.01 largely because of lower than expected research spending.Up to Monday's close of $213.71, Allergan's stock had fallen about 23 percent since Pfizer scrapped the merger, which would have been the biggest-ever in the pharmaceutical industry.The deal collapsed after the U.S. Treasury issued new rules curbing tax inversions, or moves by American companies to relocate their domicile overseas to cut taxes. ""With this highly controversial quarter now in the rear view mirror, we see an attractive setup in Allergan shares going forward based on a combination of attractive valuation, ongoing healthy organic growth and significant capital deployment optionality,"" said JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott.Revenue in its U.S. brands business, including Botox, rose 27.3 percent to $2.30 billion. The unit accounts for about 60 percent of the company's total revenue. The company reported net income of $186.1 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with a loss of $535.2 million, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 48 percent to $3.80 billion, below Wall Street's expectations of $3.95 billion.Revenue fell in the company's generic distribution unit, which lost business from Target Corp's (TGT.N) in-store pharmacies after they were acquired by CVS Health (CVS.N).

144,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Retail chain Target Corp (TGT.N) gave a cautious outlook on Wednesday after reporting a lower-than-expected increase in quarterly sales due to unseasonable weather and weaker demand for electronics and groceries. Shares of the company fell as much as 11 percent, their biggest intraday decline since December 2008, as investors focused on weaker revenues and a poor outlook despite higher-than-expected earnings. Target's woes also encouraged investors to sell shares of rival retailers like Macy's M.N., JC Penney (JCP.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) on Wednesday. Wal-Mart is due to report quarterly results on Thursday.Target is the latest traditional brick-and-mortar chain to report disappointing sales as traditional chain stores spend more at online merchants like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and as slowly rising wages enable consumers to spend more on big-ticket purchases like cars and home improvements.""We're approaching our business with appropriate caution as sales trends at Target and many of our key competitors (have) weakened,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a conference call.He said he expected price discounting to intensify as retailers try to shed excess inventory after a slow season.  Target said apparel sales rose during the quarter and were stronger than other retailers', but unseasonable weather hurt demand.In addition, the company's grocery division suffered from a reorganization that increased organic and fresh food offerings but made it harder for customers to find products. The sixth-largest U.S. retailer said customers made larger ""pantry-stocking visits,"" but growth in smaller ""convenience trips"" slowed, highlighting a new challenge for chains like Target that have bet on small format-stores for future growth.Target said sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.2 percent in the first quarter ended on April 30, missing market expectations for a 1.6 percent increase, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.  Net sales fell 5.4 percent to $16.2 billion, mainly due to the sale of the pharmacy and clinic business to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N). Analysts on average had forecast $16.32 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Digital sales increased 23 percent, compared with a year-earlier rise of 38 percent, and accounted for 3.5 percent of the company's total. Target said second-quarter comparable sales would be flat to down 2 percent even though it was confident that it would meet its earnings outlook of $1.00 to $1.20 per share before special items.  Analysts blamed the first-quarter performance on short-term weakness in the sector and expressed confidence about Target's growth prospects and Cornell's turnaround strategy. Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm Conlumino, said the comparable sales were not ""spectacular"" but nonetheless were ""a testament to Target's relative strength"" because they remained in positive territory.   Net income fell to $632 million from $635 million a year earlier.Excluding restructuring charges and gains from the CVS deal, earnings were $1.29 per share, better than analysts expectations of $1.20 per share.

148,"   By Brendan Pierson  Republican Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  of Iowa is urging a federal appeals court to revive a whistleblower lawsuit accusing pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark Corp of defrauding Medicare, saying a lower court decision dismissing the case could undermine the goals of the federal False Claims Act. In an amicus brief accepted by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, Grassley said the lower court wrongly inferred that the federal government knew of Caremark's billing practices based on federal employees' testimony that those practices were widespread.

154,"   By Subrat Patnaik  Drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) reported a better-than-expected profit, helped by strong demand for its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast.Shares of the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by store count, rose 3 percent to $96.30 in premarket trading on Tuesday.Revenue in CVS's pharmacy business rose 20.7 percent to $5.1 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, due to increased pharmacy network claim volume and growth in specialty pharmacy.CVS boosted its specialty pharmacy business, which provides drugs to people with expensive chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, with its $10.1 billion acquisition of Omnicare Inc in August 2015.""We see 2017 shaping up to be another very successful PBM selling season, with substantial gross and net new business to date,"" Chief Executive Larry Merlo said.
