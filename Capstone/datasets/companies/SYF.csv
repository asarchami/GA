0,"  (Recasts with details of deal between Goldman and Wachovia))By Olivia Oran and Neha DimriAug 13 Goldman Sachs Group Inc is buying GE Capital Bank's U.S. online deposits, a move that will give the largest U.S. investment bank a more stable source of funding to help it better weather future crises.The deal is relatively small, giving Goldman Sachs $16 billion of deposits to help fund its $860 billion of assets. But it represents the latest step in a historic shift for Goldman, a standalone investment bank that has been forced by regulators to look more like a universal bank since the financial crisis.Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns faltered in 2008 after they could no longer borrow from bond investors and in other markets. Regulators have been pushing investment banks since then to mimic commercial and universal banks and fund more of their assets with deposits from consumers. In times of stress, deposits are less likely to disappear because they are federally insured.Some officials at the Federal Reserve, for example, pressured Goldman Sachs to acquire retail bank Wachovia soon after Lehman's collapse. Goldman Sachs considered buying online bank ING Direct, but Capital One Financial Corp bought it instead in 2011, according to a person familiar with the bank's plans.At the end of June, Goldman's deposits stood at $89 billion. Terms for the deal were not disclosed. The bank long avoided targeting consumers as customers, but has lately been rethinking that position. It is starting up a new online consumer lending business, and hired Discover Financial Services executive Harit Talwar to help develop it. People close to the bank said its decision to buy the GE Deposits was independent to its consumer lending business.For General Electric Co the deal comes days after it agreed to sell its health care finance business to Capital One.GE has been winding down its financing arm, GE Capital, which at one point accounted for almost half of the company's profit. The unit's rising funding costs during the 2008 financial crisis nearly sank the entire company. After GE Capital Bank sells its deposit platform, it will wind down its remaining operations, the company said in a statement.GE Capital has another bank that is chartered in the United States, Synchrony Bank, which is owned by Synchrony Financial, the credit card unit of GE Capital. Synchrony Financial sold shares publicly last year, and is due to wholly split off from GE later this year in a share exchange.GE hopes that shedding its two banks chartered in the United States will reduce its regulatory burden.Closing of the deal with Goldman Sachs, as well as splitting off the rest of Synchrony, are subject to regulatory approval.

1,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric options have dominated the market this week, as traders have been using a complex trading strategy to take advantage of the conglomerate's tender offer for Synchrony Financial (SYF.N) shares to make a small profit.    GE, which owns about 85 percent of Synchrony and spun off the consumer-finance company as part of its broader retreat from financial services, recently commenced a tender offer where GE investors can turn in shares in exchange for Synchrony shares at a discount.    The exchange offer, scheduled to end at midnight on November 16, 2015, has spurred a flurry of trading in GE's shares, with weekly trading volume on track to hit a six-year high. GE shares hit a 7-year high of $30.89 on Thursday.There has been a record surge in GE’s options trading volume as investors look to hedge their risk of holding GE. The point of the trade is to be able to take advantage of the tender without worrying about taking losses in GE while holding the shares.Traders are employing a strategy that provides a nearly risk-free way of extracting a small profit from the exchange offer and hinges on their being able swap their GE shares for Synchrony shares at a discount to the market price.The trade, called a conversion, involves opening a ""three-legged"" complex options strategy by taking a long position in the stock, selling call options, and buying put options. Traders sell calls and buy put options at the same strike price and with identical expirations. This creates a synthetic short position that offsets the long position in the actual stock. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, while puts convey the right to sell the shares.On Thursday, the company said each share of GE that is validly tendered will fetch 1.0505 shares of Synchrony. On Friday, GE shares were up 13 cents to $30.29 and Synchrony shares were down 11 cents to $30.68.""Economically there is no real risk. GE can go up or down a 100 percent and it would be offset perfectly (by the options position),” Trade Alert President Henry Schwartz said. “But I can take all the GE stock and tender it to get Synchrony shares at a discount,"" he said.Average daily trading volume in GE options in November has exploded to 1.4 million contracts, about 14 times the average for the rest of the year.    Thursday marked the sixth straight day that GE's options were the most heavily traded single stock name. They account for 14 percent of all single stock options volume in November, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data. ""Nobody would be doing this for any other reason than this tender,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.The number of open options contracts on GE has exploded to 17 million, up from just 3.7 million on October 19 when GE commenced the exchange offer. Nearly 6.6 million listed contracts, which equates to 660 million shares, is linked to this strategy, according to Trade Alert estimates.Pfizer Inc's options (PFE.N) saw a similar, though smaller, bump in trading volume in June 2013 when the pharmaceutical company spin off its majority stake in animal health business Zoetis Inc (ZTS.N).

4,"  * Company had been seeking ""a more pro-business environment""* Boston move comes as GE rebrands for digital age* A blow to Connecticut, where GE was based for 42 years* Massachusetts to give up to $120 mln in grants, incentives   (Adds details about tax rates in Connecticut and Massachusetts, comment by Connecticut governor)By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK, Jan 13 General Electric Co said on Wednesday it will move its global headquarters to Boston, tapping the city's technology talent and likely lowering its tax bill as the industrial conglomerate seeks to lift profit and emphasize digital capabilities.The maker of aircraft engines, locomotives, power turbines and household appliances will move to temporary quarters by next summer, and permanently settle about 800 workers in the Seaport district by 2018, GE said.""We want to be at the center of an ecosystem that shares our aspirations"" as a leader in digital-industrial activities, GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said in a statement.""Greater Boston is home to 55 colleges and universities. Massachusetts spends more on research and development than any other region in the world, and Boston attracts a diverse, technologically-fluent workforce focused on solving challenges for the world,"" he added. ""We are excited to bring our headquarters to this dynamic and creative city.""GE said the move would have no material financial impact, with costs offset by state and city incentives and the sale of its current headquarters offices in Fairfield, Connecticut, and its offices at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.Massachusetts will provide up to $120 million in grants and other incentives and the city will provide property tax savings of up to $25 million. The state funds must be spent on public infrastructure, including site preparation, building acquisition costs and road and building improvements, GE said. GE also is eligible for $1 million in workforce training grants, and up to $5 million to foster relations between the company, research institutions and universities.Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said GE's decision resulted from ""the city's willingness and excitement to work creatively"" to attract the company, bringing 800 high-paying jobs to the city.The move also will lower GE's tax bill. Even though Massachusetts is often called ""Taxachusetts,"" it ranked 25th in a 2016 Tax Foundation survey of positive business tax climates among U.S. states. Connecticut ranked 44th, near the bottom.Connecticut's corporate income tax rate is nominally 7.5 percent, but GE likely pays an effective rate of 9 percent due to surcharges on growth income, versus 8 percent in Massachusetts, said Jared Walczak, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.Connecticut also has many corporate tax structures that are less favorable than other states', such as rules that could put more of GE's global sales within Connecticut's grasp, and those probably also tipped the decision, Walczak said. ""Given the cost of corporate relocation, I suspect that GE anticipates substantial tax savings from the move,"" he said.LONG SEARCH GE's decision caps a search that intensified last summer as Connecticut lawmakers passed a budget that increased taxes by $1.2 billion over two years, drawing protests from some of the state's biggest corporations.The same month, Immelt said in an email to employees that he asked a team to examine the company's options to relocate the headquarters to a state with a ""more pro-business environment."" But talent also was a draw. GE said on Wednesday it had been thinking about a new location for more than three years and considered 40 potential sites this year. Those included Atlanta; Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, according to people familiar with the matter.""This wasn't only about dollars and cents but what Boston and New England brings to the table,"" said John Fish, chief executive officer of Suffolk Construction Company, New England's largest building company.The 124-year-old company is undergoing a major restructuring to emphasize digital and industrial capabilities. Earlier on Wednesday, GE said it would cut up to 6,500 jobs in Europe over the next two years, including 765 in France and 1,300 in Switzerland, as it restructures and integrates its acquisition of Alstom's energy business.With 800 employees, the Boston headquarters will be the same size as Fairfield, but its makeup will change, GE said. The new office will employ about 200 administrators and 600 ""digital industrial product managers, designs and developers,"" GE said.Those workers, spread among the company's GE Digital, Current, robotics and life sciences divisions, will share technology developments across business units, GE said, helping develop software to run the machinery the company manufacturers.GE had been based in Fairfield since 1974. The planned move is a blow to Connecticut, which in December reduced corporate taxes to thwart criticism that the state is unfriendly to business. Fairfield's 2013-2014 annual report listed GE's headquarters with an assessed value $74.7 million and ranked it the city's largest property tax payer.GE has about 5,700 employees in Connecticut, including about 800 people employed at the Fairfield headquarters. It was not immediately clear how many employees will remain in Connecticut.""Of course we are disappointed, and we know that many in Connecticut share that frustration,"" Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy said. ""While GE's headquarters may be leaving, I have been assured that the company will continue to have many employees working here in Connecticut.""GE's presence in the state had been shrinking because much of it was related to its finance arm, GE Capital. The company is selling off the bulk of GE Capital as part of its restructuring.(Additional reporting by Daniel Bases, Lewis Krauskopf and Megan Davies in New York, Scott Malone and Svea Herbst in Boston and Ankit Ajmera in Bangaluru; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Matthew Lewis)",2016-01-13,SYF,"Wed Jan 13, 2016 | 5:18pm EST","UPDATE 5-GE moving headquarters to Boston for tech talent, tax cut",http://www.reuters.com//article/ge-headquarters-idUSL2N14X1ER20160113?type=companyNews

Chief Executive Officer Keith Sherin said in a statement that the General Electric Co (GE.N) unit no longer met the criteria for a ""systemically important financial institution,"" a label that can trigger requirements for stricter oversight and more capital.The application came the day after a federal judge struck down the designation of insurer MetLife Inc (MET.N), but GE Capital said the two events were unrelated. The company had said in October that it hoped to apply to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chair, for ""de-designation"" in the first quarter.The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law authorized regulators to designate non-bank financial companies as systemically important, largely in response to the near-collapse of insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and the $182 billion U.S. government bailout it received during the 2008 economic meltdown. Only four non-banks have been deemed too big to fail, and the label has prompted most to consider reorganizing to pre-empt any increased regulation.

19,"   By Krisztina  Than and Gergely Szakacs | BUDAPEST  BUDAPEST Hungary plans to set up a special vehicle to handle non-performing mortgages that burden banks' books, part of its efforts to encourage lending and spur the economy after a weak first quarter, its economy minister said on Tuesday.Hungary's economic growth slowed to an annual 0.9 percent in the first quarter, coming in well below expectations and prompting the government to take steps in several areas, Economy Minister Mihaly Varga told the Reuters Eastern Europe Investment Summit.These included tax cuts in the 2017 budget, which parliament would pass in June, a more efficient use of European Union development funds, wage rises in the public sector and investment in infrastructure, he said.The government still projects economic growth of 2.5 percent this year and Varga said bank lending should grow at a faster pace than economic growth.""2016 will be a watershed year in the sense of whether the tax cut (for banks) would boost banks' willingness to lend,"" Varga said in an interview for the summit at his office in Budapest. Hungary reduced its hefty windfall tax on banks this year, and will cut it further in 2017.Varga said the government planned to set up a special housing fund, in which banks could place some of their non-performing mortgages. About 18 percent of all household loans are non-performing, which weigh on banks' books. ""This would improve banks' balance sheets, and would allow smaller provisions and increased lending,"" Varga said. He said around 40,000 to 50,000 mortgages could be placed in the fund, adding that precise details would be revealed after talks with all partners are finished.Varga also said the government would probably close a deal to buy a 15 percent stake in Erste Bank's (ERST.VI) Hungarian unit in the first half of June. The purchase is based on an agreement signed with Erste and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) last year.He said Hungary would pay between 30 billion and 40 billion forints ($107 mln-$142 mln) for the Erste stake, but declined to give the final figure before the contract is signed. Varga also said he expected the sale of state-owned Budapest Bank to be finalised by next year, with proceeds already flowing into the 2017 budget.""I very much hope we will sell this bank for as much as we paid for it when we bought it,"" Varga said. Hungary paid $700 million to buy Budapest Bank from GE Capital last year.The minister said Hungary could issue another yuan-denominated sovereign bond this year after it made the first such issue from Central Europe in April. ""I think before the end of the year, or early next year we could carry out another such issuance,"" Varga said.

29,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Electric Co (GE.N) on Friday reported weak demand for new oil, gas and transportation equipment, raising concerns about its full-year performance and sending its shares down as much as 2.8 percent.Still GE, long considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, posted adjusted second-quarter earnings of 51 cents a share that topped analysts' estimates of 46 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE also affirmed its 2016 operating outlook and forecast that strong growth would continue in the second half.    But investors focused on a 16 percent decline in new orders from continuing businesses amid weakness in oil and gas prices and commodity markets that undercut demand, raising questions about its forecast. ""You're counting on the second half being pretty strong, especially in the power business,"" said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, referring to power plant sales. ""Those are capital intensive purchases and if those get pushed out even just a little bit"" it could weaken GE's performance.GE expects sales for the year to grow at the low end of its 2 percent to 4 percent target range. But it said reduced orders, which represent bookings for future sales, would not affect revenue, which comes as deliveries of actual products and is on course. ""We have an enormous backlog (of orders),"" Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview. ""We don't view it as a concern for future revenue.""About 70 percent of the sales that GE expects this year already are in the backlog, he said.Investors also reacted to GE being about $1 billion short of estimates on free cash flow for the quarter, said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""That was attributed to slower accounts receivable collection,"" he said. ""You don't typically hear GE talk about that."" With the stock having had a strong run, he added, ""a little bit of profit-taking is understandable.""GE shares fell 2.2 percent at $31.87 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Other parts of the business did well. GE's revenue rose 15 percent to $33.49 billion, helped by a 31 percent rise in the power business, but that reflected the acquisition of the Alstom (ALSO.PA) power business last year.Sales from continuing industrial operations, known as organic segment revenue, fell 1 percent to $24.4 billion, less than some analysts expected. Power sales without Alstom were up 2 percent. Net profit was $2.73 billion, or 30 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.36 billion, or 13 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.GE's order backlog rose 1.3 percent to $320 billion, reflecting a 2 percent rise in services orders to $233 billion, while equipment orders fell 2.2 percent to $86 billion.During the quarter, GE returned $18 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks. The company shed its designation as a non-bank systemically important financial institution after divesting most of its GE Capital business. The change is expected to free about $18 billion in capital, which GE had pledged to return to shareholders through buybacks.

44,"   By Ernest Scheyder and Swetha Gopinath  General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Monday it would merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), creating the world's second-largest oilfield services provider as competition heats up to supply more-efficient products and services to the energy industry after several years of low crude prices.The deal to create a company with $32 billion in annual revenue will combine GE's strengths in making equipment long-prized by oil producers with Baker Hughes's expertise in drilling and fracking new wells.Shares of Baker Hughes were down nearly 7 percent, a drop that executives said likely was due to the deal's complicated structure.           ""This is a good deal for all of the investors,"" said Lorenzo Simonelli, head of GE's oil and gas business who will lead the new entity, to be called ""Baker Hughes, a GE company.""GE is already the world's largest oilfield equipment maker, supplying blowout preventers, pumps and compressors used in exploration and production. GE also has invested heavily in large data processing services just as the oil industry eyes its potential to boost oil recovery.Baker Hughes, by contrast, is seen as one of the world leaders in horizontal drilling, chemicals used to frack and other services key to oil production.The new company will vault Baker Hughes's market share ahead of rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N), which tried and failed to buy Baker until the deal collapsed last May, and also compete heavily with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), the world's largest oilfield service provider, for customers.Simonelli called Baker CEO Martin Craighead after the Halliburton deal collapsed, seeking some kind of business combination, with negotiations evolving over time to Monday's announcement.""Neither Lorenzo (Simonelli) or I needed to do this. We both followed our fiduciary responsibility,"" Craighead said in an interview.        GE will own 62.5 percent of the new publicly-traded company. The deal is expected to close in mid-2017.GE will have to pay $1.3 billion to Baker Hughes if the deal does collapse in what would be yet another windfall for Baker Hughes after Halliburton was forced to pay it $3.5 billion earlier this year when those companies' merger collapsed. For graphic on GE and Baker Huges merger click tmsnrt.rs/2e5Y3xa""We don't anticipate anything like what we've encountered before happening again,"" Craighead said, stressing he expects the GE tie-up to be blessed by regulators.GE and Baker Hughes will reach out to the Justice Department and European antitrust enforcers on Monday, according to a source close to the company. GE will argue to antitrust enforcers - who stopped the deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes just months ago - that their deal is complementary, and that they are committed to any remedy needed to win approval, the source said.A small part of GE's business is selling equipment to Baker Hughes' competitors and it will continue those sales, the source said.All of GE's oil and gas business, which generated roughly 14 percent of GE's revenue last year, will go into the new company, leaving no energy units behind in its former parent, Simonelli said. The ""best performers"" from the existing GE and Baker Hughes will form new management teams, he added, declining to comment on potential layoffs. Analysts said there was little overlap between the businesses that would worry regulators.""I don't see any overlaps, significant overlaps,"" said Tom Seng, a veteran of the energy business who teaches at the University of Tulsa. OIL NEAR $50 The deal comes at a time when North American oil and gas producers are putting rigs back to work after a near-freeze in activity caused by a slump in oil prices that began mid-2014.But the deal is predicated on a forecast for oil prices to rise to $60 per barrel by 2019, GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told investors Monday. ""This is a very compelling time for the deal,"" Immelt said, noting he expects $1.6 billion in annual cost savings by 2020.Global oil prices LCOc1 have risen by a third this year to near $50 a barrel.Craighead, who will become vice chairman of the new company, echoed Immelt's confidence.""We see growth under any market environment,"" Craighead said in an interview. ""Our customers continue to spend massive amounts of money.""The industrywide push for pumping more oil and natural gas at cheaper costs should only accelerate that trend, he said. Activist investor Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management owns about 0.8 percent of GE as of June 30, told CNBC the new company would be able to go ""nose-to-nose"" with Schlumberger.Shareholders of Baker Hughes, which had a market value of about $26 billion as of Friday, will get a special one-time cash dividend from GE of $17.50 per share - or $7.4 billion - after the deal closes. The new company, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will have dual headquarters in Houston and London. Baker Hughes shares rose as much as 5 percent in morning trade before reversing course to trade down nearly 8 percent at $54.60. Shares of GE slipped 0.1 percent to $29.18.Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley are advising GE, while Shearman & Sterling is its legal adviser. Goldman Sachs & Co is Baker Hughes's financial adviser, with Davis Polk acting as legal adviser.
