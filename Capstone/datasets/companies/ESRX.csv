0,"  * Sees 2014 sales growth of 8-11 pct in local currencies* Q4 profit 7.35 mln crowns vs 7.73 bln forecast   (Adds comments from CEO, CFO and analysts, details, background, share price)By Teis Jensen and Shida ChayestehCOPENHAGEN, Jan 30 Novo Nordisk, the world's largest insulin producer, raised its 2014 outlook by less than investors had hoped for saying it expected sales to be hit by contract losses in the United States and competition from cheaper generic drugs.The Danish company also promoted head of sales and production Kaare Schultz to chief operating officer, a role that puts him in the running to succeed 59-year-old Chief Executive Lars Rebien Sorensen whose contract ends in 2019.Novo Nordisk said on Thursday that it now expected sales to grow by 8-11 percent, below its average 13 percent growth rate over the last ten years.It forecast operating profit to grow by around 10 percent in local currencies. Both outlooks were raised from an October forecast of 'high single-digit growth'.Novo, which competes with Sanofi and Eli Lilly & Co, aims to increase the number of people that use its drugs to 40 million in 2020 from 23 million in 2012, as the world faces an epidemic of type 2 diabetes linked to over-eating and lack of exercise. Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said 2014 sales would be hit by competition from copycat versions of its Prandin diabetes drug and the loss of two contracts with U.S. pharmacy group Express Scripts Holding Co, which was announced in September.Those two factors are expected to reduce global sales by 1 percentage point each, Brandgaard said.He said there was also uncertainty about the development of its smaller biopharmaceuticals business, without elaborating. Novo expects 2014 sales of between 87.33 billion and 89.84 billion Danish crowns ($16.4 billion), below analysts' average forecast of 90.31 billion crowns.Alm. Brand Bank analyst Michael Friis Jorgensen said he expected Novo to upgrade its outlook during the year.""It is disappointing that they do not raise EBIT guidance for 2014 further,"" Jorgensen said. ""But it is no catastrophe"".The company raised its 2013 guidance three times. CEO Sorensen, who has been in the job since 2000 and is due to step down some time before his 65th birthday, said no decision had been made about his succession. ""No crown prince title has been issued yet, and my departure is not imminent"" he said.Operating profit fell to 7.35 billion in the fourth quarter, missing forecasts in a Reuters poll.Sales rose 4 percent to 21.70 billion crowns, missing an average forecast of 22.11 billion.Novo's board proposed a dividend of 4.5 crowns per share and a 12-month share buyback programme of up to 15 billion crowns.Shares in Novo Nordisk were 0.4 percent higher at 0951 GMT, while the Danish benchmark index was up 0.9 percent.Novo's shares have risen 2.5 percent since the start of the year, outperforming a 0.9 percent fall in the European Healthcare Index.

The bonds will be cross guaranteed by ESRX's two other issuing entities, Express  Scripts, Inc. and Medco Health Solutions, Inc. and, as a result, will rank pari  passu with all existing unsecured debt currently outstanding in ESRX's capital  structure. KEY RATING DRIVERS --ESRX is the largest pharmacy benefit management (PBM) and third-largest  pharmacy operator in the U.S. Fitch expects such scale to continue enabling ESRX  to negotiate favorable purchasing discounts and pricing rebates and to leverage  its fixed costs, especially associated with mail-order pharmacy. --ESRX achieved its leverage target of 2x subsequent to its merger with Medco  Health Solutions, Inc., using nearly $4.2 billion of cash flows for debt  repayment in the second half of 2012 (2H'12) and fiscal year 2013 (FY13).  Fitch-calculated debt leverage was 2.07x at March 31, 2014. Management says the  bulk of core integration tasks are largely complete; though some additional  capacity and cost rationalization is planned for 2014. --Stable and robust cash flows are driven by strong working capital management  and efficient operations, despite relatively low margins. Fitch forecasts free  cash flow (FCF) of approximately $4.4 billion in 2014. Strong cash flows and a  solid liquidity profile afford incremental ratings flexibility in light of debt  leverage toward the upper end of the current 'BBB' range. --ESRX has been an active acquirer over the past decade, often employing large  debt balances to fund deals. The possibility for large-scale M&A and  accompanying leverage spikes, albeit lower now given ESRX's very large size,  pressure the ratings somewhat. Notably, the firm has routinely executed on its  outlined de-leveraging plans, reducing leverage appropriately within 12-18  months of each deal.  --Some pricing pressure is possible from consolidating clients over the ratings  horizon. Current trends support increasing consolidation in many areas of  healthcare, including among health insurers. Increasing competition and an  apparent willingness to experiment with new models on the part of PBM clients  creates opportunities for both risk and reward to ESRX's growth prospects over  the medium term. --ESRX's public guidance for total adjusted script declines of 4%-9% implies  weaker utilization and possibly more client losses than Fitch had initially  expected. Though 2014 and possibly 2015 may be somewhat weak, Fitch believes  ESRX's longer-term growth will fare more positively as tailwinds from healthcare  reform, specialty market growth, demographics, and ongoing cost containment  efforts by payers drive PBM volumes and utilization of more value-add services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of the current 'BBB' ratings will require debt-to-EBITDA of around  2x or below, accompanied by continued robust cash flows and steady longer-term  script growth in the low- to mid-single digits. Completion of final Medco  integration and cost rationalization efforts in 2014, with evidence of better  underlying growth drivers in 2015+, will likely contribute to incremental  flexibility at the 'BBB' ratings in the medium term.  A positive rating action is not contemplated over the ratings horizon, but could  be supported by profitability and base business growth that outpaces Fitch's  current expectations.  Fitch notes that the firm's strong cash flow profile provides significant  de-leveraging capabilities in the event of debt-funded mergers and acquisitions  (M&A). Furthermore, Fitch believes it is unlikely that broader industry dynamics  alone will contribute to significant ratings pressure over the ratings horizon.  But the prioritization of cash flows for shareholder-friendly activities over  debt repayment in the event of large-scale M&A or operational stress, resulting  in debt leverage materially and durably above 2x, could drive a negative rating  action. A possible stress scenario envisions the possibility of prolonged  negative underlying script growth, possibly due to customer losses more severe  than Fitch currently expects.  Fitch rates ESRX as follows: Express Scripts Holding Company --Long-term IDR 'BBB'; --Unsecured bank facility 'BBB'; --Unsecured notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Express Scripts, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'BBB'; --Unsecured notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Medco Health Solutions, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'BBB'; --Unsecured notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

18,"  * Advair restored to Express Scripts 2015 formulary list* Move may boost use but prices still seen under pressure* GSK diabetes drug Tanzeum not included in Express list* GSK shares up 1.2 percent   (Adds further comment from Express Scripts on Advair move)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, Aug 4 GlaxoSmithKline received a boost on Monday from a decision by Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, to reinstate its top-selling lung drug Advair as an approved drug in 2015.The British company's business has suffered since January after the inhaled medicine Advair was dropped from various formulary lists - including that of Express Scripts - while it fights growing price competition from rival products.Drugs excluded from such lists have to be paid for out of  patients' pockets, hitting their use. Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans. Express Scripts said the decision followed GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) willingness to offer the 15-year-old respiratory drug at a highly competitive price.""We have changed the formulary status of Advair in 2015 due to the improved pricing we were able to negotiate for our clients,"" said spokesman David Whitrap.Disappointing U.S. sales of Advair were largely to blame for GSK's worse-than-expected second-quarter results, which prompted the company to cut its 2014 earnings outlook last month. Advair makes up nearly a fifth of GSK's sales but demand is eroding both in Europe, where it faces competition from copycat versions, and in the United States, due to lack of formulary cover and keen competition from AstraZeneca's Symbicort.U.S. sales of Advair, which is used to treat asthma and chronic lung disease, tumbled 19 percent in the second quarter in constant currency terms.Even after the Express Scripts change, however, Advair will still be at a disadvantage, according to Credit Suisse analysts, since it is not listed as a preferred treatment, unlike Symbicort and Merck & Co's Dulera.The analysts believe Advair prices are likely to remain under heavy pressure as GSK strives to secure market share. The decision to move Advair from ""excluded"" to ""non-preferred"" means that while GSK's drug will be covered, patients will face a higher co-payment when filling Advair prescriptions than for preferred brands in the same therapy class.Furthermore, GSK's new lung drug Breo remains excluded from the Express Scripts formulary, along with its new injectable diabetes drug Tanzeum, which belongs to the same so-called GLP-1 class as Novo Nordisk's Victoza.Victoza was already excluded from the list but GSK has been hoping to win business for its rival medicine by pricing Tanzeum at a discount to Victoza.GSK shares were 1.2 percent higher by 1445 GMT.Express Scripts also said late on Friday it would drop two key anaemia drugs, Epogen and Aranesp, sold by Amgen.(Editing by David Holmes and Sophie Walker)",2014-08-04,ESRX,"Mon Aug 4, 2014 | 11:00am EDT",UPDATE 1-GSK gets a lift as Express Scripts reinstates lung drug Advair,http://www.reuters.com//article/gsk-advair-idUSL6N0QA3YS20140804?type=companyNews

20,"  * Q2 net profit up 4 percent at 7 billion DKK* Q2 operating profit up 2 pct at 8.7 bln DKK* Shares up 1.5 pct   (Adds comments from CEO, analysts, share price)By Stine Jacobsen and Ole MikkelsenCOPENHAGEN, Aug 7 Novo Nordisk <NOVOb.CO said on Thursday it could launch its new long-acting insulin Tresiba, a crucial future growth driver for the Danish company, at the start of 2016 in the United States.The world's top insulin maker is battling to maintain strong profit growth after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration refused to approve Tresiba due to heart-risk concerns and the company lost contracts to supply a U.S. pharmacy chain.Investors were likely to welcome the more detailed timetable for Tresiba in the United States. Novo Nordisk had previously said it would have additional data ready by mid-2015, without outlining further steps.""They have moved the (Tresiba) data six months forward, which is certainly not unimportant for Novo. It looks like there are no problems with the study, so it is a very positive signal,"" said analyst Michael Friis Jorgensen of Alm Brand, which has a ""buy"" rating on Novo Nordisk shares. The FDA told Novo Nordisk to conduct extra tests and the company now says the data should be complete by the end of the year or the start of 2015, allowing it to submit an analysis in the first half of 2015.""If we calculate the best possible scenario then we could see an approval by the end of the year, meaning a launch into the beginning of 2016,"" Novo Nordisk Chief Executive Lars Rebien Sorensen told journalists on a call.He was speaking after the company reported second-quarter results that were more or less in line with analyst expectations and maintained a 2014 forecast for a 7-10 percent rise in sales  and around 10 percent growth in operating profit.It said operating profit reached 8.73 billion Danish crowns($1.57 billion) in the second quarter compared to expectations of 8.56 billion crowns, on revenues of 21.63 billion crowns against a consensus forecast of 21.7 billion crowns. Shares in Novo Nordisk rose as much as 1.5 percent before retreating to stand 0.75 percent higher at 254.70 crowns each. The main Copenhagen stock exchange index was down a touch .U.S. PRICING PRESSURE  Novo Nordisk has been under pressure in the United States, its largest market, due to competition from generic drugs and broader pricing pressure. Last year it lost two contracts to supply Express Scripts Holding Co. representing some 40-45 million U.S. customers.Sales of Victoza, used for patients with type 2 diabetes who can still generate some insulin themselves, rose 15 percent in North America and Novo increased its market share in the GLP-1 sector to 69 percent from 65 percent.But Victoza was one of the products hurt by the loss of Express Script contracts and its sales growth did not satisfy all analysts, including those from Nordea and Berenberg.""Victoza sales ... were 3 percent below consensus and the GLP-1 market growth rate continues to struggle. The category is now seeing tougher competition from oral drugs such as the DPP-IVs and SGLT-2 inhibitors,"" Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said in a note.Sorensen conceded that the U.S. market was a challenge for Novo Nordisk after rivals Sanofi and Eli Lilly  both reported growth in their diabetes segments.""It is clear that the situation which occurred towards the end of 2013 is persisting into 2014, with increasing pricing pressure in almost all segments,"" Sorensen said.In the year to date, Novo Nordisk shares are up over 28 percent, outperforming Sanofi's 3 percent and Eli Lilly's 20 percent increase.

The drug had third quarter sales of $2.8 billion even though it was only approved in December.Harvoni, approved this month by U.S. regulators, combines Sovaldi with another Gilead drug and is expected to dominate treatment of the liver disease that affects an estimated 3 million Americans.    Miller said Sovaldi's cost is particularly hitting state prisons and Medicaid, the insurance program for the indigent funded jointly by states and the federal government, because those populations have high rates of infection with the hepatitis C virus. Express Scripts said U.S. regulators by December could approve AbbVie's product, which combines three drugs into a single pill.""(We) are hoping they take a different approach when it comes to pricing,"" Miller said.But Adelle Infante, an AbbVie spokeswoman, said no price has  been disclosed for her company's drug, which does not yet have a name. The suburban Chicago drugmaker is hoping it will be approved this year. Gilead officials could not immediately be reached for comment.The AbbVie product, like Harvoni, would not need to be taken with interferon, a harsh injectable drug that for years had been part of a standard regimen for the disease, which can quietly harm or destroy the liver over a period of decades. Should the AbbVie drug be deemed clinically equivalent but less costly than Sovaldi and Harvoni, Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the Gilead drugs could be given lower priority on its drug formulary, or be removed from it. Express Scripts is the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager.

29,"   By Caroline Humer  The largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager said on Monday it has lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount.Express Scripts' move reignited investor concerns that pharmaceutical companies will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.Gilead shares dropped 13 percent, or about $14.54, in Monday trading to $93.88, though it was still far above the $65 level reached in April, when insurers launched a major outcry over its multibillion-dollar hepatitis C business. Shares in major biotechnology companies such as Amgen, Biogen and Celgene fell more than 2 percent.Express Scripts opposed the $84,000 price tag of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi treatment since its approval a year ago. It said the $1,000-a-day pill, shown to cure hepatitis C in most patients, was unaffordable.Private insurers generally receive discounts of as much as 20 percent, but Gilead has resisted, bringing in $3 billion in quarterly revenue for Sovaldi this year. The company maintains that Sovaldi, and a next-generation version called Harvoni that was approved in October, will save the U.S. healthcare system the costs of caring for advanced liver disease in many patients.Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller said on Monday in an e-mailed statement that the company is continuing to negotiate with Express Scripts.AbbVie's Viekira Pak drug was approved on Friday by U.S. regulators and the company set a list price of $83,319. But it has agreed to a significantly lower price than Gilead for Express Scripts' National Preferred Formulary, a list of approved and covered drugs for 25 million Americans, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview.""This is unprecedented,"" Miller said, explaining that the pricing on specialty drugs of this type tend to be much closer even when a competitor enters the market. He did not provide a specific dollar figure, but said AbbVie had narrowed the price gap to resemble what Western European countries pay for  Sovaldi, which runs from $51,373 in France to $66,000 in Germany. WIDENING TREATMENT An estimated 3.2 million people in the United States have hepatitis C. Most insurance plans have paid for Gilead's drugs only for patients with advanced liver disease to limit their exposure to its cost. Express Scripts said the AbbVie agreement will allow it to extend treatment to all hepatitis C patients. Dr. Camilla Graham, co-director of the viral hepatitis center at Beth Israel Deaconess medical center in Boston, said she is hopeful other insurers will follow suit. ""My first thought when I saw this was 'Finally, we have a solution to this public health crisis,'"" Graham said. A significant portion of patients with hepatitis C receive medical care through government-paid programs, including Medicare for the elderly and disabled, Medicaid for the poor and the U.S. Department of Defense.State Medicaid agencies have also limited access to Gilead's Sovaldi, saying it is too expensive even after they receive a legally mandated 23 percent discount.Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said he is ""hopeful but cautious"" about the state agencies' ability to extract further rebates on top of the discount from Gilead and AbbVie.America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry's largest lobbying group, also hopes to see Gilead's prices drop now that there is competition in the market, said spokesman Brendan Buck.  EXCEPTIONS MADE FOR SOVALDI The AbbVie regimen consists of a cocktail of anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The regimen requires some patients also to take ribavirin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat.Express Scripts said starting Jan. 1, 2015, it would pay for the AbbVie drug only for patients who have genotype 1. Express Scripts will no longer cover Gilead's Harvoni, a one-pill treatment for patients with genotype 1 that costs $94,500 for a 12-week course. It will cover Sovaldi in cases where patients have other types of the disease. The AbbVie regimen is also not recommended for patients whose livers are not functioning and in people who have not benefited from using older treatments. An Express Scripts spokesman said the company will make exceptions for those patients to allow them to take Gilead's medications.Mario Molina, chief executive officer of Molina Healthcare Inc., a small Medicaid insurer in California that has criticized Gilead's high prices, said on Monday that he sees more competition on drug prices ahead.""I think that this is the beginning,"" Molina said, describing the move as ""a harbinger of things to come.""

39,"   By Deena Beasley | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies after winning discounts on medications with a strategy introduced last year.On Monday, Express Scripts said it lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc's newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc's  rival treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount. The move threatens to undermine profits at Gilead, and was viewed by Wall Street as a sign that other major biotechnology players, including Amgen Inc and Biogen Inc, will face steeper U.S. pricing pressure from insurers. Other drugmakers without potentially transformative new products, such as Shire Plc, Novo Nordisk and Theravance Inc, may also be particularly vulnerable, analysts said. Neither Shire, Novo Nordisk nor Theravance responded to requests for comment. Express Scripts will further expand the number of medicines it won't cover for 2016, including treatments for common illnesses such as diabetes, pulmonary hypertension and arthritis, said Chief Medical Officer Dr Steve Miller, in an interview earlier this month. In some cases, Express Scripts could drop coverage for newer specialty medicines in the biotechnology field, he said. The timing on specific drugs will depend on when new competing drugs with similar clinical benefits are approved for the U.S. market.Express Scripts first began excluding drugs from its largest national reimbursement list for 2014, with 44 medications, and increased that number to 66 for 2015.The prospect of having their drugs dropped from Express Scripts' biggest ""formulary"" list of covered medicines has prompted some leading pharmaceutical makers to discount their prices, Miller said.Express Scripts is acting on behalf of clients who need to rein in healthcare costs, and estimates that the move has so far saved such employers more than $1 billion in annual spending, Miller said.Employers ""are by necessity asking us to take a more aggressive stance because the affordability of their benefits is really at risk,"" Miller said. ""We are going to be opportunistic"" in looking for savings in the future.Gilead shares dropped more than 14 percent in Monday trading and fell more than 4 percent on Tuesday to $88.80. Declines in other biotech shares accelerated, with Amgen, Biogen and Celgene all losing 5 percent or more after having fallen 2 percent on Monday.CVS HEALTH  The second largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, CVS Health Corp, has said it will exclude 95 prescription products from its reimbursement list next year, up from 72 in 2014. It expects the practice will save its plan sponsors over $3.5 billion between 2012 and 2015.The drugs most under scrutiny include more expensive, ""me-too"" products, in categories where several drugmakers compete for similar patients. Both Novo Nordisk and Sanofi SA are developing slightly longer-lasting insulins. Amgen, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson, respectively sell Enbrel, Humira and Remicade - all rheumatoid arthritis drugs that work in a similar way. Companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries and Actavis want to switch patients to more expensive versions of their multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's drugs, respectively, before the arrival of cheap generic competitors.The effect is already being felt by such Big Pharma players as AstraZeneca Plc and Sanofi. Both companies warned recently that the need to offer U.S. price discounts on some of their biggest brand-name medicines will hurt 2015 sales. Insurers are pushing back against prices in other categories, including blood thinners and even HIV drugs and multiple sclerosis treatments, where there are multiple options for doctors and patients, observers said.""The extent of this becoming a broader problem is tied to whether we get great new drugs for things like asthma, (high cholesterol), Alzheimer's and cancer,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. ""If there is a limited pool of money and a bunch of new drugs, the pressure on older drugs will increase.""   DIMINISHING RETURNS In recent years, the introduction of far cheaper generic versions of medicines like Pfizer Inc's Lipitor to reduce cholesterol and Merck & Co's asthma drug Singulair helped insurers save on reimbursement costs. But that wave of patent expiries has slowed considerably. In the meantime, a new crop of novel, and in some cases, highly effective treatments for cancer and hepatitis C are costing them tens of billions of dollars more to reimburse.The influx of generics ""allowed the system to actually see drug price deflation,"" said Asher Anolic, manager of Fidelity's Select Pharmaceuticals Portfolio. ""At the same time, others are launching innovative new drugs ... Based on those dynamics I get more concerned. Where is the give in the system? It's on the legacy products."" Anolic said his Fidelity fund focuses on drugmakers with highly differentiated portfolios of treatments. Its top holdings as of Sept 30 included Actavis, AbbVie, Novartis AG and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.""When you look at the industry as a whole, we will probably see less profitability,"" said Nils Behnke, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co. ""Mid-sized companies with a broader portfolio of little products, 'me-too' products - they will have a hard time.""  Murray Aitken, vice president at healthcare information company IMS Health, estimates that 2014 spending on new and innovative brand-name drugs will total about $20 billion compared with about $3 billion in 2012. Industry executives say newer health plans, whether purchased by individual consumers or offered through an employer, will further accelerate efforts to limit drug prices because they require patients to pay a higher share of prescription costs.Pharmacy benefits companies like Express Scripts say they will cover an excluded medicine if that specific treatment is deemed medically necessary for a patient. Some groups have expressed concern that patient care might be compromised. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a leading drug industry trade group, said such practices hurt patients by limiting access to a range of appropriate medicines and potentially discriminating against certain conditions.But insurers say that the high price of new drugs set by manufacturers has already deterred some patients from following doctor's orders.""Plan sponsors, because of the rapid rise in cost, are many times having to ask the consumer to pay more"" for their medicines, said Express Scripts' Miller.

""If there is a limited pool of money and a bunch of new drugs, the pressure on older drugs will increase.""  DIMINISHING RETURNS In recent years, the introduction of far cheaper generic versions of medicines like Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) Lipitor to reduce cholesterol and Merck & Co's (MRK.N) asthma drug Singulair helped insurers save on reimbursement costs. But that wave of patent expiries has slowed considerably. In the meantime, a new crop of novel, and in some cases, highly effective treatments for cancer and hepatitis C are costing them tens of billions of dollars more to reimburse.The influx of generics ""allowed the system to actually see drug price deflation,"" said Asher Anolic, manager of Fidelity's Select Pharmaceuticals Portfolio. ""At the same time, others are launching innovative new drugs ... Based on those dynamics I get more concerned. Where is the give in the system? It's on the legacy products."" Anolic said his Fidelity fund focuses on drugmakers with highly differentiated portfolios of treatments. Its top holdings as of Sept 30 included Actavis, AbbVie, Novartis AG NOVN.VX and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N).""When you look at the industry as a whole, we will probably see less profitability,"" said Nils Behnke, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co. ""Mid-sized companies with a broader portfolio of little products, 'me-too' products - they will have a hard time.""Murray Aitken, vice president at healthcare information company IMS Health IMS.N, estimates that 2014 spending on new and innovative brand-name drugs will total about $20 billion compared with about $3 billion in 2012. Industry executives say newer health plans, whether purchased by individual consumers or offered through an employer, will further accelerate efforts to limit drug prices because they require patients to pay a higher share of prescription costs.Pharmacy benefits companies like Express Scripts say they will cover an excluded medicine if that specific treatment is deemed medically necessary for a patient. Some groups have expressed concern that patient care might be compromised. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a leading drug industry trade group, said such practices hurt patients by limiting access to a range of appropriate medicines and potentially discriminating against certain conditions.But insurers say that the high price of new drugs set by manufacturers has already deterred some patients from following doctor's orders.""Plan sponsors, because of the rapid rise in cost, are many times having to ask the consumer to pay more"" for their medicines, said Express Scripts' Miller.

42,"   By Susan Kelly and Bill Berkrot  Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, on Tuesday said cost savings on expensive cancer treatments could be achieved if the company were involved earlier in the decision-making process. Express Scripts, which has become more aggressive in negotiating discounts on drugs for insurance plans and employers, in December stopped covering Gilead Sciences Inc's hepatitis C treatments after lining up a cheaper price for AbbVie's newly-approved alternative.Gilead's Sovaldi and follow-up combination pill Harvoni have been shown to cure hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of patients. But Express deemed the more than $90,000 price for 12 weeks of Harvoni treatment unaffordable. The move reignited investor concerns that drugmakers will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.For cancer patients, treatment decisions typically go through health insurance plans first, and medicines are not changed once people have begun their regimens, Express Scripts Chief Executive George Paz said at the J.P.

""The big opportunity out there is really in cancer,"" Paz said. ""If we can get out in front of that, that is a huge opportunity.""

45,"  (Adds comment from CVS rival Express Scripts, other background)By Ransdell PiersonFeb 17 CVS Health warned on Tuesday that the costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments could eclipse those of other expensive medicines and overwhelm the U.S. healthcare system ""if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.""Two of the new injectable cholesterol treatments, called PCSK9 inhibitors, could gain U.S. approval this summer. CVS said they could eventually be used by as many as 15 million patients at an annual cost of up to $150 billion a year if priced at $7,000 to $12,000 a year, making it the highest-selling class of drugs in history.""The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,"" William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement.CVS, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans. The CVS call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians over the high cost of new, highly effective treatments for hepatitis C, especially two medicines from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500 per patient for a course of treatment.Unlike those drugs, which are typically taken for about 12 weeks, the PCSK9s would be used for a lifetime.Express Scripts, the largest U.S. PBM, which has waged a campaign against Gilead's hepatitis C drugs and is now scrutinizing costly cancer medications, provided a slightly different view of the new cholesterol drug market. Express Scripts also expects annual costs of around $10,000 per year per patient. But it sees a patient population that will start small before it ever reaches a possible high of 10 million people and a potential annual cost of $100 billion.Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview that limits set by regulators and the fact that the first wave of drugs are injections may slow their uptake. ""We are going to work to get these products at the best price possible, but they also deserve to get value in the marketplace,"" Miller said.Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting approval of rival PCSK9 inhibitors.They are expected to be used first by patients who are genetically prone to extreme high cholesterol - a population that CVS and Express peg at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used by those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc's Lipitor.Amgen declined to comment on the pricing issue and Regeneron did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of Amgen closed up 0.5 percent at $154.24, while Regeneron's stock gained 0.4 percent to $404.18. Sanofi's shares slipped 0.2 percent to 85.53 euros in trading in Paris.

46,"  (Adds Breakingviews link)By Sneha BanerjeeMarch 30 Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc  agreed to buy Catamaran Corp  in a deal worth about $12.8 billion to boost its pharmacy benefit business as it competes with bigger rivals such as Express Scripts Holdings Co.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) administer drug benefits for employers and health plans and run large mail order pharmacies, helping them get better prices from drugmakers.As employers look to cut prescription costs on expensive drugs, the deal with Catamaran will give UnitedHealth's pharmacy benefits unit, OptumRx, the scale to negotiate favorable prices from pharmacy companies.U.S. drug prices rose 12 percent in 2014 due to a new treatment for hepatitis C that cost more than $80,000 but cured almost all recipients with few side effects. Another new class of drugs, to treat high cholesterol, is expected to hit the market in 2015 and has insurers worried about drug costs this year as well.The purchase of Catamaran will increase UnitedHealth's market share to 15 percent to 20 percent of the people who receive their drug benefits through pharmacy benefit managers, BMO Capital Markets analyst Jennifer Lynch said in a research note. With a combined 1 billion scripts annually, UnitedHealth will be about the same size as current industry number two, CVS Health Corp, she added.Catamaran was formed after SXC Health Solutions and PBM Catalyst Health Solutions merged in 2012.UnitedHealth's offer of $61.50 per share represents a premium of 27 percent to Catamaran's Friday close on the Nasdaq. Catamaran's stock was trading at $60.01 premarket on Monday, while UnitedHealth was up nearly 4 percent.The deal ""makes sense to us, but admittedly came much earlier than we expected,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said in a research note.""We had always viewed Catamaran as a compelling asset for companies looking for scale in the PBM sector such as Optum or Walgreens but expected Catamaran to grow the business much further before pursuing a sale."" He added that the offer seemed adequate and he did not expect competing bids at this point.The deal value is based on Illinois-based Catamaran's total diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015 and add about 30 cents per share to UnitedHealth's profit in 2016, the companies said.Catamaran Chief Executive Officer Mark Thierer will be CEO of OptumRx and OptumRx CEO Timothy Wicks will become president.(Additional reporting by Caroline Humer in New York; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Meredith Mazzilli)",2015-03-30,ESRX,"Mon Mar 30, 2015 | 2:50pm EDT",UPDATE 4-UnitedHealth to buy pharmacy benefit firm Catamaran for $12.8 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/catamaran-ma-unitedheal-grp-idUSL3N0WW3HB20150330?type=companyNews
47,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, March 30  NEW YORK, March 30 UnitedHealth Group Inc's  planned takeover of No. 4 U.S. pharmacy benefits provider Catamaran Corp will give the companies added heft in price talks with drug companies, serving as a catalyst for deals allowing other insurers to bulk up.The $12.8 billion deal comes at a time when Wall Street has been parsing the possibilities that top insurers like Aetna Inc  with Cigna Corp could pair up. Smaller companies like Health Net Inc, Molina Healthcare Inc or WellCare Health Plans Inc are also increasingly seen as takeover targets.""There has been chatter about large-scale M&A coming out of some recent investor conferences,"" Mizuho Securities senior healthcare analyst Sheryl Skolnick said. ""I don't know if $12.8 billion qualifies as large scale M&A in the space, but now you have the answer. Yes, there will be transactions.""Express Scripts Holdings Corp, the largest pharmacy benefit manager and the only stand-alone PBM, may be pressed to do a deal with a distribution company or pharmacy if margins become too tight, analysts said on Monday.The link-up could force a tie-up between Express Scripts and Walgreens Boots Alliance, for instance, which has pharmacy and drug distribution operations but no pharmacy management business, Evercore ISI analyst Michael Cherny said in a research report.That could put it at a disadvantage to CVS Health, the No. 2 pharmacy benefit manager which also owns one of the nation's largest pharmacy chains. Meanwhile, Envision RX, a small pharmacy benefit manager, recently announced plans to be bought by national drug store chain Rite Aid. Healthcare companies are able to use scale to negotiate better prices. Late last year, for instance, Express Scripts was able to negotiate a steep discount for an important hepatitis C drug from AbbVie Inc, and has said it will use its size to extract discounts for cancer drugs and cholesterol drugs in the future.A spokesman for Express Scripts, whose shares were up 3.7 percent to $85.39 in mid-afternoon trading, declined to comment on the Catamaran deal but said its business model was differentiated and in demand.IMPACTING INSURERS The shifting competitive landscape could mean more changes for Humana Inc, which manages pharmacy benefits for Medicare, Skolnick said. Humana had been reviewing the possible sale of that business, but ultimately decided to keep it. The purchase will make Humana the fourth largest pharmacy benefit manager, and it could make sense for Humana to invest in that business, grow the commercial pharmacy business and add more covered customers, she said.Other insurers will be reviewing where they stand now against UnitedHealth. Anthem, Aetna and Cigna have inked deals in recent years where they turned to Express Scripts, CVS and Catamaran respectively to manage their pharmacy benefits and get better prices, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte explained.""In some ways the deal could catalyze more consolidation,"" Gupte said, adding that insurers would face pressure to bulk up.

49,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to Express  Scripts Holding Co.'s (NASDAQ: ESRX) new $7.5 billion bank facility. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. Proceeds will be used to refinance the current bank facility and to fund a $5.5  billion accelerated share repurchase program. ESRX repaid $1 billion of notes  that matured in February 2015 and is expected to repay $500 million of notes  maturing in September 2015. The new bank facility comprises a five-year $2  billion revolver, a two-year $2.5 billion term loan A, and a five-year $3  billion term loan A. ESRX's share repurchase and issuance plans are roughly in line with Fitch's  forecasts underlying the March 30, 2015 ratings affirmation. No further share  repurchases are expected in 2015. Fitch continues to expect that ESRX will  target maintenance of gross debt/EBITDA of around 2x. Fitch expects the majority of 2015 FCF (Fitch forecasts $4.5 billion) to be used  to repay amounts borrowed under the revolver and the two-year term loan. Total  debt is expected approximate $15 billion at Dec. 31, 2015, yielding gross  debt/EBITDA of 2.1x. KEY RATING DRIVERS Market-Leading Scale: ESRX is the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) and  third-largest pharmacy operator in the U.S. Fitch expects such scale to continue  enabling ESRX to negotiate favorable purchasing discounts and pricing rebates  and to leverage its fixed costs associated especially with mail-order pharmacy. Robust Cash Flows: Despite relatively low margins, stable and robust cash flows  are driven by excellent working capital management and very efficient  operations. Strong cash flows and a solid liquidity profile afford good ratings  flexibility at current ratings in the event of leveraging M&A. Historically an Active Acquirer: ESRX has been an active acquirer over the past  decade, often employing large debt balances to fund deals. The possibility for  large-scale M&A and accompanying leverage spikes, albeit lower now given ESRX's  very large size, pressure the ratings somewhat. Notably, the firm has routinely  executed on its outlined de-leveraging plans, reducing leverage appropriately  within 12-18 months of each deal. Increasing Competition, Consolidation: ESRX may experience some pricing pressure  from new contracts and consolidating clients and competitors, including the  announced merger of Catamaran Corp. and UnitedHealth's OptumRx, over the ratings  horizon. Current trends supporting consolidation and alignment in many areas of  healthcare are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Weak N-T, Better L-T Growth: ESRX's 2015 guidance for down to slightly flat  adjusted script growth is better than 2014, but still weak. Nevertheless, Fitch  believes ESRX's longer-term growth will fare more positively as the firm's  leading scale benefits from reform tailwinds, specialty market growth,  demographics, and ongoing cost containment efforts by payers leading to growing  PBM volumes and utilization of more value-add services. RATING SENSITIVITIES ESRX has good flexibility at its current 'BBB' ratings, which contemplate gross  debt/EBITDA of around 2x. Flexibility will be somewhat limited for part of 2015  as FCF is used to repay newly issued term loans, but is generally afforded by a  robust cash flow profile and steady industry demand. Positive rating actions could accompany a shift in Fitch's expectations that  ESRX would use its ample FCF to reduce its debt load, rather than to fund  shareholder payments, such that run-rate gross debt/EBITDA was maintained around  1.5x. Current cash generation is more than sufficient to operate with debt  leverage lower than management's 2x target over the ratings horizon. A downgrade could be driven by the prioritization of cash flows for  shareholder-friendly activities over debt repayment in the event of large-scale  M&A or operational stress, resulting in debt leverage materially and durably  above 2x. A possible stress scenario envisions the possibility of prolonged  negative underlying script growth, possibly due to additional customer losses  more severe than Fitch currently expects. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Relatively flat script and top-line growth in 2015, with modest positive  growth in 2016; --Modest EBITDA margin expansion in 2015, resulting from gross margin  compression offset by decreasing SG&A;  --Total debt of $18 billion, pro forma for the new bank facility, trending to  $15 billion by year-end 2015. Generally steady debt levels on modestly growing  EBITDA resulting in gross debt/EBITDA around 2.0x over the forecast period; --Strong FCF of around $4.5 billion in 2015, mostly directed toward the  repayment of the new term loans and revolver borrowings used to fund the $5.5  billion ASR program. FCF used for shareholder payouts over debt repayment, in  lieu of strategic M&A, over the forecast period. Fitch rates ESRX as follows: Express Scripts Holding Company --Long-term IDR 'BBB'; --Unsecured bank facility 'BBB'; --Unsecured notes 'BBB'. Express Scripts, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'BBB'; --Unsecured notes 'BBB'. Medco Health Solutions, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'BBB'; --Unsecured notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

""Cancer is different than any other disease, much more emotional."" Miller said his company, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, plans incremental moves and new tools to control cancer-drug costs.Express Scripts has been able to wrest price discounts of 40 percent or more from makers of costly new hepatitis C drugs that virtually guarantee a cure for the liver-destroying disease, including Gilead Sciences Inc's $1,000-a-pill Sovaldi and AbbVie's Viekira Pak. Some new cancer drugs are even more expensive, perhaps most notably Amgen Inc's Blincyto treatment for a deadly form of leukemia that carries a $178,000 pricetag for two courses of treatment. The drug was approved by U.S. regulators in December. Not far behind in cost are a crop of recently approved  immuno-oncology drugs, which work by harnessing the immune system. They include Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Yervoy treatment for melanoma, which commands about $120,000 for a complete course of four infusions, and Merck & Co's new Keytruda melanoma drug, which costs $150,000 for a year of treatment.

U.S. regulators last Friday approved the first of the new medicines, Praluent, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA. Given every other week by injection, Regeneron said it will have a wholesale price of $1,120 for a 28-day supply. That comes to almost $15,000 a year.Standard older cholesterol fighters such as statins, including generic forms of Pfizer Inc's Lipitor and Merck & Co's Zocor, can cost less than $50 a month.A rival treatment from Amgen Inc, called Repatha, is expected to gain U.S. approval next month. The new drugs work by blocking the protein PCSK9, whose natural function is to prevent ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from being removed from the bloodstream.Express Scripts, which administers drug benefits for employers and health plans and also runs large mail-order pharmacies, has been challenging the rising cost of new medications. ""While these drugs are being viewed as breakthroughs, they also have the potential to wreak financial havoc on clients who do not proactively manage"" their drug costs, Express Scripts President Tim Wentworth said during a conference call to discuss the company's quarterly earnings. Glen Stettin, a senior Express Scripts executive, said an estimated 70 million Americans have high cholesterol. He estimates fewer than 10 percent of them should qualify for Praluent, based on restrictions from the Food and Drug Administration, which limited the drug's use mostly to patients with a hereditary form of high cholesterol and people with cardiovascular disease. ""The big worry for our clients, given the cost of these drugs, is whether they will be used beyond ways they were tested,"" Stettin said.Before getting their prescriptions filled, patients in Express Scripts plans will be asked for documentation of their diagnosis, their cholesterol levels, diet and maximum tolerated statin therapy, Stettin said.     Express Scripts has become a vocal critic of highly priced medicines, including Sovaldi, an $84,000 hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences Inc. A rival treatment from AbbVie Inc was approved late last year, and Express Scripts successfully pressured both companies to lower prices. Similarly, Stettin said the expected approval of Amgen's cholesterol fighter, Repatha, should help Express Scripts push for lower prices on both drugs.""We love competition because we know we can leverage that,"" Stettin said. He declined to estimate how big the discounts might be.Officials at Regeneron were not available to comment.

62,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK, July 31  NEW YORK, July 31 Express Scripts Holding Corp , the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, said on Friday that it would exclude about 20 new medications in 2016 from insurance coverage, including two diabetes drugs and a weight loss drug.For the past several years, Express Scripts has been excluding medicines from its coverage list, a reflection of concern about cost to its health insurers and corporate customers, it says. The 2016 list includes 80 drugs or medical items.Express Scripts said it can negotiate lower drug prices when it excluding drugs from its coverage list, which determines whether tens of millions of people with private insurance can easily use an insurance co-pay to buy their medicine. One of the drugs Express Scripts is excluding for 2016 is AstraZeneca Plc diabetes treatment Onglyza, which had sales of $391 million in the first half of 2015. AstraZeneca was not immediately available for comment. It also said it would exclude Qysmia, a weight loss drug made by Vivus Inc. Vivus has struggled to gain insurer reimbursement for the drug and on Thursday said it would cut about 60 jobs as part of a restructuring. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment.The 2016 formulary continues to exclude Gilead Sciences Corp's pricey hepatitis C treatments Harvoni and Sovaldi in favor of its nearest competitor, AbbVie Inc's  Viekera Pak. Sovaldi set off the debate about expensive drugs in 2014 with its $1,000-per-pill regimen. Express Scripts said earlier this week that it would cover the industry's latest pricey and innovative new drug, Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc's and Sanofi SA's Praluent to treat high cholesterol. Later this year, once a competing drug from Amgen Inc is approved, its pharmacy committee will review if it will add both drugs to its formulary.Express Scripts added back about 10 drugs that had been cut from the list in 2015, saying it negotiated better prices with their manufacturers.

65,"   By Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO The world's largest retailer has a drug problem.Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Tuesday that lower margins in its pharmacy business had emerged as a drag on profits, as it gets paid less by drug plan managers and as fewer customers pay in cash, since Obamacare has increased the ranks of insured Americans. The company warned that the margin squeeze would continue for at least the remainder of the year, although a spokesman told Reuters the pharmacy business is profitable and that Wal-Mart has no plans to sell it or find a partner to share the risk.The disclosure comes as retailers weigh the merit of running drugstores on their own. In June, Wal-Mart rival Target Corp (TGT.N) agreed to sell its loss-making pharmacy division to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) in a deal that will see CVS operate the pharmacies in 1,600 Target stores.""We feel the decision we've made to run our own pharmacies is right for our business and shareholders,"" spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Tuesday. Wal-Mart said its margins were being pinched by two factors: reduced reimbursement rates from pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which administer drug plans for employers and insurers, as well as a drop in high-margin cash transactions.Wal-Mart lowered its full year earnings-per-share forecast to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 from $4.70 to $5.05. The new forecast includes an 11 cent hit from lower pharmacy margins and other ""unplanned headwinds"" such as an increase in in-store theft.On an earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said the pharmacy margins were falling due to lower reimbursement on ""some of the main drugs"", without offering further details. Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said it is likely that Wal-Mart just concluded contract negotiations with a major PBM, such as Express Scripts Holding Corp or CVS, that resulted in lower rates. The trend was for lower rates, reflecting pressure on the healthcare industry overall to lower costs, he said. No one at CVS could be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for Express Scripts declined to comment.The drop-off in cash transactions was likely due to more Wal-Mart customers being insured on the back of the Affordable Care Act, Muken said. That hurts margins because managed plans can negotiate lower prices than an individual who pays cash. PBMs, which manage pharmacy benefits on behalf of employers and healthcare plans, over the past decade or so have consolidated into three main players - Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth Group. The government has blessed these mergers as one way to help rein in healthcare costs, since the big companies have tremendous negotiating power, said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj. Wal-Mart's pharmacy generates $19 billion a year in annual revenue, according to Evercore. That ranks as one of the largest drugstores in the United States, but Wal-Mart is still no match for the clout held by the top three PBMs, which collectively process about 70 percent of all prescriptions in the U.S., Lekraj said. ""With that kind of power they have in hand, they can dictate what pricing is going to be for the most part,"" Lekraj said.

The products each cost more than $14,000 a year and are meant for patients with a hereditary form of high cholesterol and those with cardiovascular disease. Before getting their prescriptions filled, patients in Express Scripts plans are asked for documentation of their diagnosis, their cholesterol levels, diet and whether they are already taking maximum levels of standard cholesterol treatments called statins, which include Pfizer Inc's Lipitor.Neville predicted the number of rejected prescriptions for Praluent and Repatha will eventually drop sharply as doctors prescribe them more narrowly. Express Scripts, which administers drug benefits for employers and health plans and also runs large mail-order pharmacies, in July said Praluent and Repatha are viewed as breakthrough medicines but could wreak financial havoc on its clients.But Neville, speaking on the sidelines of the PSA Pharmaceutical Strategy Conference in New York, said sales of the drugs have been at the low end of its expectations.""We feel very confident we can manage this and this won't mess up our clients' budgets in 2016.""

The termination of the deal became effective as of Oct. 7, Saratoga said in a stock exchange filing on Friday.In April, Saratoga had said it planned to buy a 51 percent stake in Express from Rajawali, without disclosing the deal's value. ""There were hopes that Saratoga would buy Express shares at a premium and that Saratoga can revive the financial capability of Express,"" said Adrianus Bias, senior analyst at Samuel Sekuritas. Rajawali, a plantation-to-mining conglomerate, is controlled by Indonesian tycoon Peter Sondakh.Express shares fell nearly 10 percent on Friday. Its shares have been volatile lately, dropping more than 9 percent on several days since mid-September, but rising 19.5 percent on Oct. 2.""People are selling now because the deal is off,"" said analyst Bias.

77,"  (Adds Express Scripts comment)By Bill BerkrotOct 22 U.S. health regulators on Thursday issued a warning of potential risk of serious liver injury for certain patients using AbbVie's hepatitis C treatments, Viekira Pak and Technivie, sending the drugmaker's shares down more than 10 percent.The Food and Drug Administration said AbbVie had identified cases of hepatic decompensation and liver failure in patients with liver cirrhosis who were taking the medicines.""Some of these events resulted in liver transplantation or death,"" the agency said in a posting on its website. It did not say how many deaths were reported.Shares of Gilead Sciences, which makes the top-selling rival hepatitis C treatments Sovaldi and Harvoni, rose 5.7 percent to $107.60. Shares of much smaller Enanta Pharmaceuticals, which helped develop the AbbVie drugs, plunged 40.6 percent to close at $23.90.Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund, called the liver toxicity warning a ""huge positive for Gilead."" The FDA said it is requiring AbbVie to include warnings about the risk of serious liver injury in the labels of its combination hepatitis C treatments.Since the approvals of Viekira Pak in December 2014 and Technivie in July 2015, at least 26 worldwide cases submitted to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System were considered possibly or probably related to Viekira Pak or Technivie, the agency said.""Because post-marketing events are reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between treatment and these events has not been established,"" AbbVie spokeswoman Jackie Finley said in an emailed statement. She said the Viekira Pak and Technivie package inserts have been changed to say they should not be used in patients with a type of cirrhosis, which is advanced liver damage that can be caused by hepatitis.The new information also includes a recommendation for physicians to assess evidence of liver decompensation prior to treatment and during treatment in cirrhotic patients.In most of the cases, liver injury occurred within 1 to 4 weeks of starting treatment, the FDA said, adding that some  cases occurred in patients who should not have been using the medicines. ""Patients taking these medicines should contact their health care professional immediately if they develop fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin, or light-colored stools, as these may be signs of liver injury,"" the FDA said.Gilead, which was first to market with the new treatments that virtually guarantee a cure for the serious liver disease without any of the side effects of older treatments, came under intense fire for the high price of its drugs, which were listed for about $90,000 for a course of treatment.With competition from Viekira Pak, pharmacy benefit managers were able to negotiate steep discounts by playing one drugmaker against the other. Express Scripts Holding, the largest U.S. PBM backed Viekira, while CVS Health chose to favor Gilead's drugs.Express Scripts said it will evaluate the warning ""to determine if any additional action is required, especially for those with late-stage cirrhosis requesting coverage of Viekira Pak.""The PBM said it closely reviews all new clinical evidence and is able to rapidly respond to changes in drug labeling to ensure patients are well cared for.Express Scripts shares fell 4 percent, while CVS shares rose 1 percent.

81,"  (Adds comment from Horizon Pharma, background)By Deena BeasleyNov 10 Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest U.S. manager of prescription drug plans, has removed pharmacy Linden Care from its network after finding it primarily dispensed drugs from Horizon Pharma Plc, under fire for high prices.The move, announced by Express Scripts on Tuesday, comes as big managers of prescription medicine benefits for health plans evaluate drug dispensaries after recent claims of questionable practices at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's  partner pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services.Shares of Valeant have fallen sharply since short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research claimed the drugmaker was using an undisclosed relationship with Philidor to inflate revenues. Valeant, which is also being probed for aggressive drug pricing practices in the United States, has since cut ties with Philidor and said it was investigating its practices. Express Scripts, which severed ties with Philidor late last month, is evaluating several other pharmacies that appear to be predominantly dispensing Horizon drugs, as well as other pharmacies that derive most of their volume from a single manufacturer or product, spokesman Brian Henry said in an email.Linden Care, based in Woodbury, New York, describes itself on its website as ""a leading provider of specialty pharmacy services to the pain management industry"". Ireland-based Horizon Pharma has faced criticism over prices it charges for treatments like pain reliever Duexis, a combination of two older generic drugs.Both Linden Care and Philidor are mail-order pharmacies that offer services like coordinating insurance benefits, making sure a patient has prior authorization for use of an expensive drug or securing manufacturer coverage for patient co-payments. ""The notion that Linden Care is a so-called ""captive pharmacy"" of Horizon Pharma is entirely false. At best Express Scripts is being reckless in its allegations and at worse it is intentionally attempting to mislead investors,"" Horizon said in a statement late on Tuesday.Horizon said that less than 5 percent of its net sales are from prescriptions that are filled by Linden Care and processed by Express Scripts. The latter has also filed a complaint seeking to recover around $140 million from Horizon's U.S. arm, citing the drugmaker's failure to comply with contracted rebate obligations.Pharmacy benefit managers often negotiate supply contracts with drugmakers which can include price rebates tied to a medication's eligibility for reimbursement and levels of patient co-payments.The Express Scripts lawsuit relates entirely to a previously disclosed dispute concerning a prior rebate agreement between the parties, Horizon said. ""We are still reviewing the allegations in the complaint but we believe the claims are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves,"" Horizon said in its statement on Tuesday.Officials Linden Care did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

84,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB' ratings of  Express Scripts Holding Co. and its subsidiaries (NYSE: ESRX). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions, which apply to approximately $15.6 billion of  debt at Sept. 30, 2015, follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Market-Leading Scale ESRX is the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) and third-largest pharmacy  operator in the U.S. Fitch expects such scale to continue enabling ESRX to  negotiate favorable purchasing discounts and pricing rebates and to leverage its  fixed costs associated particularly with mail-order pharmacy. Robust Cash Flows Despite relatively low margins and volume declines, stable and robust cash flows  are driven by excellent working capital management and efficient operations.  Strong cash flows and a solid liquidity profile provide flexibility at current  ratings in the event of leveraging M&A or further contract losses. Better L-T Growth Fitch believes ESRX's longer-term underlying growth will fare better as the  firm's leading scale benefits from reform tailwinds, specialty market growth,  demographics, and ongoing cost containment efforts by payers leading to growing  PBM volumes and utilization of more value-add services. Recent performance has  been weak, as contract losses have contributed to a roughly 25% decline in  adjusted claims volume compared to that of both ESRX and Medco in 2011, just  before the completion of their merger.  Increasing Competition, Client Consolidation Underlying growth and margin dynamics face the risk of pricing pressure and  possible large customer losses in light of recent large-scale payer  consolidation. The future of ESRX's contract with Anthem, its largest customer,  is at this time unknown given Anthem's currently pending acquisition of Cigna.  The deal could produce the largest health insurer in the U.S., possibly with the  scale supportive of a strategy to bring its PBM functions in-house. Historically an Active Acquirer ESRX has been an active acquirer over the past decade, often employing large  debt balances to fund deals. The possibility for large-scale M&A and  accompanying leverage spikes, albeit lower now given ESRX's very large size,  pressure the ratings somewhat. Notably, the firm has routinely executed on its  outlined de-leveraging plans, reducing leverage appropriately within 12-18  months of each deal. RATING SENSITIVITIES ESRX has decent flexibility at its current 'BBB' ratings, which contemplate  gross debt/EBITDA of around 2x. Flexibility is afforded by robust cash flows,  market share leadership, and steady industry demand.  Positive rating actions could accompany a shift in Fitch's expectations that  ESRX would use its ample free cash flow (FCF) to repay debt rather than for  shareholder payments, such that run-rate gross debt/EBITDA was maintained at  around 1.5x. Current cash generation is more than sufficient to operate with  debt leverage even lower than this target over the ratings horizon. Negative rating actions could be driven by the prioritization of cash flows for  shareholder-friendly activities over debt repayment in the event of large-scale  M&A, debt-funded share repurchase, or operational stress, resulting in debt  leverage materially and durably above 2x. A possible stress scenario envisions  customer losses more severe than Fitch currently expects without a corresponding  reduction in absolute debt balances. KEY ASSUMPTIONS -- Flat script- and top-line growth in 2015 and modest positive growth in 2016,  offset by Coventry roll-offs, due to slowing customer churn post-integration of  ESRX and Medco operations. ESRX is expected to grow at least in line with the  overall PBM market, likely in the low single digits, for the foreseeable future. -- Modest margin expansion in 2015-2016, as better profitability from specialty  drug volumes is offsetting margin pressure from new customer contracts. Margin  expansion is expected in 2016-2017 due to the ramping nature of ESRX's contracts  and SG&A rationalization post-merger. Margins will also be supported in  2015-2016 by generic conversions and growing opportunities around specialty  drugs. -- Relatively steady debt levels on a moderately growing EBITDA figure resulting  in moderate de-leveraging. We do not think ESRX really has incentive to operate  with lower debt levels, though the firm certainly could use FCF to repay debt as  it comes due. Debt leverage around 2x is expected over the ratings horizon. -- Strong FCF of $4.5 billion or more annually, driven by strong working capital  efficiency, stable and efficient operations, and the remaining impact of synergy  capture. Most FCF is expected to be used for share repurchase, in lieu of M&A.  No working capital impact is forecast given the very large day-to-day  fluctuations inherent in operating a large mail-order pharmacy. LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity, Strong Cash Flows ESRX maintains a solid liquidity profile, supported by steady and robust cash  generation. Cash and equivalents and revolver availability at Sept. 30, 2015  were approximately $438 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. Fitch considers  all cash readily available because of ESRX's revolver availability and its  negative cash conversion cycle. FCF on an LTM basis exceeded $4.5 billion.  Strong cash flows are driven by excellent working capital management and steady  and efficient operations. Well-Laddered, Manageable Maturities The firm's debt maturity schedule is well-laddered and manageable, especially  given its strong cash flow profile. No more than $4.2 billion is due in any one  year (2017), compared to annual forecast FCF of $4.5 billion to $5 billion.  Nevertheless, Fitch expects ESRX to refinance most debt maturities, thereby  growing absolute debt balances with EBITDA, in favor of directing FCF toward M&A  and shareholders. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Express Scripts Holding Company -- IDR at 'BBB'; -- Sr. unsecured bank facility at 'BBB'; -- Sr. unsecured notes at 'BBB'. Express Scripts, Inc. -- Sr. unsecured notes at 'BBB'. Medco Health Solutions, Inc. -- Sr. unsecured notes at 'BBB'. Fitch has also withdrawn the following ratings, due to the cross-guarantees  present within the capital structure providing linkage of debt issues to the IDR  assigned at Express Scripts Holding Company: Express Scripts, Inc. -- IDR 'BBB'. Medco Health Solutions, Inc. -- IDR 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Contact:  Primary Analyst Jacob Bostwick, CPA Director +1-312-368-3169 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

88,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest U.S. drug benefit manager, has improved access to a much cheaper competitor to Daraprim, an anti-infective medication that became a poster child for excessive drug pricing after its cost rose 5000 percent overnight.Express Scripts said it has added the drug's maker, compounding pharmacy Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, to its network of pharmacies and is working with doctors to make it easy for them to choose Imprimis' $1 pill instead of Daraprim at $750 a pill.Imprimis combines pyrimethamine, the chemical name for the active ingredient in Daraprim, with a form of folic acid called leucovorin.

94,"   By Susan Kelly and Caroline Humer  Anthem Inc could save $3 billion annually on drug costs from a re-pricing provision in its current contract with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co, the health insurer's chief executive officer said Tuesday.Anthem said it is working to renegotiate the contract this year to avoid overpaying for pharmaceuticals based on current market conditions. It first announced that it was going to rework the contract about two years ago, but it has not previously disclosed an estimate on the cost savings from the move. Anthem's 10-year contract with Express Scripts runs through 2019 but includes the re-pricing clause that became effective Jan. 1, Joseph Swedish, chief executive of the insurer, said in remarks at the J.P.

""This represents a substantial adjustment to drive lower care costs for our customers and improve our competitive position in the marketplace,"" Swedish said. Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the company is in full compliance with the terms of its agreement with Anthem. The contract calls for negotiations regarding a pricing review, but Anthem is not entitled to $3 billion, Henry said in an email to Reuters.Anthem conducted a market analysis to identify the potential savings, which would come primarily from lower generic drug pricing, Swedish said. ""We have seen a substantial improvement in market pricing in just the last 12 months,"" he said.  Swedish said in an interview with Reuters at the San Francisco conference this week that the company is still undecided about when and if it will sign a new contract with Express Scripts that would go into effect when the current one expires. Negotiations have picked up pace, he said, and he is hopeful about making a decision in 2016 about how to proceed.Express Scripts values its relationship with Anthem and remains committed to productive discussions regarding its relationship with the insurer, Express Scripts spokesman Henry said.

105,"   By Brenda Goh and Lee Chyen Yee | SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE  SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE Alibaba-backed YTO Express plans to go public via a 17.5 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) merger with a listed clothing maker, becoming the latest courier seeking capital market funds to stay competitive during China's e-commerce boom.China's mostly privately held express delivery firms are under pressure to spend heavily on logistics infrastructure and service upgrades to retain market share as tech firms such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd propel the country's fast-growing e-commerce market.""The (express delivery) industry has entered a phase of reorganization and upgrading,"" said Essence Securities analyst Jiang Ming.""Right now the firms aren't very different in terms of service standards. So if one wants to make upgrades, differentiate themselves, this will require large investments."" Clothing maker Dalian Dayang Trands Co Ltd said in an exchange filing on Tuesday it would buy YTO Express through an asset swap and share issue, resulting in a backdoor listing on the Shanghai bourse for the courier.Dayang Trands said it will transfer its assets to YTO Express' shareholders under the deal. As a result of the transaction, which will require regulatory approval, the shareholders will ultimately own Dayang Trands, it said. YTO did not reply to requests for comment on Wednesday.  YTO's deal follows that of rival Shentong (STO) Express, which announced a 16.9 billion yuan reverse takeover with a Shenzhen-traded valve maker in December.Such back-door listings are becoming popular due to the lengthy waiting time involved in China's initial public offering (IPO) process. STO Express is still waiting for regulatory approval and that decision could indicate whether YTO's deal will go ahead, said analyst Jiang. ""STO Express was the first ... Now other companies are frightened and are accelerating their stock market listings,"" he said.  Rival SF Express in February posted a notice in a Shenzhen newspaper saying it was being advised by CITIC Securities, China Merchants Securities and Huatai United Securities on a potential stock market listing.Also last month, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported that ZTO Express was planning an up to $1 billion IPO this year in Hong Kong.With low barriers to entry, express couriers proliferated rapidly over the past decade to more than 8,000 firms, squeezing profit margins to about 5 percent from 30 percent 10 years ago, according to analysts. The sector grew around 50 percent each year between 2010 and 2014, data from the State Post Bureau showed.  YTO, which was founded in 2000, inked net profit attributable to shareholders of 717 million yuan in 2015, down from 747 million yuan in the previous year.Alibaba and Yunfeng Capital, a fund backed by Alibaba's founder Jack Ma, own a stake in YTO Express through a strategic investment deal announced in May last year.Dayang Trands' announcement on Tuesday came after China's markets closed. The company has suspended trading in its shares since early January citing potential major asset restructuring.

109,"   By Brendan Pierson  April 19 - Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co has accused Anthem Inc of negotiating their contract in bad faith and is seeking a court order that the health insurer has no right to demand lower drug prices.The allegations, made in a filing in federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday, are in response to a lawsuit Anthem brought against Express Scripts last month seeking $13 billion in price cuts over the remaining four years of the companies' contract.Pharmacy benefit managers negotiate pharmaceutical benefits for employers and health plans and also run large mail-order pharmacies. Express Scripts said in Tuesday's filing that the contract did not require it to offer any specific price cuts, but only to negotiate in good faith.Anthem spokeswoman Leslie Porras said that Anthem believes Express Scripts' positions are baseless. ""Anthem stands behind the merits of our lawsuit,"" Porras said in a statement. Express Scripts pointed to statements made to investors last September by Anthem's chief executive, Joseph Swedish, that he expected only $2 billion to $2.8 billion in price cuts.Express Scripts said it had proposed five price cuts ""within the range"" of Swedish's projections last June, but that all were rejected, suggesting that Anthem was acting in bad faith when it brought its $13 billion lawsuit.

113,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Express Scripts Holding Co plans to introduce several benefit programs aimed at fighting high drug costs, including speeding up how quickly it moves insurer and employer customers to cheaper medicines after sudden price hikes, its chief medical officer said.Express Scripts, the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager, is discussing the changes with its customers at an annual meeting in Florida today, Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview.Last year, the sudden 5000 percent price hike by Turing Pharmaceuticals for Daraprim, an anti-infective treatment for a rare disease, caught hospitals and patients by surprise and spurred investigations and hearings in Congress. Drug pricing has since become a national issue, taken up by Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. After that, Express Scripts and its next largest competitor CVS Health found cheaper alternatives for patients, but Express said the new program will make it easier for customers to switch plans quickly. Express and CVS began several years ago trying to cut spending for customers by narrowing coverage choices and being tougher about patient authorization. This year, CVS also started a specific program to try to limit patient use of expensive dermatology drugs, like Valeant Pharmaceuticals' pricey Jublia toe fungus cream. Miller said Express Scripts planned to expand a new pricing scheme in which it pays for cancer drugs based on how well studies show they work for a particular disease. He said it was looking at other therapeutic areas, such as arthritis and inflammatory diseases for 2017. Rheumatoid arthritis drugs like AbbVie's Humira, Amgen Inc.'s Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade are among the top selling drugs in this category and have had large price increases over the years. Another therapeutic area Express Scripts is watching closely is dermititis, with two new highly-effective drugs potentially hitting the market this year, one from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. It is also working on diabetes, where it is expecting cheaper treatments to hit the market by the end of the year.

115,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK As a pharmacy benefits manager geared toward holding down prescription costs, Express Scripts would appear to be in a sweet spot with rising political and public pressure on drug prices, but its stock has struggled this year.The main culprit: a contract dispute with a major customer, Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), that burst into the open at the start of the year, putting at risk business representing an estimated 16 percent of Express Scripts' 2015 revenue.Shares of Express Scripts (ESRX.O) have fallen 13.5 percent in 2016 against a 3 percent decline for the broader S&P 500 healthcare index .SPXHC.As the lone major publicly-traded independent pharmacy benefit manager, Express Scripts also faces competitors that might be able to offer different advantages as parts of larger businesses.   At Friday's price of $75 each, shares are only 11.5 times the company's earnings estimates over the next 12 months, below their five-year average of 13.7 times, according to Thomson Reuters data. Anthem sued Express in March, seeking $13 billion in price cuts over the remaining four years of its contract. Express has accused Anthem of negotiating in bad faith, but also said it aims to keep the insurer as a customer.""This situation with Anthem is not something we can quantify, said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York. ""If we can't quantify it we’d rather not be invested in it."" The dispute comes as another pharmacy benefit manager, UnitedHealth Group's (UNH.N) OptumRx, has scored contract wins, signaling heightened competition.     ""I think the loss of Anthem is priced in,"" said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds in Rye, New York. ""What’s a little uncertain still is do other contracts leave as well?""Of its top rivals, CVS Caremark (CVS.N) also operates a massive retail pharmacy chain, while OptumRx parent UnitedHealth is one of the biggest U.S. health insurers. CVS trades at 15.2 times forward earnings, UnitedHealth at 16.4 times.""The issue we’re trying to get our arms around right now is what model works best,"" said David Heupel, healthcare analyst with Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis, which owned 720,000 Express Scripts shares as of March 31, according to Thomson Reuters data. ""Do you need to be independent or do you need to be part of something else?"" If the company, under Chief Executive Tim Wentworth, who took over in May, were to look at acquisitions that expand its services, such as managing home-infusion medicines, Jonas said that could make the shares more appealing.Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj, who has put the stock's fair value at $100, believes Anthem is most likely to stick with Express Scripts, and that the shares stand to gain as investor fears wane. The pharmacy benefit management group ""is going to be a space that benefits from what’s happening in the healthcare industry,"" Lekraj said. ""Companies that provide efficiencies and cost savings services are going to be the companies that benefit longer term.""

120,"   By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis  PharMerica Corp (PMC.N), a U.S. pharmacy manager for long-term care facilities, is exploring strategic alternatives including a potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.The move comes five years after PharMerica received an unsolicited bid from rival Omnicare Inc, which subsequently backed off from a hostile takeover after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission challenged the move on antitrust grounds.PharMerica is working with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) on a sale process that has attracted interest from private equity firms, the people said. It is not certain that the company will decide to sell itself, the people cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. PharMerica, UBS and Bank of America declined to comment. PharMerica shares jumped as much as 19 percent on the news and were up 13 percent at $25.55 in late morning on the New York Stock Exchange, boosting the company's market capitalization to $800 million.PharMerica was created in 2007 by a merger of businesses spun off from AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) and Kindred Healthcare Inc (KND.N). It provides pharmacy services, ranging from dispensing prescriptions to trying to control drug costs, to about 15 percent of U.S. nursing homes. The company's sales have been under pressure as government payers such as Medicare reduce payments for some types of care. Earlier this month, its chief financial officer, David Froesel, announced plans to retire. The company is searching for a replacement. In recent years, pharmaceutical benefits managers, such as CVS Health Corporation (CVS.N) and Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), have been buying up specialty pharmacies as part of an effort to bolster their bargaining positions with drugmakers and hold down drug costs. In 2015, CVS Health acquired Omnicare for nearly $13 billion, including debt. The same year, Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) acquired Envision Pharmaceutical Services from buyout firm TPG Capital LP for around $2 billion. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that a Canadian long-term care-oriented specialty pharmacy, Medical Pharmacies Group, is also exploring a sale.

121,"  NEW YORK, Sept 8 Express Scripts Holding , the largest manager of U.S. drug benefits, on Thursday launched a program aimed at tightening spending on drugs for pricey inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.It is the latest Express Scripts effort intended to reduce spending on prescription drugs, such as last week's announcement of a diabetes program. Early this year, Express Scripts said it was targeting a program for expensive inflammatory therapies.Drugs to treat inflammation, such as AbbVie Inc.'s  Humira and Amgen Inc.'s Enbrel, are among the top selling U.S. drugs and have more than doubled in price in the past five years. The program has two parts. Express Scripts will give refunds to clients when patients discontinue a drug within 90 days, which it says could be worth $250 million in annual savings across its customer base, which is mainly large corporations. It also said it will change its drug coverage to pit drugs directly against one another for each inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Express Scripts said this would enable more head-to-head competition. About 10 million Americans have inflammatory conditions and the average 30-day prescription costs about $3,036, according to Express Scripts.

122,"  UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N), the largest U.S. health insurer, will stop covering several brand-name drugs as of next year, reinforcing a trend of payers steering prescriptions to lower-priced options.In a bulletin seeking client feedback by Sept. 28, UnitedHealth said it is changing reimbursement terms for long-acting insulins and will no longer cover Lantus, the main insulin drug sold by Sanofi (SASY.PA).The insurer said Basaglar, a cheaper biosimilar insulin sold by Eli Lilly (LLY.N) would be covered as ""Tier 1,"" meaning the lowest out-of-pocket costs for members. Levemir, produced by Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO), will move from Tier 1 to Tier 2.CVS Health (CVS.N) made a similar move last month to drop Lantus in favor of Lilly's new biosimilar.Analysts at Jefferies said the sales impact of the United exclusion should be less than that from the CVS move, because the United plan covers around 15 million people while CVS covers 19 million. Sanofi shares fell more than 1 percent on Thursday after the news but had recovered by 1200 GMT, while Novo was down 1.3 percent. Sanofi reaffirmed its sales expectations despite the latest exclusion. A spokeswoman said the company was still targeting a decline in diabetes drug sales of 4 to 8 percent a year until 2018. ""We are disappointed with the decision. For Sanofi, it is a pity not to leave doctors a choice,"" she said. ""We had anticipated this kind of decision but we are holding discussions with other organisations in the United States to have them keep Lantus on their lists.""Biosimilars are cheaper copies of protein-based biotech drugs such as Lantus, which are no longer protected by patents. They cannot be precisely replicated like conventional chemical drugs but have been shown to be equivalent in terms of efficacy and side effects. United also said it will exclude from coverage Amgen's (AMGN.O) white blood cell-boosting drug Neupogen, in favor of Zarxio, a biosimilar sold by Novartis (NOVN.S).UnitedHealth last year bought Catamaran for $12.8 billion, making it the nation's No. 3 pharmacy benefit manager after Express Scripts Holding (ESRX.O) and Caremark, which is owned by CVS.

123,"   By Natalie Grover and Caroline Humer  Horizon Pharma Plc said it would pay pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding $65 million to settle litigation related to after-market rebates for three of its medicines.Express Scripts, the largest manager of U.S. drug benefits, in November sued Horizon for a breach of contract, seeking $166.2 million in rebates related to Duexis, Rayos and Vimovo.Horizon contested the claim and contended that Express Scripts had breached the rebate agreement.Under the settlement, both companies will be released from claims relating to the litigation without admitting any fault or wrongdoing.""We are returning the money to our clients, based on their respective rebate agreements for these Horizon drugs,"" Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry told Reuters.Rayos is a rheumatology treatment, while Duexis and Vimovo are used for pain relief. The three accounted for more than half of Horizon's net sales of $757 million in 2015. Prescription benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate drug benefits for health plans and employers and maintain a list of covered drug benefits, called a formulary, that determines which drugs patients can easily buy. They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines on the list with low co-payments.Horizon said on Thursday that it is in discussions with Express Scripts to add Duexis and Vimovo to its coverage list after removing the drugs last year. The settlement clears the path for a contract negotiation with Express Scripts, which currently accounts for about 30 percent of all covered patients in the United States, Mizuho Securities analyst Irina Koffler said.If Horizon can also contract with UnitedHealth Group Inc's Optum unit, which covers another 20 percent of lives, then the company could achieve its goal of 80-85 percent coverage on these brands, she added.Separately, Horizon said it had signed a rebate agreement with the PBM Prime Therapeutics, securing formulary status for primary care medicines Duexis, Pennsaid 2%, Vimovo and Rayos, starting Oct. 1. Last month, the drugmaker announced it had secured coverage for Duexis and Vimovo with CVS Health Corp.""Together, we estimate Prime and CVS/Caremark manage roughly 35 percent to 40 percent of national claims,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Stephan Stewart wrote in a note.

130,"   By Deena Beasley  Short seller Citron Research's Andrew Left has turned his sights on Express Scripts Holding Co, calling the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) the ""culprit behind pharmaceutical price gouging.""Shares of Express Scripts, the largest PBM in the United States, fell 6.7 percent to close at $70.75 on Nasdaq. Citron, which profits from bets that stock prices will fall, set a price target of $45 on the company's shares. (bit.ly/2gGrUhy)Express Scripts ""is Philidor of the pharma industry. @therealdonaldtrump promises to fix drug pricing? Two words: EXPRESS SCRIPTS,"" Citron tweeted on Thursday. (bit.ly/2goUtlT)President-elect Donald Trump, in a Time magazine article on Wednesday, said he would ""bring down drug prices.""""We make money when our clients save money,"" Express Scripts said in comments emailed on Thursday. ""The vast majority of rebates we negotiate go directly back to our clients.""  PBMs like Express Scripts manage prescription drug plans for employers and insurers. Philidor Rx Services, now closed, was a mail order pharmacy linked to efforts by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to steer prescriptions to its high-priced drugs. Left, during an interview on CNBC, said Express Scripts benefits from the ""opaqueness"" of drug pricing, but ""by no means am I saying that this company is a fraud."" PBMs have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies, in some cases limiting access to rival drugs in specific categories in return for discounts to list prices or rebates.Shares of Express Scripts have struggled for most of this year after a major customer, health insurer Anthem Inc, sued the company over drug rebates.Citron sparked the investigation into the relationship between Valeant and now-shuttered Philidor with a report issued in October 2015. A former Valeant executive and the former CEO of Philidor were arrested last month on charges that they engaged in a multimillion-dollar fraud and kickback scheme.Shares of drugstore operator CVS Health Corp, which has a PBM unit, fell 3 percent to close at $78.11 on the New York Stock Exchange.
