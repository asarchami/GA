0,"   By Ben Klayman | DETROIT  DETROIT Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N) on Tuesday reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on strong demand in its powertrain business, but the auto parts maker offered a forecast for the current quarter below Wall Street's expectations.""The fourth quarter itself was very good, but Delphi is looking for an unusually steep earnings ramp in 2014,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker said in a research note, calling the first-quarter forecast very weak.However, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said the weak forecast matched similar views at other auto suppliers that did not result in investors questioning full-year earnings guidance. He said the company's stock performance remains inexpensive relative to its growth.Shares in Delphi were up 67 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $59.80 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Chief Financial Officer Kevin Clark told analysts on a conference call that the company remains cautious about the pace of the improving European economy and has concerns about weakening in South America.Clark reiterated Delphi intends to further reduce its manufacturing footprint in Western Europe in 2014, bringing cash outlays related to restructuring to about $200 million. Net income in the fourth quarter more than doubled to $298 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with $136 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, Delphi earned $1.12 a share, 8 cents more than the figure analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected.Revenue rose 11 percent to $4.18 billion, above the $4.08 billion analysts had expected. Revenue grew 14 percent in Asia, 9 percent in North America and 7 percent in Europe, but fell 6 percent in South America. Profit rose 38 percent in the company's core electrical and electronic architecture business, and 20 percent in the powertrain systems unit. It also increased in the electronics and safety, and thermal systems businesses.Morgan Stanley's Shanker said the powertrain business drove the fourth-quarter outperformance versus analyst expectations.However, Delphi's forecast for the first quarter was weaker than expected. It forecast earnings before one-time items in the range of $1.04 to $1.08 a share on revenue of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion. Analysts were expecting $1.19 a share on revenue of $4.36 billion. For the full year, Delphi reiterated a forecast from last month that it expects to earn $4.70 to $4.95 a share before one-time items on revenue of $17.2 billion to $17.6 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.90 a share on revenue of $17.46 billion.The company reaffirmed that the mid-point of its earnings forecast for the year assumes that global vehicle production increases 3 percent. Regionally, Delphi expects industry production to rise about 9 percent in China, about 5 percent in South America, about 4 percent in North America and about 1 percent in Europe.That industry growth compares with expected 2014 revenue growth at the company of about 6 percent and earning per share growth of about 10 percent, Delphi said.

4,"  * New actions are unrelated to ignition switch problems* GM to take $300 mln charge in 1st qtr for all four recalls* CEO vows changes in recall procedures* Working with Delphi to double output of replacement ignition switchesBy Ben KlaymanDETROIT, March 17 General Motors Co  announced new recalls of 1.5 million vehicles on Monday and in a virtually unprecedented public admission by a GM chief executive, Mary Barra acknowledged the company fell short in catching faulty ignition switches linked to 12 deaths.""Something went wrong with our process in this instance, and terrible things happened,"" she told employees in a video message posted online. Barra said the company is changing how it handles defect investigations and recalls.In the last two months, GM has recalled more than 3.1 million vehicles in the United States and other markets. The actions started with last month's recall of more than 1.6 million vehicles for faulty ignition switches.  The latest recalls cover airbag wiring harnesses, brake parts and other components across several models.The Detroit automaker said on Monday it would take a $300 million charge in the first quarter, primarily to cover the costs related to the ignition-switch recall and the three new recalls.Barra previously apologized for GM's failure to catch the faulty ignition switches sooner. In Monday's video, she said GM is ""conducting an intense review of our internal processes and will have more developments to announce as we move forward.""The decade-long process that led to last month's ignition-switch recall of such older GM models as the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2003-2007 Saturn Ion has led to government criminal and civil investigations, congressional hearings and class-action lawsuits in the United States and Canada. All ask why GM took so long to address a problem it has said first came to its attention in 2001. Barra said on Monday that the company was working with the supplier of the ignition switches, Delphi Automotive, to add a second production line for replacement parts and that customers would receive a detailed notice by mail during the second week of April.The latest recalls cover more than 1.5 million newer crossover utility vehicles, luxury sedans and full-size vans. While there were reports of engine compartment fires in two dealer-owned Cadillac XTS sedans, the company said it has received no reports of accidents or injuries related to the three new recalls.GM said the latest recalls include 1.18 million mid-sized crossovers to repair an issue that could lead to the nondeployment of side airbags. It said it will repair the wiring harness of seat-mounted side airbags.Affected are some 2008-2009 and all 2010-2013 Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia crossovers, some 2009 and all 2010-2013 Chevrolet Traverses and some 2008-2009 and all 2010 Saturn Outlooks. Most of the vehicles were sold in the United States, but some are in Canada and Mexico.The automaker also is recalling 303,000 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans to replace plastic material in the passenger instrument panel to meet federal head-impact crash standards for unbelted passengers, a spokesman said. Affected are vans from model years 2009 through 2014 that are rated to carry up to 10,000 pounds including the vehicle's own weight, the spokesman said. Most were sold in the United States, but also in Canada, Mexico and other markets.In the XTS, a brake booster pump wiring issue can lead to overheating, melting of plastic parts and a possible engine compartment fire, the spokesman said. There were two reports of fires in unsold cars on dealer lots in June and September last year as well as two cases of melted components.Affected are 63,900 of the 2013 and 2014 luxury sedans, mostly in the United States, but also in Canada, Mexico and a small number in the Middle East, the spokesman said.CLASS ACTION  GM said the new recalls resulted from Barra's push for a comprehensive internal safety review following the ignition-switch recall.""I asked our team to redouble our efforts on our pending product reviews, bring them forward and resolve them quickly,"" Barra said in a statement on Monday.On Friday, the automaker was hit with what appeared to be the first U.S. class action related to the ignition-switch recall, as customers claimed their vehicles lost value because of the ignition switch problems. The proposed class action was filed in a Texas federal court. Other plaintiffs' lawyers say they are preparing to file similar cases in the coming days.GM shares closed 1.6 percent higher at $34.63 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Last week, the shares fell 10 percent.Analysts have called the media coverage of the ignition-switch recall and resulting sell-off of GM stock ""overdone.""""We think much is being made in the media about recent recall headlines, but in short, we believe GM is doing a good job balancing its ongoing investigation while taking steps to prevent further vehicle related incidents by proactively announcing new vehicle recalls,"" Stifel analyst James Albertine said in a research note on Monday.""There is clearly a target on GM's back, in our view, given its highly publicized government-sponsored bailout and its industry-leading market share position.""Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said the risk of market-share loss increased because the latest recalls include newer models on dealer lots.RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said the charge for the recalls worked out to less than $100 per vehicle, but the greater risk was the potential damage to GM's reputation and whether that would force the company to offer higher incentives to customers to defend its U.S. market share.",2014-03-17,DLPH,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 5:27pm EDT",UPDATE 3-GM recalls 1.5 mln more vehicles; CEO says 'terrible things happened',http://www.reuters.com//article/gm-recall-idUSL2N0ME0SH20140317?type=companyNews

Senator Claire McCaskill, who chairs a Commerce subcommittee that also intends to hold GM hearings in early April, told Reuters that ""anything is possible"" in regard to witnesses who could be called to testify, including former GM officials.Besides the congressional investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a criminal probe of GM officials, which could complicate the ability of some to testify before Congress.FOCUS NOT JUST ON GM McCaskill made it clear that federal regulators will be closely grilled in upcoming hearings.""One of my biggest focuses is on NHTSA,"" McCaskill said. ""What did they know, when did they know it, why didn't they know more?"" she added.How deeply Congress probes GM and NHTSA could depend in part on the interest level of the American public, according to consumer safety advocates.The Reuters/Ipsos poll found that auto recalls register on consumers' radar screens and that many remember safety problems that are a few years old.Forty-six percent said they knew about a major vehicle recall by GM, while 38 percent were aware of one by Toyota, which suffered sudden, unintended acceleration problems that were the subject of congressional hearings in 2010.The poll, with a sample of 1,175 Americans aged 18 and older, found that 29 percent said they were less likely to buy a GM car, with 75 percent of that group citing safety concerns. Amid the growing scrutiny by Congress of GM, two senators on Tuesday offered legislation aimed at improving the auto industry's reporting of safety problems.Democratic senators Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced a bill that would require automobile manufacturers to provide more information about fatal accidents involving their vehicles and better public access to those reports.Markey said a legislative fix was necessary after ""a massive information breakdown at NHTSA has led to deadly vehicle breakdowns on our roads.""In 2000, Congress passed a law requiring an early warning reporting system for NHTSA to catch safety defects.The two senators want to beef up that law by requiring automakers and auto equipment manufacturers to automatically submit accident reports and other documents that alert them to fatalities involving their equipment.The information would have to be publicly released, unless it is exempted from the Freedom of Information Act.Currently, the industry documents are provided to NHTSA if the federal agency requests them and are not automatically made public unless requested under FOIA, the senators said.""Timely information can save lives when it reveals lethal defects,"" Blumenthal said.(Editing by Stephen Powell and Matthew Lewis)",2014-03-25,DLPH,"Tue Mar 25, 2014 | 5:45pm EDT",Ex-GM officials could be called to testify in U.S. Congress probe,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-gm-recall-congress-idUSBREA2O1B720140325?type=companyNews

9,"  * GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles over ignition switch* California suit claims more vehicles have similar problem* California suit seeks class action status* Lawsuits say GM concealed knowledge of ignition defect   (Adds class action suit filed in California including vehicles not recalled by GM)By Jessica DyeMarch 25 A lawsuit against General Motors Co  filed this week in San Francisco seeking class action status includes plaintiffs who own cars outside GM's recall of 1.6 million vehicles.The suit claims that a wider set of GM vehicles than the company has recalled have faulty ignition switches. Chevrolet Cobalt cars made as late as 2010 had poor placement of the ignition switch that made it easier for drivers to inadvertently bump keys into the ""accessory"" position which, the suit filed by a coalition of U.S. law firms claims, renders airbags useless in a crash.Most of the vehicles GM has recalled are Cobalt cars from model years 2005 to 2007 or Saturn Ion cars from model years 2003 to 2007.A separate wrongful-death lawsuit, filed in Alabama by a former employee of Delphi Automotive, maker of ignition switches supplied to GM, claims the automaker concealed information about the ignition switch responsible for a crash that killed his daughter.That lawsuit was brought by Steve Smith in Alabama state court on Monday and names GM as a defendant, as well as Delphi which supplied the ignition switch to GM.Both lawsuits were filed on Monday. GM in February recalled 1.6 million vehicles and issued related service bulletins to dealers with suggested remedies in 2005. GM has linked the ignition switch problems to 12 deaths. The company has apologized for how it handled the recall.The suit seeking nationwide class action status involves 13 named plaintiffs from nine states and the number of plaintiffs is expected to grow, according to a statement by one of law firms involved, Grant & Eisenhofer.The Grant & Eisenhofer statement lists 10 law firms representing the plaintiffs.Both the California-filed and the Alabama-filed lawsuits claim that GM knew of problems with ignition switches on some of its vehicles as early as 2001 but failed to take the proper steps to fix the defects. A spokeswoman for Delphi did not immediately return a request for comment.GM's communications office on Tuesday declined to comment on either lawsuit.""We are recalling all of the vehicles that were manufactured with the specific ignition switch involved with this condition,"" said a GM spokesman in an emailed statement.But the lawsuit filed in San Francisco covers owners of Cobalt cars made from 2005 to 2010, beyond the scope of 2005 to 2007 model years covered in the GM recall.From 2008 to 2010, GM sold nearly 400,000 Chevrolet Cobalt cars in the United States. Model years start ahead of calendar years. GM sold more than 200,000 Cobalt cars in calendar year 2007, according to auto industry research firm Autodata. The lawsuit does not include Saturn Ions beyond the scope of the 2003 to 2007 model years recalled by GM.GM's ""own engineering documents reflect that the defects transcend just the ignition switch and also include the placement of the ignition switch"" on the steering column, according to the California-filed lawsuit.The wider lawsuit claims that GM engineers suggested one remedy that was rejected by the company that would have called for a protective covering, or shroud, around the ignition switch that would have kept a driver from forcing the key into the ""accessory"" position.DELPHI WORKER ALABAMA LAWSUIT Smith, the former Delphi employee, claimed that his daughter, Aubrey Wallace Williams, was driving a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt on a highway in Alabama when the ignition switch failed, causing the engine to shut off and turning off power in the vehicle. The car became uncontrollable and crossed into a different lane where it struck an 18-wheeler truck, the complaint said. Williams was killed instantly, it said.Smith retired about three years ago. He did not design, work on or have any other involvement with the ignition switch, according to his lawyer, Jere Beasley of the firm Beasley Allen.GM has faced a growing number of lawsuits since the recall was announced. Numerous proposed class actions have been filed by customers who say their vehicles lost value or were unusable as a result of the defect.GM has also been hit with at least one wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of three teen-age girls who were injured or killed in a 2006 accident involving a recalled 2005 Chevy Cobalt.

12,"   By Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Delphi Automotive's name does not appear on the outside of the 2.6 million vehicles recalled by General Motors Co since February, but the company is getting drawn into a mounting wave of litigation for its role in producing the faulty ignition switch that prompted the recalls.Plaintiffs have now named Delphi, one of the largest auto parts suppliers in the world, in at least two lawsuits stemming from the recall. One was filed by a former Delphi employee whose daughter was killed in a 2013 crash involving a recalled 2006 Chevy Cobalt, the other by customers who claim the ignition problems caused their cars to lose value.Delphi's legal exposure may hinge on how much control it had over decisions involving the design of the switch, and the terms of its four-year bankruptcy, which ended in 2009.While Delphi made the part, GM set the specifications and ultimately approved its use, according to documents from civil litigation and congressional investigations.Delphi spokeswoman Claudia Tapia declined to comment, except to say that the company was ""working cooperatively with GM on this matter."" The company has not yet filed responses to the two lawsuits. GM spokesman Jim Cain said that Delphi owned the intellectual property for the switch but declined to comment on questions of liability or lawsuits.The February and March recalls center on concerns that ignition switches supplied by Delphi could unexpectedly turn off engines during operation and leave airbags, power steering and power brakes inoperable.GM has linked the defect to 13 deaths and has apologized for how it handled the recall and said it is committed to helping affected customers.BANKRUPTCY SHIELD  Even though there's no doubt that Delphi made the ignition switch, the company would likely benefit from defenses that are not available to GM, which itself faces a spate of lawsuits over the recall.Like GM, Delphi went through bankruptcy and emerged in 2009 as a different legal entity. In purchasing ""old"" Delphi's assets, the new company largely shed liability for past actions. The terms of Delphi's bankruptcy asset sale preclude ""successor liability,"" meaning that the new entity would generally not assume liabilities created by its predecessor.GM went through a similar process and also has a so-called shield from certain kinds of liabilities. But Delphi's shield is stronger.GM agreed to modify the terms of its bankruptcy exit to allow ""new"" GM to assume liability for post-bankruptcy accidents involving pre-bankruptcy products.Delphi, which emerged from a four-year trip through bankruptcy just months later, did not. For Delphi, ""there's that potential that there's just no responsibility at all"" said Larry Coben, a plaintiffs' attorney with the firm Anapol Schwartz, who represented GM product liability claimants during its bankruptcy.To penetrate this shield, plaintiffs' lawyers could mount a two-pronged argument. First, they would have to convince a judge that Delphi was engaged in an ongoing cover-up of the defects, and second, that because of this cover-up, the court should invoke ""successor liability"" and allow the suits to proceed against ""new"" Delphi.LONG-TIME PARTNERS If plaintiffs can get past the bankruptcy issue, Delphi may also be able to invoke what is known as the ""component parts doctrine"" and argue that it doesn't bear the same responsibility as GM, since it only supplied the part and was not responsible for the overall vehicle. But if Delphi is found to have played a meaningful role in the design decisions, ""then they're liable,"" said Mark Geistfeld, a professor at New York University School of Law who specializes in civil litigation.Delphi began as a GM subsidiary and was spun off into an independent company in 1999. GM is Delphi's largest customer, accounting for approximately 17 percent of its net sales, according to Delphi's latest annual report.Delphi told congressional investigators that GM approved the original part in 2002, despite the fact that it did not meet GM's own specifications, according to a memo released by the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee.During a hearing on the recall on Tuesday, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, said that both GM and Delphi engineers worked on the switch.The two companies, Blackburn said, ""have a shared responsibility and liability in this entire issue.""But that's easier said than proved in court.""Ultimately, it would be up to a jury,"" said Lance Cooper, a plaintiffs' attorney from Georgia who is involved in litigation against GM. ""If Delphi makes the switch and they know it's a bad switch, they could point the finger at GM, but that's not going to keep them out of a courtroom.""(Reporting by Jessica Dye; Editing by Eric Effron and Peter Henderson)",2014-04-03,DLPH,"Thu Apr 3, 2014 | 7:34am EDT","Despite hurdles, Delphi's liability in GM recall could be tested",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-gm-recall-delphi-analysis-idUSBREA320BZ20140403?type=companyNews

17,"  (Adds CEO comments on suspended engineers, lawmakers letter to Delphi)By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK, April 15 General Motors Co  Chief Executive Mary Barra said she ""agonized"" over last week's decision to put two GM engineers on paid leave pending the outcome of an investigation into faulty ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths.Barra's comments, made to reporters on Tuesday after an industry conference ahead of the New York Auto Show, referred to Ray DeGiorgio and Gary Altman, two engineers involved in the development of the defective switches, which are being replaced in 2.6 million recalled GM vehicles.""There was a lot of attention, and we agonized over that decision, but we felt it was right for the individuals and right for the company at this time,"" she said of DeGiorgio, who designed the switch, and Altman, who was the program engineering manager for the recalled cars.GM has not explained why the men were suspended, and the two have not responded to Reuters requests for comment. In the wake of the recall, announced in several waves in February and March, Barra said on Tuesday that GM is creating a new global product integrity organization that will focus on product safety and quality. It will report to Jeff Boyer, who was named the chief of vehicle safety in mid-March, and Mark Reuss, GM's global product development chief.""This new way of developing vehicles will provide the highest levels of safety, quality, and customer service, and ensure that a situation like the ignition-switch recall doesn't happen again,"" Barra said in New York. The automaker is on track to complete its own investigation of the recall by the middle to the end of May, Barra said. The internal probe is being headed by Anton Valukas, chief executive of Chicago law firm Jenner & Block, which has done legal work for GM for more than 10 years.""When Mr. Valukas has completed his investigation, we will then take the appropriate actions and then, as I've said, we will be transparent. So that's where we're at,"" Barra said.Congress also is investigating the recall, and a group of U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday wrote to Delphi Automotive, asking whether the parts maker had pushed back when the automaker apparently did not accept a proposed fix to the ignition switch. Barra said a team at GM is working around the clock to answer questions asked by the U.S. National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration on the ignition switch defect issue.Last week, NHTSA said GM did not answer more than a third of the 107 questions the safety regulator asked. GM faces a $7,000-per-day fine since the April 3 deadline for not responding to all questions.She said GM may wait for the completion of Valukas' investigation before answering some of NHTSA's questions.Barra spoke at an auto industry conference held by the National Automobile Dealers Association and J.D.

There are many potential reasons an engine could stall, and most of the complaints do not specify ignition switch issues. Some referred to the engine stopping when hitting a bump, which can be a switch-related problem in recalled vehicles.The driver of a 2003 CTS, in a complaint filed in April 2014, described an incident in February 2006 where the engine would shut down ""when the vehicle would hit a pot hole or hard bump.""The same driver, after hearing recent reports of ignition switches being jostled or bumped off in other GM cars, said, ""I went out to my vehicle and started it, put the vehicle in drive and smacked my key ring and the vehicle stalled.""In a complaint received in 2004 about engines stalling in the 2004 SRX crossover, another driver said that the vehicle ""goes from 65 mph to 0 (and) you have no control over the car at this point.""The complaint database does not include names or contact information.

Delphi supplied the GM-designed switches for all of those models.The documents are the first indication that GM's luxury Cadillac brand experienced ignition-switch problems similar to those that triggered the recall earlier this year of 2.6 million GM compacts, including the Cobalt and Ion.GM did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.The Delphi documents, released on Wednesday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, also may indicate that earlier versions of the Cadillac SRX, from model years 2004-2006, used a switch part from the 2003 Ion. One document says the SRX ""in the beginning of the program"" used switch parts from ""Delta"" vehicles, the code name for the GM small-car family that includes the Ion and Cobalt. The original SRX ignition switch part also was used in the 2003-2007 Cadillac CTS sedan, according to online GM parts catalogs reviewed by Reuters. Delphi told NHTSA that it supplied the switches for the 2003-2007 CTS and the 2004-2009 SRX.The Delphi documents did not make clear whether earlier versions of the Cadillac SRX had ignition switch issues. Neither the SRX nor the CTS has been recalled for ignition-switch related issues. GM did not immediately respond to request for comments.The original Cadillac ignition switch and the original Saturn ignition switch carry similar GM part numbers: 12450257 for the 2004-2006 SRX and 12450250 for the 2003-2006 Ion.GM requested a change to the Cadillac SRX ignition switch in early 2006, months before the relatively unchanged 2007 SRX went into production, because ""test drivers (were) turning off the car with their knees while driving,"" Delphi told NHTSA. GM engineers experienced similar issues in the Ion and Cobalt, but several times rejected design changes to the ignition switch until 2006.The Ion and Cobalt were not recalled until 2014, despite NHTSA receiving hundreds of consumer complaints over the past decade about engines stalling in those cars.GM sold far fewer of the Cadillacs -- just over 200,000 CTS sedans and nearly 60,000 SRX crossovers from 2002-2005. NHTSA received at least a dozen complaints about engines suddenly stalling in the 2003 CTS and another nine complaints about engines stalling in the 2004 SRX, a Reuters review of NHTSA complaint data show.There are many potential reasons an engine could stall, and most of the complaints do not specify ignition switch issues. Some referred to the engine stopping when hitting a bump, which can be a switch-related problem in recalled vehicles.The driver of a 2003 CTS, in a complaint filed in April 2014, described an incident in February 2006 where the engine would shut down ""when the vehicle would hit a pot hole or hard bump.""The same driver, after hearing recent reports of ignition switches being jostled or bumped off in other GM cars, said, ""I went out to my vehicle and started it, put the vehicle in drive and smacked my key ring and the vehicle stalled.""In a complaint received in 2004 about engines stalling in the 2004 SRX crossover, another driver said that the vehicle ""goes from 65 mph to 0 (and) you have no control over the car at this point.""The complaint database does not include names or contact information. NHTSA did not respond to a request for comment on the Cadillac switch or consumer complaints.

27,"  (Adds GM comment)By Jessica DyeNEW YORK, June 9 A federal judicial panel ruled on Monday that lawsuits against General Motors Co from customers who say they suffered economic damages from a recall over faulty ignition switches will be heard in New York.The cases will be sent to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in the Southern District of New York, according to the ruling from the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, which considers requests to consolidate related lawsuits in U.S. federal courts.More than 80 lawsuits have been filed by customers who allege that their cars lost value as a result of the recall, which began in February. GM had asked that the cases be consolidated and transferred to New York, the same district in which it filed for bankruptcy and emerged from it in 2009. GM is asking the federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan to determine whether claims brought by plaintiffs over the recall are blocked by the terms of its bankruptcy sale order, which created ""new GM"" and largely barred liability against the new company for the pre-bankruptcy conduct of ""old GM.""The order does not affect lawsuits over personal injuries or deaths alleged to have been caused by the vehicles.Plaintiffs' lawyers suing the company had also asked that the cases be consolidated but disagreed on where. The forums they suggested were Los Angeles - where litigation against Toyota Motor Corp over acceleration issues was transferred - as well as Miami, New Orleans, San Francisco and Texas. In its order on Monday, the panel said that the Manhattan district was the most appropriate choice, since it was the same district that handled GM's bankruptcy, as well as the bankruptcy of Delphi Automotive Plc, a GM supplier that made the switch at issue. Delphi has been named a defendant in some of the cases.Several judges in New York, including Furman, ""have some familiarity with the common defendant and its prior bankruptcy proceedings,"" the panel wrote. The panel, which travels around the country, heard oral arguments on the request in Chicago.Greg Martin, a GM spokesman, said via email that the order affirmed the company's belief that the New York court is the most appropriate venue for the cases.An attorney for some of the plaintiffs, Steve Berman, said in an email that he was ""happy to be (in New York), as we hear this judge is terrific.""A representative for Delphi did not immediately respond to requests by email for comment.

33,"  * ZF Friedrichshafen in talks with rival TRW* Size of deal makes counterbid unlikely -bankers* Successful takeover could prompt disposals* Auto suppliers eye driver-assistance marketBy Arno Schuetze and Andreas CremerFRANKFURT/BERLIN, July 11 German car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen's takeover offer for rival TRW  looks unlikely to draw rival bids for the U.S. company but could trigger further deals down the line, bankers and analysts said on Friday.Privately held ZF, a powertrain and chassis specialist, said on Thursday that it was in early talks to buy TRW in a deal that would create one of the world's biggest component makers with combined revenue of $40 billion.The deal would expand ZF's mechanics-heavy portfolio to include airbags, collision sensors and other electronics with possible applications in self-driving cars - an area where investment is booming to reflect potentially high returns.In a statement confirming the ""preliminary, non-binding"" approach, TRW said on Thursday that its board was also evaluating ""other strategic alternatives which may enhance stockholder value"".Both companies have declined to comment further and neither disclosed financial details of the tentative bid for TRW, which has a market capitalisation of $11 billion. However, the size of the deal makes counter-bids by groups such as Continental, Delphi or Magna  unlikely, several automotive investment bankers said on Friday.""It's just too big, and for those who could shoulder it, it's too pricey,"" said one banker, adding that rival suppliers may focus instead on potential acquisitions among busineses that could be sold by the merging companies.Antitrust concerns may force the sale of steering systems assets, a source close to one of the companies said.Rival suppliers Magna, Continental, Delphi and Autoliv declined to comment or did not return calls and messages left with their press officials.Continental would see TRW as a poor fit for its business, said a person with knowledge of the company's thinking. Some analysts, meanwhile, believe that a ZF-TRW deal would focus the thinking of rivals anxious not to be left behind in a sector becoming increasingly fixated by autonomous driving technology and able to take advantage of an abundance of potential buyout cash thanks to low interest rates.'SHAKE-UP POSSIBLE' ""Suppliers that depend on the combustion engine need to look for new business opportunities, and autonomous driving implies great future potential,"" said Bjoern Voss of M.M. Warburg. ""A shake-up of the industry is possible.""Increasing safety requirements and demand for driver-assistanace systems such as adaptive cruise control are already boosting electronics as a share of vehicle content. The driver-assistance market is set to expand almost six-fold by the end of the decade, according to the Center of Automotive Management, a German industry think-tank.Besides technology giant Google, carmakers at the forefront of self-driving car development include existing ZF clients BMW  and Mercedes-Benz.""It's a sound strategic move by ZF,"" Frankfurt-based Commerzbank analyst Sascha Gommel said. ""They're positioning themselves in a lucrative future market.""Banks have entered talks with ZF about supplying loans for its acquisition, a person familiar with the matter said.""ZF should be able to secure loans of up to 10 billion euros,"" said another automotive banker not directly involved.TRW, which counts General Motors, VW and almost all other major auto makers among its clients, has increased sales by half since 2009 to $17.4 billion last year.Combining with ZF's 16.8 billion euros ($23 billion) in revenue would create a pairing to rival Japan's Denso Corp , the world's biggest supplier with $35.8 billion in 2013 auto-parts sales.""It's too soon to know if this deal will come to fruition, but the two companies have complementary product lines,"" IHS Automotive Analysts Tim Urquhart and Stephanie Brinley said in a note on Friday.""Given the drive towards electric assistance for driving systems and self-driving cars, the combination of expertise could make for a powerful automotive supplier.""

""Claire will be posing some tough questions that haven't yet been answered about the role GM's legal department played in delaying this recall,"" said Andy Newbold, spokesman for McCaskill.In his prepared testimony, Millikin said GM has appointed an outside law firm to review its litigation practices.Millikin and other top GM executives were largely exonerated in an internal investigation that GM hired lawyer Anton Valukas to conduct and that was released last month. Instead, Valukas blamed lower-level lawyers and engineers for failing to properly flag the issue and not connecting air bag failures to the ignition switch defect.Lower-level lawyers were among the 15 employees that GM forced out over the scandal. Millikin said in his prepared testimony that he did not learn of the extent of the specific defect until February of this year. So far, GM has attributed 13 deaths and 54 crashes to the specific defect, in which the ignition switch can slip from the ""run"" to the ""accessory"" position, causing the engine to stall, air bags to not deploy, and a loss of power brakes and power steering.GM this week started running full-page advertisements in newspapers across the United States advising consumers that the ""key to safety"" in operating the recalled vehicles is to use a single key, with no other items on the key ring, until repairs can be completed.It is the first time GM has run an ad related to the ignition switch defect, the company said, adding it is intended to raise awareness among affected consumers.

Lawmakers have credited the manufacturer with proposing a fix to the switch in 2005 that GM did not immediately adopt.Also, the Justice Department is not targeting Delphi in its criminal probe of GM's handling of the safety defect, according to sources familiar with the investigation. A House committee aide said last week that Delphi submitted about 7,500 pages of documents in the probe and that the company is continuing to produce more documents.Appearing along with Millikin and O'Neal on Thursday will be Barra, Valukas, and Kenneth Feinberg, a prominent lawyer helping GM establish a victims' compensation fund.Feinberg may be questioned about whether the death toll will rise as he starts reviewing claims.The hearing may also explore the legislative response to the safety scandal.

""The macro environment in South America just continues to deteriorate,"" Chief Executive Rodney O'Neal said on a conference call.Delphi expects a third-quarter profit excluding one-time items of $1.10 to $1.18 a share on revenue of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expect profit and revenue at the higher end of those ranges, at $1.17 a share on revenue of $4.32 billion.Net income in the second quarter rose 4 percent to $382 million, or $1.26 a share, compared with $367 million, or $1.17 a share, in the year-ago quarter.Excluding one-time items, Delphi earned $1.42 a share, topping the $1.33 per share expectation of analysts. Still, Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker said it was a ""low quality"" beat and results were ""tepid."" He said Delphi's operations were mostly in line, and results were helped by lower interest expense, tax rate and share count.  Revenue rose 5 percent to $4.45 billion, compared with the $4.47 billion Wall Street had forecast.     Shares were down 0.4 percent at $67.31 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Aside from the decline in South America, Delphi's revenue in Asia and North America grew 13 percent and 7 percent, respectively, while Europe was flat.  The company's planned cost cuts in South America, which makes up about 5 percent of total revenue, will include ""fairly significant"" job cuts, especially in Brazil, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Clark said.For the year, Delphi now expects earnings before one-time items in the range of $4.95 to $5.10 a share on revenue of $17.2 billion to $17.6 billion. Clark said the company does not expect to top the mid-point of its revenue forecast.It previously forecast earnings in a slightly lower range of $4.80 to $5.00 a share, though the revenue outlook is unchanged. Analysts expect $5.01 a share on revenue of $17.5 billion.

44,"  Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N) said it would ""vigorously contest"" pressure by U.S. tax authorities to file taxes in the United States as a domestic company, when its tax base is in the UK. Delphi, which operates out of Detroit, is one among several American companies locked in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service over the use of offshore tax shelters. Mylan Inc (MYL.O) said on Thursday it would go ahead with the purchase of some non-U.S. businesses from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) despite the political opposition to tax-inversion deals. The IRS told Delphi in June that it would be taxed as a U.S. company due to the sale of its assets to Delphi Holdings LLP after it emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, Delphi said in a regulatory filing on July 31. (bit.ly/V7AVo3)Delphi said it was reincorporated in the UK as a limited liability partnership, which allows it to save tax. The company said it had filed U.S. federal partnership tax returns between 2009 and 2011.  ""We will continue to prepare and file our financial statements on the basis that neither Delphi Automotive LLP nor Delphi Automotive Plc is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,"" the company said in the filing.U.S. President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats have proposed measures to stem the flow of so-called ""inversions"". The IRS contends that U.S.-based companies operating globally are manipulating tax laws.  Under the U.S. tax code, domestic companies must pay tax on total global income, including income generated in other countries. The workaround for companies is to incorporate in those countries.Earlier, companies chose Caribbean Islands or Switzerland to set up their tax bases, but Britain is becoming increasingly attractive to companies after the country changed its laws to keep profits reported in other countries out of its tax ambit. Delphi has also been in the news in recent months because it supplied to General Motors Co (GM.N) the defective ignition switches that were linked to at least 13 deaths. Delphi's shares were up about 1 percent at $67.87 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

47,"  (Adds detail on Delphi's role in GM ignition switch recall, updates stock price in last paragraph)By Sagarika Jaisinghani and Paul LienertSept 9 Delphi Automotive Plc Chief Executive Officer Rodney O'Neal will retire in March and Chief Financial Officer Kevin Clark will succeed him, the auto parts maker announced on Tuesday.The company named Clark as chief operating officer effective Oct. 1. Delphi also said Praxair Inc executive Mark Murphy would join the company in October, succeeding Clark as CFO. Praxair supplies industrial gases.O'Neal is leaving one of the world's largest auto parts manufacturers. Delphi started out as a subsidiary of General Motors Co before being spun off in 1999, but continues to be closely associated with the Detroit automaker. This year, Delphi became embroiled in GM's safety crisis after it was disclosed that Delphi provided ignition switches for a number of older GM cars linked to at least 13 deaths.In July, O'Neal told a U.S. Senate committee hearing that the automaker was responsible for designing and approving switches that later proved defective. Delphi has been producing replacement switches for more than 2 million GM cars that were recalled earlier this year.The parts maker is a defendant in several lawsuits filed against GM over the defective switches and said it is cooperating with government officials investigating the parts. O'Neal, 61, began his career as an engineering student at General Motors Institute and held a variety of managerial positions at GM. He was named head of GM's Delphi Interior Systems unit in 1997, two years before GM spun off Delphi.Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2005, when O'Neal was named president and chief operating officer. He became CEO in January 2007.Since the company underwent bankruptcy reorganization and held an initial public offering in 2011, its market capitalization has more than tripled, to $21.4 billion. Its shares were up 30 cents, or 0.42 percent, at $71.71 in late morning trading.

56,"  (Adds comment from lead counsel for complainants)NEW YORK Nov 9 General Motors Co ordered half a million replacement ignition switches almost two months before it alerted federal safety regulators of the issues that prompted a recall of millions of vehicles, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing email exchanges between the automaker and its supplier Delphi Automotive Plc.The email exchanges, which took place in mid-December 2013 between a GM contract worker and Delphi, indicate GM placed an ""urgent"" order for 500,000 replacement switches on Dec. 18, a day after a meeting of senior executives, the newspaper said. GM announced its recall in February 2014. (on.wsj.com/142qQhn)Representatives for GM and Delphi Automotive did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the matter. ""This is simply mind-blowing in its raw evilness,"" said Bob Hilliard, lead counsel for the personal injury and wrongful death plaintiffs in the Federal Multi District Litigation against General Motors. ""GM should have notified its customers immediately to take all weight off of their keychains. By the time GM actually ordered these parts, it had to have already spent months making the decision to place the order,"" Hilliard said in a statement.GM has faced criticism for waiting 11 years to begin recalling millions of cars with ignition-switch problems that have been linked to fatalities. The switch in question can slip out of position, stalling the vehicle and disabling air bags. The defect led to the recall of 2.6 million vehicles earlier this year. So far, 61 claims have been deemed eligible for compensation, including 30 deaths and 31 injuries.A federal judge in Manhattan has set Jan. 11, 2016, for the first trial in consolidated litigation against General Motors over a series of safety issues, including a faulty ignition switch.

There is concern among other bidders about what Erae might do if it does not succeed in buying the air conditioning division, another person familiar with the deal said.""Access to the Korean market is seen as key (to Delphi Thermo's future development) and it is very hard to get,"" the person said.However, some other people familiar with the deal said the Korean joint venture partner was possibly less significant a factor than bidders' expectations for how quickly Delphi Thermo can be turned around. In the first nine months of 2014, Delphi's Thermal Systems saw its gross margin rise slightly to 8.8 percent, about 10 percentage points short of margins seen at the larger electronic architecture, powertrain systems and electronics and safety.Delphi's Thermal Systems unit posted adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $80 million on sales of $1.5 billion in 2013. According to people familiar with the Delphi Thermo sale, the business is expected to post 2014 core earnings of almost $100 million and possibly significantly higher earnings in following years.It may be valued at 6-7 times its earnings, they said.Korean Halla Visteon Climate Control was also  seen as a potential buyer of Delphi Thermo. However, Visteon is in the process of selling its controlling stake in the Korean business and this may be a distraction, a person familiar with the situation said.Delphi, its advisor Barclays, Mahle and Valeo declined to comment, while Erae, Japan's Denso and Halla Visteon were not immediately available for comment.

62,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N) said sales of advanced vehicle-safety systems would jump 50 percent annually for the next several years, sending the auto supplier's shares up to a record high Thursday.The outlook by once-bankrupt Delphi highlights a shift among big auto suppliers to the design of software-powered vehicle systems from the manufacture of mechanical parts.Advanced safety systems include collision-avoidance technology and semi-automated control of braking, steering and other vehicle functions. Delphi said its new business was with large European and North American automakers and included radar and vision sensors.Kevin Clark, who will take over the reins as Delphi chief executive on March 1, said the company's advanced safety business - which it calls active safety - will surge 50 percent this year in terms of sales, from $160 million in 2014, and at the same rate for the next several years.""Software is becoming a bigger component of our product portfolio, without a doubt,"" said Clark, who is currently the company's chief operating officer, during a conference call following the release of its quarterly results. Still, Clark said the advanced safety business represented only a small part of the company's revenue, which grew 3.4 percent in 2014 to $17.02 billion, but would be key in Delphi's sales and profit margin growth for years.Clark will take over from Rodney O'Neal, who has been Delphi chief executive since January 2007. The company entered bankruptcy in 2005 and emerged from it in 2009. Delphi was spun off from General Motors (GM.N) in 1999.Shares were up 3.5 percent at $75.30 in midday trading, after earlier having risen as much as 4.3 percent to a high of $75.88.

63,"  (Adds record share price, advanced safety systems revenue forecast)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT Feb 5 Delphi Automotive Plc  said sales of advanced vehicle-safety systems would jump 50 percent annually for the next several years, sending the auto supplier's shares up to a record high Thursday.The outlook by once-bankrupt Delphi highlights a shift among big auto suppliers to the design of software-powered vehicle systems from the manufacture of mechanical parts.Advanced safety systems include collision-avoidance technology and semi-automated control of braking, steering and other vehicle functions. Delphi said its new business was with large European and North American automakers and included radar and vision sensors.Kevin Clark, who will take over the reins as Delphi chief executive on March 1, said the company's advanced safety business - which it calls active safety - will surge 50 percent this year in terms of sales, from $160 million in 2014, and at the same rate for the next several years.""Software is becoming a bigger component of our product portfolio, without a doubt,"" said Clark, who is currently the company's chief operating officer, during a conference call following the release of its quarterly results. Still, Clark said the advanced safety business represented only a small part of the company's revenue, which grew 3.4 percent in 2014 to $17.02 billion, but would be key in Delphi's sales and profit margin growth for years.Clark will take over from Rodney O'Neal, who has been Delphi chief executive since January 2007. The company entered bankruptcy in 2005 and emerged from it in 2009. Delphi was spun off from General Motors in 1999.Shares were up 3.5 percent at $75.30 in midday trading, after earlier having risen as much as 4.3 percent to a high of $75.88. Delphi's profit margins in its advanced safety business, analysts have said, could be three times the profit margins achieved in 2014 by major automakers.The company's profit margin for the fourth quarter was 12.5 percent, up from 11.3 percent a year earlier.Excluding special items, Delphi earned $1.32 per share in the quarter, beating the $1.27 per share expected on average by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

73,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO/NEW YORK, March 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Delphi Automotive  PLC's (DLPH) proposed euro-denominated issuance of 10-year senior unsecured  notes a rating of 'BBB'. The note's rating is in line with DLPH's Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of 'BBB', which has a Stable Outlook. The proposed notes will be issued by DLPH, whereas the company's existing senior  unsecured notes have been issued by Delphi Corporation (Delphi), a subsidiary of  DLPH. However, the proposed notes will be fully guaranteed on a senior unsecured  basis by the same subsidiaries that guarantee Delphi's notes and Delphi's  unsecured credit facility, removing any structural subordination that the  proposed notes would otherwise have in relation to Delphi's existing notes. Proceeds from the proposed notes will be used for general corporate purposes,  including the redemption of Delphi's existing 2021 notes. Fitch notes that the  euro-denominated issue is likely to bear substantially lower interest than the  6.125% interest on Delphi's existing 2021 notes. Also, by issuing in euros, DLPH  is better able to match its debt to its cash flows, as 38% of the company's 2014  revenue was generated in Europe, Middle East and Africa.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch recently upgraded DLPH's IDR to 'BBB' from 'BBB-', reflecting the  company's strengthening credit profile. DLPH has successfully leveraged its  market position in advanced automotive technologies and its low cost base to  drive margins and free cash flow (FCF) that are high for the auto supply  industry.  The company's focus on safety, emissions and communications technologies takes  advantage of important growth trends in the global auto industry, and Fitch  expects revenue will grow above the rate of underlying global vehicle production  over the intermediate term. The recently announced divestiture of DLPH's thermal  systems business will further focus the company's business on its higher-margin  growth segments.  Despite its significant dividends and share repurchase activities, the company  adheres to fairly conservative financial practices, including targeting leverage  at only 1.5x over the long term. Other credit strengths include a strong  liquidity position, minor pension obligations, and a manageable debt maturity  profile, all of which provide it with significant financial flexibility. Rating risks include the cyclical nature of the global auto industry, the  industry's intense competition and potentially volatile raw material costs.  Mitigating these risks are the diversification of DLPH's business across  geographies, customers and products, and its flexible operating model, which has  positioned much of the company's manufacturing capacity in low-cost countries.  Other risks include the company's acquisitive nature and its significant cash  returns to shareholders, although its strong cash position and FCF generation  suggest that most of these activities will not drive a meaningful increase in  leverage, at least not beyond its 1.5x target. With its financial flexibility,  Fitch expects DLPH would be able to perform better through an industry downturn  than the typical auto supplier. DLPH's credit profile is strong for the auto supply sector. EBITDA leverage  (debt/Fitch-calculated EBITDA) at end-2014 was only 0.9x, with USD2.5bn in debt  and full-year EBITDA of USD2.7bn. Funds from operations (FFO) adjusted gross  leverage was 1.5x at end-2014.  DLPH's liquidity position is strong, including USD904m in cash and cash  equivalents and nearly full availability on a USD1.5bn unsecured revolver at  end-2014, and it has no significant debt maturities until 2018, when the  remaining USD400m of its term loan A matures.  Fitch expects leverage to remain low, but it could rise somewhat as leverage is  currently below the company's target level. Nonetheless, Fitch expects continued  strong operating cash flow will provide DLPH with sufficient flexibility to fund  capital spending, dividends, share repurchases and potential acquisitions  without the need for significant incremental long-term borrowing. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for DLPH include: -Low- to mid-single digit global auto production growth over the intermediate  term -An increase in DLPH's penetration rates, resulting in revenue rising at a  faster rate than overall vehicle production -Capital spending equal to between 5% and 6% of revenue over the intermediate  term -Annual increases in common stock dividends -The company refinances its significant debt maturities over the intermediate  term; -The company maintains around USD1bn in cash on its balance sheet, with excess  cash used for acquisitions or share repurchases RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Given DLPH's capital allocation strategy and leverage targets, Fitch  does not anticipate an upgrade to DLPH's ratings in the intermediate term. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: -An unexpected sharp decline in global auto production -A decline in the company's EBITDA margins to below 12% -A decline in the company's FCF margin to 3% or lower for a prolonged period -An increase in EBITDA leverage to above 1.5x for an extended period DLPH's and Delphi's ratings are as follows: DLPH -IDR at 'BBB'; Stable Outlook -Senior unsecured notes rating at 'BBB' Delphi -IDR at 'BBB'; Stable Outlook -Unsecured term loan rating at 'BBB' -Unsecured revolving credit facility rating at 'BBB' -Senior unsecured notes rating at 'BBB' Contact: Primary Analyst Stephen Brown Senior Director +1-312-368-3139 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 West Madison Street Chicago, IL 60602 Secondary Analyst Craig D.

The Delphi drive will kick off March 22 near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, with plans to wind up in New York City just before the annual auto show opens there on April 3.Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, sees the automated driver assistance systems in the Audi as building blocks on the road to fully self-driving cars in the next decade.Although automakers and suppliers will have such capability within the next five years, Owens said, ""our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time"" in case of emergency situations that self-driving systems may not be equipped or programmed to handle. During the coast-to-coast journey in the Audi, at least two Delphi engineers will be aboard, including one behind the wheel.Delphi, a former General Motors Co unit domiciled in the UK, will test such functions as traffic jam assist, automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet.

76,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N) Chief Executive Kevin Clark said the company could spend $1 billion to $3 billion this year on a large acquisition related to its traditional ""hardware"" business and will make smaller investments in software.Clark said in a Thursday interview with Reuters after the company issued first-quarter earnings that ""there is a funnel of some larger transactions,"" in the range of $1 billion to about $3 billion. He referred to Delphi's core businesses that includes wire harnesses, connectors, and powertrain technology.""It's always tough to predict larger transactions like that but based on where we sit today, I would say it's greater than a 50-50 probability"" to occur in 2015, he said.Vehicle connectivity and methods to increase fuel efficiency are high-margin and high-growth areas in the automotive industry as vehicles become more autonomous and automakers strive to meet coming stringent U.S. fuel economy regulations.Clark maintained his forecast from three months ago that Delphi's active safety systems, including radar and ""visioning"" algorithms allowing vehicles to recognize objects around them, will increase 50 percent in 2015. Delphi's quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share excluding one-time items beat the $1.17 per share expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's first-quarter revenue of $3.80 billion also beat analyst expectations of $3.76 billion.Delphi forecast 2015 revenue at $15.3 billion to $15.7 billion, lower than $15.6 billion to $16 billion it predicted during an investor presentation earlier this month, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker, who attributed the drop to a weaker euro. Delphi's Chief Financial Officer Mark Murphy told analysts on a conference call that the company assumes a valuation of $1.10 for the euro, and that it would be ""more challenging"" to offset the weaker euro and meet 2015 targets below that level.

77,"  (Corrects headline, 1st paragraph to show large acquisition is in Delphi's traditional business, not software; adds sentence in 2nd paragraph to explain its core businesses)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT, April 30 Delphi Automotive Plc  Chief Executive Kevin Clark said the company could spend $1 billion to $3 billion this year on a large acquisition related to its traditional ""hardware"" business and will make smaller investments in software.Clark said in a Thursday interview with Reuters after the company issued first-quarter earnings that ""there is a funnel of some larger transactions,"" in the range of $1 billion to about $3 billion. He referred to Delphi's core businesses that includes wire harnesses, connectors, and powertrain technology.""It's always tough to predict larger transactions like that but based on where we sit today, I would say it's greater than a 50-50 probability"" to occur in 2015, he said. Vehicle connectivity and methods to increase fuel efficiency are high-margin and high-growth areas in the automotive industry as vehicles become more autonomous and automakers strive to meet coming stringent U.S. fuel economy regulations.Clark maintained his forecast from three months ago that Delphi's active safety systems, including radar and ""visioning"" algorithms allowing vehicles to recognize objects around them, will increase 50 percent in 2015.Delphi's quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share excluding one-time items beat the $1.17 per share expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's first-quarter revenue of $3.80 billion also beat analyst expectations of $3.76 billion.Delphi forecast 2015 revenue at $15.3 billion to $15.7 billion, lower than $15.6 billion to $16 billion it predicted during an investor presentation earlier this month, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker, who attributed the drop to a weaker euro. Delphi's Chief Financial Officer Mark Murphy told analysts on a conference call that the company assumes a valuation of $1.10 for the euro, and that it would be ""more challenging"" to offset the weaker euro and meet 2015 targets below that level.

Power.The 2016 U.S. Tech Choice Study found that 56 percent of Gen Y buyers - born 1977-1994 - said they trust self-driving technology, compared with 41 percent for Gen X - born 1965-1976 and 23 percent of Baby Boomers -born 1946-1964.Significantly, over one-third of Gen Y buyers would pay $3,000 or more for an automated system, the study found, without giving comparative figures for other generations. ""'Will they pay?' is always the key question,"" said Kristin Kolodge, J.D. Power's executive director of driver interaction and human machine interface (HMI) research.The survey by the marketing information firm should encourage automakers such as General Motors Co, suppliers such as Delphi Automotive Plc and tech companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google, all of which are accelerating development of self-driving cars and systems. All respondents, however, share a concern for vehicle security and safety, including the potential for advanced technology systems to be hacked or hijacked, the survey found.Consumers also balked at the projected prices on some of the underlying equipment, J.D. Power said. Lane change assist was among the top 10 tech choices, but dropped off the list when consumers saw the $1,500 price tag. Among the most popular items, based on their estimated price, were a camera-based rear-view mirror ($300), smart parking ($100) and predictive traffic ($150).With developments in driver assistance systems rapidly advancing, ""the industry is at the cusp of a mobility revolution,"" said Kolodge, ""but consumers will decide which technology choices win."" Conducted earlier this year, the online survey of nearly 8,000 vehicle owners found a higher level of trust and confidence among younger consumers in such advanced driver assistance systems as lane change assist and traffic jam assist.Those systems, which several automakers are phasing into production, are considered a foundation for fully automated vehicles that could begin appearing on U.S. roads in 2020. The level of trust in such systems ""is directly linked to the level of interest in a new technology among automobile buyers,"" said Kolodge.Reaction was also mixed to on-demand mobility services such as those offered by ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft, with younger consumers more open to the concept.There were some light moments in the survey feedback, said Kolodge, with some respondents admitting ""they are poor sharers.""

China is expected to release draft standards for self-driving cars later this year, enabling the rapid deployment of such vehicles first on highways and later on city roads.It has been slower than some other developed countries in advancing autonomous driving technology but unified regulations could give the country an edge to rapidly catch up.  Mobileye is a second-tier supplier to companies such as Delphi Automotive and Magna International which then sell its products on to automakers.It has become a major player in the autonomous driving market by selling software and hardware that is used by Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi, Tesla Motors and others.The supplier first developed its business in the United States and Europe before pushing into Japan and Korea, finding Chinese automakers initially had little interest in its products, Oberman said. But it has recently made in-roads in China, selling to three major Chinese suppliers including a subsidiary of Ningbo Joyson Electronic and building up aftermarket sales.""Even though the Chinese automakers woke up a little late (to automated driving technology), now they are charging forward very, very ferociously and I believe they will catch up and pass the rest of the world very soon,"" he said.

A cab ride in a dense urban area can cost $3 to 4 a mile, Delphi vice president of engineering Glen DeVos said in an interview. “We think we can get to 90 cents a mile” with an automated vehicle.That drops the price of transporting goods and people, and allows for the costs of automated driving systems to be spread over hours of operation and multiple users.

120,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 31 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to  Delphi Automotive PLC's (DLPH) proposed issuance of EUR500 million in senior  unsecured notes. The Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for DLPH is 'BBB', with a  Stable Outlook. The proposed notes will be fully guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the  same subsidiaries that guarantee the senior unsecured notes and unsecured credit  facility of DLPH's Delphi Corporation (Delphi) subsidiary, removing any  structural subordination concerns. Proceeds from the proposed notes will be used  fund a portion of the redemption of Delphi's $800 million in 5% senior unsecured  notes due 2023. Fitch expects the proposed notes will carry substantially lower coupons than the  existing 2023 notes, helping the company save on interest costs. The proposed  notes will also help to further diversify DLPH's capital structure. Combined  with the notes from the company's Euro-denominated issuance in 2015, DLPH will  have EUR1.2 billion in Euro-denominated notes, which Fitch estimates will  constitute over 30% of the company's consolidated debt, including  off-balance-sheet factoring. With roughly 35% of the company's revenue derived  in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, the proposed notes will  help to better match the company's capital structure with geographic  distribution of its revenue. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings of DLPH and its Delphi subsidiary reflect the company's relatively  strong credit profile, as it continues to leverage its market position in  advanced automotive technologies and its low cost base to drive margins and free  cash flow (FCF) that are high for the auto supply industry. The company's focus  on electrical architecture, safety, and advanced powertrain technologies has put  it at the forefront of important growth trends in the global auto industry.  Fitch expects DLPH's strong business position in these growth technologies will  continue to result in top-line growth exceeding the rate of underlying global  vehicle production over the intermediate term. Although the company is highly  acquisitive and deploys a substantial amount of its cash toward  shareholder-friendly activities, it also maintains relatively conservative  financial practices, including a long-term EBITDA leverage target of only 1.5x.  Additional rating drivers include the company's relatively strong liquidity  position, minor pension obligations, and a manageable debt maturity profile, all  of which continue to provide it with significant financial flexibility. Rating concerns continue to include the cyclical nature of the global auto  industry, intense industry competition, potentially volatile raw material costs,  and new entrants into the automotive technology sector. Mitigating these  concerns are the diversification of DLPH's business across geographies,  customers and products, as well as its flexible operating model, which has  positioned much of the company's manufacturing capacity in low-cost countries.  DLPH's strong supply position with most major global auto manufacturers is also  a mitigant. Other concerns include the company's interest in acquisitions and  its significant cash returns to shareholders, although its relatively strong FCF  generating capability suggests that most of these activities will not drive a  meaningful increase in long-term leverage. With its above-average financial  flexibility, Fitch also expects DLPH would be able to perform better than most  auto suppliers through an industry downturn. Fitch expects DLPH's consolidated EBITDA leverage to remain near the company's  1.5x leverage target over the longer term, but it could temporarily rise at  times when the company makes acquisitions, as it did with the 2015 acquisition  of HellermanTyton Group PLC. Nonetheless, Fitch expects strong operating cash  flow will generally provide it with sufficient flexibility to fund capital  spending, dividends, share repurchases and smaller acquisitions without the need  for significant incremental long-term borrowing. Fitch expects the company to  produce relatively strong FCF over the intermediate term, with post-dividend FCF  margins running in the mid-single-digit range. Fitch also expects DLPH to  maintain around $500 million to $600 million in cash on its balance sheet over  the intermediate term. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for DLPH include: --Low-single-digit global auto production growth over the intermediate term; --DLPH's penetration rates increase, resulting in revenue rising at a faster  rate than overall vehicle production; --Capital spending runs at about 5% of revenue over the intermediate term; --The common stock dividend rate rises over time, but total cash spent on  dividends is about flat on a reduced share count; --The company continues to make modest to moderately sized acquisitions from  time to time; --The company refinances its significant debt maturities over the intermediate  term; --The company maintains around $500 million to $600 million in cash on its  balance sheet, with excess cash used for acquisitions or share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Given DLPH's capital allocation strategy and leverage targets, Fitch  does not anticipate an upgrade to DLPH's ratings in the intermediate term. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --An unexpected sharp decline in global auto production; --A decline in the company's EBITDA margins to below 12%; --A decline in the company's free cash flow margin to 3% or lower for a  prolonged period; --An increase in EBITDA leverage to above 1.5x for an extended period. Fitch maintains the following ratings on DLPH and Delphi with a Stable Rating  Outlook: DLPH --IDR at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes rating at 'BBB'. Delphi --IDR at 'BBB'; --Unsecured term loan rating at 'BBB'; --Unsecured revolving credit facility rating at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes rating at 'BBB'.

122,"   By Alexandria Sage | MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. Google's self-driving vehicles are mastering complex situations on public roads, from cars going the wrong way to bicycles darting in front of traffic, as the technology company strives to win the high-profile race to achieve full vehicle automation, executives said on Wednesday.The Alphabet Inc unit, which has been developing autonomous cars since 2009, said its self-driving vehicles had logged two million miles (3.2 million km) on public roads, and it continues to log about 25,000 miles of test drives per week.Google has been a leader in testing autonomous vehicles on public roads, prompting traditional carmakers to step up their self-driving plans to avoid being eclipsed by the tech leader, which has yet to disclose a business strategy for its car project.The Silicon Valley-based company is focused on making cars fully autonomous, with no need for a driver, which could make driving safer and more efficient and open up transportation to the disabled and aged. It said last year that such cars would be ready for production by 2020. Its approach stands in sharp contrast to many carmakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Tesla Motors Inc, which are moving towards autonomous driving in incremental steps, currently still requiring drivers. Tesla has said it logged over 100 million miles since last October from drivers using its partially autonomous Autopilot system. But miles driven on predictable highways are easier than navigating busy city streets, said Dmitri Dolgov, head of Google's self-driving technology effort.Google's cars experience more complex situations than just following a car on the freeway, he said. ""You have to have a deeper understanding of what's on the road and to the side,"" Dolgov told Reuters following a ride in a self-driving Lexus near Alphabet's Mountain View, California campus, during which the vehicle reacted to individuals in wheelchairs, pushing strollers and a car making a U-turn. ""Every time you drive it's different.""The Google car can detect whether a moving object is a child or a bicycle and anticipates that both can make fast, unpredictable movements. The car's driving system calculates the probability of such movements and uses the results to determining how the vehicle will react.  Those types of complicated social interactions are the last, most difficult element of autonomous vehicle technology, according to Dolgov. ""You get to 90 percent autonomy in 10 percent of the time and then spend 90 percent of your time on the last 10 percent,"" he said. The closest company to rival Google's self-driven miles in California is auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, with 16,662 autonomous miles, according to a January report filed with state regulators.

123,"   By Bernie Woodall and Joseph White | DETROIT  DETROIT Investors dumped General Motors Co shares on Tuesday  despite record third-quarter results, highlighting the disconnect between Detroit and Wall Street as the long U.S. vehicle sales boom cools off. GM's quarterly results zoomed past analysts' forecasts. But the automaker's share price tumbled, closing down 4.2 percent at $31.60 a share, reflecting investor fears it will not avoid a cyclical profit slump. The sell-off hit other U.S. auto stocks as well. Ford Motor Co shares fell 1.6 percent to $11.85, and supplier Delphi Automotive PLC fell 1.6 percent. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV shares edged up 0.5 percent after the automaker raised its full-year profit forecast. Top executives of the largest U.S. automaker tried to reassure investors. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts on Tuesday ""we are working hard to make sure the core business is operating in a very disciplined fashion"" while the company invests in future technology such as self-driving cars.GM said full-year results should be on the ""high end"" of a previous forecast of $5.50 to $6.00 a share.  Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said GM expects North American profit margins to stay at or above 10 percent because it will rein in discounts needed to close deals, cut $5.5 billion from costs and refresh its compact and mid-size sport utility vehicles at a time when demand for such vehicles is hot.However, Stevens also said the overall U.S. car and light truck market is a ""plateaued environment,"" and forecast the slumping British pound could slash $400 million from GM's European results for the year.GM said revenue for the third quarter rose 10 percent to a record $42.8 billion, boosted by production of vehicles that went onto lots at GM's U.S. dealers. Compared with a year ago, GM said it had about 110,000 more vehicles in stock at U.S. dealers as of Sept. 30. ""GM will say our inventories are fine and our incentives are great,"" said Matthew T. Stover, automotive analyst with Susquehanna Financial in Boston. ""The truth is their inventories are among the highest in the industry."" Among investors' concerns are signs that discounts on large pickup trucks are rising.       GM and rival Ford Motor Co, due to release third-quarter results on Thursday, have staked out competing views of the U.S. auto market. Ford warned in July that a slowing U.S. auto market would put its full-year profit forecast at risk. GM has stuck with a more positive view, in part because it is reaping substantial profits from pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles such as the $73,000 Cadillac Escalade. Ford bet during the past decade that gas prices would be high and cut back on its large SUV production, allowing GM to capture more than 70 percent of the lucrative segment in the United States. GM's results and its outlook depend primarily on continued strength in the U.S. and Chinese markets. The company said it lost money in Europe, and Stevens said achieving break-even results for Europe this year will be ""very, very challenging."" Overall, GM said third-quarter net income more than doubled to $2.8 billion, or $1.76 a share, from a year earlier. Excluding a $110 million gain from litigation, earnings of $1.72 a share beat analysts' average estimate of $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

125,"   By Joseph White  Auto parts maker Delphi Automotive Plc and Israeli technology firm Mobileye NV will put an Intel Corp chip at the heart of their joint effort to produce self-driving vehicles by 2019, the companies said on Tuesday.The move is a boost for the world's largest semiconductor maker, which is also working with German luxury car maker BMW AG and Mobileye on self-driving technology, but has not been able to extend its broader chip dominance into the fast-emerging autonomous vehicle market.Companies from Alphabet Inc's Google to Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Tesla Motors Inc are vying to put autonomous vehicles on U.S. roads, which could radically reshape transportation across the country. Intel will provide a ""system on chip"" for autonomous vehicle systems that Delphi and Mobileye are developing together, Glen De Vos, Delphi's vice president of engineering, told Reuters.  UK-based Delphi is talking with established automakers and new or niche vehicle companies, such as manufacturers of commercial vehicles, interested in automating vehicles, De Vos said. The system Delphi and Mobileye are developing would likely come to market first in a commercial vehicle operating in a limited area, such as an airport shuttle or a ride-hailing service, DeVos said. Delphi is testing autonomous driving technology in vehicles in Singapore. By the end of this year, Delphi hopes to choose a city in the United States to launch a test fleet of self-driving cars during 2017, De Vos said. The company is also looking for test site in a European city.""We are looking at Pittsburgh and Boston and a couple of others,"" De Vos said. Pittsburgh is where ride services company Uber is testing its own self-driving vehicles. Delphi and Mobileye will stage a demonstration of their self-driving vehicle system at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, De Vos said. That system will use current, electromechanical laser imaging technology, or LIDAR, that is too expensive for use in consumer vehicles, he said.Delphi is also working with Quanergy Systems, a maker of solid-state LIDAR systems, De Vos said.

By the end of this year, Delphi hopes to choose a city in the United States to launch a test fleet of self-driving cars during 2017, De Vos said. The company is also looking for test site in a European city.""We are looking at Pittsburgh and Boston and a couple of others,"" De Vos said. Pittsburgh is where ride services company Uber is testing its own self-driving vehicles. Delphi and Mobileye will stage a demonstration of their self-driving vehicle system at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, De Vos said. That system will use current, electromechanical laser imaging technology, or LIDAR, that is too expensive for use in consumer vehicles, he said.Delphi is also working with Quanergy Systems, a maker of solid-state LIDAR systems, De Vos said.
