0,"   By Patrick Temple-West | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Energy group Exelon Corp is fighting the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in court over a $517 million tax bill in a case that tax lawyers said could lead to new restrictions on businesses' ability to do tax-free property exchange deals.Such exchanges are common legal strategies for avoiding capital gains tax. Thousands are carried out annually, though the Exelon deal at issue was unusually large.If Exelon loses its case against the IRS in U.S. Tax Court, tax-free property exchange deals, even smaller ones, could be at risk of more often being labeled ""abusive tax shelters,"" by the agency, tax lawyers said this week.""People are already on edge ... it is going to put a crimp on this type of transaction,"" said Stefan Tucker, a lawyer with Venable LLP, who is not involved in the case. He said he thinks the case will likely be appealed regardless of the Tax Court's decision.'LIKE-KIND' DEALS Exelon is defending two tax-free property exchanges worth more than $1 billion combined. They were carried out by one of its units in 1999, according to a Tax Court filing.The IRS contends that the exchanges were ""a potentially abusive tax shelter,"" said Exelon, the largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator, in a November 2013 regulatory filing.A spokesman for Chicago-based Exelon declined to comment and referred questions to the company's regulatory filings. The IRS, which also declined to comment, has not yet filed a response to Exelon's Tax Court petition challenging the tax bill. The company does not have to pay the bill while litigation is ongoing. A trial has not yet been scheduled.The dispute centers on a tax break that lets an individual or business sell an asset - often real estate - and pay no capital gains tax on any profit if the asset is replaced within a certain time period with a similar, or ""like-kind,"" asset.Tax-free exchanges must be done following strict rules on timing, intermediaries and any cash involved. Corporations filed more than 64,000 forms with the IRS in 2010 declaring so-called like-kind exchanges, while individuals filed more than 150,000 such forms that same year, the most recent year for which data was available.In the Exelon case, the IRS is arguing that the company ""did not acquire and retain significant and genuine attributes of a traditional owner,"" to satisfy the like-kind exchange rules, according to court documents. 'SILO' TAX SHELTER The case traces back to 1999 when an Exelon subsidiary sold some of its fossil fuel power plants to comply with new regulations. With the sale proceeds, the subsidiary acquired three power plants in Georgia and Texas in what the company said it structured as a tax-free exchange.The Exelon subsidiary then leased the Georgia and Texas properties back to the local governments that operated them. The governments paid advance rent to the Exelon unit totaling more than $1 billion, according to court filings.The rent payments were part of a ""sale in, lease out,"" or SILO, deal that was integral to the tax-free exchange. The IRS contends that by leasing the properties, the Exelon unit did not take proper possession of the plants it got in the exchange. The IRS views some SILO deals as tax shelters and has won SILO disputes in court, including an unrelated one against Exelon last year in a federal appellate court.""SILOs are old tax shelters and courts have ruled against them numerous times,"" said Bradley Borden, a Brooklyn Law School tax professor. He added that if the SILO portion of the power plants exchange does not hold up in court, Exelon could lose and its case could have ""a chilling effect"" on similar deals.""Exelon is going to have a hard time winning,"" Borden said.However, in court fights over like-kind exchanges, ""the IRS has a pretty bad track record,"" said David Shechtman, a lawyer with Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP who is not involved in the case.Exelon's transaction was not a typical SILO and that might help the company prove it was playing by the rules, he said.The case is Exelon Corp, as successor by merger to Unicom Corp and Subsidiaries v.

2,"  April 1 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Tuesday it has approved the proposed direct transfer of operating licenses from Constellation Energy Nuclear Group (CENG) subsidiaries to Exelon Corp for five commercial nuclear power reactors and three spent fuel storage installations.The transfer of operating licenses will be for Constellation's five nuclear power reactors at three plant sites - Calvert Cliffs 1 and 2 in Maryland, Nine Mile Point 1 and 2, and R.E. Ginna in New York and the associated independent spent fuel storage installations, the regulator said.The NRC had approved the indirect transfer of the licenses in February 2012 when Exelon merged with Constellation Energy Partners LLC, CENG's parent company. ""The current direct transfer allows Exelon to integrate the operations of the facilities into its existing nuclear fleet,"" the NRC said in a statement. The license transfers will not result in any physical changes to the facilities. The on-site organizations and plant staff, including senior managers, will remain unchanged by the license transfers, the NRC said. Exelon currently owns 50.01 percent of CENG, which is jointly owned with EDF Inc, a subsidiary of Electricité de France SA.Long Island Power Authority's 18 percent ownership in Nine Mile Point 2 reactor will not be affected by the license transfers, the NRC said. Existing Exelon licenses will also not be affected, it added.

3,"   By Swetha Gopinath and Kanika Sikka  Exelon Corp said it would buy Pepco Holdings Inc for $6.83 billion, helping it overtake Duke Energy Corp as the biggest power distribution company in the United States.The deal will allow Exelon to sell more power at stable rates set by regulators at a time when an abundance of cheap natural gas is dragging down power prices in the open market.Exelon's move to reduce its exposure to the vagaries of the wholesale power market comes as U.S. utilities struggle with falling electricity demand in both the open and regulated markets due to increased energy efficiency and a weak economy.However, Exelon's stock fell as much as 5 percent to $34.22.""Some investors might question Exelon's desire to increase the company's regulated exposure at a time when power markets appear to be recovering,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton.The company defended the acquisition saying it was maintaining substantial exposure to the recovery in prices.""The acquisition also supports our belief in the value of an integrated utility, with a balanced mix of regulated and non-regulated cash flows,"" Exelon Chief Executive Chris Crane, who will lead the combined company, said on a conference call. Exelon said its earnings from the regulated business is expected to rise to as much as 65 percent after the deal, from about 60 percent now.Pepco's shares rose as much as 18 percent before closing 17.4 percent higher at $26.76, slightly below Exelon's offer price of $27.25 per share, despite fears of severe regulatory scrutiny for the deal.However, two experts said the deal was unlikely to run into serious trouble from regulators, who most likely will include the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and public utility commissions in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. There is no antitrust issue since the two companies don't have customers in the same areas, said Bruce McDonald, an antitrust expert with Jones Day law firm.Pepco operates utilities in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey, serving about 2 million customers.Exelon's utilities deliver electricity and natural gas to more than 6.6 million customers in Maryland, Illinois and Pennsylvania.The acquisition would not deter Exelon from buying more renewable and conventional power assets, Crane said. At the same time, the company is looking to raise up to $1 billion by selling non-core assets, he said. Weak power prices and consumption have spurred consolidation among utilities in the past three years, with Exelon itself having bought Constellation Energy for $7.9 billion in 2011. Duke Energy and AES Corp have also made acquisitions.Exelon said it expected Pepco to ""significantly"" add to adjusted earnings in the first full year after the deal closed.The company also reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter, hurt by weak energy prices and a fall in nuclear and coal output.Barclays, Goldman Sachs & Co and Loop Capital Markets are Exelon's financial advisers.

14,"   By Valerie Volcovici and Scott DiSavino | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK May 30 U.S. environmental regulators could throw a lifeline to the nation's ailing nuclear power fleet when they unveil landmark carbon pollution curbs next week, heeding calls from operators like Exelon Corp  to acknowledge nuclear energy as a valuable way to reduce emissions.The Environmental Protection Agency is due on Monday to release a plan to slash pollution from the power sector, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's efforts to tackle climate change and likely one of the most contentious initiatives of his second term.Nuclear generators like Chicago-based Exelon, the nation's largest, and Entergy Corp of New Orleans, have warned that they need a regulatory pathway to compete with cheap gas-fired power plants and to cope with the high cost of repairing or replacing aging units.In meetings with the EPA, executives have urged the agency to recognize atomic energy in the new rules, arguing that financial incentives or trading systems that would prevent the closure of nuclear plants are an effective way to reduce overall greenhouse gas output.Officials appear to have taken note. In an EPA summary document seen by Reuters, the agency identifies ""avoiding the retirement of 8 percent of existing nuclear capacity"" among several ways states can comply with the rules, along with increasing renewable power such as solar.By naming the continued use of existing nuclear capacity as part of a ""best system of emission reductions"" - the menu of options for curbing carbon - the EPA could give states the go-ahead to make nuclear part of their strategy for complying with the new federal pollution limits.It was not clear, though, whether this phrase would remain in the proposal, which is still being finalized.  The EPA has declined to comment on any details of the plan until it is made public. ""We need every single megawatt of nuclear to stay in place just to tread water, and we need appropriate incentives to keep those units in operation and to expand clean energy,"" Joseph Dominguez, Exelon's senior vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs, told Reuters. He said he has not yet seen the EPA proposal.NUCLEAR DISTRESS The pleas arise amid growing signs of distress in the industry. Last week three nuclear units owned by Exelon, including two in Illinois, failed to win contracts at an auction to supply the Atlantic and Midwest PJM electrical grid, the nation's largest, for 2017-2018. Exelon, which operates 24 reactors at 14 sites around the country, or about a quarter of the U.S. fleet, has said it may be forced to shut three Illinois units for economic reasons. The threatened facilities - in Byron, Clinton and the Quad Cities - employ more than 2,300 people and pay over $50 million a year in local and state taxes.Nuclear plants produce nearly a fifth of the nation's energy, and industry boosters tout the reliable, around-the-clock, carbon-free output. Clean alternatives such as wind turbines operate only intermittently, and need additional capacity from gas or coal plants to maintain a steady supply for customers.Chuck Barlow, Entergy's vice president of environmental strategy and policy, says nuclear generators should get credit for the megawatts produced, either through state clean energy programs or multi-state carbon markets, like the northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).The EPA is expected to give states the option to use cap-and-trade programs, such as the RGGI, to comply with future performance standards, Reuters reported on May 20. ""Nuclear does need to get beneficial treatment under the rule because of its importance to meeting any climate change goals,"" Barlow said.Without any incentives, companies may be forced to shut several of the nation's older reactors, despite expectations they would find favor with the retirement of older coal plants, said Doug Vine, a senior energy fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.A report from the Energy Information Administration in April forecast that a total of 10,800 megawatts of U.S. nuclear generation, or around 10 percent of total capacity, would be shuttered by 2020.Nuclear accounts for nearly half of Illinois' electricity generation, with carbon-intensive coal making up most of the remainder, making the future of the nuclear fleet a key question for the Midwestern state.Illinois lawmakers are advancing a resolution urging the EPA to ""secure the continued operations"" of its nuclear plants as a compliance mechanism for any greenhouse gas rules.Doug Scott, chairman of the Illinois Commerce Commission, hopes the EPA proposal will back states like Illinois that have a cleaner energy mix, led by nuclear, but including energy efficiency improvements, coal plant closures and renewables.""There are ways we can take advantage of the clean energy sources we have, like nuclear. Hopefully we will have enough flexibility to mesh all of the things we are talking about,"" Scott said.

Maryland's Public Service Commission said on Friday it would approve the deal, which would create the biggest U.S. power generator, if Exelon would agree to 46 conditions.Exelon, for example, agreed to give $66 million in residential rate credits and spend $43.2 million for energy efficiency programs for a total of $109.2 million.The companies must also establish a $19.8 million Green Sustainability Fund and pledge that Exelon would preserve Pepco's plans to improve reliability in snow and rainstorms.Exelon President Chris Crane said the state's order on the transaction was constructive, though ""challenging."" Three members of the state's utility-regulating commission voted to approve the deal. The two who dissented said the deal will, if allowed, create a company providing 80 percent of Maryland's electric power. That would reduce competition, raise rates and ""eviscerate economic protections due to a weakened and compromised corporate governance structure,"" they wrote.Maryland Energy Administration, a state agency which promotes clean energy, opposed the deal. So did Maryland's Office of People's Counsel, an independent state agency to represent residential consumers, as well as various public advocacy and environmental groups. The deal was announced in April 2014, drawing objections from environmentalists concerned about Exelon's nuclear plants.Exelon generates 55 percent of its power from nuclear plants, with the remainder coming from natural gas, oil and gas, hydroelectric, and coal, wind, oil, and solar/landfill gas.Pepco serves about 2 million customers in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey.

24,"   By Scott DiSavino  New rules for U.S. electricity providers could save two money-losing nuclear power plants in Illinois from shutting down and may amount to a $10 billion bonanza to U.S. power producers.A system of rewards and penalties is part of a requirement approved last month by federal energy regulators that applies to a power auction next month.It may benefit some costly nuclear reactors in the PJM power region, which stretches from New Jersey to Illinois, that have had a tough time competing against the growing use of wind turbines and power plants fired with cheap natural gas.That is particularly true for two plants operated by Exelon Corp, the biggest U.S. nuclear power plant operator. It has warned it might be forced to shut its Quad Cities and Byron nuclear plants in northern Illinois, unless the reactors' revenues increase.Other generators expected to benefit from the new requirements, including those with nuclear plants located far away from the Midwest wind farms, include Dynegy Inc, NRG Energy Inc, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc and Talen Energy Corp.Thanks to the growth of alternative power sources and abundant gas from shale formations, PJM power prices have fallen an average of 20 percent over the past five years to around $50 per megawatt hour compared with the prior five years.The regulation should provide generators with more money for keeping their units ready to operate when most needed to avoid unexpected power plant outages like those that pushed the system to the brink of blackouts as homes and businesses cranked up their heaters during the polar vortex winter of 2013/2014.The rule creates a niche for nuclear plants, which run consistently, unlike breeze-dependent wind turbines, and do not need potential upgrades to withstand harsh winter temperatures like gas plants.    Under so-called capacity performance requirements, generators will receive higher fees to keep plants available but face stiff penalties if their units don't deliver power when needed during system emergencies. Fines for an average 100-megawatt plant would be around $350,000 an hour.One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.PJM will hold the auction starting August 10 for power capacity for the June 2018-to-May 2019 time period that will include the capacity performance standards. Capacity performance prices for the 2018-2019 delivery year are expected to increase by about 25 percent over last year's rates to around $150 to $165 per megawatt day, according to analysts, which could total about $10 billion for the power resources sought in the auction. If analysts' estimates are correct and all ten of Exelon's reactors in northern Illinois are selected to provide capacity in the auction, the company could receive around $600 million for those reactors during the 2018-2019 delivery year.""We expect the vast majority of our nuclear units will clear the auction,"" Joseph Dominguez, Exelon's executive vice president for government and regulatory affairs told Reuters, meaning the company expects most of its reactors in PJM to receive capacity payments for the 2018-2019 delivery year.He would not speculate on what might happen with Quad Cities and Byron in Illinois and Oyster Creek in New Jersey, which did not clear last year's auction for the 2017-2018 delivery year that did not include the capacity performance standards.Exelon has already said it planned to retire Oyster Creek in the fourth quarter of 2019, but has not set a closure plan for the Illinois plants. With the new capacity standards in place, some analysts said Byron and Quad Cities, which are located in Exelon's Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) power delivery zone in northern Illinois, will make the grade for continuing to operate. ""Byron and Quad Cities will clear the 2018-2019 auction because we think the ComEd zone will price at a higher level than the rest of PJM,"" said Prajit Ghosh, research director North America power, at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.Exelon has lost close to $1 billion over the past five years on its nuclear operations - about $350 million at Quad Cities alone. It expects those losses to continue, based on forward power prices, Dominguez said.Even if Byron and Quad Cities clear the auction, Dominguez said they still face the risk of shutdown unless federal, state and regional policy makers find ways to compensate generators for the environmental and reliability benefits that non-carbon emitting nuclear plants provide.In the meantime, extra revenues from the capacity auction could keep the money losing reactors operating for a few more years until possible new carbon standards are available.

25,"   By Ayesha Rascoe | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Utilities regulators for the District of Columbia on Tuesday denied Exelon Corp's $6.8 billion bid for Pepco Holdings Inc, dealing a major blow to a deal that would have created the country's top power distributor.Pepco shares fell 15.4 percent, and Exelon was down about 4 percent after the D.C. Public Service Commission said the companies had not proven that the proposed merger was in the public interest.The three-member commission was the final regulatory hurdle for the deal, which was announced in April 2014. The four other states required to approve the deal had voted in favor of the merger.The companies, which have 30 days to ask the commission to reconsider its order, said they were disappointed in the decision and would review their options.If the commission rejects an application for reconsideration, the companies would then have the option of appealing the decision to the D.C. Court of Appeals. The companies may also choose to submit another application.""Lately we have seen a trend of regulatory commissions rejecting deals and leaving the door open for a re-submitted application with enhanced terms for rate-payers,"" said Daniel Fidell, of USCA Securities LLC. ""That door is open for Exelon and Pepco. I expect they will be doing so,"" he added.Commission Chairwoman Betty Ann Kane said the decision was one of the most important rulings that the agency would ever make. She said that while the merger would offer some benefits, some factors could prove harmful to the District.""Pepco would become a second-tier company in a much larger corporation whose primary interest is not in distribution, but in generation,"" Kane said at the hearing where the decision was announced. Opponents of the deal have said it would raise rates for consumers while limiting growth of renewable power in the region.""The proposed acquisition would have been a substantial step backwards in the District's efforts to move toward more sustainable electricity generation and greater reliance on local, renewable energy,"" said Power DC, a coalition of environmentalists and public advocacy groups.Pepco serves about 2 million customers in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey. Exelon has about 7.8 million customers in Maryland, Illinois and Pennsylvania.

Public Service Commission voted on Friday to make revisions to an offer that Exelon Corp made in order to win approval for its merger with Pepco Holdings Inc, after first rejecting the companies' improved offer.The commission gave Exelon 14 days to accept the proposed conditions. If it does so, the deal ""will be approved as in the public interest without further commission action,"" the commission said in a statement.Exelon said it would mull the offer.""The commission's order prescribes new provisions that we and the settling parties must carefully review to determine whether they are acceptable,"" Exelon spokesman Paul Elsberg said in a statement. D.C. Councilmember Mary Cheh, in an interview on local radio, described the changes as relatively minor. ""It is effectively a done deal,"" said Cheh, who had opposed the merger.Allison Fisher of Public Citizen, which also opposed the deal, was critical of the commission's proposal. ""This is a huge loss for consumers, a discouraging setback for the institutions entrusted to protect them and a sad commentary on how things are done in the District,"" she said in a statement.The deal would create the country's top power distributor. The alternative terms proposed by the commission would change the oversight of some of the $72.8 million offered by Exelon. It also cancels a portion of the previous settlement that would have designated Exelon as the developer of a 5 megawatt solar project at a D.C. water treatment plant.The commission had said on Aug. 25 that it would not approve the $6.8 billion deal but reopened consideration in October. The commission took two votes on the deal on Friday, at first rejecting Exelon's sweetened offer. Commissioner Joanne Doddy Fort then proposed a set of alternative measures, which the commission voted 2-to-1 to accept.The proposed transaction has won approval from Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia and the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Pepco does not generate electricity but delivers it to about 2 million customers in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey.

63,"  June 2 Exelon Corp, the biggest U.S. nuclear power plant operator, said on Thursday it will shut reactors at the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear stations in Illinois, given a lack of progress on state energy legislation that would have allowed the plants to operate economically.The planned nuclear shutdowns are the latest example of natural gas' growing dominance of the U.S. power sector since the shale revolution made the United States the world's biggest producer of the fuel for the past five years.Gas is expected to top coal as the nation's biggest source of power generation in 2016, according to federal energy estimates.Coal has been the primary fuel source for U.S. power plants for the last century, but its use has declined since peaking in 2007 due to low gas and power prices that make it uneconomic to upgrade older units to meet stricter environmental rules.Coal is not the only victim of low gas prices. Nuclear operators have shut five reactors since 2013 and have threatened to close several more primarily because U.S. power prices have collapsed to decade lows due to low gas prices, making it uneconomic to keep running or make needed repairs to the nuclear units.Exelon said Clinton will close on June 1, 2017, and Quad Cities will close on June 1, 2018. Quad Cities and Clinton have lost a combined $800 million in the past seven years, despite being two of Exelon's best-performing plants, the company added.Exelon was hoping the Illinois Legislature would adopt legislation, known as the Next Generation Energy Plan, that would compensate nuclear reactors for the reliability, environmental and economic benefits they provide like round-the-clock power with no carbon emissions, and jobs and taxes for the local communities. ""While the Illinois legislative session has not ended, the path forward for consideration of the Next Generation Energy Plan legislation is not clear,"" Exelon said.The company said it would immediately take one-time charges of $150 million to $200 million for 2016 and accelerate about $2 billion in depreciation and amortization through the announced shutdown dates. Exelon said it will continue to work with stakeholders on passing the legislation but it may come too late to save some plants.The Clinton and Quad Cities plants support about 4,200 direct and indirect jobs and produce more than $1.2 billion in economic activity annually, Exelon said. There are nearly 700 workers at Clinton and 800 workers at Quad Cities.The Clinton plant began service in 1987, while Quad Cities began service in 1972.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by W Simon and Chris Reese)",2016-06-02,EXC,"Thu Jun 2, 2016 | 1:33pm EDT",Exelon to shut two nuclear plants in Illinois,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-nuclear-exelon-idUSL1N18U1L6?type=companyNews

68,"  New York state energy regulators on Monday approved a plan to pay several upstate nuclear power plants up to $965 million over two years to keep the reactors in service and meet the state's carbon reduction goals.The New York Public Service Commission (PSC) approved the proposed Clean Energy Standard, which requires that 50 percent of the state's power will come from clean and renewable sources of energy by 2030, including nuclear power.The subsidies are part of an effort to keep the nuclear reactors, which produce almost no emissions, operating at a time of low prices for power as well as for natural gas, an alternative generator fuel.New York's plan could provide a model for the rest of the country to save the struggling nuclear industry while reducing carbon emissions.Several nuclear plants in New York and across the country may have to shut over the next few years because power prices are lower than reactor operating costs due to ample supplies of cheap gas from shale fields. PSC staff estimated the economic and environmental benefits of keeping the reactors in service at about $5 billion over the first two years of the program, for a net benefit of about $4 billion since the cost of the nuclear subsidy was calculated at up to $965 million.Reactors eligible for the program include Exelon Corp's Ginna and Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2, and Entergy Corp's FitzPatrick.""We could not possibly replace those nuclear units if they were to shut,"" PSC Chair Audrey Zibelman said during a question and answer period before the vote. Zibelman said the energy lost would almost certainly be replaced by fossil-fired, carbon producing power plants. Entergy, which has said it would shut FitzPatrick in 2017, is in discussions with Exelon for the potential sale of FitzPatrick. The companies have said those discussions depend on the terms and timeliness of the state's Clean Energy Standard.The plan included only the upstate reactors because prices there are expected to be too low to cover the operating and other costs of those plants. Entergy's Indian Point Units 2 and 3 were not included in the program, at least for the first two years, because down state power prices were expected to remain high enough to cover the plant's operating and other costs, the report said.Entergy is seeking to renew the operating licenses for the two Indian Point reactors, while New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has opposed the continued operation of the plant because it is located in the heavily populated New York metropolitan area about 40 miles north of New York City.

73,"  (Adds Exelon statement, paragraph 9)Oct 19 An energy industry coalition including competitive non-nuclear electricity producers sued on Wednesday to oppose a plan to subsidize nuclear power plants in New York State.The lawsuit in federal court said the New York Public Service Commission's (PSC) plan to raise electric rates across the state by requiring consumers to pay for zero emission credits (ZECs), infringes illegally into federal regulators' territory.The coalition said in a statement that the litigation was  ""solely to save several New York nuclear plants that, allegedly, can no longer compete successfully in the federally-regulated wholesale electric power market."" The subsidies were part of an effort to keep the nuclear reactors, which produce almost no emissions, operating at a time of low prices for power and natural gas, an alternative generator fuel.""The frivolous lawsuit is right out of fossil fuel industry's play book to deny and thwart actions to combat climate change,"" New York PSC Chairwoman Audrey Zibelman said in a statement. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the rights of states to protect their environment for the welfare of citizens.The owners of the state's nuclear reactors include units of Exelon Corp and Entergy Corp. Exelon in August agreed to buy Entergy's FitzPatrick reactor in New York, which Entergy said it would retire in 2017, after the state adopted the Clean Energy Standard (CES) to help the state's nuclear reactors.Exelon said in a statement that despite the lawsuit, New York PSC's work to finalize the CES ""and our work to complete the FitzPatrick transaction continues notwithstanding attempts to stop it.""Coalition members opposed to the nuclear subsidies include units of Dynegy Inc and NRG Energy Inc.

78,"   By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE  SEATTLE General Electric Co (GE.N) has signed up U.S. energy utility Exelon Corp (EXC.N) to use its full software set to analyze and manage power plants in 48 states, the largest GE deployment in the power sector so far, the companies said on Tuesday.The Exelon deal, aimed at wringing greater efficiency from the business of generating electricity, marks another advance in GE's effort to lift annual digital technology revenue to $14 billion in 2020 from $5 billion in 2015, across its many industrial products. It also is one of the three largest sales of GE's Predix industrial operating system so far. Exelon has nuclear, wind and fossil fuel-powered plants. The companies did not disclose the value of Exelon's five-year contract with GE. In initial uses, GE's technology has increased power plant efficiency by 3 percent and reliability by 5 percent, while cutting operating and maintenance costs 25 percent, said Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE Power. Exelon's deployment is nearly six times larger than the previous largest GE deal, signed last month with the New York Power Authority and covering 16 power plants in New York state that generate about 5,600 megawatts.Chicago-based Exelon will use GE's Predix software and applications across its 91 power plants, which produce 32,700 megawatts and supply more than 10 million customers, the companies said. Exelon will also use GE software that analyzes the company's business performance and profitability, something NYPA didn't choose, GE said. GE and Exelon also agreed to work together on new Predix-based software applications. GE's power business accounts for 40 percent of GE's digital revenue, said Bolze. About $400 million a year is produced by GE Power's software business, and that revenue is growing by 50 percent a year, he added. Exelon's agreement follows four pilot projects over the past year and is GE's ""first and largest IoT (internet of things) enterprise-wide deployment of Predix full-suite offerings anywhere in the world,"" Bolze said.
