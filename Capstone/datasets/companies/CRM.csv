7,"  (Adds details from conference call, updates share price)By Sruthi RamakrishnanFeb 27 Salesforce.com Inc raised its full-year revenue forecast and said it aims to improve its adjusted operating margin, after quarterly revenue grew more than expected on strong sales at ExactTarget, an email marketing firm it acquired in June.The world's biggest maker of online sales software on Thursday estimated revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion for the year ending January 2015, compared with its previous forecast of $5.15 billion to $5.2 billion.Salesforce forecast adjusted earnings of 48-50 cents per share for the full year.That was largely below analysts' average estimate of 50 cents per share for the full year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The full-year adjusted profit forecast implies adjusted operating margin growth of 125 to 150 basis points, and assumes no significant mergers and acquisitions by Salesforce for the year ending January 2015.Adjusted profit for the year ended January was 35 cents per share.""We are committed to improving non-GAAP profitability by 125 to 150 basis points, which is a huge goal of mine for this year and increasing cash flow growth this,"" Chief Executive Marc Benioff said on a conference call with analysts. Salesforce aims to keep delivering topline growth at an ""outstanding"" pace, he added. Benioff said in November that he would seek to balance ""growth and profitability"" without jeopardizing his company's ""outrageous"" pace of revenue expansion.Benioff, who founded Salesforce in 1999, has for years shrugged off calls from Wall Street to turn a bigger profit by arguing that it was more important to re-invest earnings to increase its market share.The San Francisco-based company also said its chief financial officer of six years, Graham Smith, would retire in 2015. Salesforce shares, which had closed at $66.20 on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped 3 percent to $64 after hours but later pared losses to trade at $65.98.The company's net loss widened to $116.6 million, or 19 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, from $20.8 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 7 cents per share, one cent higher than analysts' expectations.Revenue rose 37 percent to $1.15 billion and beat analysts' expectations of $1.13 billion.Salesforce's unbilled deferred revenue, a critical measure of contracts that have been closed with business customers but remain off-balance sheet, rose to $4.5 billion, up 29 percent from a year earlier.

8,"  SAN FRANCISCO, March 25 Chuck Ganapathi, the executive behind Salesforce's popular Chatter software, is starting a company that takes aim at that company's core focus of managing business relationships.Tactile, a service launching on Tuesday, aims to automatically synchronize email, calendar, tasks, Salesforce data, LinkedIn contacts, Twitter and other functions. It will help salespeople and other users manage data, Ganapathi said in an interview last week.He has raised $11.2 million from Redpoint Ventures and Accel Partners, the venture firm where he worked as entrepreneur in residence while he developed the idea for Tactile.

Dropbox, widely considered an initial public offering candidate for later this year, allows users to synchronize files automatically to the cloud, so the files can be accessed from anywhere rather than a specific set of computers.

In a demonstration of the platform, the companies showed how a nurse could remotely use a networked weighing scale and a pill dispensing box to assist elderly patients.Van Houten said he expected insurance companies would be keen to fund the use of networked healthcare devices because of potential cost savings.""There's a huge amount of money in the healthcare ecosystem; it's 17 percent of U.S. GDP,"" he said.

36,"  PARIS, March 30 European stocks were set to rise on Monday, bouncing back from last week's losses with tech shares in focus after news of merger talks in the sector spurred a late-session rally on Wall Street on Friday.     Intel Corp is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp  in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter, which would make it Intel's biggest acquisition ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector.      Intel shares jumped 6.4 percent on Friday, making it the biggest boost to the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes, while Altera shares surged 28.4 percent.

At 0650 GMT, futures for Euro STOXX 50, for Germany's DAX  and for France's CAC were up 0.4-0.5 percent.     Market sentiment on Monday was also supported by recent central bank comments.     Weekend comments from Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan reinforced expectations for further monetary easing to support the country's slowing economy.      On Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled that the U.S. central bank will likely start raising borrowing costs later this year, but emphasized the return to normal interest rates will be gradual.      ""The cautious tone that she struck stating that there was no set path, completely dependant on the data, and the fact that she highlighted the risks of raising rates too quickly as greater than leaving them low for too long is also set to play in to the hands of the bulls this morning,"" Capital Spreads trader Jonathan Sudaria wrote in a note.     Greek shares will be in the spotlight again after Greece and its international creditors continued talks through the weekend on reforms to unlock loans and Athens sounded an upbeat tone, but the lenders said it could take several more days before a proper list of measures was ready.           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   MARKET SNAPSHOT AT 0650 GMT:                                          LAST   PCT CHG  NET CHG  S&P 500                             2,061.02    0.24 %     4.87  NIKKEI                               19411.4    0.65 %   125.77  MSCI ASIA EX-JP                        484.5    0.43 %     2.07  EUR/USD                               1.0866   -0.19 %  -0.0021  USD/JPY                               119.28    0.15 %   0.1800  10-YR US TSY YLD                       1.953        --     0.01  10-YR BUND YLD                         0.195        --    -0.01  SPOT GOLD                          $1,193.20   -0.47 %   -$5.60  US CRUDE                              $48.01   -1.76 %    -0.86   > GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia shares swing higher as China nears 7-yr high    > US STOCKS-Wall St ends 4-day skid on late tech rally    > Nikkei up in choppy trade; airline shares outperform on weak oil prices    > TREASURIES-Bond prices rally on month-end buying, hold gains after    > FOREX-Dollar supported even as Yellen drives home message of patience    > PRECIOUS-Gold slips as Yellen signals U.S. rate hike on track    > METALS-London nickel slides to lowest since 2009 on weak demand    > Oil prices fall as Iran, world powers seek nuclear deal           COMPANY NEWS:          TECH SHARES      Intel Corp is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp  in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter, making it Intel's biggest purchase ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector.

50,"   By Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The global bond market rout slowed on Thursday as long-term borrowing costs retreated from their highest levels in more than five months, helping to stabilize European stocks and kindle a mild recovery on Wall Street.The absence of a deal between Greece and its lenders, however, put pressure on the euro and regional stocks.Investors' rush out of stocks and bonds earlier this week sent major European indexes to their lowest in two months and major U.S. and Japanese gauges to the weakest in a month.U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's warning about high equity valuations on Wednesday added pressure to U.S. stocks ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs report, which may support expectations of a possible Fed rate increase later this year.Oil prices scaled back from 2015 highs on the perception of ample supply despite data that showed the first weekly drop in U.S. crude inventories since January.""That drastic, draconian move in bonds and violent updraft in oil are settling a little bit and that's helping us focus on stocks,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.A retreat in European bond yields from their session peaks caused the euro to decline from a 10-week high against the dollar. A bounce in the dollar and elevated bond yields touched off a second day of selling in gold. Bond markets were at the center of this week's rout, prompted by heavy supply and less pessimism about Europe, with German Bunds on track for their biggest weekly spike in yields in over a decade.Italian and Spanish yields hit 2 percent for the first time this year, French yields topped 1 percent and U.S. Treasuries, the benchmark for borrowing costs globally, briefly broke 2.3 percent. [EUR/GVD] [US/]Global yields receded from their Thursday peaks on bargain-hunting, led by Japanese investors who had been out of the market due to the three-day Golden Week holiday, analysts and traders said.  The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 83.38 points, or 0.47 percent, at 17,925.36, the S&P 500 ended 7.9 points, or 0.38 percent, higher at 2,088.05 and the Nasdaq Composite finished up 25.90 points, or 0.53 percent, to 4,945.54.

57,"   By Nadia Damouni  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) currently is not weighing an offer for Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N), two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, dampening speculation that Microsoft could be drawn into bidding for the cloud software company.Bloomberg News, citing people with knowledge of the matter, reported earlier this week that Microsoft was evaluating a bid for Salesforce after the latter was approached by another unnamed would-be buyer.Microsoft considers Salesforce's current market valuation  expensive, one of the people said. It is possible that Microsoft could review a bid for Salesforce in the long term, the other person said.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.Microsoft and Salesforce both declined to comment. San Francisco-based Salesforce is No. 1 in the $23 billion-a-year customer relationship management (CRM) market, according to tech research firm Gartner. It helps corporations organize and track sales calls and leads.Salesforce's services are entirely provided over the cloud, with no software directly installed on PCs. Oracle (ORCL.N) and Microsoft, which were relatively late to the cloud model, have much smaller online CRM revenues.As a result, Microsoft and several other big software companies are seeking to beef up their presence in cloud computing. Yet any deal for Salesforce, which has a market capitalization of $49 billion, would be pricey. Salesforce's shares, which have risen 48 percent in the last 12 months, trade at 106.8 times the company's forward earnings, well above Microsoft's multiple of 19.1, according to Thomson Reuters data.Last month, Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz said her company could benefit if Microsoft or another rival bought Salesforce.com. ""It would cause a lot of disruption in that market and so I would view that as something that would be helpful to us, especially in the short or medium term, dependent on who it was,"" Catz said. She declined to comment on whether Oracle had made an approach to buy Salesforce.Another potential buyer for Salesforce has ruled itself out.

The central bank's officials believed it would be premature to raise rates next month even though most felt the economy was set to rebound from a dismal start to the year, according to minutes from their April policy meeting.However, data on Thursday showed that jobless claims rose slightly more than expected last week, manufacturing sector growth slowed for a second straight month during May and home resales unexpectedly fell in April.""I doubt we'll see a rate hike this year,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.""The market is weighed down by debt.

She also said it would take several years to return to normal interest rates.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)       WEEK AHEAD      The stragglers for the earnings season - Home Depot, Wal-Mart and a few others - will report results to close out the quarter next week, with expectations that retailers would see decent sales after recent revisions show better-than-expected activity in the second quarter. The markets will also continue to watch the Chinese yuan after its unexpected devaluation this week, with anticipation that the dollar will strengthen a bit more, boosting bond-market activity in what is otherwise expected to be a slower week.      Fed minutes are released on Wednesday and will be parsed for clues of an interest rate rise. The Changes in the July statement pointed to an improving economy and labor markets. Characterization of the debate in the minutes could indicate how firm opinions are about the state of the U.S., and how confident members are that inflation and employment will move towards the Fed's target levels. Investors will also look for the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 0.2 percent in July, a bit down from a rise of 0.3 percent in June. Housing data, including housing starts and building permits on Tuesday and existing home sales on Thursday will be in focus. The Conference Board releases its Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity on Thursday.      Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp release its results for the second quarter. Wal-Mart is expected to report better-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday, while Target is expected to miss estimates when it reports on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, TJX Cos Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The off-price retailer is expected to be helped by lower gas prices, wage growth, and higher traffic to its stores as more consumers hunt for bargains. A hike in the number and quality of brands in its stores and merchandise that reflects popular fashion trends is also expected to drive sales. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on industry trends and plans to expand in international markets.      Home Depot Inc, the world's No. 1 home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimate on Tuesday. Strong housing market data over the last few months is expected to have kept overall demand for home improvement goods steady. However, record rainfall in May and June in large parts of the United States is likely to have kept a lid on sales of products in the home exterior improvement categories, such as paint and gardening supplies. Lowe's Companies Inc, the second-largest U.S. home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimates on Wednesday.      Hardware and software maker Hewlett-Packard Co is expected to report third-quarter earnings slightly above analysts' average estimate on Thursday. HP has been cutting costs and focusing on higher-margin sales in the face of a strong dollar and weak enterprise demand for its services. The company is also in the processes of separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.      Salesforce.com Inc, the world's biggest maker of online sales software, is expected to report a second-quarter profit above analysts' average estimate. Salesforce has struggled to earn consistent profits despite strong revenue growth over the past few years, hurt by higher spending on hiring. The company reported a profit for the first time in seven quarters in May. On Thursday, the investors will look for improvement in margins in the quarter and merger-related comments.      Data storage equipment maker NetApp Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue on Wednesday slightly above average analysts' estimate. NetApp, which cut about 500 jobs in May, has been trying to boost growth by focusing on cloud-based products as businesses cut spending on high-end storage systems. The company appointed George Kurian as its new CEO in June to replace Tom Georgens. Investors would be looking for second-quarter forecast.      On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota speaks before the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Price Measurement Issues in a Low Inflation Environment"" conference, in Seoul, South Korea. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco releases the text of the speech Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams delivered before the Bank Indonesia-BIS Research Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia.      Apparel retailer Gap Inc is expected to report a second-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday. Out of fashion merchandise and a general lack of trendy products have led to a decline in sales at the company's flagship Gap brand, leading to heavy discounts. Shipment delays caused due to disruptions at the West Coast ports early this year and a strong dollar are also expected to hurt the company's results in the quarter. Investors will look for comments on recovery at the Gap brand and performance in the current quarter.      On Wednesday, teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The earnings beat is expected to be driven by trendy, fashionable merchandise, lower discounts, benefits from lower cotton prices and tight inventory controls. American Eagle is also benefiting from a new multi-channel distribution center that allows it to control inventories more efficiently by enabling it to supply to its brick-and-mortar as well as online stores. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on promotions and trends, and expectations for the back-to-school shopping season.      Agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co has been hurt by a strong dollar as well as weak demand for its farm and turf equipment, which make up about two-thirds of its annual revenue. Falling U.S. farm income and weak commodity prices have reduced spending on new equipment by farmers. In May, Deere forecast a fall in global sales for its farm equipment in 2015 and said it would close plants and cut jobs. When the company reports its third-quarter results on Friday, the investors will be looking for an update on the company's plans to shutter more factories to adjust to lower demand, as well as whether it is expected to take a hefty charge on a tractor recall announced earlier in August. They will also be looking for more information on a fire in a chemical warehouse in China last week that left some Deere workers critically injured.      Friday data is expected to show that Canada's June retail sales have increased a little, compared with the previous month's reading. It is likely to have risen 0.2 percent, compared with a rise of 1.0 percent in May. Canada's inflation data is also out on Friday. Country's annual inflation is likely to have advanced 1.4 percent in July, up from 1.0 percent in June. Statistics Canada releases June wholesale trade data on Thursday.      On Thursday, Mexico's statistics institute will release GDP data for the second quarter, after the central bank said it sees quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.3 percent for the period, slackening from the first quarter after weaker-than-expected exports and a slump in domestic oil output. The same day, data with show how economic activity fared in June, after slowing to a nine-month low in May. On Friday, retail sales data for June will show how domestic spending performed after rebounding by 0.2 percent in May.           MONDAY, AUGUST 17      U.S. homebuilder sentiment is expected to stay strong in August as the National Association of Home Builders's NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index is likely to show an increase to 61 from 60 in July, which was the highest since November 2005. (1000/1400) Also, the New York Federal Reserve releases its New York Fed's Empire State general business conditions index for August. (0830/1230)      Beauty products company Estee Lauder Co Inc has been seeing a revival in sales in North America, helped by product launches and acquisitions. However, Estee has to increase promotions in its flagship Clinique and Estee Lauder brands which have shown some weakness. The company's smaller brands such as Smashbox and Bobbi Brown have seen a rise in demand, helped by their extensive online presence. Even as sales in overseas markets like the UK and China grow by double digit percentages, a stronger dollar in the past few quarters has stripped their value. The company is expected to beat revenue and profit estimates for the fourth quarter. Investors will be keen on 2016 forecast, updates on acquisitions and the impact of the dollar.      Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales slightly above analysts' average estimates. The beat is expected to be driven by strong performance at the flagship Urban Outfitters brand, which accounts for a majority of sales, but margins are expected to be pressured by higher promotions at the Anthropologie brand, where sales growth has slowed in recent quarters. The company is also benefiting from investments in its fast-growing e-commerce and online division. Investors will look for commentary on sales recovery at the Anthropologie brand, promotions, and updates on performance for the back-to-school shopping season.      Data from Statistics Canada will show the holdings of Canadian securities by non-residents for June. Foreign investors sold C$5.45 billion in Canadian assets in May.

78,"  (Adds details on currency, emerging markets revenue)By Lehar Maan and Abhirup RoyOct 19 International Business Machines Corp  posted a bigger-than-expected drop in revenue and cut its full-year profit forecast, as a stronger U.S. dollar accentuated weakness in demand from China and emerging markets.It was the 14th quarter in a row that IBM has posted a reduction in revenue, as the world's largest technology services company gets rid of low-margin businesses, but has so far failed to make up the shortfall with newer initiatives in the more lucrative area of cloud computing.Shares of IBM fell 4.8 percent in after-hours trading to $141.95.""This is another example of the massive headwinds that large-cap traditional tech stalwarts are seeing in this ever-changing environment, as more customers move to the cloud,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.China was particularly hard hit, with fewer big deals causing revenue from that country to fall 17 percent, IBM's chief financial officer said on a conference call with analysts. Sales in Brazil, Russia, India and China combined were down 30 percent.Armonk, New York-based IBM, which gets more than half its business from overseas, said overall revenue from continuing operations was cut 9 percent by a strong U.S. dollar, which is up about 17 percent from a year ago against a basket of currencies.The company's total revenue fell 13.9 percent to $19.28 billion in the quarter, below analysts' average forecast of $19.62 billion. Martin Schroeter, IBM's CFO, pointed to weakness in its consulting and storage businesses for the revenue shortfall, after taking currency moves and discontinued business into account.'STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES' ""I would characterize it as the consulting and systems integration business moving away from these large, packaged applications and the storage business moving to flash and to the cloud,"" Schroeter told Reuters in an interview. Flash is a speedy type of memory used in mobile phones and other types of electronic devices.IBM lowered its full-year 2015 operating profit forecast to a range of $14.75 to $15.75 per share from $15.75 to $16.50. Analysts on average were expecting $15.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company is shifting away from hardware to the cloud, much like established rivals such as Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp. Each is striving to boost Internet-based software and services sales to compete with Salesforce.com Inc and Amazon.com Inc's web software unit.In August, IBM said it would buy medical image company Merge Healthcare Inc in a $1-billion deal and combine it with its newly formed health analytics unit, which is powered by its famous Watson supercomputer. Revenue from what the company calls ""strategic imperatives,"" which include cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 17 percent in the third quarter ended Sept 30.Yet the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. The company known as 'Big Blue' has been selling low-margin businesses such as cash registers, low-end servers and semiconductors to focus on high-growth areas such as security software and data analytics, besides cloud-based services.IBM's net income from continuing operations fell to $2.96 billion, or $3.02 per share, from $3.46 billion, or $3.46 per share, a year earlier.Consolidated net income rose to $2.95 billion, or $3.01 per share, from $18 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.Last year profit was hurt by non recurring pre-tax charge of $3.3 billion, net of tax, for discontinued operations.Excluding items, IBM earned $3.34 per share from continuing operations in the latest quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of a profit of $3.30 per share.Up to Monday's close, IBM's shares had fallen about 7 percent this year.

BakerSAN FRANCISCO, Sept 27 With speculation mounting that Twitter Inc will soon have a new corporate owner, the 10-year-old social networking service - which has long struggled to define its core purpose -may end up heading in one of several distinctly different directions depending on who ends up paying for it.Companies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc's Google have shown interest in Twitter, which is working with investment banks to evaluate its options, according to people familiar with the matter.With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming.It is not clear how quickly Twitter might approach a sale, but it is moving to formalize the process, sources have said. A deal is by no means assured in light of the company's uncertain financial prospects and steep price tag - its market value is more than $16 billion after talk of a sale drove the stock up over the past few days.Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, speaking at a conference in Washington on Monday, declined to comment on possible sale talks.CORPORATE ROUTE? Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software; unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at businesses users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships.Salesforce.com already uses the Twitter ""firehose"" for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. ""It would give them the social graph and a better idea of how social media relates to its customers,"" said Ryan Holmes, chief executive of Hootsuite, a private technology firm that helps brands and consumers manage their social media accounts.Holmes also said that if Salesforce.com owned all of Twitter's data, it could have better insights into what sort of conversations companies such as airlines or telecom firms might be having with their customers and thereby gain more understanding of their business challenges.But many Twitter users - especially newer ones - are not active tweeters, which over time could limit the value of the data Twitter can provide. Salesforce.com could also likely gain much of the benefit of Twitter's data from licensing its trove of tweets as opposed to buying the whole company.Salesforce.com investors are already spooked by the speculation it could acquire Twitter: its shares are down 6  percent since news of the company's interest flared up last week. GOOGLE AD PLAN Twitter would fit easily with Google's online advertising-driven business model. Ads could be sold across paid search, YouTube, display and mobile on Twitter - while filling a gap for Google, which has struggled with social media.""Google already has the eyeballs with advertisers. Cross-selling to the Twitter inventory could be an amazing play for them,"" Hootsuite's Holmes said.Google, which has expertise in monitoring its video service YouTube, would know how to deal with the tricky policy issues facing Twitter, such as abusive tweets and censorship. Still, such a tie-up faces potentially fatal regulatory hurdles, analysts said. In Europe, where the company has a bigger share of the search market than in the United States, the company is already facing two antitrust investigations.""Google could help Twitter's user acquisition problem. The unknown is whether regulators in the United States and European Union would allow the transaction,"" said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield.Facebook Inc, meanwhile, has been trying to replicate Twitter on its own platform and could also face antitrust challenges if it tried to buy the company, Greenfield said. So far Facebook has not been mentioned as a potential buyer, but with its large cash reserves and penchant for surprise moves it cannot be counted out.THE MEDIA PLAY Twitter's foray into live streaming of National Football League games and its presence in news gathering could interest media companies such as Disney, which owns sports channel ESPN.Twitter's presence on mobile devices could help any media company, all of which are struggling to find mobile growth, according to BTIG's Greenfield.

133,"   By Liana B. Baker and Jessica Toonkel  Twitter Inc has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, according to people familiar with the matter.The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company's future as quickly as possible.Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people said this week. Salesforce.com Inc is in the running, while Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Walt Disney Co have also been contemplating bids, the people added.Recode reported on Wednesday, citing sources it did not identify, that Google would not move forward with a bid to acquire Twitter.It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the Reuters sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.    Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment.With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. The company missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company.It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook Inc's Instagram and Snapchat. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as chief executive more than a year ago, has been part of Disney's board since 2013.Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO, but have been on a steady downward trajectory since.  (Reporting by Liana B.

Healthcare shares led declines.Yellen, in a speech at a conference of policymakers and academics, laid out the deepening concern at the Fed that U.S. economic potential is slipping - and may need aggressive steps to rebuild it.""In looking at the market, I think, yes, (Yellen's speech) had a dovish tilt to it if you took it literally,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said Yellen's speech could suggest the U.S. central bank will stay accommodative for longer.Yellen did not address interest rates or immediate policy concerns directly. Traders have currently priced in a 67-percent chance of a rate hike in December.The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY was up 0.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) trounced third-quarter estimates. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank.  Shares of JPMorgan ended down 0.3 percent, however, while Citigroup (C.N) ended up 0.3 percent and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) was down 0.1 percent.Wells Fargo has been under pressure following recent revelations that branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. The bank earnings somewhat helped shore up Wall Street's confidence on the outlook for third-quarter earnings after some disappointing results from industrial and healthcare companies. S&P 500 earnings for the quarter are still expected to have declined 0.4 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed up 39.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,138.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.43 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,132.98 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.83 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,214.16.For the week, the Dow was down 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 was down 1 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 percent.Shares of Twitter (TWTR.N) fell 5.1 percent to $16.88 after Salesforce.com's (CRM.N) chief executive ruled out bidding for Twitter. Salesforce.com shares jumped 5.2 percent to $74.27.HP Inc (HPQ.N) fell 4.4 percent to $14.48 after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 80 new lows.
