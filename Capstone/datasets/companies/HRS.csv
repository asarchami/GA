1,"  * Harris showed no remorse for harm to his victims, judge says* Biggest name to face trial so far in ""Operation Yewtree"" probe into UK celebrities* Five decades at pinnacle of show business* Four victims spoke of harrowing experiences   (Adds quotes, details on sentence and other charges, background)By Costas PitasLONDON, July 4 Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris, a household name in his native Australia and adopted home Britain, was jailed for almost six years on Friday for repeatedly abusing young girls over decades as a beloved host of children's television.Handing down the sentence, Judge Nigel Sweeney said the 84-year-old, known for shows such as ""Rolf Harris Cartoon Time"" and songs including ""Two Little Boys"", had shown no remorse for the harm he had done to his victims.Harris was found guilty earlier this week of 12 counts of assaulting four girls, some as young as seven or eight, between 1968 and 1986.It was the second conviction in a long-running investigation into sex abuse by British celebrities that has led to soul searching in the country, revealing that some of its most prominent stars of the 1970s and 1980s were serial paedophiles who evaded detection for decades.""It is clear from the evidence that what you did has had a significant adverse effect on each victim,"" the judge told Harris, detailing how one woman had battled with alcoholism as a direct result of his abuse.""You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all."" During two months of evidence, the court heard how Harris  groped his victims, often while unsuspecting fans stood nearby.""You clearly got a thrill from committing the offences whilst others were present or nearby,"" the judge said.One victim said Harris had taken away her very ""essence"".""I have never felt safe since. I live in a constant state of anxiety,"" she said in her statement, read out in court by a prosecution lawyer. ""I know the person I am today is not the person I should have been.""An artist and musician who first earned fame in the 1950s with the top 10 hit novelty song ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport"", Harris went on to present prime-time TV shows mostly aimed at children during five decades at the pinnacle of show business. In 2005 he painted Queen Elizabeth's portrait. Since Monday's guilty verdicts he has been stripped of several honours both in Britain and Australia.Harris was the biggest name to go on trial since British police launched ""Operation Yewtree"" to investigate celebrity child abuse, following revelations two years ago that late BBC TV host Jimmy Savile had been a prolific child abuser.On Friday, Harris sat motionless as the judge read out the sentence at a packed courtroom at London's Southwark Crown Court. He was later led from the dock, wearing a grey suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie.During the trial, the prosecution had portrayed the bearded, bespectacled entertainer as a predator who groomed and abused one woman for her entire teenage and young-adult life.The London court was told he first assaulted the woman when she got out of the shower aged 13, and then repeatedly abused her until she was 28 years old. WIDE-REACHING INVESTIGATION Defence lawyer Sonia Woodley had asked for leniency due to the 84-year -old's health, age, his charity work and the ailing health of his wife, who has attended court most days but was not present on Friday.In sentencing, Judge Sweeney said Harris would only have to serve half his five year and nine month sentence behind bars.He also will not face four other, separate charges of making and possessing indecent images of children, which were not part of the trial and which he denies. Britain's Crown Prosecution Service decided it was no longer in the public interest to pursue those charges in light of this week's convictions.Police launched the wide-reaching Operation Yewtree into historic sex crimes in the wake of the disclosures that Savile, who died in 2011 at 84, had managed to escape detection while abusing hundreds of children over the course of decades.As one of Britain's best known celebrities, Savile had used his fame to gain access to victims and deflect suspicion, raising questions of whether other stars exploited a showbiz culture of impunity to abuse children in the 1970s and 1980s.Since then, a dozen ageing British media luminaries have been the target of investigations over decades-old child abuse allegations.The country's most well known publicist, Max Clifford, was found guilty in May of indecently assaulting teenage girls some 30 years ago as part of the investigation and sentenced to eight years in prison.However, the police enquiries have been labelled a witch hunt by some of those placed under investigation, following  decisions not to prosecute several high profile household names.

15,"   By Sharon Bernstein | SACRAMENTO, Calif.  SACRAMENTO, Calif. California state lawmaker Rocky Chavez on Thursday became the first Republican to jump into the race for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated next year by Democrat Barbara Boxer.Chavez, a retired Marine colonel who represents part of San Diego County in the State Assembly, faces an uphill battle against Democratic state Attorney General Kamala Harris in the heavily blue state.But Chavez predicted he would win support from Californians concerned about national security, the economy and the state's troubled public education system.""If things get worse overseas, who would Californians want representing them in the Senate? A lawyer from San Francisco or a Marine colonel who knows how lives can be protected?"" Chavez said, citing the threat from the Islamic State militant group.Chavez has charted a mostly centrist course since winning election to the Legislature in 2012, backing immigration reform and same-sex marriage while saying that as a Catholic, he opposes abortion. He has also supported education reform, introducing a bill to loosen some job protections for teachers. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa flirted for weeks with a run after Boxer announced her retirement in January. The Democrat said last week he would not seek the job.Harris' spokesman, Brian Brokaw, said on Thursday she ""welcomes Assemblyman Chavez to the race and believes anyone should run for office if that's how he or she believes California can be best served.""A Field poll released last month showed 46 percent of likely voters were inclined to support Harris, compared with 20 percent for Chavez among a list of potential candidates. Forty-nine percent of respondents said they would support former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a Republican, if she sought the seat. Rice has not said if she would consider a run.

16,"  (Repeating story to additional subscribers with no changes to text)By Alwyn ScottNEW YORK, March 10 U.S. aerospace company Exelis Inc is close to unveiling a low-altitude surveillance system for drones, the latest sign of how a ""highway in the sky"" is likely to evolve.The system, whose existence has not been previously reported, shows how Exelis and other companies are racing to create technology that enables drones to safely fly over long distances to do everything from inspections of remote pipelines to surveys of crops or delivery of packages.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration recently proposed regulations that largely ban unmanned aircraft systems from many of those tasks by requiring that remote pilots keep the drones in sight. This is giving foreign companies the chance to leap ahead of the U.S. in figuring out how to best exploit drone technology.But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is working with Exelis and other companies, universities and government agencies, to develop an air traffic management system that could persuade the FAA to allow flights beyond the line of sight, provided the operator is using such a tracking system.Exelis' products, called Symphony UAS-Vue and RangeVue, are significant because Exelis has a head start on competitors: It has the exclusive right to use a data feed it already supplies the FAA to track manned aircraft, using 650 ground stations. It will augment the feed with lower-altitude data that pinpoint drone locations, says Exelis, which is being taken over by communications company Harris Corp in a $4.75 billion deal.""For any drone that needs to go beyond line of sight, this is a potential solution,"" Edward Sayadian, vice president of civil aerospace systems at Exelis, told Reuters. .Exelis said it plans to announce the products this month and make RangeVue available this summer at some of the six sites the FAA has set up to test drones. The company developed the system quickly in the last six months, and hasn't yet set prices. While Exelis sees potential markets overseas, it is focused initially on the U.S., where it can leverage its ground stations and FAA feed. It also wants to be part of whatever overall system the FAA adopts after NASA finishes work on the prototype in three to five years.In the meantime, Exelis said it plans to market its UAS-Vue and RangeVue directly to companies that want to operate drones commercially in the U.S.SAFETY FEARS NASA and the industry face steep challenges overcoming fears of thousands of drones crisscrossing the skies, crashing into planes and people. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll recently found 73 percent of U.S. respondents want drone regulations. When drones are in the same airspace as airliners, ""I need to be able to see them on my display just like I see a 747,"" said Capt. Tim Canoll, president of the Air Line Pilots Association International, the world's largest union for pilots.Canoll and aviation safety experts also worry about latency, the lag time as control commands are transmitted to drones, and what happens when the control link is lost and the drone is out of control.Other companies also are addressing drone safety. San Francisco-based startup DroneDeploy, for example, has a system that automatically checks the drone's battery life, surrounding terrain, weather and other parameters and prevents flight if there's a problem. NoFlyZone.org, based in El Segundo, California, is building a database to keep drones away from private residences and other properties. Airware, based in San Francisco, is building an operating system for commercial drones that works with a variety of aircraft, cameras and other tools. Sagetech, of White Salmon, Washington, is making transponders for drones so that they can send location data to a system like the one Exelis has built.Amazon.com Inc is developing its own technology for drone package delivery, known as Prime Air, but says it sees the importance of a drone traffic management system and is working with NASA on the prototype.""We won't launch Prime Air until we are able to demonstrate safe operations,"" said Gur Kimchi, vice president of Amazon Prime Air. NASA has decades of experience with air traffic management research and development, and plans multiple ""builds"" of the prototype unmanned aircraft traffic management (UTM) system. NASA's system will provide services such as airspace configuration, weather and wind data, strategic flows of drones, sequencing, separation management between drones and contingency support, said Parimal Kopardekar, the NASA principal investigator of the project at the Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley.It also will allow ""geo-fences"" to be placed around airports and other sensitive areas such as the White House, where a small quad copter breached a security perimeter and crash landed in January.MOVING MAP Exelis' drone tracker will show terrain, weather and airspace boundaries in real time. The system can be called up on tablets and laptops, and can send emails and text message alerts if a drone is in a danger area.""It's like the moving map that you have on the GPS in your car,"" Exelis' Sayadian said.Exelis also is creating portable relay stations that can be set up in the field to extend the range a drone can fly away from the pilot. It plans to test them on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline this year.Though NASA is working with Exelis, it said other communications companies also could provide drone tracking in the final system. The system that is ultimately adopted could be operated and maintained by federal, state or local governments - or by private companies using a fee for service model, NASA says.A spokeswoman for the FAA, which will chose the final configuration, said it is too early to discuss what the system might look like.(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Martin Howell)",2015-03-10,HRS,"Tue Mar 10, 2015 | 7:00am EDT","RPT-INSIGHT-Exelis to offer drone-tracking system as industry, NASA seek to ease safety fears",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-drones-exelis-idUSL1N0WB29B20150310?type=companyNews

19,"   By Nia Williams | CALGARY, Alberta  CALGARY, Alberta Suncor Energy Inc has launched a pilot project to replace the high-pressure steam used to extract bitumen from oil sands with radio frequency technology developed by U.S. defense contractor Harris Corporation.Canada's largest oil and gas company, which produces 440,000 barrels per day from Alberta's oil sands, said on Tuesday that the technology could significantly reduce costs, greenhouse gas emissions and water usage.Alberta's oil sands are the world's third-largest crude reserves after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and a leading source of U.S. crude imports.However, breakeven costs for new projects are some of the highest globally. And the carbon-intensive process of using steam to liquefy the tar-like bitumen trapped in the sand has attracted fierce opposition from environmental groups.""Anytime you can develop a resource that is more environmentally benign and economically advantageous is going to be a strategic advantage. I would say it's going to be critical to the long-term success of oil sands,"" said Mark Bohm, manager in situ technology development at Suncor. The small-scale pilot will run for two years at Suncor's Dover oil sands project in northern Alberta. Production rates are expected to be equivalent to a normal thermal project but use 75 percent less energy.Harris approached Suncor with the idea of using radio waves in oilfields more than five years ago. It is a partner in the $44 million ($34.55 million) project along with Devon Energy Corp, CNOOC Ltd subsidiary Nexen and Alberta's Climate Change and Emissions Management Corp. The technology uses a generator on the surface connected by a cable to transmit radio frequency energy down the well and turn the steel liner into an antennae, heating the bitumen.Small amounts of light hydrocarbons like propane or butane, which can be recycled, are pumped into the well to enable the bitumen to flow at around 70 Celsius (158 Fahrenheit), well below the 200C reached when using high-pressure steam.Suncor turned on power at the Dover project at the end of May and said it will take up to a couple of months to warm the reservoir to the point where solvent can be injected. Gary Bunio, Suncor's general manager of oil sands strategic technology, said the pilot will help determine how much could be saved in operating and capital costs and whether it was worth the investment even in the current low oil price environment.

24,"  (Adds details)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Dec 8 The U.S. Air Force's top space official on Tuesday slammed a new ground control system for GPS satellites being built by Raytheon Co as ""a disaster"" and said the Pentagon planned ""significant"" changes with the company to address the issues.General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command, spoke after attending a session on the program last Friday led by the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall.Air Force spokeswoman Captain Annmarie Annicelli said the  Air Force would develop new cost estimates for the troubled GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, to reflect an additional two-year delay in completing its development. Air Force officials earlier this year said the program had an 80.5 percent cost increase, to $1.6 billion, and a two-year delay due to increased cyber security requirements and issues with the contractor's performance.Hyten, speaking with reporters after an event, said Raytheon had completed an initial system called Block 0 to launch and fly the satellites, but more sophisticated software was needed to take full advantage of all the GPS signals over the longer term.He said the Air Force initially underestimated the challenge of securing the system from cyber attacks and later had to revise its approach. But he said Raytheon also ""did a really bad job"" of systems engineering before it began developing software code. ""The OCX program is a disaster, just a disaster, and it's embarrassing to have to stand in front of people and try to defend it, so I won't,"" Hyten told the event. ""When you start down a path and you basically can't deliver and you keep pushing the system out to the right, and you keep pouring money at it, and the contractor does not deliver, you're in a tough spot.""Matt Gilligan, Raytheon's vice president for navigation and environmental solutions, said the company was focused on continued development of the system. ""We are fully committed to delivering, without compromise, the modernized GPS ground controls envisioned and required by the Air Force,"" Gilligan said in a statement to Reuters.Kendall last week told reporters the department was looking at a range of options for the program, including opening part of the work to a new competition. Neither the Pentagon nor the Air Force had any immediate comment on Tuesday on possible further steps to open part of the work to competition.The OCX system is to allow the Air Force to operate its newest GPS III, or global positioning system, satellites to help the military target weapons strikes, provide critical timing information and deliver critical services for industry.Lockheed Martin Corp's program to build the GPS III satellites also ran into trouble, but is back on track after delays involving a sensor built by Exelis Inc, which is now owned by Harris Corp.

35,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Harris Corporation's (HRS)  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and long term issue ratings at 'BBB-' and  Short-Term IDR and commercial paper ratings at 'F3'. In addition, the Rating  Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable. Fitch's ratings covered  approximately $4.8 billion of outstanding debt as of April 1, 2016. A full list  of rating actions appears at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are supported by the company's competitive position in the defense  industry; technology capability; sizable international and commercial sales;  good product diversification; adequate liquidity; and large backlog. The company  has solid cash generation and strong operating margins and is expected to  further improve its operations with the realized cost savings from the XLS  acquisition. The ratings are also supported by adequate financial flexibility  and by the stabilization of the company's main end market in fiscal 2016 (ending  in June).  Fitch has revised the Rating Outlook to Positive based on expectations that HRS  will continue reducing its leverage over the next two years through both  voluntary and scheduled debt reductions and improving operating results. The  continued impact of the Exelis (XLS) acquisition in May 2015 has left HRS'  leverage metrics weak for the ratings despite significant de-leveraging during  fiscal 2016. As of the last 12 months ended April 1, 2016, the company's  leverage (debt/EBITDA) and adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) were 2.9x  and 3.1x, respectively, down from 4.1x and 4.2x at the end of fiscal year ended  July 3, 2015. As of mid-April 2016, HRS had repaid approximately $683 million of  the term loans incurred in the XLS acquisition. HRS is on track to retire a  total of $1.8 billion of the acquisition-related debt by the end of fiscal 2018  to bring its net debt leverage to 1.5x (Fitch estimated 1.7x gross leverage).  Fitch believes the company is committed to achieving its leverage target and we  anticipate the majority of excess cash will be used for debt retirement over the  next two years. Fitch expects HRS' leverage and adjusted leverage will decline  to 2.4x and 2.7x, respectively, by the end of fiscal 2017. FFO adjusted leverage  is also expected to improve to 3.8x during the same time frame, down from 5.9x  at the end of fiscal 2015.  The majority of the company's non-leverage metrics (profitability, diversity,  backlog, etc.) are indicative of a strong investment-grade company. HRS is a  sole source provider for many of its products and generates solid operating cash  driven by strong margins and effective cost management. HRS' fiscal 2016 revenue  growth has been softer than previously anticipated, largely due to the impact of  the energy market downturn on CapRock, slowdown in military spending by the  company's Middle East customers, completion and/or losses of several projects,  and year-over-year declines in XLS' legacy communications segment.  Fitch expects HRS' revenue at the end of fiscal 2016 will be more than $500  million short of Fitch's prior fiscal 2016 revenue projections. Significant and  unexpected declines in CapRock revenues resulted in a non-cash goodwill  write-down of $367 million (pre-tax) during the second quarter of fiscal 2016  (2Q16). As a result of the revenue headwinds, the aforementioned write-down, and  sizable one-time XLS integration costs, the company's operating margins were  modestly lower in fiscal 2016 compared to Fitch's expectations.  Fitch anticipates HRS' EBITDA margins will be higher than 22% in fiscal 2017 and  beyond, driven by the completion of the integration efforts and significant  run-rate savings in the range of $140 million to $150 million. In addition,  Fitch expects the company will generate above $500 million of free cash flows  (FCF) annually after giving effect to sizable annual cash outlays associated  with the dividends of more than $250 million, capital expenditures of  approximately $200 million, and pension contributions of approximately $175  million. Fitch is concerned with HRS' exposure to shocks and downturns in U.S. military  spending or shifts in spending mix. The fiscal 2015 U.S. defense budget hit a  trough (base budget and wartime spending), and it began rising in fiscal 2016.  Fitch still considers the defense outlook to be somewhat uncertain, partly due  to the Pentagon's intense focus on lowering costs, which could impact the  sector's profitability, as well as the continued risk of sequestration after  fiscal 2017. Fitch considers HRS' portfolio to be of good quality, with highly  diversified strategically important and growing programs. Additionally, the  exposure to the U.S. defense spending is mitigated by a sizable international  and commercial presence. Fitch also notes that despite the larger scale that  resulted from the XLS acquisition, HRS remains smaller than many of its key  competitors. Fitch is also concerned by HRS' large pension deficit (including a relatively  high percentage of Level III assets) and corresponding future pension funding  requirements, and the impact on cash flows upon expiration of Highway and  Transportation Funding Act of 2014. At the end of fiscal 2015, HRS' pension  plans were underfunded by approximately $2 billion (approximately 69% funded), a  slight improvement from $2.1 million deficit (also 69% funded) at the end of  fiscal 2014. The pension benefit obligation (PBO) was $6.5 billion at the end of  fiscal 2015, while the other post-retirement benefit obligation was $445 million  (approximately 58% funded). In fiscal 2016, HRS plans to make a contribution in  the range of $170 million to $180 million to its qualified pension plans and we  expect future contributions will remain in the similar range for the next  several years. The large pension deficit and required contributions are  mitigated by expected reimbursements from the U.S. government, which treats a  part of pension costs as allowable and reimbursable under some contracts. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for HRS include: --Flat sales through 2017 and low single-digit revenue growth thereafter;  --EBITDA margins at approximately 21% in fiscal 2016. Margins are expected to  increase above 22% in the following years;  --Debt repayment will be accelerated and driven by the company's cash  generation;  --Dividends will increase annually; --Share repurchases will resume in fiscal 2017. Fitch expects share repurchase  amounts will depend on internal cash generation and may not resume in fiscal  2017 if the company's is not on target to achieving its net leverage goal of  1.5x by the end of fiscal 2018; --Cash flow generation will be solid and the company will generate above $500  million FCF annually after giving effect to pension contributions and dividends;  --The company will make contributions between $170 million and $180 million  towards its pension liabilities annually; --HRS will not make material debt-funded acquisitions over the rating horizon;  --Capital expenditures will fluctuate in the range of 2.25% to 2.50% of  revenues. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future actions that may individually or collectively cause Fitch to take a  positive rating action include continued de-leveraging which would lead to  sustained leverage in the range of 2x to 2.25x and adjusted leverage below  2.75x, and sustained FFO adjusted leverage below 3x. Fitch may also consider  positive rating action if a stabilization of the oil and gas market or faster  EBITDA margin improvements translate into better than expected operating  results.  Future actions that may individually or collectively cause Fitch to take a  negative rating action include if the company's leverage and adjusted leverage  remain above 2.75x and 3.25x, respectively, for a prolonged and sustained period  of time. Fitch may also consider a negative action if the company's FCF margin  declines and remains below 4%. Additionally, it may also be considered if the  company engages in sizable share repurchases or acquisitions prior to reducing  leverage. LIQUIDITY As of April 1, 2016, HRS' $1.3 billion liquidity was composed of approximately  $302 million of cash and cash equivalents and a fully available $1 billion  revolving credit facility with no outstanding letters of credit. Fitch expects  the company's liquidity will remain steady over the next several years as we  anticipate its cash balances will not increase due to rapid debt repayment.  HRS has sizable maturities over the next two years as the XLS legacy $250  million senior unsecured notes and the $500 million senior unsecured notes  become due in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, respectively. In addition, Fitch  estimates that as of mid-April 2016, the company had approximately $300 million  outstanding on each of its three-year tranche and five-year tranche term loans,  which mature in fiscals 2018 and 2020, respectively. Fitch expects the company  will repay in full the three-year term loans and will pay down a significant  portion of the five-year term loan by the end of fiscal 2018 to achieve its 1.5x  net leverage target, and anticipates the company will manage the maturities with  internally generated cash.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Harris Corporation: --IDR at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured three- and five-year term loans at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Commercial paper at 'F3'.

43,"   By Mike Stone and Michael Flaherty  U.S. defense contractor Harris Corp (HRS.N) has launched the sale of parts of its Critical Networks division, according to people familiar with the matter, its first divestiture move after striking a deal with activist hedge fund Jana Partners.The asset sale, which could fetch more than $1 billion, comes after Harris, a major supplier of U.S. Army radios, signed an agreement with Jana in August to add two new independent directors to its board. Harris promised at the time to continue to assess its portfolio to identify non-core assets. Harris' information technology services operation, which sits within Critical Networks, is among the divisions up for sale, the people said this week, citing marketing materials sent to potential buyers. This and other parts of Critical Networks could draw more than $500 million in the sale, the sources said.The company's business that supplies communications services to the energy industry, known as Harris CapRock Communications, is also expected to be sold in a separate process, according to the sources. CapRock could also attract offers of more than $500 million, the sources said. Selling off sections of that division would help the company lower its energy industry exposure, in addition to reducing its debt load.    The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is not yet public. Harris declined to comment.Shares of Harris were flat at $91.38 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.The Melbourne, Florida-based company, with around $7.5 billion in annual revenue, is organized into four business segments: communication systems, which sells military and civilian radios; space and intelligence systems; electronic systems; and critical networks.  ""When we believe a business is not core to our strategy to drive shareholder value, we undertake proactive steps, as evidenced by the recent sale of Aerostructures and the sale of our commercial healthcare and broadcast communications businesses in prior years,"" Harris CEO Bill Brown told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Aug. 2.Harris said in its fiscal year-end report that revenue pressure would likely increase next year. It pointed to CapRock's energy industry exposure and weakness in its IT segment as among the reasons behind the revenue pressure.  The company's fiscal 2016 net income dipped 3 percent to $324 million, it said in August. The company's shares have risen 5.3 percent year-to-date, while the S&P 500 Index .INX is up 5.9 percent.
