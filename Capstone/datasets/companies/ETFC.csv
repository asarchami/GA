0,"  NEW YORK E*Trade Financial Corp, the smallest of the publicly traded online discount brokers, gave its chief executive officer $13.5 million in compensation in his first year on the job, based on his performance ""during an important transition period"" and comparisons with pay for comparable industry executives.In its annual proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, the New York-based bank and brokerage firm said Paul Idzik, a former Barclays Bank retail banking executive who joined in January 2013, received $4.42 million in cash and $9 million of stock that vests over four years.The company's compensation committee said the stock was a signing bonus and E*Trade does not intend to give him additional equity over the next two years under his employment agreement.Idzik is the seventh chief executive at E*Trade since late 2007 as the company struggled to emerge from billions of dollars of bad loans from its attempt to balance volatile brokerage earnings with what its former management believed was stable banking revenue.Since Idzik's arrival, he has replaced most senior executives, sold $2 billion of loans, raised the company's capital levels, revamped its marketing campaign and focused the company on its core brokerage operations. E*Trade also received permission from regulators in late 2013 to begin transferring capital from its bank subsidiary, which it is keeping to hold clients cash, to fund its brokerage operations.Navtej Nandra, a former colleague of Idzik's when both were consultants at Booz Allen, received $2.13 million in cash for the nine months he served last year as president after leaving his position at Morgan Stanley's investment management unit. Nandra, who is putting a big emphasis on delivering E*Trade services digitally, also received restricted stock in February valued at $2.1 million on its grant date. Chief Financial Officer Matthew Audette, the only senior executive remaining from the management team prior to Idzik's arrival, received a 3.8 percent raise in total compensation from 2012 to $2.2 million.Excluding Idzik's $9 million stock-based signing bonus, his $4.4 million pay in 2013 compares with $6.5 million in total compensation received by TD Ameritrade Holding Corp CEO Fred Tomczyk for the company's fiscal year that ended September 30, 2013. Charles Schwab Corp., the largest competitor to E*Trade by capitalization, paid its CEO Walt Bettinger $10.2 million in 2012 but has not yet reported his 2013 compensation.Shares of E*Trade were down slightly on Tuesday morning at $23.87 per share.(This story has been refiled to add CEO's first name in second paragraph, adds slug)(Reporting by Jed Horowitz; Editing by Chris Reese)",2014-03-25,ETFC,"Tue Mar 25, 2014 | 12:26pm EDT",E*Trade pays CEO Idzik $13.5 million in his maiden year at firm,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-etrade-financl-ceo-compensation-idUSBREA2O1AR20140325?type=companyNews
1,"   By Jed Horowitz and Neha Dimri  E*Trade Financial Corp (ETFC.O) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by a surge in customer trading activity and progress in reducing its bank subsidiary's portfolio of bad loans.Net income at the discount brokerage company nearly tripled to $97 million, or 33 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $35 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.That handily beat analysts' average forecast of 23 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's net revenue rose 13 percent to $475 million, also beating analysts' average estimate of $454.6 million.E*Trade, which was on the brink of failure during the financial crisis due to its bank's subprime mortgage portfolio, set aside $4 million to cover loan losses, well below a $43 million provision in the first quarter of 2013. That was partly because it sold $800 million of troubled residential loans at a profit during the quarter, reducing its loan portfolio to $7.4 billion.E*Trade said re-engagement of individual investors in the firm's core business of trading stocks and options after years of caution played a big part in its quarterly gains.""Customers were overwhelmingly bullish,"" Paul Idzik, the company's chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call. Favorable economic conditions and few alternative investment choices brought client activity to ""levels not seen in years,"" he said. He also insisted that E*Trade takes pain to ensure that its customers trades are executed at the best possible price. Shares of E*Trade and other discount brokers were battered earlier this month after publication of Michael Lewis's book ""Flash Boys"" said that markets were rigged.The book raised concerns that regulators could end discount brokers' practice of selling customers' stock and option orders to market-makers and exchanges for execution, a practice known as ""payment for order flow.""In an unusual disclosure, E*Trade Chief Financial Officer Matt Audette said on the conference call that the company received $25 million in such payments in the first quarter. Earlier Wednesday, competitor TD Ameritrade Holding AMTD.N also defended its order flow practices but declined to disclose how much revenue they produce.Idzik joined E*Trade in January 2013 with a mission to return the company to its discount brokerage roots. In his year at the helm he has replaced virtually his entire management team. He also oversaw the demise of the company's famous E*Trade talking baby TV ads because they were not appealing to the core constituency of investors. TRADING EXPLODES Idzik has also helped restore the sustainability of the company's bank that it still uses to hold client cash.Discount brokers' profits are tied to both customer trading activity and rising interest rates that let them capture a big return on the cash customers leave in their accounts.Rates remain low, but trading has exploded as investors shake off the long-lingering effects of the 2008-2009 market collapse and search for returns they cannot get from bonds or bank accounts. The enthusiasm for markets also boosted the firm's interest revenue as customers borrowed in their margin accounts to buy stocks. Margin balances of $7.3 million at the end of the quarter were at their highest level in six years, Idzik said.Daily average trades at the company hit 198,000 in the quarter, the highest level in almost five years. Its average commission rate fell 6 percent to $10.64 per trade because stock trading was stronger than more expensive options trading.E*Trade as of March 31 had 3.1 million brokerage accounts, up 5 percent from a year earlier and 2 percent since the end of 2013. The company said clients are closing accounts at a record-low annual rate of 7.1 percent.Analysts at Wells Fargo raised their rating on E*Trade stock to ""outperform"" from ""market perform"" before the results were released on Wednesday, saying E*Trade was likely to continue using capital at its bank to pay down expensive debt and thus eliminate its high interest payments.In the first quarter, regulators allowed E*Trade's bank to lend the company $75 million. The firm also sold $800 million of subprime home mortgage loans and booked $76 million on the sale of its market-making business during the quarter.Shares of E*Trade, up 117.6 percent over the past 12 months, gained another 3.3 percent in after-hours trading to $22.20.

The biggest U.S. discount broker said on Wednesday that its clients made an average of 492,000 daily trades in the quarter, a firm record.Last week, discount broker Charles Schwab Corp  reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit due to a rise in trading commissions and fees for managing client assets.E*Trade's total headcount, including consultants, rose 7 percent to 3,144 people in the quarter.

4,"  NEW YORK, June 2 E*Trade Financial Corp on Monday said its customers averaged about 148,000 trades a day in May, down 14 percent from their daily volume in April and about 9 percent lower than in May 2013.Investors and analysts monitor monthly trading data from discount brokers such as E*Trade to get a sense of investor confidence in the stock market and investing in general. Assets flowing into mutual funds along with trading in individual stocks has gradually increased in recent years from very low levels following the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.Though trading was especially strong at the end of 2013, it has been declining on a monthly basis this year at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, Charles Schwab Corp and E*Trade, the largest publicly traded brokerage firms that offer low-commission trading to retail investors.E*Trade's monthly trading report is the first among the discount brokers this year to register a year-over-year decline. In April, its daily average trades were 21 percent higher than in the same month of 2013, though down 13 percent from March 2014. Daily trades at E*Trade, the smallest of the three discount brokerage firms with about 3.1 million brokerage accounts, averaged 197,000 in March, 171,000 in April and 148,000 in May. The March and April trading data were higher than for the comparable months in 2013, but May's average daily trading volume was off from almost 163,000 in May 2013.TD Ameritrade and Schwab have not yet reported their May trading metrics, but have reported steadily decreasing month-over-month trading in each of this year's first four months. E*Trade plans to issue additional May data as part of its standard monthly report on or about June 13. It released the trading number early to conform with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's fair disclosure requirements because it is presenting the monthly data to stock analysts at a meeting on Monday evening.The company also said Monday that regulators allowed it to move $75 million from its bank subsidiary to the parent company this quarter, a sign that E*Trade continues to recover from bad loans at the bank that nearly killed the company during the financial crisis.

The company earned $86 million in last year's third quarter. Total net revenue rose to $461 million from $446 million a year earlier.

10,"  NEW YORK E*Trade Financial Corp, the discount broker and bank that almost collapsed during the financial crisis, said on Monday it will retire $800 million of debt due in 2019 and issue $460 million of new eight-year notes at a lower interest rate.The new senior notes were priced Monday afternoon at par and will pay investors an annual rate of 4.625 percent, lower than analysts had forecast. The notes that are being retired paid interest of 6.375 percent, meaning E*Trade's interest costs should decline by about $30 million a year.The debt restructuring cuts the company's outstanding debt by $340 million to a 10-year low of $1 billion. Executives had publicly forecast they would meet the $1 billion debt goal this year, but none of the 16 Wall Street analysts following E*Trade expected it to have enough cash to redeem debt in the first half of 2015. E*Trade will have to pay about $70 million to investors as a ""make-whole"" premium since the notes it is redeeming were not callable until November 2015. It will recognize the loss this quarter. Regulators enabled the move by removing constraints on E*Trade's cash-rich brokerage to send money to its parent. E*Trade Securities upstreamed about $430 million this quarter, and regulators have allowed the once-crippled E*Trade Bank to send $550 million to the parent since the third quarter of 2013.E*Trade will combine the net proceeds from its new notes with $432 million now on its balance sheet to redeem its 2019 notes. It used cash in November when it replaced $940 million of senior notes paying 6 percent and 6.75 percent with $540 million of 5.375 percent 10-year senior notes.  The new eight-year issue matures in September 2023, but is callable as of March 15, 2018. E*Trade also said it received a vote of confidence from its banks, which increased its revolving credit line of $200 million by another $50 million. The company has not drawn on the line, which is now at the limit set by loan covenants, a spokesman said.  Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs & Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co are joint book-runners on the new issue. Credit Suisse Group and Wells Fargo & Co are co-managers.Shares of E*Trade closed up 45 cents, or 1.7 percent at $26.49 on Monday.

In his nine months as president of E*Trade in his inaugural 2013 year, Nandra earned $2.14 million.The pay increase underscores the longstanding Wall Street perception that executives with an investment banking background like Nandra command higher pay than those who come from commercial banking and other financial fields.The pay hike, which compares with $5.3 million for Idzik, reflects Nandra's role running the bank and brokerage company's core businesses, according to E*Trade's annual proxy notice filed on Wednesday. Nandra, who will be 48 when E*Trade holds its annual meeting on May 7, ran the international unit of Morgan Stanley Investment Management and was chief strategy officer for the firm's real estate investing and merchant banking division before joining E*Trade. He previously had led the diversified financial services unit of Merrill Lynch, among other positions.  His 2014 base salary of $800,000 was higher than the $500,000 received by Chief Financial Officer Matt Audette and Chief Administrative Office Michael Foley. It matched that of general counsel Karl Roessner, who joined E*Trade in May 2009 from law firm Clifford Chance US LLP to help the firm build stronger relations with bank and securities regulators.Audette previously was controller of an online commercial bank that E*Trade bought in 2000 and Foley was a consultant and former Barclays Bank PLC technology executive before joining E*Trade in 2013. Nandra received about double the cash and deferred stock awards, including more than 91,000 shares valued at $2.35 million, as Roessner, Audette and Foley.  Idzik, who will be 54 as of May 7, earned a cash bonus of $4.25 million, but did not receive a long-term stock bonus in 2014. He was paid $9 million of stock that vests over four years as part of the employment agreement he signed when he joined in January 2013, according to the proxy statement.  Nandra was ""directly or indirectly in charge of a significant portion of the company's business units and functions as well as the implementation of the company's business strategy,"" the compensation committee wrote in the proxy document that explained his pay.E*Trade reported net income of $293 million in 2014, up from $86 million in 2013 and a loss of $112.6 million in 2012.

14,"  E*Trade Financial Corp's first-quarter profit fell 59 percent, hurt by lower trading volume and losses related to retiring $73 million of corporate debt, the New York-based financial company said on Thursday.Excluding the debt retirement charge, the company earned $85 million, or 29 cents a share, down 12 percent from $97 million, or 33 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2014. Analysts had forecast profit of 24 cents a share, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/SE*Trade, which operates a discount broker-dealer and a bank, said net revenue fell 4 percent to $456 million. Operating expenses rose to $300 million from $290 million.Chief Executive Paul Idzik said on a conference call with analysts that E*Trade had made big strides in reducing bad subprime loans that brought it to the brink of bankruptcy during the financial crisis. It is no longer under close scrutiny from the Comptroller of the Currency, he said, but continues to be subject to special controls from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.E*Trade last quarter gained approval from regulators to shift capital from its bank to use in its core brokerage operations. It also has reduced its debt interest costs by more than 70 percent by buying back debt. ""With debt reduction behind us, we put our attention to how to put our capital to work,"" Idzik said, outlining new investments in technology, mobile trading and risk-management that the company is making.The company also shaved $617 million from its loan portfolio, and said its credit risk has diminished with each passing quarter. Like larger rivals Charles Schwab Corp and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, E*Trade said customers eased their trading during the volatile stock market of the first quarter and have pulled back even further in April. Average trades on which E*Trade charges commissions fell 14 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to 169,951 a day, even as the average commission per trade rose 3 percent to $10.94 from $10.64. The jump reflects increased customer use of option trades that cost more than stock trades. E*Trade added 39,000 customer accounts during the quarter while fee-based assets and margin balances from customers also rose. The higher margin borrowing to clients buying stocks helped bolster net interest revenue, the company said (Reporting by Amrutha Gayathri in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)",2015-04-23,ETFC,"Thu Apr 23, 2015 | 6:02pm EDT",E*Trade Financial first-quarter profit falls 59 percent,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-e-trade-financl-results-idUSKBN0NE2JF20150423?type=companyNews

16,"  NEW YORK May 6 E*Trade Financial Corp  will recognize an income tax benefit of about $225 million this quarter following a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the financial services company said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.The vast majority of the benefit will be used to reduce future tax bills, E*Trade wrote in its quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The settlement derives from an IRS examination of the deductibility of a loss realized in the third quarter of 2009 from exchanging interest-bearing corporate debt for non interest-bearing convertible debt. E*Trade, parent of a bank and a discount broker-dealer, was at the time under severe financial stress from making subprime mortgages. Settlement of the uncertain tax position occurred this month, the company reported. Separately, E*Trade said it was sued in a putative class-action in March for allegedly enriching itself and breaching its fiduciary duty by routing customers' orders to certain market-makers and exchanges.  E*Trade and other brokerage firms that process high volumes of retail trades are paid by certain professional traders and dealers for such orders. The company said it will ""defend itself vigorously"" against the suit, which was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California by defendant Ty Rayner on behalf of himself and others.

E*Trade said it will record a related pre-tax charge of about $410 million in the third quarter.  E*Trade's shares were up 3.4 percent in premarket trading at $26.23.
