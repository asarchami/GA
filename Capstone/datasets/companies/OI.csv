0,"  LONDON, March 24 The ACI, the global foreign exchange market's main industry umbrella group, will officially appoint former State Street executive Marshall Bailey as its first full-time president later this week.The move has been in the works for well over a year, according to an industry source, but comes as the $5.3 trillion-a-day market is under unprecedented scrutiny as regulators around the world probe allegations of price-rigging and collusion between traders.""It was decided 18 months ago to appoint a president, so it wasn't directly inspired by the FX fixing investigation. But it certainly has proved to be fortuitous,"" the source said. The ACI couldn't be contacted immediately for comment but its website lists him as ""president delegated"". On Bailey's LinkedIn page he is listed as ACI president starting March 2014. The announcement will be made later this week at the ACI's annual meeting in Berlin, which will bring together FX industry and market participants from around the world. He will be the first full-time president in an organisation whose leadership traditionally comes from senior bank managers taking on an extra, part-time role. Bailey had held senior positions at State Street for the past three years. Before that he was at Canadian investment bank RBC Capital Markets and Switzerland's UBS AG.Around 25 currency traders around the world have been placed on leave, suspended or fired as investigations into alleged wrongdoing in the foreign exchange market - the world's largest and one of its least-regulated - have gathered pace.

2,"  CARACAS, March 13 Venezuela said on Friday it has started the process of filing for the annulment of an award that orders the South American country to pay U.S. bottle maker Owens-Illinois $455 million in compensation for nationalizations.Seeking an annulment will automatically stay the award, Venezuela added, buying the cash-strapped OPEC nation time as it juggles major debt payments and other arbitration awards amid a deep recession exacerbated by lower oil prices.On Thursday, a lawyer for Venezuela told Reuters the country would likely seek an annulment, adding processing such a request would take between 18 and 30 months. The World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) issued the award on Tuesday. Owens-Illinois had originally sought $1 billion in compensation, the office of Venezuela's solicitor general added in the statement. In 2010, the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez nationalized the Dutch subsidiary OI European Group 's majority interest in two plants in a move typical of his 14-year-governance.""They've been exploiting workers, destroying the environment and taking Venezuelans' money,"" Chavez said at the time, according to the press release.
