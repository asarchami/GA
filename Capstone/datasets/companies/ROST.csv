0,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday charged four San Francisco-area men with insider trading in Ross Stores Inc stock options, and one of the four with insider trading in stock options of a company that was later bought by Oracle Corp.The alleged scheme resulted in more than $12.6 million of illegal profit and was centered on Saleem Khan, a former finance manager at a healthcare nonprofit, according to the regulator.Khan will begin a 1-3/4 year prison term on June 23 after pleading guilty in an unrelated case, court records show.According to the SEC, former Ross finance executive Roshanlal Chaganlal from 2009 through 2012 routinely tipped Khan about the apparel retailer's monthly sales results.Khan allegedly used the tips to make $11.4 million by trading Ross stock options for himself and his brother-in-law, and through intermediaries kicked $130,000 back to Chaganlal. The regulator said Khan also provided inside tips about Ross to his supervisor Ranjan Mendonsa and colleague Ammar Akbari, who made a respective $800,000 and $2,000 in Ross stock options.Khan was also accused by the SEC of making $450,000 by using tips from an Oracle insider to trade Taleo Corp stock options in the six days before Oracle agreed on Feb. 9, 2012 to buy that software company for $1.9 billion, an 18 percent premium.The SEC said Khan, Chaganlal and Akbari live in Dublin, California, where Ross is based, while Mendonsa lives in nearby San Ramon. It said they invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the agency's probe. Khan's lawyer, Chris Cannon, said: ""Saleem has made hundreds of short-term trades in Ross, many of which were unprofitable, and if he were trading on inside tips he would have been able to avoid the unprofitable trades.""Martin Sabelli, a lawyer for Chaganlal, declined to comment. Brian Berson, a lawyer for Akbari, said his client did not engage in insider trading. Garrick Lew, a lawyer for Mendonsa, was not immediately available for comment. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined to comment.The SEC civil lawsuit seeks to recoup illegal profit and fines. It also seeks an officer-and-director bar for Chaganlal, whose employment was terminated by Ross in December 2012.The case is SEC v. Khan et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 14-02743.

3,"  * Yellen says Fed should be cautious in rate hike decision* NATO issues condemnation after Russian convoy enters Ukraine* Retail shares surge, lifted by Ross Stores earnings* Indexes: Dow and S&P off 0.2 percent, Nasdaq up 0.1 percent   (Updates to close)By Akane OtaniNEW YORK, Aug 22 Stocks ended mostly lower on Friday as Ukraine-Russia tensions reignited and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen failed to give investors any clues on interest rate hikes.The S&P 500 retreated from a record close it set on Thursday after Ukrainian officials said Russia had launched a ""direct invasion"" by sending a convoy of trucks across the border. Investors had been hoping that Yellen would catapult the S&P to the milestone 2,000 level.While Russia has maintained the trucks contain humanitarian aid, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen condemned the move as an ""alarming build-up."" He called on Russia to ""stop destabilizing Ukraine.""""People are thinking maybe the convoy sent wasn't in line with an acknowledgment of a Red Cross-led endeavor and was something taken on by Russia unilaterally, which has reestablished a little bit of investor anxiety,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Markets were also pressured by comments from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi delivered remarks on the labor market.  Yellen did not give a timeline for Fed interest rate hikes, saying that with slack remaining in the labor market, ""there is no simple recipe for appropriate policy.""The comments ""were more hawkish than what the market was anticipating"" because Yellen kept the Fed's ability to hike interest rates sooner than expected on the table, said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist with Voya Investment Management.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.27 points, or 0.22 percent, to 17,001.22, the S&P 500 ended down 3.97 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,988.4 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 6.45 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,538.55. Despite the day's losses, all three major indexes posted gains for the week, with the Dow up 2 percent, the S&P up 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq up 1.6 percent. It was the strongest week of gains for both the Dow and the S&P since April, and the third straight week of gains for all three indexes.Retailers moved higher, led by a 7.4 percent advance in Ross Stores to $74.37 after the apparel and home fashion retailer posted second-quarter results. The S&P retail index  gained 0.6 percent, posting its best week since late February.The Nasdaq Composite was lifted by Keurig Green Mountain , whose shares soared 13.3 percent to $133.36. The K-cup coffee-pod maker said earlier in the day it had inked a deal to make and sell Kraft Foods Group Inc's coffee.Peregrine Semiconductor shares jumped 62.9 percent to $12.53 after Murata Electronics North America said it would buy the portion of the chipmaker it does not already own for $12.50 per share.About 4.1 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 5.1 billion.
