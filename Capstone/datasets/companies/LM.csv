6,"   By Ross Kerber  Asset manager Legg Mason Inc (LM.N) on Friday reported a profit in the year-end quarter but also gave a mixed picture of flows to its funds, highlighting the task its new chief executive Joseph Sullivan still faces to turn the company around.The results sent shares down 2 percent in morning trading to $42.42, slightly more than other asset managers. Still, Legg Mason has far outperformed peers over the twelve months ended January 30, a period its shares were up 56 percent.With $679.5 billion under management at the end of 2013 Legg Mason remains among the largest fund firms but lost ground during the financial crisis. The chief issue now is its ability to attract cash from investors. For the three months ended December 31 Legg Mason reported a net inflow of $9.9 billion, reflecting money put into its money-market funds.During the quarter, investors also added $700 million to its bond funds, but withdrew $700 million from Legg Mason's equity products. The results came as investors are returning to stock funds that should favor some of the company's equity-heavy divisions. Until Legg Mason can step up its flows, its valuation is likely to lag peers, wrote Sandler O'Neill analyst Michael Kim in a note to investors. He is maintaining his ""Hold"" rating on the stock.Others said the company deserves more credit considering other factors like better margins and buybacks that have reduced the number of Legg Mason shares outstanding. ""Margin Expansion, Lower Sharecount & Flattish Flows is a Victory"" was the headline on a note to investors from International Strategy & Investment Group analyst Glenn Schorr. Sullivan was named Legg Mason's chief executive in February of 2013 and since then he has wound down or sold smaller businesses, pushed for new products, and moved to renegotiate financial arrangements with some of its investment units. Among its units are the big Western Asset Management bond division and its ClearBridge equity shop.In an interview on Friday, Sullivan said his work is showing results, especially compared to past quarters in which Legg Mason reported steep outflows. ""We're clearly making progress in our flow trajectory, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""It's a significant improvement over the past year."" For its fiscal third quarter ended December 31, Legg Mason reported net income of $81.7 million, or 67 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $453.9 million, or $3.45 per share, in the same period a year ago, when it took impairment charges.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, on average, expected earnings of 66 cents per share in the most recent quarter.Assets under management of $679.5 billion were up from $656 billion at September 30, driven by $13.6 billion in market gains and foreign exchange factors, and net inflows of $9.9 billion.(Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Chizu Nomiyama and Sofina Mirza-Reid)",2014-01-31,LM,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 11:12am EST",Legg Mason posts profit but mixed flow picture on turnaround,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-legg-mason-results-idUSBREA0U0Q620140131?type=companyNews

42,"  (Fixed date in dateline)By Mike StoneNov 19 Private equity firm Lightyear Capital is looking to sell its majority stake in real estate investment manager Clarion Partners LLC for around $800 million, people familiar with the sales talks said this week.Lightyear helped Clarion's management buy the firm from its previous partner, Dutch financial services company ING Groep NV , in 2011. When that deal was struck, the price and ownership structure were not disclosed. New York-based Clarion's current management plans to retain its minority interest in the company after a sale, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the sale.Lightyear's stake in Clarion, which has more than $36.8 billion in assets under management, has attracted interest from a larger asset manager, Legg Mason Inc, according to one of the sources. Legg Mason could be eyeing Clarion because it could offer a specialized real estate investment management platform, that person said, noting that it is not clear if Legg Mason is still interested. Representatives for Clarion, Lightyear and Legg Mason declined to comment. There are very few real estate asset managers, and they are rarely for sale. However, in October, another asset manager, Russell Investments, was sold by the London Stock Exchange Group Plc to private equity firm TA Associates in transaction valued at $1.1 billion.Clarion invests in a broad range of real estate assets including office buildings, hotels, residential and retail. The firm offers individual and institutional investors the opportunity to invest in real estate funds as well as separate accounts.Founded in 1982, Clarion has 274 employees around the world in offices in Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, London, Los Angeles, São Paulo, Seattle and Washington, DC.

He won high regard for picking ""value"" stocks and making big bets on them with the Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust fund, which he left in 2011 and is now the ClearBridge Value Trust fund.In its heyday, the fund beat the S&P 500 every year from 1991 to 2005. A spokeswoman for Miller, 66, said he was traveling and not immediately available to comment.At the $1.3 billion Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, Miller's stock picking clearly had not been working, prompting investors to pull their money. This year, investors have made net withdrawals of $112 million from the fund and $779 million over the past five years, according to Lipper Inc, a unit of Thomson Reuters. The fund's 1-year return of -18.06 percent lags 98 percent of its peers and trails the 5.73 percent advance of the S&P 500 Index during that time, according to Morningstar.      Loren Fox, director of research at Ignites Research, which follows the fund industry, said Miller’s departure is mainly symbolic, given that he oversaw a relatively small amount of assets under management at Legg Mason in recent years. “While a star manager can create a marketable face for a firm, it can carry risks if that star underperforms” or runs into other troubles, Fox said.Miller showed flashes of his old self in 2012 and 2013, when his fund returned 40.68 percent and 68.03 percent, respectively. He outperformed 99 percent of his peers during those two years, according to Morningstar Inc.But his departure, as Wells Fargo equity analyst Christopher Harris put it, ""has no consequential bearing on (Legg Mason's) financials, given the relatively small amount of assets Miller now manages."" The Legg Mason Opportunity fund generated $18 million in management fees in 2015. By contrast, the Legg Mason Value Trust fund generated $121 million in fees in 2006, U.S. regulatory filings show. Legg Mason shares are down 29 percent over the past 12 months, compared with the S&P 500's 5 percent return. Miller had been the public face of Legg Mason for years and his performance troubles handicapped the firm’s recovery from the financial crisis. Legg Mason's record eventually drew the attention of activist hedge fund investor Nelson Peltz, who became a board member in 2009 and oversaw the replacement of the firm’s CEO in 2012. Peltz has since left the board and his firm, Trian Partners, sold most of its Legg Mason shares earlier this year.  The exodus from Miller's fund underscores a larger problem for active managers everywhere as they lose a flood of money to passively managed index funds. Since the end of 2008, Vanguard Group, the industry's king of index funds, has pulled in nearly $1 trillion in net deposits.Miller left the Value Trust fund in 2011 after the fund's downturn during the recession.""I am thankful to Legg Mason for our 35-year relationship and to the many great people I've worked with along the way,"" Miller said in a statement.With Miller's departure, Legg Mason said, Miller acquired Legg Mason's stake in LMM LLC, which provides investment management services to Legg Mason Opportunities Trust, Miller Income Opportunities Trust and related strategies.Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
