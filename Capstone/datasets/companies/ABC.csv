0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  AmerisourceBergen Corp.'s (NYSE: ABC) proposed $1 billion senior unsecured bond  issuance. Proceeds from the issuance are expected to be used for the redemption  of ABC's $500 million of unsecured bonds due Sept. 2015 and for general  corporate purposes, including the repurchase of stock. ABC's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A-', with a Stable Rating Outlook. A full  list of ratings for ABC follows at the end of this release. Fitch views the incurrence of additional debt - albeit for the repurchase of  stock - as tenable at the 'A-' rating. The stock repurchase is meant to offset  dilution associated with the pending warrant exercise by Walgreen Co. (WAG) and  Alliance Boots GmbH (AB) in 2016 and 2017. Fitch sees the relatively short  3-year tenor of one tranche, and the firm's assertion that repurchased stock  will be held for future re-issuance, as supportive of its dilution-offset  intentions. Fitch's current forecasts yield cash generation sufficient over the  ratings horizon to facilitate the repayment of the 3-year tranche upon maturity  in 2017. The issuance will, nevertheless, constrain ABC's ratings flexibility in the near  term, as Fitch estimates that reported debt leverage (gross debt-to-EBITDA) will  approximate 1.6x-1.7x, based on Fitch-calculated EBITDA of $1.18 billion for the  LTM period ended March 31, 2014. However, Fitch anticipates top-line and  earnings growth from ramping generic drug volumes to WAG over the remainder of  ABC's fiscal 2014 will be sufficient to drive moderation in reported debt  leverage to around 1.3x by Sept. 30, 2014. Notably, debt leverage sustained at  this figure provides limited flexibility for the incurrence of additional  long-term debt. The notes will rank pari passu with all currently existing unsecured debt and  include a change of control repurchase provision (at 101%) upon both a change of  control and subsequent downgrade of the notes to non-investment grade. Change of  control triggers are customary. KEY RATING DRIVERS -- U.S. drug distributors maintain stable operating profiles due to the  industry's oligopolistic nature and steady pharmaceutical demand. Drug  distribution, though low margin, is relatively insulated from pricing and  regulatory pressures faced by other areas of healthcare in the U.S. -- ABC maintains strong credit metrics through its consistently strong core cash  generation, efficient operations, and commitment to operating with low debt  leverage. The aforementioned issuance will push leverage toward the upper end of  the 'A-' ratings; but de-leveraging is expected owing to top-line and earnings  growth from ramping WAG generic drug volumes over the remainder of fiscal 2014. -- A strong liquidity position provides ample flexibility for the firm to fund  significant working capital and other cash requirements ahead of and during the  beginning of its distribution contract with Walgreens.  -- Fitch views favorably ABC's alignment with WAG and AB, as it provides  significant incremental distribution volumes and improved long-term growth  prospects and stability. Fitch expects the relationship will drive increased  top-line growth, stronger cash flows, and incremental margin expansion  opportunities over the ratings horizon, though initially resulting in a  significant drop in profit margins and material cash outflows for working  capital. -- Fitch believes there are limited growth opportunities in the traditional U.S.  drug distribution space. As a result, and now more so considering ABC's  alignment with WAG-AB, Fitch expects ABC to responsibly pursue growth in  service-related and non-U.S. markets (i.e. minority investment in Profarma  Distribuidora) over the intermediate- to longer-term. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of ABC's 'A-' long-term ratings will generally require the firm to  operate with gross debt leverage at or below 1.3x. EBITDA margins have declined  significantly in recent quarters due to the onboarding of the new Express  Scripts, Inc. and WAG distribution contracts. However, these contracts add  long-term stability to ABC's operations, and Fitch expects ABC to generate  steady to moderately expanding EBITDA margins beginning in second-half 2014, in  support of the firm's current ratings.  An upgrade to 'A' is not expected over the ratings horizon. Fitch believes ABC's  management would need to commit to operating with gross debt leverage below  0.75x, accompanied by increased profit margins and cash flows, to achieve an  upgrade to 'A'. Fitch does not expect ABC to commit to operating with such low  leverage in the near- to intermediate-term. Negative ratings momentum could be caused by greater and more direct pricing  pressures than Fitch currently expects and/or by a transaction which drives  leverage sustainably above 1.3x or that illustrates a departure from ABC's  traditional commitment to its core drug distribution business. Fitch notes the  risks associated with ABC's recently announced alignment with WAG-AB, including  cash outflows associated with working capital and the offsetting of dilution  associated with the exercise of warrants issued to WAG-AB, including stock  repurchases and hedging transactions. Nevertheless, Fitch does not expect these  risks to precipitate a negative rating action over the ratings horizon.  Fitch rates ABC as follows: --Long-term IDR 'A-';  --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Senior unsecured bank facility 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'; --Commercial paper 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term ratings  of AmerisourceBergen Corp. (NYSE: ABC) at 'A-' and the short-term ratings at  'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The rating actions apply to approximately $2 billion of debt at June 30, 2014. A  full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS -- U.S. drug distributors maintain stable operating profiles due to the  industry's oligopolistic nature and steady pharmaceutical demand. Drug  distribution, though low margin, is relatively insulated from pricing and  regulatory pressures faced by other areas of healthcare in the U.S. -- ABC maintains strong credit metrics through its consistently strong core cash  generation, efficient operations, and commitment to operating with low debt  leverage. The May 2014 debt issuance, which Fitch expects to be repaid upon  maturity in 2017, pushed leverage toward the upper end of the 'A-' ratings. But  de-leveraging is expected owing to growth from ramping Walgreen & Co (Walgreens)  generic drug volumes over the next few quarters. -- Fitch views favorably ABC's alignment with Walgreens and Alliance Boots GmbH  (AB), and the process to align the firms seems to have gone well so far. Fitch  expects the relationship will drive increased top-line growth, stronger cash  flows, improved stability, and incremental margin expansion opportunities over  the ratings horizon, despite the significant drop in profit margins and material  cash outflows for working capital initially. -- The ultimate effectiveness of ABC's strategy to offset stock dilution  associated with the pending warrant exercises by Walgreens in 2016-2017 is at  this time uncertain, as an increasing stock price may result in the need for  additional cash outflows. The firm's solid liquidity position and strong  operational cash generation provide an offset to this risk. -- Fitch believes there are limited growth opportunities in the traditional U.S.  drug distribution space. As a result, and now more so considering ABC's  alignment with WAG-AB, Fitch expects ABC to responsibly pursue growth in  service-related and non-U.S. markets (e.g. its minority investment in Profarma  Distribuidora) over the intermediate- to longer-term. RATING SENSITIVITIES ABC currently has somewhat limited flexibility at its present ratings.  Maintenance of its 'A-' long-term ratings will generally require ABC to operate  with gross debt leverage at or below 1.3x, accompanied by steady funds from  operations (FFO) in excess of $800 million annually. EBITDA margins, which  declined significantly in fiscal 2013 and 2014 due to the onboarding of the new  Express Scripts Holding Co. (Express Scripts) and Walgreens distribution  contracts, should show some improvement going forward, in support of the firm's  current ratings.  An upgrade to 'A' is not expected over the ratings horizon. Because of the  business's low margins, Fitch believes ABC's management would need to commit to  operating with gross debt leverage below 0.75x to achieve an upgrade to 'A'.  Fitch does not expect ABC to commit to operating with such low leverage in the  near- to intermediate-term. Negative ratings momentum could be caused by greater and more direct pricing  pressures than Fitch currently expects and/or by a transaction which drives  leverage sustainably above 1.3x or that illustrates a departure from ABC's  traditional commitment to its core drug distribution business. Fitch notes the  risks associated with ABC's recently announced alignment with Walgreens-AB,  including possible cash outflows associated with working capital or  hedging/anti-dilution transactions. But Fitch does not expect these risks to  precipitate a negative rating action over the ratings horizon. COMMITMENT TO STRONG CREDIT PROFILE Steady demand for pharmaceuticals contributes to an exceptionally stable  operating profile for U.S. drug distributors. The industry has proven rather  resilient to persistently depressed patient volumes, elevated levels of  unemployment, and constrained healthcare reimbursement in recent years.  Appropriately low EBITDA margins have grown steadily in recent years, owing  primarily to brand-to-generic conversions, efficiency improvements, and growth  in higher-margin businesses (i.e. specialty distribution, consulting services). ABC's credit profile also benefits from management's demonstrated commitment to  conservative financial management. Fitch expects the firm to remain committed to  operating with debt leverage, as adjusted for operating leases, below 1.5x.  (This figure implies Fitch-calculated unadjusted leverage of 1.2x-1.3x.) Fitch  generally views event risk associated with M&A to be limited given ABC's history  of sticking to its core competencies and management's demonstrated financial  discipline. TEMPORARILY LIMITED FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Unadjusted debt leverage of 1.6x at June 30, 2014 currently affords ABC limited  flexibility to issue additional debt, if necessary, to help fund cash outflows  associated with working capital and/or additional share repurchases meant to  offset dilution. However, ramping EBITDA contributions from the onboarding of  generic drug distribution volumes to Walgreens should help to moderate debt  leverage to below 1.3x during fiscal 2015. Fitch expects ABC to repay its $600  million of 2017 notes upon maturity, which is ABC's only debt due until 2019.  Furthermore, Fitch believes ABC's contract with Walgreens contributes to  improved operational efficiency and business stability, plus expected cost  savings and working capital improvement, offsetting the risk associated with  temporarily elevated debt leverage metrics. ALIGNMENT WITH WALGREENS A NET POSITIVE The unique 10-year, comprehensive distribution contract with Walgreens, which  began Sept. 1, 2013, will add materially to ABC's top-line and cash flows over  the next couple of years. Gross margins have declined in ABC's fiscal 2014 due  to the low-margin nature of distributing to a customer as large as Walgreens.  But Fitch expects the new Walgreens business will contribute to ABC's already  stable and highly efficient operations by allowing the firm to leverage the  fixed costs associated with drug distribution. Fitch forecasts EBITDA margins of approximately 1.3%-1.4% in ABC's fiscal 2014  and 2015, compared to 1.84% in fiscal 2012. Higher margins could be achieved  depending on the success of the generics procurement joint venture (JV) among  Walgreens, AB, and ABC. Expansion opportunities in adjacent businesses (i.e.  World Courier and consulting services) and in non-U.S. markets - especially in  partnership with AB - and growth in specialty and generics could also provide  margin upside over the ratings horizon. ADDITIONAL CASH MAY BE NEEDED TO SUPPLEMENT HEDGING STRATEGY  Significant cash outflows for working capital needed to onboard the Walgreens  business are now beginning to normalize, but cash needed to fund ABC's strategy  to offset dilution resulting from the expected warrants exercise by Walgreens in  2016 and 2017 may continue to pressure ABC's overall cash generation in fiscal  2014-2015. Fitch estimates that total cash outflows to accomplish the firm's  hedging strategy will exceed $1 billion, including around $370 million for the  capped call options ($163 million in 2013, $205 million in 2014) and $650  million to complete the firm's special share repurchase program ($142 million in  first nine months of 2014). According to ABC, these transactions are meant to  offset approximately 80% of the firm's exposure to warrant-related dilution.  In the event ABC's share price exceeds the ""cap"" price of a portion of the call  options contracts, additional cash may be needed to supplement the hedging  strategy. The firm may have some flexibility at 'A-' in 2016-2017 to use debt to  fund additional special share repurchases, as necessary. But Fitch forecasts  free cash flow (FCF; cash from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) to approach $1 billion in 2015 and beyond, providing ample cash flows  to fund possible supplemental share repurchases. ABC's liquidity profile is also  solid, comprising an undrawn $1.4 billion revolver and $1.26 billion of cash on  hand at June 30, 2014. In general, Fitch believes ABC will address these risks, including the issuance  of any possible incremental debt, in a manner appropriate at ABC's current  ratings of 'A-'. Furthermore, Fitch expects that working capital benefits and  cost savings related to the increased purchasing scale of the procurement JV  will more than offset these costs over the next few years. HIGHER CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION NOT A MATERIAL CONCERN Fitch acknowledges the risks generally associated with increased revenue  concentration, as represented by ABC's new contracts with Express Scripts and  Walgreens. But these risks are mitigated by the long-term and comprehensive  nature of the Walgreens distribution contract, as well as the costs that are  required to switch drug distributors, especially those related to technological  integration. Furthermore, Fitch believes ABC will benefit from the long-term  market growth connected with serving two of the largest pharmacy companies in  the U.S. Fitch estimates these two customers will account for roughly 45% of  ABC's revenues going forward. Notably, ABC's distribution contract with Express Scripts is set to expire in  September 2015. Although representing more than $20 billion in revenues, the  contract carries very low profit margins; thus, a negative rating action would  not likely occur in the event ABC lost this contract. TAILWINDS INCLUDE SPECIALTY, GENERICS, AND PROSPECT OF BIOSIMILARS ABC's incumbent leadership in the higher-growth and higher-margin specialty drug  distribution business is a material competitive advantage. Fitch expects ABC  will continue to grow other areas of its specialty business, including more  nascent therapeutic classes and non-U.S. markets (i.e. Brazil) in the longer  term, providing growth and margin support over the rating horizon. Brand-to-generic conversions will also continue to support profit margins. ABC  and its peers have benefited materially from the unprecedented wave of generic  launches in recent years. A few large branded products' expirations should  provide some margin support in calendar 2014-2015. While Fitch believes much of  the margin expansion achieved by drug distributors as a result of generic  conversions is durable, it will be harder to identify for ABC going forward due  to the impact of the lower-margin Express Scripts and Walgreens business.  Generic pricing as a whole has also been favorable to drug distributors in  recent quarters, but generic pricing deflation is expected to resume over the  longer term. The introduction of biosimilars to the U.S. drug channel - possibly as early as  2015 - will provide another area of potential margin growth for drug  distributors. ABC is uniquely positioned among its peers to benefit from  biosimilars, given its leadership position in specialty drug distribution and  its relationships with Walgreens and Express Scripts, which currently control  sizeable shares of the specialty pharmacy market. Fitch has affirmed ABC's ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-';  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A-'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

(NYSE: ABC), including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR),  on Rating Watch Negative. The short-term 'F2' ratings are affirmed. A full list  of rating actions, which apply to $2 billion of outstanding debt as of Sept. 30,  2014, follows at the end of this release. The rating actions follow ABC's announced acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply,  Inc. (NYSE: MWI) for approximately $2.5 billion. MWI is the largest distributor  of animal health pharmaceuticals and supplies in the U.S. and the only pure play  national player. RATING DRIVERS --The deal is strategically compelling. Relative to ABC's current core  businesses, animal health is generally categorized by more favorable pricing  dynamics and stronger growth prospects. The acquisition of MWI provides an  important medium- to longer-term growth opportunity for ABC, especially related  to production animals in developing markets. --Debt leverage of 1.4x at Sept. 30, 2014 is already elevated relative to ABC's  current 'A-' ratings. Additional ratings pressure will result from the $2  billion of planned new debt, effectively doubling ABC's total debt balance.  Ample de-leveraging in the 18-24 months following the deal is possible but will  be predicated on relatively strong margin expansion and cash generation  assumptions in fiscal 2015 and 2016. --Fitch does expect improving margins and robust cash generation for ABC in  fiscal 2015 stemming from a full year of Walgreens' generic drug distribution  volumes and continued favorable drug pricing trends. Fitch will review its  expectations for profitability and cash generation relative to cash outflows  required to offset dilution related to the Walgreens warrants and the $500  million May 2017 note maturity during the time leading up to the deal close. --Fitch views favorably ABC's alignment with Walgreen Co. (Walgreens) and  Alliance Boots GmbH, and the process to align the firms seems to have gone well  so far. Fitch expects the relationship will drive some top-line growth, stronger  cash flows, improved stability, and incremental margin expansion opportunities  over the ratings horizon, despite the significant drop in profit margins and  material cash outflows for working capital initially. --U.S. drug distributors maintain stable operating profiles due to the  industry's oligopolistic nature and steady pharmaceutical demand. Drug  distribution, though low margin, is relatively insulated from pricing and  regulatory pressures faced by other areas of healthcare in the U.S. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of ABC's current 'A-' ratings will require Fitch's expectation that  gross debt/EBITDA of 1.3x or below will be achieved within approximately 18-24  months of the deal's close. A one-notch downgrade could result if Fitch  concludes that this target is not achievable. Importantly, the de-leveraging  timeframe will be lengthened to include the repayment of the $500 million May  2017 notes. Fitch thinks such de-leveraging is possible, but with only $1 billion of  prepayable debt will likely require relatively strong margin expansion over this  timeframe. De-leveraging will be facilitated by ample FCF applied to the  repayment of the proposed term loan and ABC's $500 million of notes that mature  in May 2017. If the ratings are affirmed, flexibility will be very limited over  this period. Other negative ratings momentum could be caused by greater and more direct  pricing pressures than Fitch currently expects and/or by a transaction which  drives leverage sustainably above 1.3x or that illustrates a material departure  from ABC's traditional commitment to its core drug distribution business. Fitch  notes the risks associated with ABC's alignment with Walgreens-AB, including  possible cash outflows associated with working capital or hedging/anti-dilution  transactions. But Fitch does not expect these risks to precipitate a negative  rating action over the ratings horizon. An upgrade to 'A' is not expected over the ratings horizon. Because of the  business's inherent low margins, Fitch believes ABC's management would need to  commit to operating with gross debt leverage below 0.75x to achieve an upgrade  to 'A'. Fitch does not expect ABC to commit to operating with such low leverage  in the near to intermediate term. Fitch has placed the following ratings for ABC on Rating Watch Negative: --Long-term IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured bank facility rating 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes rating 'A-'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for ABC: --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper rating 'F2'.

14,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 06 (Fitch) The Rating Outlook for  AmerisourceBergen Corp.'s  (NYSE: ABC) 'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) remains Negative, according to  Fitch Ratings, following the announcement that the firm will acquire PharMEDium  Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (PharMEDium) for approximately $2.6 billion. PharMEDium is the largest provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations  to acute care hospitals in the U.S. The firm has been owned by private equity  sponsors Clayton Dubilier & Rice since 2013 and generated 2014 revenues of  roughly $375 million. NEGATIVE OUTLOOK DRIVEN BY PROLONGED HIGH LEVERAGE  Incremental short-term and term loan debt of approximately $1.4 billion are  expected to fund the deal, with the remainder of the purchase price being paid  out of cash on hand. Resulting gross debt/EBITDA is expected to approximate 2x  through fiscal year-end 2016. Elevated debt leverage is due, in part, to the  issuance of $650 million of three-year notes in May 2014 to help fund ABC's  strategy to offset dilution from the exercise of warrants by Walgreens in 2016  and 2017.  The Negative Outlook reflects the aforementioned temporary financing and  incremental deal funding in the context of a longer-than-usual de-leveraging  timeframe. Fitch maintains that gross debt/EBITDA of 1.3x-1.4x is the upper  limit for the firm's current 'A-' ratings.  Fitch continues to believe ABC will be able to repay debt such that gross  debt/EBITDA moderates to 1.4x or below by fiscal year-end 2017. This target is  largely dependent on the use of cash - whether from warrant proceeds or cash  generation - for the repayment of the bulk of outstanding term loans and the  $650 million notes due in 2017. However, ABC's stock performance could alter the  firm's updated plans for cash deployment as it pertains to management's  commitment to offsetting warrant-related dilution.  STRATEGICALLY SOUND ACQUISITION Ownership of PharMEDium by ABC should allow for the leveraging of each firm's  relationships with hospital customers and adjacent roles within the drug channel  to drive complementary growth opportunities that are independent of ABC's  largest customers, Walgreens Boots Alliance Corp. (Walgreens) and Express  Scripts Holding Corp. (Express Scripts). Almost half of ABC's revenues are  sourced from these two large customers. STRONG FCF HELPS TO OFFSET RISKS ABC's FCF has been exceptionally strong in 2015, providing some relief to the  risks outlined in February 2015 when Fitch revised the Rating Outlook for ABC's  long-term IDR to Negative. Strong cash generation has been driven primarily by  better than expected volumes and associated purchasing dynamics of generic  pharmaceuticals. Both branded and generic drug pricing trends have also  supported cash generation. FCF for the LTM period ended June 30, 2015 was $3.1  billion. Fitch expects fiscal 2015 (ended Sept. 30) FCF will exceed $3 billion. Cash generation will remain strong through fiscal 2016, allowing for accelerated  repayment of the $1 billion term loan borrowed to fund the acquisition of MWI  Veterinary Supplies, Inc. and any short-term borrowings for the PharMEDium deal.  Furthermore, ABC has indicated that its strategy to offset dilution associated  with the Walgreens warrants is now complete. Fitch plans to review the Negative Outlook in the context of recent deal  funding, up-to-date financial results and developing business trends within the  next six months.  Fitch currently rates ABC as follows: --Long-term IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured term loans 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.

19,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O), the No.1 U.S. drugstore operator by store count, reported a lower-than-expected increase in quarterly sales, hurt by weak demand for over-the-counter drugs and other products.The company's shares fell as much as 3.5 percent on Wednesday.Walgreens has been investing to revive U.S. retail sales, or front-end sales, mainly by sprucing up its beauty business, which is a big traffic driver. It is rolling out a revamped beauty division to more than 1,800 stores by end of 2016.However, comparable sales in the business were underwhelming in the latest third quarter, rising just 0.1 percent, after two quarters of declines.Analysts were expecting U.S. retail sales, which accounts for roughly a third of total U.S. sales, to increase 0.7 percent, according to Evercore ISI.The rest of Walgreens' U.S. sales comes from its pharmacy business, where comparable sales rose 6 percent due to a jump in prescriptions filled for Medicare Part D drugs. Total net sales rose 2.4 percent to $29.5 billion, missing analysts average estimate of $29.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Excluding items, Walgreens' profit of $1.18 per share beat analysts average estimate of $1.14.Walgreens said its acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) was on track to close later this year and that it was looking for buyers for the stores it needed to divest to get regulatory clearance. Rite Aid's shares rose 2 percent. ""While USA Retail is facing some pressure, we believe that the RAD deal will cause sentiment in USA Retail to shift positively once integration efforts begin,"" Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen wrote in a note.Walgreens also said it was bracing for a long period of volatility following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union.The company's revenue from UK, about 9 percent of sales last fiscal, could be a cause for concern, especially with the pound falling about 13 percent against the dollar since the vote on June 23. ""The situation is very volatile at this time. For sure, the period of uncertainty will be quite long,"" Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said.The depreciation of the pound would hit Walgreens' sales in the near term and more than offset any sales gains in local currency terms, said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.Still, the company bumped up the lower end of its fiscal 2016 profit forecast – to $4.45-$4.55 per share from $4.35-$4.55.
