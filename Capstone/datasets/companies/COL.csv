0,"  Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), which makes electronics systems for aircraft, reported a lower quarterly profit on Tuesday, but raised its full-year outlook, saying government-related sales would not fall as much as previously expected.Net income in the quarter totaled $131 million, or 96 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, compared with $132 million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier. There were fewer outstanding shares in the most recent quarter.Analysts had expected 94 cents a share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total sales rose 1 percent to $1.07 billion, the company said. Commercial system sales rose 3 percent to $521 million, while government-related sales dropped 3 percent to $532 million. Rockwell Collins said it now expects full-year government system sales to fall in the mid-single-digit percentage range because of the passage of a U.S. budget agreement, the Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act. The legislation would reduce the effect from U.S. spending cuts under sequestration which the company had previously expected for its defense segment.Rockwell Collins is also beefing up its exposure to commercial markets as U.S. defense spending shrinks. Commercial revenues stand to grow because of production of newer planes such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. The company last year bought ARINC Inc, a provider of systems that help airline pilots communicate, and has said that purchase will enable it to bolster information management services for aviation. It has formed a new segment devoted to such services that had $18 million in sales in the just-completed quarter.Rockwell Collins said it now expects full-year sales of $4.95 billion to $5.05 billion, compared with a prior view of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, and profit in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share, against an earlier outlook of $4.30 to $4.50 a share.

4,"  * Q4 post-tax ENI per adjusted share $1.64 vs Street view 91 cents* Q4 distributable earnings $401 mln vs $188 mln a year ago* Most profitable quarter since Carlyle went public in 2012By Greg RoumeliotisFeb 19 Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP  said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings rose by 216 percent to a record, as the value of its funds jumped and profits generated from the sales of assets soared, beating most analysts' forecasts.Buoyant capital markets not only boosted the value of the companies held by Carlyle's funds but also allowed the Washington, D.C.-based firm to cash out on more of its investments and return money to its investors.""Our performance exceeded our prior outlook because some of the exit activities that we earlier expected would occur in future periods in fact occurred in 2013,"" Carlyle co-founder and co-chief executive David Rubenstein told analysts on a conference call.The value of Carlyle's private equity funds rose by 9 percent in the fourth quarter. Peer Blackstone Group LP  reported an 11.5 percent rise in the same quarter, Apollo Global Management LLC reported a 9 percent rise and KKR & Co LP  reported an 8.4 percent rise.Assets sales in the quarter included Carlyle's $1.39 billion sale of aerospace communications company Arinc Inc to Rockwell Collins Inc and the sale of human resources software company Personal & Informatik AG to private equity firm HgCapital, generating returns of 4.5 times and 6.5 times of Carlyle's investors' money respectively. Carlyle also completed the initial public offerings of luxury jacket maker Moncler SpA, telecommunications equipment maker CommScope Holding Company Inc, travel agency CVC Brasil Operadora & Agencia de Viagens SA  and cable operator Numericable Group SA.It also sold shares in auto parts maker Allison Transmission Holdings Inc, television ratings company Nielsen Holdings NV, BankUnited Inc and consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton Corp, which were already publicly listed.Economic net income (ENI), an earnings measure comprising cash and paper profits or losses based on how funds have been marked to market, increased to $576 million in the fourth quarter from $182 million a year earlier.This translated into post-tax adjusted ENI per share of $1.64. Analysts on average expected 91 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. This was the best quarterly financial result for Carlyle since its initial public offering in 2012.Carlyle shares were up 3.4 percent at $36.68 in early afternoon trading in New York. They had fallen 0.1 percent in the 12 months leading up to Wednesday, compared to a 21 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index. Carlyle also said the value of seven of its funds rose enough in the fourth quarter for them to exceed return hurdle rates of between 7 and 8 percent. This entitles them to pay out so-called carried interest, giving Carlyle a slice of the investment profits generated by the funds at a time of Carlyle's choosing.EARNINGS BLOT A blot on Carlyle's earnings was its real estate and energy division, which reported a loss as a European real estate fund underperformed and the valuation of some energy funds that Carlyle launched with another private equity firm, Riverstone Holdings LLC, dropped. Carlyle has ended its partnership with Riverstone and in 2012 took over another energy-focused private equity firm, Natural Gas Partners, for which it has high hopes.Carlyle also runs credit funds, hedge funds and fund-of-funds products whose divisions also saw profits rise. But private equity continues to dominate the firm's earnings, accounting for 80 percent of its profits in 2013.Carlyle's pre-tax distributable earnings, which show how much cash is available to pay dividends, were $401 million in the fourth quarter versus $188 million a year earlier, as the firm monetized more of its assets.Assets under management were $188.8 billion at the end of December, up from $185 billion at the end of September. Carlyle announced in November it had raised a $13 billion U.S. private equity fund, surpassing its $10 billion target.Rubenstein also said that Carlyle had raised $2 billion from retail investors in 2013 and expressed confidence that the two mutual funds it plans to launch this year will be differentiated enough to succeed in a competitive marketplace.He declined to comment on competitor KKR's disclosure last week that it would liquidate two funds targeting individual investors, in a blow to the firm's efforts to widen its appeal beyond institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance firms.Carlyle's fee-related earnings were $39 million in the fourth quarter, down 30 percent from a year earlier.Carlyle declared a fourth-quarter dividend of $1.40 per share. Dividends for 2013 totaled $1.88 per share, representing 75 percent of Carlyle's after-tax distributable earnings. The firm reaffirmed its dividend policy of paying out 75 to 85 percent of its after-tax distributable earnings in 2014.",2014-02-19,COL,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 12:36pm EST",UPDATE 2-Carlyle's fourth-quarter earnings more than triple,http://www.reuters.com//article/carlyle-results-idUSL2N0LO0VG20140219?type=companyNews
5,"  Rockwell Collins Inc, maker of a key communications system for jets, is interested in joining a task force on improving global airline tracking to prevent further disappearances of planes like Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, its chief executive said on Thursday.Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said the avionics supplier had ""a lot of value to add"" to the task force planned by the International Air Transport Association that will look at ways to track airplanes and make recommendations.The Malaysia Airlines flight disappeared from radar screens on March 8 with 239 people on board. On Thursday, Australian search authorities said footage taken by a deep-sea drone could help determine whether the lost jet ended up in a remote area of the Indian Ocean.Last year, Rockwell acquired ARINC, a provider of aviation connectivity services including flight planning and high-speed data. ARINC developed the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, designed to transmit maintenance data back to the ground. Data from the ACARS system indicated that the Malaysia Airlines jet had veered away from its planned path and led rescuers to search in the Indian Ocean. ""The industry is pledging to go figure out a way to make sure this never happens again,"" Ortberg said in an interview, referring to the disappearance of the Boeing jet.Ortberg said the technology exists to improve plane tracking. ""We may have to write some software, we may have to do some different things--upgrade the airplane to implement this capability--but we don't need to invest in new technology,"" he said.""With GPS satellites and connectivity, this is a solvable problem,"" Ortberg added.

11,"  (Adds details on possible bidders, share price and comment from minority shareholder)By Peter Maushagen, Tim Hepher and Sagarika JaisinghaniFRANKFURT/PARIS May 5 German aircraft seating maker Recaro is looking at buying assets from B/E Aerospace  after the U.S. company announced a surprise review that could lead to a shakeup of the $3 billion cabins industry.Florida-based B/E Aerospace on Sunday postponed Monday's investor meeting and said it has hired Citigroup Inc  advisers to explore options, including a possible sale, merger or spinoff of the company or selected businesses.The statement came less than two weeks after the company reported a record quarter for new orders amid rising demand for wide-bodied jets, and said it was looking at two potential aerospace acquisitions and had completed a third.Analysts said the review could lead to a break-up of the 26-year-old company, which has grown through more than two dozen acquisitions to become one of the largest makers of aircraft seats, with a leading role in the parts distribution chain.Asked in Frankfurt whether Recaro Aircraft Seating was interested in buying any assets from B/E Aerospace, Chief Executive Mark Hiller told reporters: ""We are looking into it"".B/E shares jumped around 10 percent in early U.S. trading on Monday to $97.99.In Paris, B/E's closest rival in the seats market, Zodiac Aerospace, declined to comment. Its shares were down 1.2 percent, slightly lagging a weaker overall market.""Zodiac cannot be considered a potential bidder on the deal in our view,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christophe Menard.Given B/E Aerospace's $9 billion market value, ""an acquisition in full of the company could only be carried out by a much larger player in aerospace,"" he said in a note.But several of the large companies that could bid for all or part of B/E Aerospace appeared already occupied with other acquisition strategies.General Electric Co said last week that its $13.5 billion offer for the power business of France's Alstom  would effectively fill its allotment for acquisitions through next year, while the company's aviation division is focused predominantly on manufacturing jet engines. At United Technologies Corp analysts have said recently that the diversified manufacturer is more likely to focus on deals to boost its commercial building businesses, which sell elevators and climate control systems, than on aerospace.On United Technologies' earnings call last month, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said the idea of striking a big deal this year was very unlikely.Honeywell International Inc said in March that it was planning for $10 billion in deals through 2018 as part of its five-year financial plan. That deal value would more than double what Honeywell spent in the previous five years on acquisitions, but the spending was expected to be spread across the whole company, not just the aerospace division, which works primarily on electrical and mechanical systems.Avionics maker Rockwell Collins took on significant debt recently to buy Arinc, whose computer networks help flight crew navigation. That may limit its ability to do a big deal.Spokesmen for GE, United Technologies, Honeywell and Rockwell declined to comment.A bid from within the industry for the seats business would have to overcome competition hurdles, with Zodiac and B/E controlling around 70 percent of the market between them. Buying assets from B/E Aerospace could help Recaro, a family run firm, to expand in the lucrative market for premium seating. Recaro says it is the market leader for economy seats, but wants to expand its grip on profitable premium seats.On Monday, the unlisted German company reported sales of 337 million euros for 2013 and said it was aiming to reach 600 million in 2018, not including the effects of any acquisitions.BREAK-UP TALK B/E Aerospace makes lavatories for the Boeing 737 and galleys for the Airbus A350, as well as seats and oxygen units. It also has a spare parts distribution business.The company made just over half its 2013 revenue of $3.48 billion from commercial aircraft, with about a third coming from consumables management, as the spare parts business is known. Consumables management is the slowest-growing part of the company. The rest of B/E Aerospace's revenue comes from luxury fittings for business jets. In 2008, B/E Aerospace bought the consumables distribution business of Honeywell for $1 billion to create what it describes as the world's largest distributor of fasteners or specialist bolts, operating in a market estimated at $4.5 billion a year.Most analysts said a sale was most likely to work if B/E Aerospace split the interiors business from distribution. And several researchers, including Oppenheimer, said the abrupt weekend announcement suggested talks were already under way.B/E Aerospace shares have risen 40 percent in the past year. In midday trading in New York the stock was up 10.8 percent at $98.60.Several brokers raised their price targets to as much as $121, while noting aerospace acquisitions are looking expensive as commercial suppliers ride a wave of orders and increases in production.B/E Aerospace shares trade at 19.1 times this year's forecast earnings, compared with an average multiple of 16.3 for its industry peers, according to Thomson Reuters data.The company, which has net debt of $1.6 billion, has an enterprise value of 11.6 times its forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, giving it a premium over the sector average of 10.2, according to the data.Scott Thompson, who heads PricewaterhouseCoopers' aerospace and defence coverage, said the announcement from B/E underscored growing interest in acquisition and mergers.""We see things heating up,"" said Thompson, who put out a study last week predicting increased M&A activity this year.B/E management likely has a clear idea of what they can get for the company, and is in a strong position having posted robust earnings in a market ripe with potential investors, said George Young, a partner at St. Denis J. Villere & Co LLC, which owns about 2 percent of the company.He's hoping for a deal priced at the top end of broker targets.""If it's less than $120 per share, then I would be somewhat disappointed,"" Young said.

There were fewer shares outstanding in the latest period.However, the company earned $1.19 per share from continuing operations, higher than the $1.17 analysts on average were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total sales rose 12 percent to $1.26 billion, aided by the acquisition of the ARINC information management business. Revenue at the commercial systems unit of Rockwell Collins,  which sells to Boeing Co and Airbus Group NV, rose 5.8 percent to $583 million. Government system sales fell 6 percent to $535 million.Rockwell Collins is beefing up its exposure to commercial markets as U.S. defense spending wanes. Commercial revenues stand to grow because of production of newer planes such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. The company last year bought ARINC Inc, a provider of systems that help airline pilots communicate, and has said that purchase will enable it to bolster aviation information management services. It formed a new segment for such services that had $146 million in sales in the just-completed quarter.In recent years, Rockwell Collins has exited some sectors of defense. On Tuesday, it said it was selling a satellite communications business formerly known as Datapath that mainly caters to military customers. ""Government revenues continue to come under pressure, though the sale of Datapath should help the overall company mix,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rob Stallard said in a note to clients. He added that commercial results were better than expected but noted that higher employee benefit costs hurt margins in that segment.Rockwell raised the low end of its 2014 earnings forecast to $4.45 per share from $4.40. It kept the higher end of the range at $4.55. It said it expected sales for the year that ends in September of $4.9 billion to $4.95 billion, down from a prior view of up to $5.05 billion, reflecting the Datapath divestiture.  Shares of Rockwell Collins were down 1.9 percent to $78.90 in morning trading. (Reporting by Rohit T.

Commercial revenues stand to grow because of production of newer planes such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. The company last year bought ARINC Inc, a provider of systems that help airline pilots communicate, and has said that purchase will enable it to bolster aviation information management services. It formed a new segment for such services that had $146 million in sales in the just-completed quarter.In recent years, Rockwell Collins has exited some sectors of defense. On Tuesday, it said it was selling a satellite communications business formerly known as Datapath that mainly caters to military customers. ""Government revenues continue to come under pressure, though the sale of Datapath should help the overall company mix,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rob Stallard said in a note to clients. He added that commercial results were better than expected but noted that higher employee benefit costs hurt margins in that segment.Rockwell raised the low end of its 2014 earnings forecast to $4.45 per share from $4.40. It kept the higher end of the range at $4.55. It said it expected sales for the year that ends in September of $4.9 billion to $4.95 billion, down from a prior view of up to $5.05 billion, reflecting the Datapath divestiture.Shares of Rockwell Collins were down 1.9 percent to $78.90 in morning trading.

15,"  (Adds detail, analyst note, CEO quote and background)By Jeffrey DastinOct 31 Rockwell Collins Inc reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Friday largely in line with Wall Street's expectations, as its commercial operations helped boost overall sales by 15 percent year over year.The avionics and aircraft systems manufacturer matched average analyst estimates of $1.27 in earnings per share, which exclude its discontinued operations. The company reported net income of $167 million.A paucity of purchases by the U.S. military and other government agencies has hurt defense manufacturers industrywide, with sales by Rockwell Collins to governments falling 5 percent year over year. The company's communications products for government, however, increased by 11 percent ""due to higher deliveries of JTRS Manpack radios,"" the company said in a statement.""Not only do we see improving market conditions for our company, but the acquisition and integration of ARINC is exceeding our expectations and adds a growth engine to our portfolio,"" the company's chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, said in a statement. Rockwell Collins acquired ARINC, an aerospace communications firm, in late 2013. As uncertainty over military acquisitions lingers, Rockwell Collins and other manufacturers have doubled down on their commercial operations.Rockwell Collins reported a 12 percent increase in  commercial sales, and sales from information management services grew 12-fold, excluding discontinued operations. The company reaffirmed its outlook for fiscal year 2015 that it had disclosed in September. It has a target of $5.2 to $5.3 billion in total sales, compared sales of nearly $4.98 billion in fiscal year 2014.In a note circulated Friday morning, Sterne Agee analyst Peter Arment reaffirmed his recommendation to buy the stock.Shares of Rockwell Collins rose 1.57 percent to $84.21 in early morning trading, on the New York Stock Exchange.

17,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) sees a large opportunity to retrofit current-generation Boeing Co (BA.N) 777 aircraft with heads-up cockpit displays it is developing for the next-generation 777X, a senior executive told Reuters on Tuesday.""We are seeing tremendous acceleration in desire for heads-up displays"" for the 777, Kent Statler, executive vice president and chief operating officer of commercial systems at Rockwell, said in an interview after the company announced it had won an exclusive contract to supply flight displays and other cockpit systems to the 777X. [ID:nWNAB05IFV]As part of that program, the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based aerospace manufacturer will develop heads-up displays for the 777X similar to those now supplied on Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The displays allow pilots to see instrument readings while looking out the cockpit window. The 777X is a refresh of Boeing's wide-body 777 jetliner, which is due to enter service in 2020. In tandem, Rockwell Collins will develop and certify heads-up displays for the 777, Boeing's current production mini-jumbo jetliner.  Rockwell wouldn't disclose the value of the 777X contract, but Statler said it will provide a ""very material"" benefit to the company's earnings as it begins product deliveries around 2019. Boeing has sold 286 777X aircraft through November.The 777 entered service in 1995, and Boeing has sold more than 1,500 of the aircraft.

18,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Sharply falling oil prices are providing a windfall for global airlines by cutting their massive fuel bills, but a weaker euro will temper the benefits for European carriers and limit their ability to spend on aircraft upgrades, the head of Rockwell Collins (COL.N) said on Friday.While the currency effects will not completely neutralize the fuel gains, ""there's no question that ... European currency countries aren't going to see as much good news,"" Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg said in an interview.""In some of those airlines, budgets are going to be tight because of the strengthening dollar against the euro,"" he added. The Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based maker of avionics and information systems has not yet seen an impact from currencies or from lower fuel prices. The company also is actively exploring potential acquisitions for both its defense and information management businesses, Ortberg said.Ortberg expects fuel savings to lift its sales to business jet companies as early as this summer, since they are less hedged on fuel than commercial airlines. Commercial airline sales likely would emerge in the company's next fiscal year. Earlier Friday, Rockwell Collins reported a 26 percent rise in net profit on a 16 percent rise in sales for its fiscal first quarter. On Thursday, the European Central bank announced a 1 trillion euro bond-buying program, sending the euro to 11 year lows against the dollar.  ""Most of the major airlines have hedges, some up to three years, so while fuel is coming down, they're not seeing the direct budget windfall,"" Ortberg said. ""It's going to be a little while before we see any change in buying behavior.""""Having said that, there's no question that this is good news for them. And if there are things they wanted to do but couldn't afford it, they're going to be revisiting that. We're going to see some good news, it's just a little early.""Rockwell Collins wants to build its defense portfolio with acquisitions that can also add capability to its commercial products, especially now that uncertainty about the U.S. defense budget has eased and company valuations are more clear.  Rockwell also wants to build its commercial products through acquisitions, Ortberg said.""We're really focused on expanding our information management services portfolio,"" he said. ""Companies that can enhance our previous ARINC acquisition are opportunities that we're exploring now.""

28,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force on Monday named Pratt & Whitney as the engine maker for the new Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) long-range strike bomber, and defended the plane's ""cost plus incentive fee"" contract that has been challenged by U.S. lawmakers.U.S. Air Force Secretary Deborah James revealed the names of the engine maker, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and other key suppliers at a Pentagon news conference amid growing calls for more transparency about the classified arms program.Other key suppliers for the new B-21 bomber include the U.S. units of two British suppliers, BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) and GKN Plc (GKN.L), as well as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), Orbital ATK Inc (OA.N), Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and Janicki Industries, a family-owned company, James said.Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) last month dropped their challenge to the multibillion-dollar bomber contract that Northrop won in October.James said the suppliers named Monday would work on the airframe and mission systems of the new flying wing stealth bomber, but gave no details. Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the Air Force's top military acquisition official, declined to say where Northrop would assemble the planes.He said the Air Force hoped in time to provide the value of the bomber development contract and associated incentive fees.He said the incentive fees were based on cost and performance, with an emphasis on meeting plans to start using the new planes in combat from the mid 2020s. The Air Force initially estimated it would cost $23.5 billion to develop the new bomber, but has not released terms of its contract with Northrop. Analysts have said the overall deal could be worth $80 billion to Northrop and its suppliers over time.James said the Air Force was working to address questions raised by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain about the Northrop contract. McCain fears it could leave the U.S. government liable for potential cost increases. She said it would take ""money and time"" to cancel and redo the deal if McCain succeeds in blocking it.McCain says the Air Force has been spared from $1 billion in cost overruns on a new refueling plane being built by Boeing since that plane was developed under a fixed price contract.But Bunch said this program was different since it involved a wholly new airplane, and the company had no potential commercial or foreign military sales customers to help defray its costs.

32,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Boeing Co (BA.N) reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss on Wednesday, cushioned by strong performances in its jetliner and defense businesses.The world's biggest plane maker warned last week it planned to take $3 billion in pretax charges related to its 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker aircraft programs.But the quarterly loss of 44 cents a share in so-called core results, which excludes some pension and other expenses, was less than half the 93-cent loss that analysts expected, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts said Boeing produced more aircraft at higher operating profit margins. The company also notched down its full-year forecast by just $2.05 a share, significantly less than the after-tax charges of $3.23 a share. That suggested Boeing is confident that margins will stay firm in the second half, said Ken Herbert, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.      Still, investors remained concerned about a cyclical downturn, a weak global economy and softening demand, factors other industrial companies cited in recent days.""Boeing still faces a tough environment with increasing competition,"" said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Boeing shares rose 3 percent in early trading, but by mid-afternoon they eased and were up 1.2 percent at $136.46 on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing said its decision to slow down payments to suppliers this year was an important strategic move to align its payment processes with industry standards. Reuters reported the change on July 7. The shift has ruffled suppliers, including Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and GKN Plc (GKN.L), which noted it recently. Boeing declined to say whether the change had contributed to an 11 percent rise in its cash to $9.3 billion in the quarter, or how it might affect cash generation in the future.""This is not a one-time event or implementation,"" Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in response to questions on a conference call. ""We see this as a key element of our longer-term cash growth plan and consistent with our plans for the business to grow cash year over year."" Muilenburg also said Boeing would rather curb production than cut prices for twin-aisle aircraft to deal with slowing demand. The company ""clearly has work to do"" to sell 40 of its 777s this year, having only sold eight so far, he said.""If those orders don't materialize, we're going to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure supply and demand remain in balance,"" he said.But he added: ""We don't need to make drastic changes to pricing in order to capture market share. In the wide-body market, even though we're seeing hesitation in buying, the value proposition is holding up well.""  Boeing lifted production of 787s to 12 a month in the quarter, sooner than expected, but has not set a date for boosting output to the next target level of 14 a month.Boeing's results reflected better profitability in its defense, space and security business. While revenue in the unit fell 5 percent, profit rose 9 percent. Margins at the commercial airplanes unit widened to 10.3 percent, excluding the one-time charges, versus 7.1 percent a year ago. Defense margins widened to 8.3 percent, with the tanker charge included, from 7.2 percent. Deliveries of twin-aisle 787s and 777s rose 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively, in the quarter. But the company is delivering fewer 737s as it begins production of the successor 737 MAX jet.Those deliveries are expected to rise next year once the new plane is certified and begins service. That is now expected in the first half, rather than the third quarter as targeted previously.

35,"   By Alwyn Scott  After two years of looking to expand, aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins Inc has struck a deal to buy aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace Inc for $62 a share in cash and stock, the companies said on Sunday.The acquisition, valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt, expands the range of products Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft and broadens its customer base internationally.Rockwell on Sunday also reported a 14 percent increase in profit to $1.58 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, on a 4 percent rise in sales.The acquisition, which is expected to be completed next spring, allows both companies to sell to each other’s customers and to deploy Rockwell’s capability with onboard connectivity to make internet-enabled seats, galleys, lavatories and other cabin systems that B/E Aerospace provides.“B/E is very strong in relationships with airlines,” Rockwell Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said in an interview. “We're stronger with aircraft makers as well as business aviation operators and the military. We’ll be able to sell our respective products into a much broader market base than either of us could do independently.”B/E Aerospace plans to use Rockwell’s dealer network and relationships with business jet owners, for example, to know when jets are coming in for avionics upgrades.“Having that information and time to market directly to the owners of the aircraft is a tremendous opportunity that we're looking to take advantage of,” said Amin Khoury, B/E Aerospace founder and chairman. “It's not something we can do on our own.” The combination is expected to produce cost savings of about $160 million, with 90 percent captured in the first full year of the acquisition, and provide a double-digit percentage boost to per-share earnings in the first full year, the companies said. They also anticipate it generating more than $6 billion in free cash flow over five years.The cost savings come from eliminating public company administration at B/E Aerospace, greater buying power with suppliers, consolidating information technology system and using low-cost factory labor across the combined company, Ortberg said.LITTLE PRODUCT OVERLAP  Rockwell agreed to pay $34.10 a share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins stock, a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace's closing price on Friday.The purchase will curb Rockwell’s appetite for big deals for about three years, but the company will still be looking for smaller acquisitions while paying down debt, Ortberg said.The companies have little product overlap. Rockwell is best known for avionics, flight control systems and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems.Rockwell, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has market value of about $11 billion, more than twice the size of Wellington, Florida-based B/E Aerospace, which has a market value of $5.1 billion. The offer represents a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace's closing price on Friday. B/E Aerospace brings more aftermarket and aircraft retrofit business to Rockwell, which is mainly focused on new equipment, and also adds exposure to twin-aisle aircraft, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.Combined sales will be about evenly split between the U.S. domestic market and international markets, Ortberg said.Pricing pressures from Boeing Co and Airbus are one driver of such a deal. ""But it's also a pretty clear indicator that the market has peaked in terms of deliveries and orders,"" Aboulafia said of new aircraft sales. ""In this environment, consolidation is inevitable as a cost-control move.""Ortberg said that while cost was a factor, ""It’s really the transition to the digital airplane that's creating the perfect timing to bring these two entities together.”Rockwell’s board set up a committee two years ago to examine whether to grow by expanding into new markets or partnering to use existing sales channels. “We thought that (latter strategy) was a much better approach,” he said.

38,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aircraft electronics supplier Rockwell Collins (COL.N) said on Monday its $6.4 billion acquisition of interiors maker B/E Aerospace Inc (BEAV.O) will boost sales and spur new products, helping offset sluggish demand for equipment in new business and commercial jets.But investors and industry experts voiced skepticism about the deal, sending Rockwell's stock down 6.9 percent to $78.63, while B/E Aerospace shares rose 15.5 percent to $58.44, reflecting the bid premium.Rockwell's acquisition, announced on Sunday, would triple its sales of equipment in new-generation widebody jetliners such as the Boeing (BA.N) 787 and Airbus (AIR.PA) A350, and ""nearly double our position in the narrowbodies,"" Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said on a conference call with analysts, referring to top-selling jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.The companies have little product overlap, with Rockwell best known for avionics, flight controls and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems.     But Rockwell's plan to wire digital sensors and electronics into the galleys, lavatories and seats that B/E Aerospace drew some skepticism from industry experts.    Lavatories and galleys are not items airlines typically use as selling points to customers. ""If you're making a lavatory higher tech, it's got to improve customers experience or reduce cost,"" said Phil Toy, a managing director at aerospace consulting firm AlixPartners.    The combination is expected to produce annual cost savings of $160 million, with 90 percent captured in the first full year, and provide a double-digit percentage boost to per-share earnings in the first full year, the companies said.      Rockwell's acquisition - which is expected to be completed next spring - also underscores rising competition for lucrative aftermarket sales, which involves spare parts and services, a business that Boeing and Airbus also are pursuing.     Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins could benefit as leases expire on numerous widebody aircraft and the planes need interior upgrades that B/E Aerospace provides.
