0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of HCP, Inc.  (NYSE: HCP) as follows:  --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Unsecured bank credit facility at 'BBB+';  --Unsecured term loan at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect HCP's credit strengths, namely: the steady and predictable  cash flows from a large portfolio of healthcare properties, maintenance of  leverage and fixed-charge coverage metrics appropriate for the rating category,  manageable lease expiration and debt maturity schedules, financial flexibility  stemming from a large unencumbered pool, and a solid liquidity position.   Credit concerns include: operator concentration, which will increase further pro  forma for the pending merger between Brookdale Senior Living and Emeritus  Corporation, persistently low coverage metrics for HCP's largest tenant (HCR  ManorCare), and the impact of government and regulatory actions on operators'  profitability. HCP's commitment to existing conservative business and financing  strategies mitigates the abrupt change in senior leadership (the termination in  4Q13 of Jay Flaherty who had been CEO since 2003).  DURABLE CASHFLOWS HCP's same-store property performance has been strong over the past five years  and is one of the largest factors behind the rating, with same property net  operating income (NOI) increasing between 3.1% and 4.8% annually from 2009-2013.  Same-property NOI increased 3.1% for 2013 as compared to 4.2%, 4% and 4.8% for  2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The strong fundamentals result from the lease  structures (generally triple-net with contractual increases) as well as HCP's  active management. Fitch estimates same-property NOI growth to remain within the  historical 2%-4% range through 2015 despite the regulatory-based headwinds some  operators are facing. Unlike many other rated healthcare REITs, HCP has an  insignificant amount of RIDEA exposure, thereby increasing the durability of  cash flows.  HCP's lease maturity schedule is well-staggered and long-dated as a result of  the high percentage of long-term triple net leases. Less than 10% of annual base  rent revenues expires in any one year. Limited lease expirations coupled with  contractual rental bumps increase the predictability of future rental revenues,  absent tenant bankruptcies and are credit strengths for HCP. STRONG CREDIT METRICS HCP's fixed-charge coverage was 3.5x for 2013 as compared to 3.1x and 2.7x in  2012 and 2011, respectively. Fitch projects fixed-charge coverage will improve  further above 4.0x over the next 12-to-36 months driven by same-store NOI  growth, earnings contributions from recent acquisitions and reduced fixed  charges. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less  recurring capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments and direct  financing lease accretion, divided by total interest incurred.  HCP's leverage was 5.2x and 5.0x for year and quarter ended Dec. 31, 2013,  respectively which is within a range that is appropriate for a 'BBB+' IDR.  Leverage was 5.4x and 5.3x as of Dec. 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, pro forma  for material acquisitions. Fitch projects HCP's leverage will decline towards  4.5x by 2016. That said, Fitch notes that HCP's propensity for large  transactions may cause fluctuations in reported metrics. Fitch defines leverage  as net debt divided by recurring operating EBITDA.  STRONG LIQUIDITY & ACCESS TO CAPITAL HCP has repaid the majority of its 2014 maturities pro forma for the $350  million 4.2% senior unsecured bond issuance in 1Q'14 and has only 9.7% of total  debt maturing through 2015. The company's debt maturity schedule is  appropriately-staggered thereafter, with less than 17% of debt maturing in any  one year. The largest year for debt maturities is 2016; however, HCP maintains  options to extend the maturity of the term loan by one year. This reduces  potential maturities in 2016 to 14% of total debt outstanding. As such, HCP  maintains a strong liquidity position.  Sources of liquidity (unrestricted cash, availability under the company's  unsecured revolving credit facility pro forma for the recent extension and  amendment to $2 billion and expected retained cash flows from operating  activities after dividends and distributions) divided by uses of liquidity (pro  rata debt maturities adjusted for recent repayments, development expenditures  and estimated recurring capital expenditures) for the period Jan. 1, 2014 to  Dec. 31, 2015 results in a liquidity coverage ratio of 2.4x. HCP has also  demonstrated strong access to a wide variety of capital sources over the past  two years, mitigating refinance risk.  HCP maintains solid financial flexibility stemming mainly from its large  unencumbered property pool, which serves as a source of contingent liquidity.  Using a stressed capitalization rate range of 8%-10%, HCP's unencumbered asset  coverage of net unsecured debt was approximately 2.0x-2.4x, which is appropriate  for the 'BBB+' IDR.  Further, HCP's distributions do not restrict financial flexibility. Fitch  calculates that the company's common stock dividends represented only 83% and  90% of 2013 and 2012, respectively, funds from operations adjusted to account  for capital expenditures, straight-line rents and non-cash income  (company-reported funds available for distribution). CONCENTRATED PORTFOLIO & PERSISTENTLY LOW COVERAGE AT HCR Credit concerns include the potential impact of government fiscal imbalance and  regulatory risk on operators' profitability and operator and geographic  concentration. Rent from HCR ManorCare represents 29% of HCP's revenues. This  tenant continues to have coverage ratios below 1.0x facility EBITDAR and 1.2x  guarantor fixed-charge coverage for the trailing 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2013  which is a credit concern. Sustained and material improvements in HCR  ManorCare's profitability may support positive ratings momentum if reflective of  a generally improving and lower risk operating environment. Partially offsetting  this concentration is the master lease structure and covenants to provide  protection to HCP at the guarantor level.  Furthermore, HCP's tenant mix will become more concentrated upon the completion  of the merger between Emeritus Corporation and Brookdale Senior Living  (currently HCP's second and third largest tenants, respectively). The combined  company will comprise 21% of revenues and result in the two largest tenants (HCR  and Brookdale/Emeritus) comprising approximately 50% of revenues. The risks  associated with a concentrated tenant mix are two-fold: 1) the effects of a  potential default are greater and 2) tenants may have significant leverage when  negotiating lease renewals given the pooling of assets into master leases. Fitch  notes the merger has no immediate impact on HCP's credit ratings given its  exposure to the underlying property cash flows is unchanged but notes the  longer-term increase in risk.   Lastly, HCP's portfolio remains geographically concentrated, despite the company  maintaining a diversified investment platform. As of Dec. 31, 2013,  approximately 31% of HCP's consolidated net operating income from wholly owned  assets was generated from properties located in California and Texas (though  this is down from 47% as of Dec. 31, 2010). STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook is driven by Fitch's expectations that HCP will maintain its  long-standing conservative business and financing strategies and metrics will  remain appropriate for the rating over the next 12-to-24 months. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the rating and/or  Outlook: --A sustained and material improvement in coverage for skilled  nursing/post-acute operators in whole and in part; --Reduced tenant concentration; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x for several  consecutive quarters (coverage was 3.5x for the TTM ended Dec. 31, 2013); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.2x at  Dec. 31, 2013). The following factors may have a negative impact on the ratings or Outlook: --A sustained and material weakening in coverage for skilled nursing/post-acute  operators in whole and in part; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6.0x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 2.5x; --A liquidity shortfall.

1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to the  $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.40% senior unsecured notes due 2025  and the GBP220 million unsecured term loan due 2019 issued by HCP, Inc. (NYSE:  HCP). The 2025 notes were issued at 99.185% of par value to yield 3.497% or 160  basis points (bps) over the benchmark rate. The term loan bears interest at GBP  LIBOR plus 97.5 bps and HCP entered into a three-year interest rate swap  agreement that effectively fixes the rate at 1.79%. The combined proceeds will  be used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility related  to the funding of a portion of a GBP395 million debt investment in the United  Kingdom, repay senior unsecured notes due later in 2015, and for general  corporate purposes.  Fitch currently rates HCP as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rate (IDR) 'BBB+'; --Unsecured bank credit facility 'BBB+';  --Unsecured term loans 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect HCP's credit strengths, namely: the steady and predictable  cash flows from a large portfolio of healthcare properties, maintenance of  leverage and fixed-charge coverage metrics appropriate for the rating category,  manageable lease and debt maturity schedules, financial flexibility stemming  from a large unencumbered pool, and appropriate liquidity. Credit concerns  include: operator concentration and the persistently low coverage metrics for  HCP's largest tenant (HCR ManorCare), and the impact of government and  regulatory actions on operators' profitability. DURABLE CASHFLOWS HCP's same-store property performance has been strong over the past seven years  and is one of the largest factors behind the rating, with same-property net  operating income (SSNOI) increasing between 1.6% and 4.8% annually and 3.2% YTD  through 3Q'14. The strong fundamentals result from the lease structures  (generally triple-net with contractual increases) as well as HCP's active  management. Fitch estimates same-property NOI growth to remain within the  historical 2%-4% range through 2015. Unlike many other rated healthcare REITs, HCP has traditionally had an  insignificant amount of RIDEA exposure, thereby increasing the durability and  predictability of cash flows. However, Fitch estimates HCP's RIDEA exposure will  increase to approximately 9% of NOI from 3.3% pro forma for the Brookdale  transaction. HCP's revenue maturity schedule is well-staggered and long-dated as a result of  the high percentage of long-term triple-net leases. Less than 9.2% of annual  base rent and interest revenues expire in any one year. Limited lease  expirations coupled with contractual rental bumps increase the predictability of  future rental revenues, absent tenant bankruptcies or a lease restructuring with  HCR ManorCare, and are credit strengths for HCP. The company had been consistent  on past earnings calls that HCR had the capacity to honor its lease, and HCP  would not amend it without growth opportunities similar to those received in the  Brookdale/Emeritus lease amendment. However, Fitch notes that the Dec. 22, 2014  SEC filing describing a 4Q'14 impairment charge by HCP on its equity investment  in HCR signifies that a material improvement in operating fundamentals is less  likely. The filing speaks only to HCR's capacity to honor the lease for 2015.  STRONG CREDIT METRICS HCP's fixed-charge coverage was 3.7x for the trailing 12 months (TTM) ended  Sept. 30, 2014 as compared to 3.5x and 3.1x in 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Fitch projects fixed-charge coverage will improve further, surpassing 4x over  the next 12-to-24 months driven by SSNOI growth, earnings contributions from  recent acquisitions and reduced fixed charges. Fitch defines fixed-charge  coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less recurring capital expenditures less  straight-line rent adjustments and direct financing lease accretion, divided by  total interest incurred. HCP's leverage was 5.4x as of Sept. 30, 2014 which, is appropriate for a 'BBB+'  IDR. Leverage was 5.2x and 5.5x as of Dec. 31, 2013 and 2012, pro forma for  material acquisitions. Fitch projects HCP's leverage will decline toward 4.5x by  2016. That said, Fitch notes that HCP's propensity for large transactions may  cause fluctuations in reported metrics. Fitch defines leverage as net debt  divided by TTM recurring operating EBITDA. STRONG LIQUIDITY & ACCESS TO CAPITAL HCP has prefunded all of its 2015 unsecured maturities and its debt maturities  are appropriately staggered thereafter. Liquidity coverage is strong at 1.2x for  the period Oct. 1, 2014 through Dec. 31, 2016. Fitch calculates liquidity  coverage as sources of liquidity (unrestricted cash, availability under the  company's unsecured revolving credit facility, expected retained cash flows from  operating activities after dividends and distributions and pro forma adjustments  for the bond issuance) divided by uses of liquidity (pro rata debt maturities,  development expenditures, net cash payments for the Formation Capital  transaction and estimated recurring capital expenditures). HCP has also  demonstrated strong access to a wide variety of capital sources over the past  two years, mitigating refinance risk. HCP maintains solid financial flexibility stemming mainly from its large  unencumbered property pool, which serves as a source of contingent liquidity.  Using a stressed capitalization rate range of 8%-10%, HCP's unencumbered asset  coverage of net unsecured debt was approximately 2x-2.4x. CONCENTRATED PORTFOLIO & PERSISTENTLY LOW COVERAGE AT HCR Credit concerns include the potential impact of government fiscal imbalance and  regulatory risk on operators' profitability and operator and geographic  concentration. Rent from HCR ManorCare represents 29% of HCP's revenues. This  tenant continues to have coverage ratios below 1x facility EBITDAR (nine  consecutive quarters of TTM coverage at or below 1x) and 1.1x guarantor  fixed-charge coverage for the TTM ended June 30, 2014, which is a credit  concern. Sustained and material improvements in HCR ManorCare's profitability  may support positive ratings momentum if reflecting a generally improving and  lower-risk operating environment. Partially offsetting this concentration and  low coverage ratios are the master lease structure and covenants to provide  protection to HCP at the guarantor level. Furthermore, HCP's tenant mix has become more concentrated since the completion  of the merger between Emeritus Corporation and Brookdale Senior Living  (previously HCP's second- and third-largest tenants, respectively). The combined  company now makes up 19% of revenues and results in the two largest tenants (HCR  and Brookdale/Emeritus) comprising approximately 48% of revenues. The risks  associated with a concentrated tenant mix are two-fold: the effects of a  potential lease amendment or default are greater, and tenants may have  significant leverage when negotiating lease renewals given the pooling of assets  into master leases. Fitch notes the merger had no immediate impact on HCP's  credit ratings given that its exposure to the underlying property cash flows is  unchanged but notes the longer-term increase in risk. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook is driven by Fitch's expectations that HCP will maintain its  long-standing conservative business and financing strategies and metrics will  remain appropriate for the rating over the next 12-to-24 months. The following factors may result in positive momentum in the rating and/or  Outlook: --A sustained and material improvement in coverage for skilled  nursing/post-acute operators in whole and in part; --Reduced tenant concentration; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3x for several  consecutive quarters (coverage was 3.7x for the TTM ended Sept. 30, 2014); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.4x at  Sept. 30, 2014). The following factors may have a negative impact on the ratings or Outlook: --A sustained and material weakening in coverage for skilled nursing/post-acute  operators in whole and in part; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 2.5x; --A liquidity shortfall.

8,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  HCP Inc said it would spin off its beleaguered HCR ManorCare skilled nursing and assisted living business into a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) to focus on assets that are less dependent on government reimbursement.HCP shares rose as much as 6.8 percent on Monday, their biggest intraday percentage gain in nearly five years.The HCR ManorCare business has been a nagging worry for HCP ever since the U.S. Department of Justice sued the unit in April last year over its billing practices.HCP, a healthcare-focused REIT, said the spinoff would allow it to focus on its core businesses - senior housing, life science properties and medical offices.""We need to eliminate the overhang in the HCR ManorCare business so that the rest of the business can flourish,"" Executive Chairman Michael McKee said on a call. The spinoff will lead to a ""new portfolio where private-pay increases to 95 percent from 80 percent,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Richard Anderson wrote in a note.Skilled nursing facilities, which provide long-term care for patients who struggle with regular day-to-day activities, are vulnerable to changes in healthcare policies as they are covered under Medicare and Medicaid. Ventas Inc, another healthcare REIT, also separated its skilled nursing facilities last year to focus on its hospital business.Several REITs including NorthStar Realty Finance Corp , Simon Property Group Inc and Cousin Properties Inc, have spun off assets in the past couple of years in a bid to simplify their businesses.After the spinoff, HCP expects to have more than 860 properties generating an estimated annual income of about $1.4 billion, the company said on Monday. The new REIT, which will also hold some other nursing facilities of HCP, will own over 320 properties with estimated annual rent of about $485 million.Mark Ordan, who has joined HCP as senior adviser, will be the chief executive of the new company.HCP shares were up 4.8 percent at $36.22 in noon trading.

20,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has removed HCP, Inc. from Rating  Watch Negative and affirmed the company's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and debt  ratings at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions  follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BBB' IDR and Stable Outlook reflect Fitch's expectation that HCP's leverage  and liquidity will stabilize pro forma following its spin-off of HCP's HCR  ManorCare Inc.'s (HCR) real estate into Quality Care Properties (NYSE: QCP). The  recently completed $1.75 billion debt issuances by QCP and subsequent dividend  to HCP, along with significant progress on dispositions resolve the uncertainty  and execution risk that the previous Rating Watch Negative captured.  Round-trip, Fitch views the HCR investment as having been a distraction to  management and a headwind against relative access to capital over the past few  years. The lease amendment in 2015 and the QCP spin-off in 2016 will have  increased leverage by approximately 1x. HCP will be a predominantly private-pay  healthcare REIT focusing on senior housing, medical office and life science with  some debt and hospital investments pro forma for its permanent separation from  HCR.  LEVERAGE TO SUSTAIN IN LOW 6x RANGE Fitch projects that leverage will sustain in the 6x - 6.5x range in 2017 and  2018 pro forma for announced dispositions and assuming $750 million per year of  acquisitions. Fitch views leverage sustaining between 6x - 7x as being  appropriate for the 'BBB' rating. Leverage could migrate lower depending upon  acquisition volumes and funding mix, though Fitch expects the issuer's primary  focus will be demonstrating accretive growth to shareholders. This compares to  leverage in the high-4x to mid-5x range in 2012 through 2014 before the lease  amendment and spin-off. Fitch projects fixed-charge coverage (FCC) will sustain  in the mid-to-high 3x range through 2018, which is strong for the 'BBB' rating  and comparable to prior years (3.5x in 2015 and 3.8x in 2014).  AMPLE LIQUIDITY WHILE RE-ESTABLISHING ITSELF WITH INVESTORS HCP will have ample liquidity to retire maturing debt obligations through 2018  which provides it time to re-establish itself with debt and equity investors.  HCP has not issued non-bank debt or issued equity since late 2015. Fitch views  HCP as having weaker access to capital relative to its higher rated peers, which  is another factor driving the ratings differential, and Fitch does not expect  this will change meaningfully through the rating horizon. However, the  differential should stabilize, if not improve, given the removal of the HCR  overhang and return to growth.  HCP will receive approximately $1.7 billion as a dividend from QCP, which  recently completed its debt issuance along with at least $700 million of  additional proceeds from announced dispositions on a net basis. These proceeds,  when combined with unrestricted cash, availability under the $2 billion  revolving credit facility due 2018 and Fitch's estimate of pro forma retained  cash flow from operations after dividends, cover uses by 1x assuming no access  to external capital for the period July 1, 2016 through Dec. 31, 2018. Fitch  considers uses to be debt maturities, development expenditures, maintenance  capital expenditures and announced acquisitions. Fitch's projections assume HCP  will return to the unsecured debt capital markets in 2017 to re-establish itself  with investors and fund growth.  HIGHER QUALITY PORTFOLIO BUT COST OF CAPITAL INFLUENCES COMPETITIVE POSITION HCP's portfolio will be of a higher quality going forward focusing on senior  housing (54% of net operating income), life science (21%) and medical office  buildings at 19%. Government reimbursement risk will decline with NOI backed by  private-pay sources comprising approximately 95% of revenues. While improved,  Fitch expects management will look to resolve or dispose of assets with thinner  coverage (e.g. the Brookdale assets, certain debt investments in the United  Kingdom) and to reduce tenant concentration.  Fitch believes there is some risk that HCP will be incentivized to acquire  weaker assets or ones with more execution risk (i.e. higher yielding) as it is  pressured to demonstrate growth while at a competitive disadvantage to do so  given its relative cost of capital. Cost of capital is a key differentiator  between healthcare REITs given their acquisitiveness. Fitch expects HCP's cost  of debt and equity capital will remain higher than its peers as a result of  weaker metrics, lower ratings and the uncertainty surrounding operating and  financial policies until the permanent management team is finalized.  CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY TO REMAIN BELOW AVERAGE Unsecured bondholders will be supported by less contingent liquidity after the  spin-off and asset sales as the HCR portfolio was one of the largest  contributors of wholly-owned unencumbered net operating income. Fitch estimates  that unencumbered assets (assuming a stressed 8% - 10% cap rates) will cover  unsecured debt by 1.4x - 1.7x pro forma. This compares to 1.7x - 2.2x at Dec.  31, 2015 and from 2x - 2.4x before the rent reduction earlier in 2015. HCP's  contingent liquidity will likely sustain below the 2.0x typically carried by  investment grade REITs. Unencumbered assets are REITs' primary sources of  contingent liquidity to raise proceeds via a sale or pledge against during a  time of stress. Moreover, this metric may fluctuate depending on the extent to  which HCP uses joint ventures.  EVOLVING MANAGEMENT TEAM HCP will have new leadership at the CEO, CFO and CIO positions once a permanent  CEO is hired. Fitch recognizes the potential for new leadership to change  strategic goals and financial policies but expects the Board of Directors will  have an active role given the continuity in financial policies during prior  management changes. Fitch expects HCP's initial investments will receive more  scrutiny than its peers' from debt and equity investors. Highly successful or  unsuccessful outcomes may play an outsized role in shaping investors' perception  of the company, its deal sourcing and underwriting expertise and, as a result,  its access to capital.  Fitch generally views the additions of J. Hutchens (CIO) and K. Hsiao (EVP -  Senior Housing) favorably given their prior roles at operating companies (COO of  Emeritus Corporation and CEO of Holiday Retirement, respectively) considering  the higher degree of interconnectedness between healthcare REITs and their  tenants than other REIT sectors. Prior leadership at HCP came from banking,  commercial real estate services and life science / office backgrounds. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain favorable with low single digit growth in  same-store net operating income despite supply in some senior housing markets; --The issuer completes the QCP spin-off and announced dispositions; --The issuer manages acquisition volumes and capital markets activity to sustain  leverage between 6x-6.5x; --The issuer's access to debt and equity capital improves but remains below  prior levels and peers. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum for the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 6x; --Fitch's expectation of HCP restoring its access to unsecured debt and equity  capital to levels consistent with years prior to 2016 and consistent with higher  rated peers.  The following factors may result in negative momentum for the ratings and/or  Outlook:  --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 7x; --Fitch's expectation of unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt  sustaining below 2x; --Fitch's expectation of HCP having weak absolute or weaker relative access to  capital than its peers. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has removed from Rating Watch Negative and affirmed the following ratings:  HCP, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB'; --Unsecured bank credit facility at 'BBB'; --Unsecured term loans at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Financial statement adjustments  that depart materially from those contained in the published financial  statements of the relevant rated entity or obligor are disclosed below: --Historical and projected recurring operating EBITDA is adjusted to add back  non-cash stock based compensation and include operating income from discontinued  operations.  --Historical recurring operating EBITDA referenced in prior press releases  calculated DFL income on a cash basis rather than GAAP increasing leverage by  0.2x to 0.3x. This adjustment became less relevant when HCP began to report the  HCR DFL on a cash basis; --Fitch has adjusted the historical and projected net debt by assuming the  issuer requires $25 million of cash for working capital purposes which is  otherwise unavailable to repay debt.
