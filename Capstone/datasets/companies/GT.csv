0,"   By Nicholas Vinocur | PARIS  PARIS French trade unionists held two executives overnight on Tuesday at the country's Goodyear tyre plant - a flashpoint for France's troubled industrial relations - to demand higher pay-outs for more than a thousand planned layoffs.Workers at the idled factory in the northern city of Amiens have been trying to negotiate redundancy terms with management for nearly a year, after Texan tyre tycoon Maurice Taylor withdrew a potential rescue bid on the grounds that French workers were lazy - triggering a political storm.After a court rejected their most recent appeal against the plant's closure, members of the hard-left CGT union locked up production and human resources directors Michel Dheilly and Bernard Glesser on Monday.France 2 TV showed the Goodyear executives seated at a table staring straight ahead as workers shouted in their ears. One director had a bed pan thrust in his face. The unionists said the two men were being amply supplied with food and water.The so-called ""boss-napping"" is the first since a spate of them in 2009 prompted conservative ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy to give police powers to intervene by force if necessary.Tough labor tactics have declined under Socialist President Francois Hollande. But the situation in the factory, where the hardline CGT has majority staff backing, creates a dilemma for the left-wing government wary of cracking down too hard on protests by their blue-collar voters. ""We're ready to go all the way,"" said CGT union delegate Franck Jurek. ""It can last for a few more hours, it can last for a few days or a few weeks. As long as our demands are not met, these two people stay with us.""""WE'D CALL THIS A KIDNAPPING"" The boss-napping may be the final chapter in a dispute which started in 2009 when Goodyear management said the plant in France was not competitive enough to keep running and needed modernization to produce the sort of tyres now required on the market. Goodyear workers rejected plans to tighten costs and labor conditions while across the street workers at the Dunlop tyre plant owned by the same Dunlop-Goodyear parent accepted new conditions. That plant is still producing after receiving hefty investments.The unions at Goodyear are now no longer fighting to keep the plant open, but want severance packages of between 80,000 euros ($109,100) and 180,000 euros depending on seniority. Management's proposals have not been made public.The unions also want access to job re-training benefits for 24 months rather than 15, as currently proposed, Jurek said. ""We've decided with the workers to change tactics to extract as much money as possible,"" he added.While holding a person against their will for less than 7 days is punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a 75,000-euro fine, courts rarely enforce the penalties. Goodyear said in a statement it had filed a complaint on a lesser charge of impeding personal mobility.The police declined to comment on the case.Maurice Taylor, chief executive of Titan International, said the boss-napping had killed any chance of a takeover for the plant.""In the United States, we'd call this a kidnapping,"" he told Europe 1 radio. ""These people would be arrested and charged... In France your government does nothing, it seems crazy.""

1,"  LILLE, France Jan 22 Workers who took two executives hostage at France's Goodyear tyre plant earlier in January are set to end an  occupation of their doomed factory after a redundancy payoff deal, labour union officials said on Wednesday.The idled factory in the northern city of Amiens, where the unions have been fighting for almost a year to secure a better payoff for 1,170 workers, has been occupied since Jan. 7.The payoff deal, for an undisclosed sum, was approved by a vote among Goodyear workers on Wednesday and involved an improved package in return for ending the occupation, union officials said. Unions have been trying to negotiate redundancy terms with management after Texan tyre tycoon Maurice Taylor withdrew a potential rescue bid on the grounds that French workers were lazy - triggering a political storm. After a court rejected their most recent appeal against the plant's closure, members of the hard-left CGT union locked up production and human resources directors Michel Dheilly and Bernard Glesser.

2,"  * Purchase ranks among Continental's biggest-ever deals* Contitech can imagine further acquisitions -division chief* Fitch sees no immediate impact on Continental's ratingsBy Andreas CremerBERLIN, Feb 10 German tyre and car parts maker Continental has agreed to buy U.S. private equity investor Carlyle Group's Veyance Technologies, which once belonged to its rival Goodyear, for 1.4 billion euros ($1.9  billion).Veyance, which employs 9,000 workers at 27 plants worldwide producing industrial hoses and belting, will be integrated into the German company's Contitech division, Continental said.""Veyance will make an immediate positive contribution to the company's profitability,"" Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said, adding that the purchase will be paid for from cash and available credit lines. Contitech can imagine further acquisitions after the purchase of the U.S. competitor, which will raise the share of non-automotive sales at Continental to 32 percent of group revenue from 28 percent, still short of a 40-percent goal, division chief Heinz-Gerhard Wente said on a conference call.Continental expects group sales to rise by more than 5 percent this year to about 35 billion euros as world auto markets recover, the company said last month.The company aims for its adjusted operating margin to stay ""comfortably"" above 10 percent, after 11.2 percent in 2013. It is due to publish full results for 2013 on March 6.Carlyle bought Veyance from Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in 2007 for $1.475 billion and was licensed to continue to use the Goodyear Engineered Products brand for its range of belts, hoses and other products. The addition to Contitech, which accounts for more than 10 percent of Continental's 2013 sales of 33.3 billion euros, will increase the company's presence in the United States and South America and create other opportunities overseas, Wente said.Combined with Veyance, Contitech will have 39,000 employees and sales of about 5.4 billion euros. Veyance generated more than half of its $2 billion 2013 sales in North America.The deal, the closing of which is not expected before late September, may create synergies worth about 75 million euros in the next four years, Wente said. Fitch Ratings said on Monday that the purchase will have no immediate impact on Continental's ratings.""The negative effect on credit metrics is modest and should be offset by the mildly positive impact on the group's business profile,"" the firm said.Barclays and Latham & Watkins LLP were financial and legal advisers to Carlyle. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP served as a legal adviser to Continental.The acquisition announced on Monday ranks among Continental's biggest deals to date and is Contitech's largest purchase by sales volume, a spokesman said.In 2007 Continental bought Siemens's VDO automotive division for 11.4 billion euros, still the biggest purchase in the company's 142-year history.A year earlier, Continental acquired the automotive electronics unit of Motorola Inc for $1 billion to expand in in-vehicle communications.",2014-02-10,GT,"Mon Feb 10, 2014 | 1:31pm EST",UPDATE 2-Germany's Continental to buy U.S. firm Veyance for $1.9 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/continental-deal-idUSL5N0LF2TM20140210?type=companyNews

Some dealers said prices may pick up to $1.50 and above if market sentiment improves.Malaysia's SMR20 grade changed hands at $1.52-$1.53 per kg on free-on-board basis and Thailand's RSS3 grade was sold between $1.60 and $1.62 for December shipment, dealers said.There were no reports of deals for the Thai STR20 grade, which was being offered at $1.56-$1.57 per kg including freight. Rubber futures in Singapore, which many in the region consider as benchmark along with those traded in Japan, remained below $1.50 since breaching that level in late September.Front-month rubber on the Singapore Exchange was at 148.70 U.S. cents per kg on Wednesday, off this month's trough of $137.40 which was its weakest since April 2009. THAILAND OUTPUT Members of the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries, which together account for more than 90 percent of global natural rubber output, met in Kuala Lumpur on Monday but they did not appear any closer to coming up with a more drastic measure to shore up prices than the minimum-price plan.Malaysia is planning to boost rubber consumption at home by constructing rubberised roads from next year.Top rubber producer Thailand, which announced similar plans earlier this year to use rubber for roads, pavements and reservoirs, uses 3.3 tonnes of natural rubber for every 1 kilometer of road.Thailand's rubber output is seen dropping this year, versus earlier expectations for a rise, as plummeting prices drive away tappers and heavy rains slow harvesting.An official with the Thai Rubber Association said production will unlikely even reach 3.8 million tonnes in 2014, compared to the 4.2 million tonnes churned out last year.""Lower production will definitely support the market,"" the Thai-based dealer said.""If supply has reduced, it will help balance out the surplus in the past, then eventually prices will adjust.""

The company has managed to boost margins in the past few years even though car sales in Europe fell to historic lows. It has done this by focusing since 2010 on more upmarket tyres for brands such as Mercedes, Audi, and BMW - luxury carmakers which have weathered the downturn better than their mainstream rivals.Pirelli said 2014 operating profit rose 6.8 percent to 838 million euros helped by its focus on higher-margin products, a better price mix and efficiency measures. Analysts were expecting a 837 million euro operating profit, according to a consensus provided by the company. Revenues stood at 6.02 billion euros, down from 6.06 billion the previous year and compared with an analyst consensus of 6.05 billion euros.The Italian group's results compare with weaker results from France's Michelin, which pledged to step up cost-cutting efforts after cut-price competition hit profits more than expected last year.Pirelli's results were released after the Milan stock market closed on Thursday.

47,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss  Nov 3 Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management gained 8.4 percent last month as its bets on Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co, NCR Corp, and its recently acquired stake in LPL Financial Holdings Inc paid off.October's returns helped shrink the $3 billion fund's year-to-date decline to 4 percent from a double-digit loss at the end of September, a person familiar with the returns but not authorized to discuss them publicly said.The San Francisco-based Marcato, run by Richard McGuire, saw LPL Financial's stock gain 8 percent in October. The fund had announced in mid-September that it bought 6.3 percent of the company, one of the country's largest independent broker dealers. Stock in global technology company NCR, where McGuire joined the board nearly one year ago, jumped 15 percent during the month and Goodyear gained 12 percent. The fund's stake in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, where McGuire has urged management to cut costs and improve performance, also rose, gaining 6 percent last month.McGuire set up Marcato five years ago after leaving William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management and has returned an average 9 percent a year since. October proved a welcome relief for many investors when stronger earnings reports overshadowed earlier worries about slowing growth in China, falling energy prices, and concerns over drug company price hikes which had sent stocks reeling over the summer. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 8.3 percent in October.But for many hedge funds October was still difficult due to a handful of losing bets, including on widely held Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which tumbled 47 percent. The average hedge fund gained just 1.46 percent in October, leaving it off 1.63 percent for the year, Hedge Fund Research data show. Activist investors like Marcato, meanwhile, have lost an average 5.61 percent this year through the end of September, according to HFR. HFR's October figures for activists are not out yet.In its September regulatory filing Marcato said it planned to discuss LPL's capital structure and capital allocation with management. By the end of October, the company announced a $500 million share buyback plan, its most aggressive ever.During the third quarter, McGuire launched a new portfolio called the Marcato Encore fund which invests in smaller companies including investment management firm Virtus Investment Partners Inc and Continental Building Products Inc .

48,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON A slew of major  U.S. corporations are likely to announce in the next few weeks whether they will take big writedowns for their troubled Venezuela operations, and some may say they are leaving the country altogether. The companies may decide to slash the valuations of their businesses and take charges based on declines in some of the  oil producing nation’s four exchange rates for the bolivar currency, of which three are official and one black market, and then deconsolidate the operations on their balance sheets, Wall Street securities analysts said.They may have more reason to accelerate the process after the socialist government on Friday declared a 60-day economic emergency, which would give President Nicolas Maduro wider powers to intervene in companies or limit access to already scarce dollars in Venezuela.It also disclosed that the nation’s economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year while the official annual inflation rate was the world’s highest at 141.5 percent in that period, as plunging oil prices, and what critics of Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.    Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.    The Reuters analysis shows that U.S. companies with exposure could face total writedowns of more than $3 billion if they revalue their assets in Venezuela using the less preferential Simadi exchange rate of nearly 200 bolivars to the dollar. In the past, many companies valued their assets using the main official rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar.     But even that change may not reveal the full extent of the problem given that the black market exchange rate has worsened to about 878 bolivars to the dollar from about 190 bolivars a year ago, according to dolartoday.com, a website that tracks the rate.        MONITORING DAY-BY-DAY     Increased government regulations and lack of access to U.S. dollars at lower rates could force companies such as Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co to deconsolidate if they lose further control over their operations. Goodyear said in recent financial disclosures that a deconsolidation move would trigger a one-time, pre-tax charge of more than $500 million and what it termed “derecognition” of $293 million of cash on its balance sheet. Goodyear was not immediately available for comment. At a Jan. 12 investor conference, Goodyear Chief Financial Officer Laura Thompson described Venezuela as “a very volatile environment.”“The outlook is pretty uncertain. Our visibility is unclear, but we continue to monitor the situation day-by-day, quarter-by-quarter, as we go,” Thompson said.Deconsolidation under U.S. accounting rules allow companies to treat a subsidiary in a volatile foreign market as an investment rather than an operating unit, while writing down the market value of that subsidiary largely insulates the parent company from future hits to its financial results.So far, blue-chip companies that have deconsolidated in Venezuela and written off nearly all of their investment there include Procter & Gamble Co, Pepsico Inc and Ford Motor Co. Among those who have departed altogether is cleaning products maker Clorox Co.One major pressure point could be drug companies. Abbott Laboratories, Abbvie Inc, Merck & Co Inc, Pfizer Inc and Zoetis Inc have about $1.8 billion in combined net monetary assets exposed to the bolivar, recent U.S. regulatory filings show.Zoetis, which declined to comment for this story, began scaling back operations in Venezuela several months ago, executives have said previously. Pfizer, Merck and Abbvie did not return messages seeking comment. Abbott declined to comment.These companies’ preferential access to dollars at the official exchange rate has become more difficult, even as the government has made availability of drugs a priority. But the economic crisis has worsened so much that now less business is being done at the official rate, even for essential food and medicine.The government also has another lower official rate known as the Sicad rate – that has been at around 13 bolivars to the dollar – but there are also very few dollars available at that rate. The last Sicad auction was in September.    Meanwhile, it is not uncommon for U.S. companies to have currency exchange settlements pending with the Venezuelan government for years, U.S. regulatory filings show.SUSPENDED SHIPMENTS Other companies selling sensitive products, such as baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, have had to adjust their practices because of constraints placed by the Venezuelan government on the release of U.S. dollars to repatriate cash back to the United States. Mead suspended shipments to Venezuela temporarily, the company said during an October investor day presentation. The company was not available for comment.Consumer products maker Newell Rubbermaid Inc has been identified by some Wall Street analysts as the next major U.S. company that will likely take action to protect itself from Venezuela's crumbling economy.""We continue to view a deconsolidation (in Venezuela) as a likely event"" when Newell reports fourth-quarter results on Jan 29, analysts at Jefferies Companies said last week in a research note.If Newell were to deconsolidate it would take a one-time charge of $111 million, according to company commentary in recent U.S. regulatory filings. Newell declined to comment for this story.Such a move would largely protect the company from taking further Venezuela-related hits to its financial results in the future.Among U.S. companies, Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International Inc has one of the largest remaining exposures to Venezuela, with $617 million in net assets, according to the Reuters analysis of corporate disclosures.""We would expect to provide an update on Venezuela and other markets when we announce our (fourth quarter) earnings on Feb. 3, but I’m not able to provide comment before that time due to quiet period,” said Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens.Besides Newell and Goodyear, 3M Co, Colgate Palmolive Co and Herbalife Ltd have at least raised the specter of insulating their financial results from Venezuela. In U.S. regulatory filings over the past three months, the companies have talked about deconsolidation if conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate.     Toy maker Mattel Inc has said it may consider ceasing operations in Venezuela.

49,"   By David Randall and Marcus E. Howard | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. companies are singing the warm weather blues this corporate earnings season. The long spate of warm temperatures this winter likely will have a slightly positive affect on the U.S. economy, as a whole as construction projects can continue unabated and fewer workers will need to leave the office on account of snow, said Brain Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds. After a December that was the warmest on record in most of the United States, a total of 38 U.S. companies have mentioned unusually high temperatures as a factor in their most recent quarterly profit results since the start of the year, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis of earnings calls transcripts.That is a jump from just nine companies who said they were feeling an impact from higher-than-average temperatures at this point last year, when a warm spell in Europe affected sales revenue at companies including Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co and Deckers Outdoor Corp. Companies who are feeling the heat range from the obvious, like snowmobile maker Polaris Industries Inc who called its quarter ""difficult and disappointing"" and noted it was the worst year-over-year performance since 2009, to those farther afield. Monro Muffler Brake Inc told analysts that ""unseasonably warm weather"" across the Northeast led to a 9.0 percent decline in same-store sales in November, while grocery-store chain Supervalu Inc cited high temperatures in Florida cutting into the quality and availability of strawberries and other produce.Not every company is hurting though. McDonald's Corp told analysts that the mild weather added a ""positive contribution"" to sales, while Petmed Express Inc said warm temperatures are helping sales because customers are administering flea and tick medication to their pets well into the winter.  Yet there is also the danger that consumers will start their spring and summer spending early and forgo winter-related purchases entirely, cutting sales of retailers, said Douglas Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research. Department store chain Macy's Inc said in early January it plans to cut more than 2,000 jobs after its same-store sales fell 4.7 percent in November and December. It estimated that 80 percent of the sales decline was due to warm temperatures that hurt sales of sweaters, coats and gloves.  ""Even with low gas prices, consumers are looking for ways to save money, and the weather is giving them a perfect excuse,"" Roberts said.

50,"   By Arunima Banerjee and Shashwat Awasthi  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as its sales volumes in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region recovered after more than a year of decline and its raw material costs fell.Shares of the No.1 U.S. tire maker rose as much as 9 percent in morning trading on Tuesday. Goodyear's sales volume in EMEA rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter, driven by strong demand for replacement tires. The region accounts for nearly a third of the company's total revenue. ""We are positive on EMEA's long-term potential and we believe stronger margins are achievable in the competitive EMEA market,"" Chief Executive Richard Kramer said on a conference call.The company, which is facing stiff competition in Europe from Michelin (MICP.PA), Continental AG (CONG.DE) and Pirelli PECIn.MI, has been moving some operations to lower cost centers in EMEA.Goodyear has also benefited from lower oil and rubber prices, with its cost of goods sold declining 8 percent in the quarter. The company, whose brands include Dunlop and Fulda tires, expects raw material prices to fall further by 5 percent this year.  Brent crude prices LCOc1 nearly halved from a year earlier in the fourth quarter and rubber prices JRUc6 fell 4 percent.Goodyear said it expected to spend $700 million on restructuring between 2014 and 2016, higher than the $600 million it had estimated earlier.  DOLLAR PINCHES Goodyear reported a net loss of $380 million, or $1.42 per share, attributable to shareholders for the quarter ended Dec. 31, hurt by a charge related to its Venezuela operations. Excluding items, the company earned 93 cents per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of 75 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue declined 6.7 percent to $4.06 billion, hit by a strong dollar, but beat analysts' expectations of $4.01 billion.

51,"   By Arunima Banerjee and Shashwat Awasthi  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as its sales volumes in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region recovered after more than a year of decline and its raw material costs fell.Shares of the No.1 U.S. tire maker rose as much as 9 percent in morning trading on Tuesday. Goodyear's sales volume in EMEA rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter, driven by strong demand for replacement tires. The region accounts for nearly a third of the company's total revenue. ""We are positive on EMEA's long-term potential and we believe stronger margins are achievable in the competitive EMEA market,"" Chief Executive Richard Kramer said on a conference call.The company, which is facing stiff competition in Europe from Michelin (MICP.PA), Continental AG (CONG.DE) and Pirelli PECIn.MI, has been moving some operations to lower cost centers in EMEA.Goodyear has also benefited from lower oil and rubber prices, with its cost of goods sold declining 8 percent in the quarter. The company, whose brands include Dunlop and Fulda tires, expects raw material prices to fall further by 5 percent this year.  Brent crude prices LCOc1 nearly halved from a year earlier in the fourth quarter and rubber prices JRUc6 fell 4 percent.Goodyear said it expected to spend $700 million on restructuring between 2014 and 2016, higher than the $600 million it had estimated earlier.

A unanimous three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a 2015 decision dismissing the U.S. lawsuit saying the case belongs in France, in part because the plaintiffs live in France, worked for a French subsidiary of Goodyear in a French factory and suffered their injuries in France.

68,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Marcato International, an activist hedge fund that mainly bets on U.S. equities, returned 10.4 percent in July, handily beating the broader stock market index's gain, when the fund made two new investments.July's gain helped shrink the fund's losses for the year, leaving it down 2.7 percent through the end of July, according to a shareholder update sent to investors in the $1.5 billion fund firm and seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 3.7 percent in July and is up 7.7 percent for the year. Marcato last week said that it now owns 5.1 percent stakes in crane and heavy equipment manufacturer Terex Corp. and restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings Inc, sending the share price of both companies higher. Neither company has big name hedge fund investors among its biggest owners, leaving the door open for Marcato to become the driving force in pushing management to use its capital better and buy more of its own shares.At the same time, Marcato's three biggest holdings - Bank of New York Mellon, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and auction house Sotheby's - also performed well with Sotheby's climbing 18 percent. Last week, Taikang Life Insurance, run by Chen Dongsheng, who founded Chinese auction house China Guardian, took a 13.5 percent stake in Sotheby's. Marcato is run by Mick McGuire who had been a partner in Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management before launching his firm six years ago. The fund has returned an average 9 percent a year since its launch.

78,"   By Alison Frankel  In its 1991 decision in Chambers v. NASCO, the U.S. Supreme Court gave federal trial judges a lot of leeway to police the integrity of their dockets. The case involved a Louisiana television station operator that backed out of a deal to sell the station, then engaged in all sorts of litigation chicanery when the purchaser sued to enforce the sales contract. The justices held that the district judge properly exercised his inherent power when he awarded the erstwhile purchaser all of its attorneys' fees to punish the TV station operator for its misconduct.Various federal rules of civil procedure might have covered some of the operator’s bad acts, the Supreme Court said, but “requiring the court to apply the other mechanisms to discrete occurrences before invoking the inherent power to address remaining instances of sanctionable conduct would serve only to foster extensive and needless satellite litigation, which is contrary to the aim of the rules themselves.”Three years after the Chambers decision, the Supreme Court looked at sanctions for civil contempt in United Mine Workers v. Bagwell. In Bagwell, which involved contempt sanctions for the union’s repeated violations of an injunction against strike-related activities, the justices were more leery of federal judges’ power. The Supreme Court found that the sanctions were akin to a criminal penalty because they were intended to punish the union, not to coerce compliance with the injunction. In that circumstance, the court said, the union was entitled to the due process protections for criminal defendants.In a concurrence, Justice Antonin Scalia highlighted a fundamental concern about judges issuing sanctions. “That one and the same person should be able to make the rule, to adjudicate its violation, and to assess its penalty is out of accord with our usual notions of fairness and separation of powers,” he wrote. “And it is worse still for that person to conduct the adjudication without affording the protections usually given in criminal trials.” I’m reminding you about these two seemingly divergent takes on federal judges’ power to set sanctions because the current court is going to have to reconcile them this term in Goodyear v. Haeger, which presents the question of whether trial judges must “tailor compensatory civil sanctions imposed under inherent powers to harm directly caused by sanctionable misconduct when the court does not afford sanctioned parties the protections of criminal due process.”The tire company filed its merits brief last week, arguing that if Bagwell and Chambers are in tension – which they certainly seem to be – then Bagwell should control. According to Goodyear’s lawyers at Squire Patton Boggs, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mistakenly relied on Chambers to affirm a $2.7 million sanction against the company and its outside lawyers, awarded under the trial judge’s equitable powers.The underlying product liability case claimed that Goodyear tires were responsible for a motor home accident that injured four members of the Haeger family. After about five years of litigation, Goodyear settled the case in 2010 for an undisclosed amount. Several months later, the Haegers’ lawyer read an account of a different case involving the same supposedly defective tires. In that case, Goodyear produced data from heat and speed tests that the company did not turn over in the Haegers’ suit. The Haegers argued that the entire course of the case was warped by that failure to disclose the testing data. (In their brief opposing Goodyear’s petition for Supreme Court review, the Haegers’ Supreme Court counsel, John Egbert of Jennings Strouss & Salmon, said the company “sent the Haegers on a completely misdirected frolic.” The trial judge, U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver of Phoenix, agreed. She wrote a lengthy opinion detailing Goodyear’s alleged misconduct and, citing her inherent authority to issue sanctions, ended up awarding the Haegers $2.7 million – just about all of their lawyers’ fees and costs in the case. The judge said it would be “inappropriate to limit the award to the fees and costs that could be directly linked to the misconduct” because “it would be impossible to draw the precise causal connections between the misconduct and the fees (the Haegers) incurred.” A split 9th Circuit panel issued its affirmance of Judge Silver’s sanction in March 2016.In its Supreme Court brief, Goodyear said Judge Silver effectively hit the company with a criminal penalty because the sanctions award is not tethered to whatever harm the Haegers suffered from the alleged litigation misconduct. (That is especially true, the company said, because the Haegers recently settled a fraud suit against Goodyear’s outside counsel that sought the same fees and costs they were awarded in the sanctions decision.) Goodyear’s failure to disclose the testing data, the company contends, did not cause the Haegers to incur legal costs of $2.7 million. “Causation functions as an important check on a court's inherent power,” the brief said. “Without this constraint, courts are free to impose more drastic monetary sanctions under inherent powers than those available for the ostensibly more serious sanction of contempt.”Under the Supreme Court’s holding in Bagwell, Goodyear said, if the company had defied a court order from Judge Silver and been found to be in contempt, it would be on the hook for less money than the judge awarded via her inherent authority. Goodyear called that a “perverse” outcome. “Given that contempt covers direct defiance of a court order, one would not expect inherent authority sanctions to entail much more sweeping relief for subtler forms of misconduct,” it said.The company also claimed the 9th Circuit decision is “dangerous” precedent that essentially allows trial courts free rein to punish misconduct. “The absence of a causation requirement pries open the door to an almost boundless view of monetary awards under inherent authority,” the brief said. “The 9th Circuit majority took a step in that direction, implying that lost settlement value might justify a high sanctions amount. But going beyond fees would be the equivalent of transforming an inherent powers sanctions award into a tort remedy, creating a host of proof and due process problems.”The Haegers’ lawyer, Egbert, sent me an email statement about Goodyear’s brief, disputing Goodyear’s premise that the lower courts did not link the dollar value of the sanction to the company’s supposed wrongdoing. “Far from rejecting ‘any causation requirement,’ the 9th Circuit expressly concluded that ‘there is no doubt that (Goodyear’s) bad faith conduct caused significant harm in forcing the Haegers to engage in sham litigation,’” Egbert said. “Not only did the 9th Circuit acknowledge that a causal link was required - and satisfied - in this case, but it also went on to carefully ‘consider how close a link is required between the harm caused and the compensatory sanctions awarded when a court invokes its inherent power.’”",2016-11-21,GT,"Mon Nov 21, 2016 | 3:01pm EST",Goodyear asks SCOTUS to restrict federal judges’ inherent sanctions power,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-otc-goodyear-idUSKBN13G28R?type=companyNews
