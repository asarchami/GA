""This revision is even more dire than we expected,"" Morningstar analyst Erin Lash wrote in a note.ConAgra boosted its private brands business with the $5 billion acquisition of Ralcorp Holdings in January last year as recession-hit shoppers bought cheaper store-branded products.ConAgra, however, cut its full-year profit forecast twice, blaming weak sales in its private-label business and a steeper-than-expected fall in sales of its own brands.The private brands business, which makes cereals, pasta, snacks and sauces that retailers sell as their own, accounted for 24 percent of ConAgra's total sales in the third quarter. Profit from the business is likely to drop by about $60 million in the fourth quarter due to discounts and costs related to the Ralcorp acquisition, ConAgra said.The company said in February that its private-label business was taking longer than anticipated to reach expected operating profit levels, forcing it to cut prices to stem a fall in sales volumes.Chief Executive Gary Rodkin said in May that discounting was likely to pressure margins in the next several quarters. The lower profit estimate was not because of ""new or deeper challenges; it's simply a reflection that it will take time to grow margins,"" ConAgra spokeswoman Teresa Paulsen said in an email on Wednesday.Sales volume in consumer foods, the company's largest business, dropped 7 percent in the fourth quarter. The business sells meals, snacks and desserts such as Act II popcorn and Blue Bonnet spread.A change in consumer attitudes towards heavily processed foods is likely to hit sales at ConAgra and General Mills Inc , Kellogg Co and Campbell Soup Co, Bernstein Research analyst Alexia Howard wrote in a note.ConAgra said it expected to take $681 million in non-cash impairment charges in the fourth quarter, mostly in the private brands business.The company said profits in its private brands business were likely to be lower in the next several years than it had expected. Profit is expected to grow in the mid-single digits for the year ending May 2015.ConAgra is scheduled to report its results on June 26.The company's shares were down 7.3 percent at $30.45 in noon trading.

30,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Mill Inc (GIS.N), which owes its return to growth in the United States to its purchase of organic macaroni-and-cheese maker Annie’s Inc and the popularity of its yogurt, faces a challenge with its traditional cereal brands.The maker of Yoplait, Nature Valley and Cheerios reported a 1 percent rise in U.S. sales in the third quarter ended on Feb. 22. It said the results marked an inflection point from the declines of the first half of the fiscal year. But without a 2 percentage point bump from the October acquisition of Annie's, sales were down. U.S. cereal sales, a key focus area of the company, were flat. The numbers illustrate a growing shift by consumers toward foods they consider healthier, whether due to their organic origins or the main nutrients associated with them. The trend has weighed on the performance of the most entrenched processed food makers, including General Mills, Kraft Foods Group Inc KFT.N and Kellogg Co (K.N).Besides the Annie's purchase, General Mills has altered its Yoplait yogurt to appeal to health-conscious consumers by simplifying ingredients and removing high fructose corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors. Yogurt sales were up 10 percent in the third quarter. But breakfast cereals, the company's third-biggest category behind snacks and yogurt, remain a tough spot. Cereals accounted for roughly $2.9 billion of the company's $17.9 billion in annual sales in fiscal 2014. Industrywide, U.S. cereal sales are expected to decline at a rate of 1 percent to 2 percent through 2019, according to Euromonitor International.

35,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK By removing artificial colors and flavors and selling gluten-free cereals, General Mills Inc (GIS.N) Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell is betting his company can buck a broader decline in U.S. cereal sales.General Mills will begin marketing five of its biggest Cheerios varieties as gluten free later this summer. The company also said in June that it is removing artificial flavors and colors from all of its cereals, a move that its competitors have made with other products.""We've developed what we think is a good model and a good theory about how people are thinking about breakfast,"" Powell said in an interview on Wednesday. ""We've learned that part of what's happening with the cereal category is there are things people are avoiding."" The moves illustrate how General Mills is tweaking its offerings as consumer perception of what is healthy changes. While people used to make decisions based on calorie counts, they are now looking for other attributes such as ingredients that are easier to understand and foods higher in protein, according to industry executives. One casualty of that shift has been cereal, whose U.S. sales at General Mills fell 3 percent to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2015. Cereal is General Mills' second-largest business in the United States.   Overall, U.S. cereal sales are expected to decline at an annual rate of 1 percent to 2 percent through 2019, according to Euromonitor International.But Powell dismissed the idea that U.S. consumers want to leave the category entirely, noting that cereal is still a $10 billion business in the United States.""It's more about providing the right product profile,"" he said. General Mills, like its peers, is under pressure from investors to grow amid changing consumer tastes. The company's overall sales declined 2 percent in fiscal 2015 to $17.6 billion. ""It does get down to making sure that the product ultimately resonates with consumers,"" said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. The company also aims to increase sales in its natural and organics business from roughly $700 million to more than $1 billion by 2020.  The increase would come partly through widening distribution of organic macaroni-and-cheese maker Annie's Inc, which General Mills purchased in October, Powell said. He also said the company would be open to more acquisitions of natural and organic companies. Its portfolio currently includes brands like Cascadian Farm and Larabar.""We’re interested in this space, so if we see other properties that fit well with what we got, we’ll acquire them,"" Powell said.

Nomad recently purchased Britain's Iglo Foods Holdings Ltd, whose brands include Birds Eye, for 2.6 billion euros ($2.83 billion). The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential. Bellisio, Centre and Nomad did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bellisio's frozen meals are found in supermarkets and retail grocers under the Michelina's, Boston Market and Chili's at Home brand names. The company also serves customers in the branded retail, private label and food service sectors. It had $599 million in revenue in the 12 months ending Dec. 28, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.Bellisio was acquired by New York-based Centre Partners in 2011 for an undisclosed amount from its founder Jeno Paulucci, a serial food industry entrepreneur who passed away soon after he agreed to sell the company. An auction for Bellisio would follow General Mills Inc's  sale process for its frozen vegetable brand Green Giant, amid tough market conditions favoring fresher food products.Despite the frozen food industry's struggles, Bellisio may be better positioned than some of its peers, due to its fortified relationships with popular franchises and cost-conscious shoppers who stay loyal to the freezer aisle, according to an industry source.

40,"   By Ramkumar Iyer  Snack food company B&G Foods Inc (BGS.N) said it would buy General Mills Inc's (GIS.N) Green Giant frozen foods and Le Sueur canned vegetables brands for about $765 million to expand its distribution network and enter the frozen foods market. Shares of B&G, which expects the deal to add to earnings immediately, rose as much as 14 percent to a 14-month high on Thursday.Growth in the frozen vegetables category has been sluggish in recent years as consumers shift to fresher items. This has led to companies scaling back marketing spend on frozen foods.B&G plans to double the amount General Mills has been spending on marketing the Green Giant brand, B&G Chief Executive Robert Cantwell said on a conference call. ""In General Mills, Green Giant was an important brand, but they had a different direction...It makes more sense under B&G's ownership and we're going to pay a lot more attention to it,"" Cantwell said. Green Giant, with a portfolio of more than 160 products, is the second-biggest frozen foods brand by market share in the United States and the largest in Canada. B&G, which sells Vermont Maid syrups, Pirate's Booty popcorn and Cream of Wheat breakfast porridge mixes, said it expected the acquired businesses to generate annual sales of about $550 million and add 60 cents per share to its profit.The two brands had net sales of about $585 million in fiscal 2015, General Mills said.  General Mills, like other big packaged food companies, has been looking to shed less-profitable brands to cut costs and focus on faster-growing brands. Reuters reported last week that General Mills was in late-stage talks with B&G to sell Green Giant, whose mascot is the Jolly Green Giant.The sale raises the question of whether General Mills might be considering more extensive portfolio changes to reduce exposure to older legacy brands, Sanford Bernstein Alexia Howard wrote in a note.  General Mills said it would continue to operate the Green Giant business in Europe and select other markets under license from B&G.B&G shares were up 12.6 percent at $34.29 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while General Mills' shares were up 1.3 percent at $57.55.Barclays and RBC Capital Markets are B&G's financial advisers for the deal, while Rothschild advised General Mills.

42,"  (Adds details)Sept 22 General Mills Inc, the maker of Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt, reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit as U.S. sales showed further recovery.The company's shares rose 1.7 percent to $57.77 in premarket trading on Tuesday.General Mills' U.S. sales rose 3.6 percent to $2.53 billion in the first quarter ended Aug. 30, accounting for more than 60 percent of total revenue. The company's sales in the United States have been under pressure as consumers change their eating habits, shifting away from some of the main products it sells, such as meals and cereals.Sales in the latest reported quarter were helped partly by the acquisition of organic food producer Annie's. The deal boosted General Mills's organic food business, which includes Cascadian Farm and healthy snacks makers Food Should Taste Good. Net earnings attributable to the company rose to $426.6 million, or 69 cents per share, from $345.2 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.

44,"  (Adds comments from Wilmar, Kerry)By Martinne Geller and Freya BerryLONDON, Sept 29 The owners of Quorn, a line of meat-free packaged foods, is facing takeover interest from a range of parties from Asia, Europe and North America, as they look to cash in on the world's growing appetite for healthier food.Monde Nissin from the Philippines and Wilmar International  from Singapore are among the parties to have shown an interest, according to sources familiar with the matter.An auction for Quorn, which is owned by Exponent Private Equity, kicked off earlier this month with detailed information  sent to a range of potential bidders, said the sources, who declined to be identified. French yogurt company Danone and Canadian French fries company McCain are also looking at the business, said one of the sources, as well as Ireland's Kerry Group.First-round bids are due in mid-October, but a pre-emptive deal -- in the range of about 500 million pounds ($759 million) -- could be announced as soon as this week, one source said.Wilmar, the world's largest palm oil processor which also sells consumer brands in sugar and sweeteners in Australia, said it did not make a preemptive bid. Exponent, based in London, Danone and Kerry declined to comment. Monde Nissin did not respond to requests for comment. McCain was not immediately available. Quorn is a mycoprotein meat substitute, made by fermenting a type of fungus. It is sold on its own, in ready-meals or in products that replicate burgers, sausages or chicken fillets.The brand capitalises on consumers' growing health consciousness and desire to eat less meat. The deal would be the latest in a string of transactions for foods seen as healthier, such as General Mills' $820 million purchase of organic macaroni-and-cheese maker Annie's, Mondelez International's deal for Enjoy Life Foods, which makes allergy-friendly foods and Hershey Co's buy of Krave Pure Foods, which makes lower-calorie meat jerky.Philippines-based biscuit and noodle maker Monde Nissin, which is planning an IPO as early as 2016, wants to grow outside its traditional businesses. Earlier this year, it bought Australia's Black Swan, a brand of chilled dips, and Nudie, which sells premium juices. Monde has ambitions to do larger deals and emerge as a ""health and wellness company,"" according to one person familiar with the company.Others that have been named as possible suitors for Quorn include Nomad Foods, which recently bought the maker of Birds Eye vegetables, and WhiteWave Foods, which recently announced a deal for a maker of plant-based powdered shakes and snacks.($1 = 0.6587 pounds)   (Additional reporting by Denny Thomas in Hong Kong, Neil Jerome Morales in Manila and Rujun Shen in Singapore; editing by Adrian Croft and David Evans)",2015-09-29,GIS,"Tue Sep 29, 2015 | 12:48pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Quorn fields takeover interest from range of parties -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/quorn-ma-asia-idUSL5N11Z2VB20150929?type=companyNews
45,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Ramkumar Iyer  General Mills Inc is recalling 1.8 million boxes of gluten-free Cheerios cereal because they may contain wheat, which can cause adverse reactions in people with gluten allergies.The company said on Monday it was recalling the original and honey nut flavored varieties of Cheerios produced on certain days at its Lodi, California facility, saying wheat flour may have been accidentally added to its gluten-free oat flour system at the facility.The incident occurred when the facility lost rail service and the company's gluten-free oat flour was being off-loaded from rail cars to trucks for delivery, said Jim Murphy, president of the company's cereal business, in a blog post on General Mills' website. He said it was isolated event and a result of human error.""We sincerely apologize to the gluten-free community and to anyone who may have been impacted,"" Murphy said.Ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye, by individuals with celiac disease causes an autoimmune response that attacks the small intestine, damaging the body's ability to properly absorb nutrients.  General Mills, like others in the industry, has been changing its brands to appeal to consumers who are increasingly seeking less-processed, healthier food. In particular, the cereal business has proven problematic as some U.S. consumers have shifted to other breakfast alternatives. Gluten-free cereal is one way General Mills is trying to bring people back to the category and take market share from competitors. The company is transitioning five varieties of Cheerios to gluten-free and investing significantly in promoting the new products. On its last earnings call in September, the company said that gluten-free Cheerios would be ""one of the largest merchandising events in our cereal business's history."" In a research note, JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman estimated that the recall accounted for 1 percent of annual Cheerios production, an amount he called ""not insignificant.""""We are not sure how costly the recall will be,"" he said.

47,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 20 There are no picky eaters on Thanksgiving - as long as the menu is hormone and antibiotic free, locally grown and convenient.That is the reality for major food producers, including companies reporting earnings next week, as they adapt to a more health-conscious consumer.Tyson Foods and Post Holdings report results Monday, followed Tuesday by Campbell Soup and Hormel Foods. They are beating the S&P 500 by different margins, but that is not the case for all the industry.Spending on food is shifting due to better-informed and increasingly health-conscious consumers. Savvy investors are taking note.""""We are looking at changing consumer patterns with regards to looking at the label,"" billionaire value investor Mario Gabelli told Reuters reporters during the Reuters Global Investment Summit in New York.He mentioned yogurt and probiotics - not exactly Thanksgiving staples, but buzz words among health-minded consumers. Gabelli's investing ideas include General Mills , Paris-based Danone and Tokyo-based Yakult Honsha for their yogurt products, and probiotics maker Chr Hansen, from Denmark.Gabelli is not alone in looking for value in the trend. Earlier this week, Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell singled out yogurt as a key category ""where we added premium and better-for-you brands."" SHIFTING GROUNDS Tyson Foods, likely the provider of many a turkey at the table next week, said in April it plans to end the use of human antibiotics in its chicken by 2017, while Hormel announced in May the acquisition of natural and organic meat processor Applegate Farms.Investors will likely sift through their earnings next week to see how the process of catering to a new type of customer is affecting the business. Hormel's stock, up 31 percent year to date, has gained more than 20 percent since the Applegate announcement. It hit an intraday record high on Friday before closing the day down 1 percent.Tyson shares are up almost 9 percent this year, while the food producers index is up more than 5 percent. The S&P 500 has gained 1.5 percent in 2015 so far.Not all investors, however, are seeing enough of what they are looking for in the food business when it comes to catering to millennials and healthy eaters.""I look at food companies hoping to find the buzzwords I think the millennials are looking for (but) they're not offering fresh, artisanal, that kind of stuff,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said lack of time is key and convenient foods are a fact of life for many people. ""I think some company that cracks that, the prepared foods for the next generation, that would be a real winner.""NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS One of the shifts in consumption is gearing more toward protein, where Tyson and - on a smaller scale - Hormel, dominate.""It is part of the healthier eating, diets are shifting to more protein, less carbohydrates,"" said Timothy Ramey, analyst at Pivotal Research Group in New York.Of course it's not all about the food when it comes to investor interest. If it announces an increase in its dividend for next year, Hormel will join a select club of companies that have upped dividends for 50 straight years.U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and Friday will be a half-session day.

48,"  * For other news from Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, click hereBy Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer AblanNEW YORK Nov 20 American consumers are spending.That's the message of top fund managers and strategists, who say consumer resilience in the face of a slow-growing economy may make the consumer sector a good place to invest in 2016.""The consumer, we continue to spend money, we're happy to spend money, when we're depressed we spend money,"" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research Inc in New York. ""The world is, once again, very dependent on the American consumer.""Participants at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit said falling unemployment, rising wages, low oil prices, cheap imports and relatively low interest rates throughout 2016 will encourage consumers to open their wallets more.A series of high-profile earnings disappointments among retailers, particularly clothing sellers, and U.S. government reports suggesting spending has abated has worried some investors.But participants at the Summit said changing consumer habits are a reason apparel companies have been hit, while other companies have not.""The question for me is simple: Why are people not buying clothes?"" said Mario Gabelli, who oversees $39.6 billion at Gabelli & Co in Rye, New York. ""Is it the weather? Is it tourism? Retailers like O'Reilly are doing fantastic, retailers like Home Depot are doing fantastic.""O'Reilly Automotive Inc, which has more than 4,400 auto parts retailers, is one of Gabelli's picks, even after its share price had more than doubled since the start of 2014.Gabelli said he is also focused on ""changing consumer patterns,"" such as how people now read ingredient labels more carefully. To that end, he owns General Mills Inc, which makes Cheerios cereal but also owns Yoplait yogurt and recently bought Annie's Inc, maker of organic macaroni-and-cheese.MORE SAVING, MORE DOING Summit participants made their assessments as Fed governors suggested in speeches this month that it may finally be time to raise interest rates for the first time since June 2006.In the minutes from its latest meeting, the central bank signaled that a December hike is possible so long as it remained confident the labor market was healthy, wages will increase and inflation can rise toward the Fed's preferred level. Dean Maki, chief economist at billionaire Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut, noted that consumer spending grew in the third quarter at a 3.2 percent rate, dwarfing the rate of inflation.""That's precisely what should happen when gasoline prices fall: headline inflation declines, and real spending grows faster,"" Maki said. ""Consumer spending continues to be the main driver of expansion.""Margie Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management, which invests $348 billion, expects wages in 2016 to rise about 1.5 percentage points faster than inflation.The Boston-based manager said rising wages could prompt consumers to spend more online, helping brick-and-mortar retailers such as home improvement specialist Home Depot Inc  that are ramping up their Internet presence.She was also high on cars. Annual sales from General Motors Co and others are potentially on track to eclipse the approximately 17.35 million units sold in 2000. ""We still have a couple more years left for the auto up cycle,"" Patel said. ""It's one of the best real-time indicators for what is the real health of the consumer.""SENTIMENT RISES The outlook is different for clothing retailers, which have struggled with excess inventory as shoppers hunt for bargains online.Gap Inc, Macy's Inc and Nordstrom Inc  are among retailers known for apparel whose results or outlooks disappointed investors this month.From mid-July to mid-November the Standard & Poor's Select Retail Index fell as much as 18 percent, a much larger drop than for stocks generally.""I don't think that those retailers missing expectations can really blame a weakening consumer, because others are clearly benefiting,"" Maki said.More broadly, summit guests noted that consumer sentiment remains strong, having this year reached its highest since 2004, according to University of Michigan data.""It's rare that you see us entering a recession without consumer confidence rolling over first, and we're not even close to that, so that makes me feel better,"" said Gregory Peters, who helps invest $565 billion as senior investment officer of Prudential Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey.Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits   (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2015-11-20,GIS,"Fri Nov 20, 2015 | 3:58pm EST","REUTERS SUMMIT-Heading into 2016, U.S. consumers look up, dress down",http://www.reuters.com//article/investing-consumers-idUSL1N13E34A20151120?type=companyNews

51,"   By Barbara Lewis and Emma Thomasson | PARIS/BERLIN  PARIS/BERLIN Dec 8 Kellogg, Sony , Coca-Cola Enterprises and a group of other companies have committed to targets certified by independent assessors to cut their carbon emissions, they said on Tuesday.The initiative came as negotiators gathered in Paris try to reach an accord on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and is intended to go beyond the often vague promises of corporate action on the issue.U.N. Global Compact, a voluntary U.N. scheme, and non-governmental organisations including the U.S.-based World Resources Institute (WRI) have been attempting to persuade business to set carbon goals since the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The WRI and its partner organisations said more than 100 companies had committed within the next two years to set targets, assessed on the basis of U.N. standards as a meaningful contribution to warding off a global average temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius, viewed as a threshold for potentially catastrophic climate change.Coca-Cola Enterprises (the European bottling partner of Coca-Cola Co ), Dell, Enel, General Mills , Kellogg, NRG Energy, Procter & Gamble, Sony and Thalys have already had goals approved equating to nearly 2 billion barrels of oil not burned over the lifetime of their targets. Kellogg, which like other food companies is sensitive to extreme weather that inflates the cost of ingredients and makes them scarce, committed to a 15 percent reduction in emissions intensity per tonne of food produced by 2020 versus 2015, the joint statement said. ""It's a core business issue in terms of, can we have enough access to foods over time?"" Diana Holdorf, chief sustainability officer at Kellogg, said in Paris. ""Security of supply is critical to our business.""Other corporate climate commitments linked to the Paris conference included Unilever, Nestle, Procter & Gamble and others saying last month they had signed up to emissions targets.(Editing by David Holmes)",2015-12-08,GIS,"Tue Dec 8, 2015 | 5:15am EST","Kellogg, Sony and others sign up to emissions goals",http://www.reuters.com//article/climatechange-summit-companies-idUSL8N13S53Q20151208?type=companyNews
52,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK General Mills Inc said on Tuesday that it had reduced sodium by at least 20 percent in seven product categories, fewer than it had targeted, as part of the food industry's effort to cut back on an ingredient said to increase the risk of serious illnesses. The maker of brands like Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt said in 2010 that it was targeting a 20 percent reduction in 10 product categories by 2015. The results would be compared with a 2008 baseline.The company has reached its goal in all but three categories. It cut sodium by 18 percent in cereal and by 19 percent in both its Progresso ready-to-serve soups and Old El Paso Mexican dinners.The biggest reductions came in savory snacks at 35 percent and frozen pizza at 29 percent.  According to the American Heart Association, excess sodium consumption can increase risk of stroke, heart disease and other health problems. In 2010, the National Academies’ Institute of Medicine issued a report outlining ways to reduce intake and recommended that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set mandatory national standards to lower content in foods gradually. The FDA has yet to issue benchmarks, but companies ranging from Kraft Heinz Co, formerly Kraft Foods, to Wal-Mart Stores Inc have announced voluntary plans to reduce sodium in products they sell.  General Mills called its results a success and noted that 20 percent was an ambitious target. Some product reformulations took months or even years, said Chief Health and Wellness Officer Maha Tahiri.""It's very significant for a nutrient like sodium because it really defines a lot of the taste,"" Tahiri said in an interview. ""We did it in a very, very mindful way.""  But some health advocates said the industry had not done enough to reduce public consumption. ""Clearly, some companies have been making significant progress, but it's nowhere near enough to protect the public's health,"" said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Washington non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest.

53,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Dec 15 General Mills Inc said on Tuesday that it had reduced sodium by at least 20 percent in seven product categories, fewer than it had targeted, as part of the food industry's effort to cut back on an ingredient said to increase the risk of serious illnesses.The maker of brands like Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt said in 2010 that it was targeting a 20 percent reduction in 10 product categories by 2015. The results would be compared with a 2008 baseline.The company has reached its goal in all but three categories. It cut sodium by 18 percent in cereal and by 19 percent in both its Progresso ready-to-serve soups and Old El Paso Mexican dinners. The biggest reductions came in savory snacks at 35 percent and frozen pizza at 29 percent.According to the American Heart Association, excess sodium consumption can increase risk of stroke, heart disease and other health problems. In 2010, the National Academies' Institute of Medicine issued a report outlining ways to reduce intake and recommended that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set mandatory national standards to lower content in foods gradually. The FDA has yet to issue benchmarks, but companies ranging from Kraft Heinz Co, formerly Kraft Foods, to Wal-Mart Stores Inc have announced voluntary plans to reduce sodium in products they sell.General Mills called its results a success and noted that 20 percent was an ambitious target. Some product reformulations took months or even years, said Chief Health and Wellness Officer Maha Tahiri. ""It's very significant for a nutrient like sodium because it really defines a lot of the taste,"" Tahiri said in an interview. ""We did it in a very, very mindful way.""But some health advocates said the industry had not done enough to reduce public consumption. ""Clearly, some companies have been making significant progress, but it's nowhere near enough to protect the public's health,"" said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Washington non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest.He said that while there had been modest reductions of sodium in some products over the past decade, others had been reformulated to contain even more.

58,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to  General Mills, Inc.'s (General Mills), issuance of EUR500MM senior unsecured  notes due January 2020. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  The company plans to refinance upcoming maturities with the proceeds. The  company has a $250 million floating rate note (FRN), a $500 million FRN and a  $250 million .875% note, all of which are due between Jan. 28 and 29 2016. This  represents $1 billion of the $1.1 billion due this year. The notes rank pari  passu with General Mills' other senior unsecured debt and contain a Change of  Control provision at 101. The notes are issued under the company's indenture  dated Feb. 1, 1996.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage Returns to Mid-2x, Expectations Met Early: The company's leverage had  temporarily increased to over 3.2x with the Annie's acquisition in 2014. As  expected, General Mills has been focused on deleveraging and cash on hand and  proceeds from the Green Giant brand sales were used to reduce debt balances with  leverage returning to 2.6x at Nov. 29, 2015. Leverage is expected to remain  stable in the mid-2x times range in 2016. Strong Margins, Brands: General Mills's ratings incorporate the company's strong  profitability, substantial internally generated liquidity, and leading market  positions in key categories. Fitch considers General Mills to have one of the  best product portfolios in the industry, with strong brand equities and  marketing expertise in large categories that span a variety of meals and snacks.  The company maintains significant brand equity in major product categories  including cereal, yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, and snacks. Fitch expects organic  top line growth of 1% annually. The company's 20% EBITDA margin is generally  among the sector's top tier and Fitch expects modest improvement given current  restructuring initiatives. Credit strengths are balanced with General Mills'  high priority for returning cash to shareholders. FCF Improved: After averaging approximately $850 million during the past five  years, the current run rate is a much improved $985 million. Fitch expects FCF  to be $900 million to $1 billion annually going forward.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS ASSUMPTIONS:  --Low single-digit organic sales growth for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017;  --FCF is expected to be $900 million to $1 billion annually in fiscal 2016 and  fiscal 2017;  --Fitch expects leverage will remain in the mid 2x range.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --A negative rating action could occur if operating earnings remain under  pressure and debt reduction does not occur, resulting in a sustained period of  leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) greater than approximately 3x and  weakening FCF.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  A ratings upgrade is unlikely in the near- to intermediate-term but could occur  in the long term if the company commits to maintain leverage in the low 2x range  while generating FCF at historical average annual levels or higher. A commitment  to refrain from large debt-financed share repurchases or acquisitions would also  support an upgrade.  LIQUIDITY Ample Liquidity: The company maintains $2.7 billion of undrawn committed credit  facilities that support its CP program, consisting of a $1 billion facility  expiring in May 2019 and a $1.7 billion facility expiring in April 2017. In  addition, Yoplait SAS has a EUR200 million revolver due in June 2019 that  General Mills consolidates. General Mills had $2.8 billion available on its  total of $2.9 billion committed facilities as of the most recent quarter end.  The remaining $100 million is under the Yoplait facility. Debt maturities are high in calendar 2016 with $1.1 billion due, all except $100  million in at the end of January 2016 and $1.5 billion in calendar 2017. Fitch  expects that General Mills will refinance much of its near-term maturities and  today's action is in accordance with our expectations.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates General Mills and its subsidiaries as follows:  General Mills, Inc.  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB+';  --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB+';  --Senior unsecured credit facilities 'BBB+';  --Short-term IDR 'F2';  --CP 'F2'.  General Mills Cereals LLC  --Long-term IDR 'BBB+';  --Class A limited membership interests 'BBB+'.  Yoplait S.A.S.  --Long-term IDR 'BBB+';  --Credit facility 'BBB+'  --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB+'.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) WEEK AHEAD  Markets lean into next week adjusting positions for the Federal Reserve, with the dollar experiencing more weakness due to rising inflation indicators and a more dovish outlook from the U.S. central bank. Stocks are expected to extend gains as credit conditions improve and overall economic figures support markets. That may drive a bit of a rally in bonds too, given the central bank's support for loose policy - but that can only go so far, given the expectation for higher rates before long.  Next week, investors will mostly work through housing figures that include home price index on Tuesday, revised building permit numbers on Thursday and new home sales data on Wednesday. New U.S. single-family home sales are expected to have increased 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 510,000 units in February from January, when sales dropped 9.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 494,000 units. Separately, the orders for durable goods, due to be released on Thursday, is likely to have dropped 2.8 percent in February from January. Financial data firm Markit is expected to show a little gain in its preliminary Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index on the same day.

Investors will look for comments on the performance of its various footwear lines, trends influencing the direct-to-consumer channel and updates to the forecast.  On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans, one of the Fed's most dovish policymakers, will give his take on the appropriate path for monetary policy and the risks to the U.S. economic outlook in his first public appearance after the Fed's March policy-setting meeting.

Investors will look for an update on 2016 forecast and comments on demand trends for the rest of the year.The main event in Canada next week will be the release of the federal government's budget on Tuesday. Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present his first budget and he is set to unveil a deficit of up to C$30 billion ($23.08 billion) - three times the amount the ruling Liberal party promised to run - in the 2016/17 fiscal year. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Ottawa needs to invest heavily in infrastructure now to help boost a sluggish economy. Opposition parties say he risks returning Canada to an era of persistent massive deficits.  Canadian gold miner Eldorado Gold Corp is expected to report a fall in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, hurt by a slump in gold prices.

Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart speaks on the economic outlook and monetary policy before the Rotary Club of Savannah. After the Fed's policy meeting this week, Lockhart will be among the first policymakers to elaborate on the central bank's latest statement. No rate hike is expected. But the statement will set the tone for rate hikes to come, and give some sense of when rates will next rise. Important to that evaluation is how members like Lockhart see the path of inflation, now that prices have given some sense of increase and expectations have also risen. (1240/1640) Separately, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker speaks on ""The Outlook for Inflation and Inflation Expectations"" before the Global Interdependence Center Conference: ""Inflation Expectations, Implications & Policy Response in a New Paradigm for Commodities"" in Paris, France.

63,"   By Lisa Baertlein | March 18  March 18 General Mills Inc on Friday said it would begin putting labels on its products that contain genetically engineered ingredients, a move that comes days after U.S. Senators failed to advance legislation aimed at blocking Vermont from requiring such labels on July 1.U.S. consumer are calling for greater transparency around food production and sourcing, and many want mandatory labels on foods that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The decision from the seller of Cheerios cereal and Nature Valley Granola bars comes after high-profile companies such as Whole Foods Market Inc, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  and Campbell Soup Co have bowed to consumer pressure by requiring GMO labels or abandoning the use of GMOs.""Vermont state law requires us to start labeling certain grocery store food packages that contain GMO ingredients or face significant fines,"" General Mills said on its company blog. ""We can't label our products for only one state without significantly driving up costs for our consumers and we simply will not do that,"" the company added. The food industry has spent millions of dollars fighting mandatory GMO labeling efforts on the state and federal level. On Wednesday, a federal bill that would have nullified mandatory state and local GMO labeling laws failed to garner enough support to move forward.That bill also would allow food makers to decide whether to tell consumers about GMO ingredients in their products.

90,"   By Simon Jessop | LONDON  LONDON A group of 40 investors managing $1.25 trillion in assets have launched a campaign to encourage 16 global food companies to change the way they source protein for their products to help to reduce environmental and health risks.The investors, which include the fund arm of insurer Aviva and several Swedish state pension funds, wrote to the food companies on Sept. 23 urging them to respond to the ""material"" risks of industrial farming and to diversify into plant-based sources of protein.Among the companies targeted were Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Walmart, a statement by the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative, which organized the investor group, said on Monday. ""The world's over reliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis,"" said Jeremy Coller, founder of the FAIRR initiative and chief investment officer at private equity company Coller Capital.Pollution from intensive livestock production is already at too high a level, while safety and welfare standards are too low and the industry cannot cope with the projected increase in global protein demand, Coller said.""Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4 percent annually over the next five years,"" Coller said. The campaign follows an Oxford University study which said $1.5 trillion in healthcare and climate change-related costs could be saved by 2050 if people reduced their reliance on meat in their diet.The study also pointed to growing political pressure on companies to change, citing a consultation in Denmark on the introduction of a red meat tax and a Chinese government plan to reduce its citizens' meat consumption by 50 percent, FAIRR said.Ella McKinley, ethics analyst at Australian Ethical Investment, which is taking part in the campaign, said the need to change food production models was essential to help to limit climate change.""Forward-looking companies can move now to encourage more sustainable diets by reducing reliance on meat and growing the market for plant-based protein alternatives. In the process, companies make their own protein supply chains more resilient to future shocks,"" she said. The other companies written to by FAIRR were General Mills, Mondelez International, Ahold-Delhaize, The Co-operative Group, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Kroger Company, Marks & Spencer, Wm Morrison Supermarkets, Ocado, Sainsbury's and Whole Foods Market.A Nestle spokeswoman said the company did not use much meat, ""so our main strategy is not to focus on replacing the meat that we do use as its impact would be minimal. Our main opportunities lie in innovating new products using alternate proteins"".""In terms of timetables and targets, this is still a relatively new area, where in many countries the consumers are not fully prepared to replace or reduce meat in their diets. Our focus is to innovate great tasting solutions to encourage consumers to try them and over time make small, sustainable shifts towards a higher plant-based, more balanced diet."" Kraft Heinz declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The Co-Op said it had yet to receive the letter. Mondelez also declined to comment because it had not yet seen the letter, while a Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: ""We're aware of the issue and are looking forward to receiving a copy of the letter.""A Walmart spokesman said the company was not familiar with the campaign and so could not provide comment, while a Kroger spokesman said the firm had not received the letter but was happy to talk with the investor group.The remaining companies were not immediately available to comment.Among the other investors to join the campaign were Nordea Asset Management, the fund arm of Norwegian lender Nordea, Boston Common Asset Management, and Impax Asset Management, as well as a number of charities and other ethical investors.

It also raised prices on products such as Banquet frozen entrees. These actions, along with lower commodity costs, drove margins, which rose 2 percentage points to 27.3 percent in the first quarter.""Locking a brand into a $1 price point for decades it's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and food quality ... So the change was long overdue,"" a company executive said on a post-earnings call. Operating margins rose 5 percentage points to 18.4 percent as the company kept a tight lid on costs.Like rivals Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) and General Mills Inc (GIS.N), ConAgra is struggling to increase sales and profit margins as consumers move away from packaged foods that are highly processed.Earlier this week, ConAgra said it would buy Frontera Foods, celebrity chef Rick Bayless' Mexican food company, as it looks to add more premium brands to its portfolio. The company is also in the middle of divesting its $3 billion Lamb Weston potato business and sold its spicing and flavoring business for more than $300 million earlier this year.The Lamb Weston business reported a 4 percent rise in net sales in the quarter ended Aug. 28.Net income attributable to the company was $186.2 million, or 42 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.15 billion, or $2.68 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The company booked a $1.32 billion loss from discontinued operations in the year-earlier period after selling its loss-making private-brands business to TreeHouse Foods Inc (THS.N).Excluding one-time charges and discontinued operations, ConAgra earned 61 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 48 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales, however, fell 4.6 percent to $2.67 billion, missing analysts' estimate of $2.73 billion, hurt by lower demand for its grocery, snacks and frozen food items.

96,"  General Mills Inc (GIS.N), the maker of Cheerios cereal, said it would cut as many as 600 jobs globally as part of a new organizational structure and eliminate the position of international chief operating officer.As part of the new organizational structure, the company will be split into four business groups - North America retail, Europe & Australia, Asia & Latin America and convenience stores & foodservice.The company said its French dairy unit, which makes Yoplait yoghurt and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, would work independently with each of the four business groups.Minneapolis-based General Mills has been struggling to boost sales as customers increasingly shift to less-processed and sugary foods.
