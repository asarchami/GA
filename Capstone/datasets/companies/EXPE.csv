9,"  (Adds comment from Expedia)MILAN May 20 Italy's competition watchdog is looking into TripAdvisor to see if the influential holiday review website takes appropriate measures to avoid publishing fake opinions.The antitrust authority has also opened an investigation into online booking websites Expedia and Booking.com , saying their agreements with hotels may prevent consumers from getting a better deal.In a statement on Tuesday, the watchdog said it had received complaints about TripAdvisor from consumers as well as hotel and restaurant owners.TripAdvisor is a travel website that gathers readers' reviews of hotels and restaurants. The authority said in a separate document on its website that TripAdvisor may have published opinions of people who had not actually been to the places they rated.It also said TripAdvisor did not make clear enough the distinction between information provided independently by travellers and business profiles that hotels and restaurants pay to get published on the website. A TripAdvisor spokesman said the company took a tough stance on fraud and had confidence in its systems and procedures. Every review goes through a tracking system that uses complex algorithms to spot patterns of activity, he added.Then there is ""a team of over 200 content specialists, who manually investigate every review flagged for inspection by our systems"", the spokesman said.""We also have strong penalties in place to deter fraudsters and the very nature of our site allows for any inaccuracies to be quickly rectified."" The Italian watchdog gave details of its investigation into Expedia and Booking.com in a statement on Monday.""The analysis centres on clauses applied by Booking and Expedia that prevent hotels from offering better prices and conditions through other online services and, generally, any other booking system (including hotels' own websites),"" it said. ""The authority believes the use of such clauses by the main two platforms on the market may significantly limit competition.""A spokeswoman for Expedia said on Wednesday the company had been contacted by Italy's competition watchdog about so-called ""most favoured nation"" clauses in its agreements with Italian hotels, and would co-operate with the inquiry.""Expedia is convinced it is acting in full compliance with all applicable laws, offering value to both consumers and ... more than 290,000 accommodation partners,"" she said.The watchdog said it would conclude the investigation by August 2015.The Priceline Group, which owns Booking.com, had no  comment.

10,"  (Corrects Yelp ticker symbol in paragraph 9)* Looks to expand services in restaurant bookings* Priceline's offer of $103/shr a 46 pct premium* OpenTable shares inch past offer price* Deal expected to close in Q3By Rohit T. K. and Sagarika JaisinghaniJune 13 Travel website owner Priceline Group Inc  will buy restaurant reservation website operator OpenTable Inc for $2.6 billion, aiming to broaden its services outside the increasingly competitive online travel industry.Priceline's offer of $103 per share for the owner of OpenTable.com represents a premium of 46 percent to OpenTable's Thursday close.OpenTable's shares inched past the offer price to trade as high as $104.19 on the Nasdaq, suggesting that some investors expect a higher bid. Priceline's shares were down 1.6 percent at $1,205.50.Priceline, whose competitors include Expedia Inc  and Orbitz Worldwide Inc, has a record of buying smaller companies and transforming them into large, successful businesses.With little room to expand, online travel companies are looking outside the industry to boost revenue and drive more customers to their websites by offering more of a one-stop shop for travelers by offering services at their destination.TripAdvisor Inc, for example, bought French online restaurant booking platform Lafourchette last month to enter the restaurant-booking industry. Friday's deal gives the travel site operator access to OpenTable's agreements with over 23,000 U.S. restaurants.OpenTable has been trying to expand its international business as it faces increased competition from Yelp Inc  and a slew of startups focused on local services.""Priceline could further strengthen OpenTable's business, especially in Europe, where Priceline is the market leader, as a result of its significant online user traffic and its organizational infrastructure,"" Citi Investment Research analyst Mark May wrote in a research note.Priceline bought Kayak.com last year and has built it into one of the biggest travel websites outside the United States. It has also ramped up U.S. advertising for Booking.com, which it bought in 2005, giving stiff competition to Expedia. As of Thursday, OpenTable's shares were trading at about 33.5 times 12-month estimated forward earnings, far below the 498.7 times of Yelp, its closest competitor, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.""I think (the takeover) creates urgency for larger players to acquire the leading local platforms,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst James Cakmak told Reuters, mentioning Yahoo Inc , Google Inc and Microsoft Corp as potential buyers in the sector.OpenTable posted its first quarterly loss in five years for the period ended March 31 as it spent more on marketing to stem the slowdown in the number of restaurants signing up for its services.The number of North American restaurants using OpenTable's platform rose 19 percent, but growth was slower than in the previous two quarters.OpenTable, which gets $1.00 from a restaurant if a diner reserves a table through its website or app, will continue to operate as an independent business led by its current management, Priceline said.Yelp's shares were up 13 percent at $74.65 in midday trading, having fallen 5 percent this year to Thursday's close.Priceline reported a 36 percent rise in second-quarter profit as hotel and car booking rose.The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.

11,"  (Corrects in fourth paragraph to show complaint against Expedia is ongoing)PARIS May 27 French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg filed a legal complaint against U.S.-owned hotel reservation web site Booking.com on Tuesday over what he said were anti-competitive business practices in its dealings with hotels.Montebourg, who has frequently clashed with foreign companies operating in France, said in a statement he had filed the suit against Booking.com after anti-fraud officials uncovered what they said were unfair clauses in the firm's contracts with hoteliers.The complaint against Booking.com, owned by U.S.-based Priceline.com, alleges that its contracts unfairly bar hotels from offering their customers any room price lower than those displayed on the web site. It follows a similar complaint filed by a hoteliers' union against U.S.-based reservation site Expedia in 2013, which is ongoing. ""This approach underscores the French government's desire and ability to ensure that national rules are respected by companies operating in the digital sector,"" the statement from Montebourg's office said, adding that Booking.com executives had been summoned to appear before a Paris commercial court.Booking.com's practices were damaging for competition in the service sector, as hotels were unable to circumvent the site and its commissions by offering special prices to customers who contacted them directly, it said. Booking.com and Priceline.com representatives did not immediately return phone calls seeking their response to the French complaint.The outspoken minister last month signed a decree that broadens the state's power to block foreign takeovers in strategic industries, in keeping with his policy of intervening in business affairs to protect French firms.

17,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK, July 29  NEW YORK, July 29 With some of Wall Street's more volatile names set to report in the next couple of days, traders who bet on big swings in shares are hoping to see moves more like Facebook than Netflix.Netflix, along with Gilead Sciences and several other stocks famous for their sharp gyrations, were unusually calm following their latest quarterly reports. However, Amazon.com and Facebook have had big days after their reports, heightening expectations for upcoming releases from Tesla Motors Inc and Expedia Inc.For volatility investors, the direction of the move is not important, just the magnitude. Traders use an option strategy known as a straddle - buying a bullish call option and a bearish put option at the same strike price - in a bet that a stock will move by a certain amount. Even if a stock rises, the trader can lose money if it moves less than implied by the combined cost of the put and call options.On average, the realized stock change on earnings is about 1.5 percent lower than expected, according to derivatives strategists at Credit Suisse in New York.""Many of the companies that are typically volatile have had in-line numbers, which wouldn't result in a materially volatile stocks afterwards,"" said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners in Palm Beach, Florida.Expedia and Tesla are both due to report results on Thursday. Over the past eight quarters, both have averaged a move of about 15 percent following results, according to Thomson Reuters data. Based on where they traded on Monday, investors expect a move of 9.4 percent for Expedia and 7.8 percent for Tesla. Investors trading options in 3D Systems Corp, scheduled to report on Wednesday, are looking for an 11 percent move in shares, compared with the eight-quarter median of 6 percent, according to Goldman Sachs.VOLATILITY SUCCESSES Recent days have seen more volatility among individual names. Amazon.com Inc on Friday tumbled almost 10 percent following results, while both Facebook Inc and Chipotle Mexican Grill soared to records. Amazon lost more than $34 on the day after reporting results. The options market had priced in a $22 move. Facebook shares rose as much as $5.45, beyond the $4.92 move estimated by the options market, said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.Still, moves like these have been the exception this season, in an environment where the CBOE Volatility index is less than 13, well below its historical average of 20. Netflix Inc  fell 5 percent in the week after its results, less than a third of its nearly 19 percent average move over the past eight quarters.""One might expect a little more volatility to the downside, which we haven't seen,"" said Peter Cecchini, managing director and chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. ""We could be in a calm before the storm, there's a lot of complacency."" Google Inc rose 2.5 percent in the week after its results, less than half the 5.5 percent average over the past eight quarters. F5 Networks Inc rose 1.7 percent, below its 7.85 percent average. Gilead Sciences averaged a one-day move of 2.85 percent in the last six quarters; this time out, it gained just 1.1 percent.Apple Inc rose 4.8 percent in the seven sessions following earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data, below the 6.4 percent average over the past eight quarters.""Last quarter the people who played an Apple straddle really got rewarded,"" said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. Apple gained 11.4 percent in the week after results.""This time they bid it up too much, and those people got beat up.""Sarhan said that selling volatility in high-growth names can still be dangerous, even in a quiet market.""You're going into a situation where you know these names have had big moves in the past,"" he said.

21,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) for Expedia, Inc. (Expedia) at 'BBB-', affirmed the senior unsecured debt  rating at 'BBB-', and assigned a 'BBB-' rating to the new senior unsecured  notes.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. In July 2014, Expedia entered into an agreement to acquire Wotif.com Holdings  Limited for a USD equivalent of $658 million.  Wotif is a leading online travel  agent (OTA) in Australia and operates in the APAC region. Through the  transaction, Expedia gains market share and local inventory while Wotif benefits  from Expedia's technological expertise.  Proceeds from the new notes are  expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including funding the  acquisition of Wotif.  The company has historically issued debt to fund share  repurchases or around the time of acquisitions.  Fitch calculates unadjusted leverage of 1.3x at June 30, 2014, and pro forma for  the new notes, high 1.0x to low 2.0x. Fitch expects leverage to decline on  absolute EBITDA growth.  There is room at the current rating level for leverage  to spike above 2.0x due to strategic acquisitions, so long as Fitch views the  transaction as favorable and is comfortable that leverage will be reduced within  a 12-18 month period.  Fitch forecasts leverage to be around 2.0x or below at  the end of FY2015. As the competitive and technological landscape continues to change, traditional  OTAs will vie to increase their global share and maintain their relevance in the  face of other travel providers moving down the purchase funnel (i.e.  TripAdvisor's instant book).  Fitch expects Expedia to continue growing  organically and by acquisition, possibly operating closer to the 2.0x leverage  range than it has in the last few years. KEY RATING DRIVERS Expedia's ratings reflect its solid credit profile and reasonably conservative  balance sheet offset by event risk concerns. The company has significant  exposure to economic cyclicality through its impact on travel demand which is  countered by strong secular growth trends as an increasing mix of travel  reservations are made through OTAs. Expedia's leading market position as an OTA  is a significant credit strength enhanced by its solid geographic and customer  diversification. Event risk concerns are material and reflect Liberty  Interactive's (Liberty) controlling stake in the company (although its shares  are voted by Expedia Chairman, Barry Diller). In March 2012, Liberty affected a sale of 12 million shares, approximately 35%  of its total economic interest in the company although it retains control of 56%  of the voting shares. In the event that Expedia did pursue a debt-financed  repurchase of the remaining Liberty stake, it would be difficult for the company  to retain its investment-grade rating and/or a Stable Outlook, given limited  headroom in the rating today. Fitch expects the company to delever over the next  one to two years, creating additional headroom, increasing its ability to retain  its rating and Outlook in the event of a debt-financed repurchase of  Liberty-owned shares. Fitch continues to believe that Expedia's credit profile is weaker following the  2011 spin-off of TripAdvisor which provided Expedia significant revenue  diversification and could potentially evolve into a more direct competitive  channel for hotel bookings.  There is execution risk at Expedia as TripAdvisor's  business evolves considering its significance as Expedia's largest marketing  partner. However, Expedia's 2013 acquisition of trivago, and its subsequent  growth, acts to considerably offset the loss of revenue diversification from the  TripAdvisor spin.  In the LTM period ended June 2014, revenues from Ad and Media  grew to $415 million; prior to the TripAdvisor spin revenue was $476 million  (LTM ended June 2011). Fitch expects that Expedia will remain a moderately leveraged credit while the  competitive landscape and changing technology trends of the OTA market remain in  flux. TripAdvisor's new mobile Instant Booking feature blurs the line between  the metasearch function and the OTAs.  Expedia and Priceline have not partnered  with TripAdvisor on this new feature; Fitch believes that is due to the risk of  commoditization of the OTA function as merely a back-end transaction processor  in the minds of consumers. Google's intent in the travel market and the ability  and willingness of hotels to compete for direct bookings are both considerable  long-term threats. Fitch views Expedia, as one of the largest OTAs in the world  with a meaningful secular tailwind and significant financial flexibility, as  having the capacity to manage these potential challenges over the foreseeable  future.  The company's strategic decision to broadly offer consumers the choice to pay  upfront for hotels under a merchant model or pay at the time of a stay under an  agency model has only modestly impacted cash flow, as Expedia has maintained a  controlled roll-out of this new feature. Fitch expects it will increase  Expedia's traction with both consumers and new hotel acquisitions at a  manageable expense-to-cash flow during what will likely be a multi-year  transition. As of June 2014, over 59,000 of Expedia's 325,000-plus hotel  partners have chosen to give consumers this option as part of the Expedia  Traveler Preference (ETP) program. Expedia's recent results highlight the secular tailwinds in the OTA environment.  For the second quarter 2014 (2Q'14; end June 2014), revenue increased 24% over  the prior year period. Revenue growth has accelerated on the back of strong  hotel signings on the ETP platform. More significantly, 2Q'14 EBITDA margins  strengthened from strong revenue growth and leveraging of fixed costs.  Expedia  plans on investing more in sales and marketing and salesforce to drive  acceleration of hotel acquisitions in 2H'14.  However, EBITDA margins have been  trending lower on a longer term basis.  EBITDA margin for the LTM period ended  June 2014 was 18.1%, down from 20.5% in FY2011, reflecting competitive pressures  and shifts in the market.  Other factors which impacted margins include  Expedia's shift to an ETP platform for hotels; the agency model is lower margin.  Expedia's Hotwire business continues to underperform, the result of both  competition (e.g. Priceline's Express Deals) and tight hotel inventories. In  fact, tight hotel inventories generally compress margins across all of Expedia's  platforms. Fitch believes these challenges reflect the potential execution risks inherent  in the business as technology and consumer preference shifts the OTA landscape.  Expedia spun off TripAdvisor in 2011 which Fitch believes may eventually result  in TripAdvisor evolving into more of a direct competitive threat. Separately,  Expedia acquired Trivago in early 2013 for its hotel metasearch capabilities,  which Fitch views as a response to competition from the likes of Kayak. Expedia  remains one of the largest OTAs in the market but as the industry churns through  what is a new wave of technology evolution, these risks will add volatility to  results and could ultimately alter its standing in the marketplace. To date,  management has been reasonably proactive in positioning the company for the  future while also maintaining solid credit metrics. Credit strengths include: -- Expedia is the largest OTA with advantages in scale that have contributed to  the company gaining significant share in the market for travel services over the  past several years;  -- Broad customer and geographic diversification positively impact the stability  of end-market demand for travel services which are inherently highly correlated  to the macro-economic environment; -- Expedia benefits from the expected continuation of a secular shift toward use  of OTAs which should support revenue growth in excess of both overall travel  services and GDP growth; -- A relatively high-variable-cost model limits potential negative pressure on  profitability during business downturns, although much of the variable cost  items are specific to marketing expense which, if reduced, could have a negative  effect on the company's competitive position.  Ratings concerns include: -- Increasing competition from other on-line travel businesses including Google  as well as the potential for non-OTAs such as TripAdvisor to become significant  competitors in the future; -- Expedia faces a potentially significant contingent liability due to lawsuits  related to hotel occupancy taxes. The company could also face negative pressure  on profitability if municipal tax rules are amended to apply specifically to the  retail rate charged by Expedia; -- Ongoing pricing pressure in the OTA market combined with increasing  competition with direct sales channels could negatively affect future revenue  growth and profitability;  -- Inherent volatility in travel service demands from macroeconomic drivers as  well as the potential for significant volatility due to travel demand shocks; -- Liberty Interactive holds shares representing approximately 56% of the voting  power in Expedia. While Liberty has given Expedia's Chairman of the Board Barry  Diller a proxy to vote these shares, Fitch's ratings take into account Liberty's  historical track record of shareholder-friendly actions; -- In a slower growth or negative revenue environment, the working capital  deficit of $3.8 billion at June 2014 is expected to be a use of cash; -- Expedia competes directly with the online presence of its suppliers in the  travel services industry, which could lead to future disruptions in the  company's business model. Fitch believes, however, that OTAs represent a valued  source of market information to, as well as being a marketing arm of, travel  service providers. Liquidity as of June 30, 2014 was solid with $1.4 billion in cash and an undrawn  $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in November  2017. Free cash flow has averaged near $600 million annually for the past five  years, which Fitch expects to remain similarly strong in 2014 and 2015. Expedia  has a working capital deficit of $3.8 billion which peaks seasonally in the June  quarter and should decline through the end of the year by utilizing  approximately $600 million to $800 million of the company's existing cash  balance. Expedia does have $2.4 billion in total cash and short-term investments  to partially offset the working capital deficit. Total debt as of June 30, 2014 was $1.2 billion and consisted of $500 million in  7.456% senior unsecured notes due August 2018 and $750 million in 5.95% senior  unsecured notes due August 2020.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: --Fitch believes there are minimal business considerations to support the  company maintaining a rating above 'BBB-' which will likely forestall positive  rating action for the foreseeable future. However, a more conservative financial  profile coupled with increased revenue diversification from the growth of the  Egencia segment and Ad and Media revenues could have positive implications for  the rating.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: -- An increase in expected volatility in profitability, potentially due to  greater volatility in travel services demand or a higher fixed-cost component to  Expedia's financial model;  -- A secular decline in the OTA business model, potentially resulting from a  shift in the competitive landscape;  -- A substantial financial loss from any future conclusion of the occupancy tax  lawsuits facing the company; -- A more aggressive financial policy, reflected through material debt-funded  acquisition, share repurchase (including buyback of Liberty-owned shares), or  dividends, that drive leverage sustainably above 2.0x. Fitch has taken the following rating actions for Expedia: --IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured bank credit facility affirmed at 'BBB-'; --$500 million in 7.456% senior unsecured notes due August 2018 affirmed at  'BBB-'; --$750 million in 5.95% senior unsecured notes due August 2020 affirmed at  'BBB-'; --New senior unsecured notes rated 'BBB-'.

22,"   By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Michael Connor | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Bitcoin is catching on at U.S. online merchants including Overstock.com and Expedia, as customers use a digital currency that just a few years ago was virtually unknown but is now showing some staying power.    Though sales paid for in bitcoin so far at vendors interviewed for this article have been a fraction of one percent, they expect that as acceptance grows, the online currency will one day be as ubiquitous as the internet.     ""Bitcoin isn't going anywhere; it's here to stay,"" said Michael Gulmann, vice president of global products at Expedia Inc. in Seattle, the largest online travel agent. ""We want to be there from the beginning."" Expedia started accepting bitcoin payments for hotel bookings on July 11.    Until recently a niche alternative currency touted by a fervent group of followers, bitcoin has evolved into a software-based payment online system. Bitcoins are stored in a wallet with a unique identification number and companies like Coinbase and Blockchain can hold the currency for the user.    When buying an item from a merchant's website, a customer simply clicks on the bitcoin option and a pop-in window appears where he can type in his wallet ID number. Still, broad-based adoption of bitcoin is at least five years away because most consumers still prefer to use credit cards, analysts said.    ""Bitcoin is a new way of making payments, but it's not solving a problem that's broken,"" said George Peabody, payments consultant at Glenbrook Partners in Menlo Park, California. ""Retail payments aren't broken.""    There are also worries about bitcoin's volatility: its price in U.S. dollars changes every day. On Wednesday, bitcoin was up 0.4 percent at $514.09.    That risk is borne by the consumer and the bitcoin payment processor, such as Coinbase or Bitpay, not the retailer. The vendor doesn't hold the bitcoin and is paid in U.S. dollars. As soon as a customer pays in bitcoin, the digital currency goes to the payment processor and the processor immediately pays the merchant, for a fee of less than 1 percent.    ""We don't have to deal with the actual holding of the bitcoin: it's the payment processor that takes the currency risk for us,"" said Bernie Han, chief operating officer at Dish Network Corp, in Englewood, Colorado. ""That's what makes it appealing for us and I guess for other merchants as well.""Dish, with about $14 billion in annual revenue, started accepting bitcoins in mid-August.    Payment processors do some form of hedging though, said Gil Luria, a financial technology analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. These entities would, for instance, sell bitcoins in the market to offset the ones they have processed and in their books, so they're not left with much exposure, Luria said.     The only risk for the retailer is if the counterparty, or payment processor, doesn't fulfill its obligation. That risk is minimal, Luria said,    ""Coinbase and Bitpay are now well-funded start-ups and they have put a lot of resources behind security,"" Luria said. ""You can consider them as secure counterparties, as opposed to a year ago, when they were very small.""    ADDING TO EARNINGS     For some, it has become a beneficial situation for retailers, as they take advantage of lower transaction fees and sales from new customers. In at least one instance, bitcoin sales are expected to pad a company's bottom line, adding 4 cents a share to 2014 earnings at Salt Lake City-based online merchant Overstock.com, said chief executive officer Patrick Byrne.    Overstock was the first U.S. company with annual sales of at least $1 billion to accept bitcoins. Soon after, other companies including computer maker Dell Inc, Dish, and Newegg Inc, an online retailer of computer hardware and software, began to accept payments in bitcoin.     To date, there are about 63,000 merchants globally accepting bitcoin, estimates from data provider CoinDesk show. It forecasts that figure to rise to 100,000 by year-end.    Overstock's Byrne estimated bitcoin sales of between $6 million and $8 million by the end of 2014, a fraction of the company's total revenue.More importantly for Byrne, the bulk of bitcoin sales comes from new customers, who would otherwise not shop at Overstock if the website didn't offer bitcoin payments. Bitcoin owners tend to be high net-worth individuals and tech-savvy consumers.     In a way, bitcoin has been used by retailers as a marketing strategy to bring some much-needed buzz to brands that may be struggling.     ""Every retailer knows that if they make some sort of announcement on bitcoin these days, they know it's going be picked up more broadly by the media, than if they decided to accept Discover cards,"" said Glenbrook's Peabody.    One disadvantage from a consumer's point of view is that, in general, Bitcoin sales are final and irreversible. Still, there are some vendors that do return bitcoin payments for faulty products, said Adam White, director of business development and strategy at Coinbase, an online wallet company in San Francisco.              SAVING ON TRANSACTION COSTS     For retailers, the biggest benefit in accepting bitcoins is lower transaction costs. Coinbase and Bitpay, for instance, charge less than 1 percent per transaction. A credit card payment, in contrast, typically carries a 3 percent fee.    Dell, which started accepting bitcoins in July, Dish, and Expedia all say their bitcoin revenue so far have exceeded their expectations. The three companies declined to give specific figures, but said bitcoin sales are modest relative to their overall revenues.    ""From the first day...we saw traffic at the site, it has been growing since,"" said Paul Walsh, chief information officer at Dell Commerce Services in Texas. He cited a recent single purchase in bitcoins of a server worth more than $50,000.    At online travel agent Cheapair.com in Calabasas, California, bitcoin sales totaled $1.5 million so far since it started accepting them in November 2013, said CEO Jeff Klee. In July alone, bitcoin sales at the company jumped 20 percent.    Data from BlockChain.info, a bitcoin wallet which stores the digital currency for customers, showed that over the last three months, there were between 50,000 and 75,000 bitcoin transactions a day on average, worth between $45 million and $85 million. That compares with U.S. retail sales of about $15 billion a day during July, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.    As of the end of June, bitcoin wallets, representing the number of users who have bitcoin accounts, have grown to 5.32 million, from 765,039 users a year ago, CoinDesk data show. It predicted that wallets would increase to 8 million by year-end.    ""I don't see too much risk for us right now on bitcoin,"" said Dish's Han. ""We are not expecting bitcoin to revolutionize the way our customers handle their accounts, but based on what we have seen so far, there is no reason for us to change.""

Blocking the deal would not just make it harder for U.S-based Expedia to grow in Australia and the Asia-Pacific. It would also continue uncertainty about the future of Wotif, which last month said its annual profit fell by a sixth because of business lost to Expedia and another large U.S. rival Priceline Group Inc.The commission said industry players feared that ""with the removal of Wotif as an independent competitor a significant competitive constraint on Expedia will be removed and Expedia will increase commission rates"".Joining two of Australia's three biggest accommodation sites would leave Expedia - the world's No. 2 travel website - competing only with Priceline Group Inc. This could leave ""limited incentive for them to compete with each other by offering lower commission rates to accommodation providers,"" the commission said.The regulator had been due to say if it would allow the deal on Thursday. Instead it said it needed more industry feedback and would now give its ruling on Oct. 2. In a statement, Wotif said it would work with the regulator to ""resolve any issues identified as a result of market enquiries"".Wotif shares traded as high as A$5.94 in early 2013 before a profit warning in December saw them tumble to a record low of A$2.29 on March 17.

34,"  * Announces 225 million euro investment in digital push* Buys French travel software company Wipolo* Group goal is to generate 50 percent of sales online   (Writes through, adds detail, Bazin and analyst comments)By Dominique VidalonPARIS, Oct 30 Accor will spend 225 million euros (283.5 million) over five years to beef up its digital business, the hotel company said on Thursday, responding to competition from online booking rivals such as Expedia  and Booking.com.Europe's largest hotel group's traditional competitors are the likes of InterContinental, Marriott and Starwood, but it faces multiple challenges online.These range from online travel agents (OTAs), which have squeezed the margins of traditional hoteliers with commission fees of up to 20 percent of the cost of a room, to the growing popularity of home-sharing website Airbnb.Accor said that as part of its plan it had bought French start-up Wipolo, a travel software company that offers mobile and web itinerary management services. It did not disclose the sum paid. ""OTAs have taken a large slice of the pie. They eat too much, but they also provide me with customers. I want to enter their game more efficiently,"" Accor Chief Executive Sebastien Bazin said at the company's Digital Day, having ditched his traditional business attire for a more casual black T-shirt.Bazin took over a little more than a year ago and initiated a reorganisation that has now turned to the online arena, focusing on beefing up its IT tools and systems, improving existing services such as its reservation system, bolstering its loyalty programme and seeking to attract more direct bookings.One goal is to increase the share of online reservations to 50 percent of the group's business volume, from 35 percent currently, while limiting the share of OTAs, Bazin said.Exane BNP Paribas recently estimated that OTAs account for 14 percent of Accor's gross revenue, against 11 percent for InterContinental and 7 percent for Marriott, having more than doubled their share of the market since 2008. LONG-TERM THREAT ""Online travel agencies represent a long-term threat to industry returns,"" the brokerage had said, adding that it expected hotel groups to respond with a new phase of IT investment, marketing partnerships and potential mega-mergers. In the battle against OTAs, Bazin said that the Accor loyalty programme and its 17 million members are key to its efforts to persuade customers to book directly through the company's websites.However, the Accor programme that started in 2008 remains small compared with those of InterContinental or Marriott, both of which have more than 50 million members.Bazin would not say how he planned to counter the rise of Airbnb, but he acknowledged that the success of the customer-to-customer site should be a ""wake-up call"" for the hotel industry.In a move to regain more control over distribution, Bazin appointed former Orange executive and technology specialist Vivek Badrinath last year as deputy CEO in charge of marketing, digital and information systems.The latest digital initiative comes after a busy first year for Bazin, in which he has had to grapple with a group that reported 2013 revenue of 5.5 billion euros from its 3,600 hotels in 92 countries, spread across 14 brands ranging from budget Ibis to luxury Sofitel.His first move was to split Accor into two divisions - HotelServices and HotelInvest - to separate its operating and franchising business from its real estate activity in an effort to boost profitability.The online challenge could take considerably longer, though the group's share price made a little headway on Thursday's announcement, rising 1.8 percent by 1453 GMT, against a 0.3 percent rise for the European travel and leisure index.

44,"  (Repeats to fix first reference to CFO)By Jeffrey DastinFeb 5 Expedia Inc on Thursday posted a fourth-quarter profit below analysts' expectations and over 30 percent lower than the same quarter a year ago, due in part to currency headwinds and heavy competition in China.The travel services company's shares slid more than 7 percent in extended trading.Expedia, which recently slipped behind The Priceline Group Inc to become the world's second largest travel services company by bookings, earned about $66.0 million last quarter, or 50 cents per diluted share.However, analysts had on average estimated the company would earn $1.01 per share in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While Expedia has expanded rapidly with the acquisitions of Travelocity last month and the Wotif Group in November 2014, the company said it will take time to integrate Wotif, in particular, and will not realize its full potential until after the first half of 2015, when Expedia technology will power all of its business.""We're now on cutting-edge technology platforms that will enable us to really expand our global presence,"" Chief Financial Officer Mark Okerstrom said. Meanwhile, its Chinese subsidiary eLong continued to suffer from heavy competition in the region, while demand from European travelers and others visiting the United States has slumped due to a stronger dollar.""We are expecting a deceleration in revenue growth in 2015 (from these) headwinds,"" Okerstrom said during the company's earnings call, adding in an interview: ""We are seeing impacts in most regions that have had foreign exchange weakening.""To be sure, a stronger U.S. dollar and lower fuel prices have helped boost demand from U.S. consumers, Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said during the earnings call. More than 50 percent of Expedia's revenue is generated from the United States. Volatile foreign exchange rates reduced Expedia's cash and equivalents by $79.4 million last quarter, the company reported. Its currency hedging cost it more than $5 million, and the eLong business saw a $27 million loss in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).Excluding eLong but including a negative foreign exchange impact of 5 percent, the company said it expects its EBITDA to grow between 10 percent and 15 percent in 2015.Gross bookings in the fourth quarter grew 24 percent year-over-year.Expedia also said it will pay shareholders an 18-cent dividend on March 26, worth about $23 million.

Cisco Systems climbed 9.4 percent to $29.46 in the network equipment maker's biggest one-day jump since May 2013 after earnings and revenue beat expectations. TripAdvisor Inc soared 22.5 percent to $82.40 a day after revenue topped forecasts. Fellow online travel company Expedia jumped 14.5 percent to $89.57. Earlier, Expedia agreed to buy Orbitz Worldwide for about $1.33 billion.With 76 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, about 71.4 percent of companies have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, while 56.8 percent have topped on revenue. That compares to the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue.Overseas, leaders of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine agreed a deal to end fighting in eastern Ukraine, potentially removing a concern for global investors, although the pact remained fragile. The news contributed to oil prices advancing 4.9 percent, which in turn lifted the S&P energy index 1.3 percent. ""There's definitely a feel-good situation leading from the reduction in geopolitical risk, while the rise we're seeing in the energy sector is really helping the overall benchmark,"" said Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston.U.S. economic data was tepid, as initial jobless claims rose more than expected in the latest week, while retail sales barely rebounded in January. In addition, business inventories rose less than expected in December.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 110.24 points, or 0.62 percent, to 17,972.38, the S&P 500 gained 19.95 points, or 0.96 percent, to 2,088.48, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 56.43 points, or 1.18 percent, to 4,857.61. The Nasdaq ended at its peak of the session, the highest level for the index since March 2000, while the S&P 500 ended about 0.1 percent below closing record, set on Dec. 29.Tesla Motors dropped 4.7 percent to $202.88 after it missed fourth-quarter sales targets and analysts' profit expectations.American Express shares dropped 6.4 percent to $80.48 as the biggest drag on the Dow after it said Costco Wholesale would stop accepting its cards in the United States from next April, after a renewal agreement could not be reached.NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,403 to 685, for a 3.51-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,931 issues rose and 806 fell, a 2.40-to-1 ratio.The S&P 500 posted 69 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 123 new highs and 20 new lows.About 6.72 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 7.31 billion.

50,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Diane Bartz  Online travel company Expedia Inc said on Thursday that it would buy Orbitz Worldwide Inc for about $1.33 billion in cash to bring on the rival's programmers and widen its customer base.While Expedia and larger rival Priceline Group, have embarked on acquisitions sprees to dominate the online travel business, three antitrust experts say the Orbitz deal is likely to get U.S. regulatory approval.""There's no entry barriers,"" said Andre Barlow, a partner in Washington law firm Doyle, Barlow & Mazard PLLC.Expedia and Priceline face increasing competition from the likes of Google Inc, airlines and hotel chains, which also sell itineraries on their websites. Shares of Orbitz, whose brands include CheapTickets and ebookers, were up nearly 22 percent at $11.73 in afternoon trading, just shy of the $12-per-share deal price. Expedia stock rose 15 percent to $90.02. Shares of TripAdvisor Inc, which Expedia spun off in 2011, rose more than 23 percent as investors speculated that it would be another industry target.Expedia bought Travelocity in January and Wotif Group in November. Besides running the website that bears its name, it also owns Hotels.com, Hotwire and a host of other brands. In terms of future acquisitions, Expedia Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said during a call Thursday with investors: ""We have got plenty on our plate, and we're not necessarily looking to jump around in the (coming) weeks or months."" NEW TALENT Instead, the company expects to grow in the short term by bringing in programmers, designers and marketers from Orbitz, as heavy competition among employers has led to a scarcity of high-quality talent, Chief Financial Officer Mark Okerstrom said. ""One of the things that Orbitz brings to us is a very strong brand, a very strong customer base,"" Okerstrom said in an interview. He also praised the company's loyalty programs.Okerstrom described the acquisition bid for Orbitz as ""competitive"" during the investor call. Orbitz had been exploring a sale and had drawn interest from various companies, according to media reports last month.S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi said the purchase price was fair because Orbitz would help Expedia reap full benefit of its investments and grow in international markets, where the strong U.S. dollar has hurt sales. [ID:nL1N0VF333] However, at more than five times Expedia Inc's market value, Priceline, which owns Booking.com, OpenTable and Kayak, remains tough competition, he said.""This deal is a good step in the right direction,"" Amobi said. ""It's very important for them to signal to the world that they are a hunter as opposed to being hunted."" Okerstrom downplayed concerns that consolidation would drive up prices, saying that there are more deals for consumers as companies vie for greater share of the $1.3 trillion industry. Expedia Inc said it expected the deal to generate $75 million in savings and revenue, amounting to an extra 75 cents in adjusted earnings per share, in the year after the two bookings agencies are integrated.The company said the deal was valued at $1.6 billion, including debt. Spokeswoman Sarah Waffle Gavin said the equity value was based on 110,798,050 Orbitz shares outstanding.

65,"  (Adds reactions from booking.com, Expedia, hoteliers, Accor)By Dominique VidalonPARIS, April 21 France's competition watchdog said on Tuesday that in coordination with the European Commission, and Swedish and Italian regulators it had accepted sweetened commitments from online travel agent booking.com to address competition concerns.These will go into effect in France, Italy and Sweden from July 1 for five years and will allow hotels to offer lower prices on other booking websites, the French regulator said.Hotels will also be able to make offers directly to their customers by means other than the Internet and allot fewer rooms to booking.com than they keep for themselves.In December, booking.com, owned by U.S-based Priceline Group , proposed scrapping the so-called pricing parity clause in its contracts preventing hotels from giving discounts to its rivals. Booking.com came up with improved commitments following third-party feedback and market tests conducted by the regulators.The pledges will be enforceable with the potential of fines of up to 5 percent of the company's global revenue of around $7 billion, the French competition authority said.Booking.com said it was considering implementing the new commitments across Europe and was working with other national regulators towards that goal. The European Commission, the anti-trust enforcer in the 28-country European Union, has been coordinating national probes in France, Italy and Sweden but has said it was not conducting its own investigation.The regulator's probe in France was prompted by a consortium of hotelier federations.Hoteliers have been trying to crack down on rate parity clauses in contracts with online travel agents (OTA) such as booking.com, arguing they remove flexibility in pricing. Traditional hoteliers face rising competition from OTAs, which are hitting their margins and earning commission fees that can reach 20 percent of the cost of a room. Booking.com said its commissions are between 15 and 17 percent.The French UMIH hotel federation welcomed booking.com's commitments as ""a first step"" but remained vigilant as other OTAs such as Expedia and HRS were not bound by these proposals.Accor, Europe's largest hotel group, approached the French regulator in February, saying booking.com was abusing its dominant position.It said on Tuesday that booking.com's commitments would allow hotels to ""reward their loyal clients and regain control over pricing policies"" but said Expedia and others must also comply to bring true competition among OTAs and lower their fees.Expedia said it was working with the authorities to find a solution.

Accounting for these fluctuations, travel bookings would be up 15 to 22 percent, the company said.The company expects to earn between $10.95 and $11.75 per share in the second quarter, excluding certain items, with revenue staying flat or rising up to 7 percent compared to a year earlier. It has greater exposure to foreign exchange volatility than rival Expedia Inc, with international bookings representing 88 percent of its total travel sales in the first quarter, compared to 41 percent for Expedia.Last week, Expedia affirmed earlier guidance for earnings growth as first-quarter bookings soared 19 percent.Priceline said travel bookings jumped 12 percent on the year in the first quarter, or 26 percent when accounting for currency fluctuations.The company's name-your-own-price feature, which allows customers to suggest a price they'd like to pay to travel, continued to shrink and hamper U.S. growth.""You have to question why they are still promoting that business,"" Amobi said.

Yellen's speech will start at 1:00 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). Consumer prices moderated last month, data showed, but the so-called core consumer price index, which strips out food and energy costs, posted its largest gain since January 2013.""It will give the Fed greater confidence that inflation will indeed make it to its target in the next couple of years, it increases the odds of faster Fed action,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.While the Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, is broadly expected to raise interest rates this year, the timing of the hike has kept the market on tenterhooks.Recent economic data has been sluggish, prompting investors to bet that rates will stay near zero till at least the later part of the year and pushing the major stock indexes to record territory over the past couple of weeks. Both the Dow and the S&P hit new records this week, although they have traded in a narrow range and volumes have been subdued as the quarterly earnings season draws to a close.At 12:28 p.m. ET (1628 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 42.98 points, or 0.24 percent, at 18,242.76, the S&P 500 was down 2.29 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,128.53 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.84 points, or 0.08 percent, at 5,094.63.The dollar rose to a 3-1/2-week high against the euro and U.S. bond yields rose after the stronger-than-expected rise in core consumer prices. Eight of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, led by a 0.7 percent drop in the teleservices index.Boeing shares fell 1.7 percent to $144.87 and was the biggest drag on the Dow after the Wall Street Journal reported that Bombardier was considering a third model of its CSeries jetliner.HP shares rose 3.6 percent to $35.05 after it forecast split-related costs below expectations and its quarterly profit beat market estimates.Expedia rose 8.6 percent at a record of $115 after selling its entire stake in Chinese online travel company ELong  to Ctrip.com and others. Ctrip jumped 17 percent to an all-time high of $84.50.Aeropostale slumped 13.5 percent to $2.24 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,827 to 1,111, for a 1.64-to-1 ratio on the downside. On the Nasdaq, 1,514 issues fell and 1,121 advanced for a 1.35-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 showed 24 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 61 new highs and 27 new lows.

78,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) AUSTIN, May 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Expedia,  Inc.'s (Expedia) announced issuance of senior unsecured Euro notes. A full list  of ratings follows at the end of this release. Expedia plans to use the note proceeds for a portion of the Orbitz acquisition  and other general corporate purposes, which may include capital returns to  shareholders, or prefunding of the potential Trivago call option in first  quarter 2016 (1Q16).   KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch calculates pro forma unadjusted leverage of 1.9x-2.0x for the notes  offering and both eLong and Orbitz transactions, up from 1.8x for the  last-12-month period ending March 31, 2015. There is headroom for leverage to  spike above 2.0x due to strategic acquisitions, so long as Fitch viewed the  transaction as favorable and was comfortable that leverage would be reduced  within a 12-18-month period. This note offering and the Orbitz acquisition fall  within that context, but there is now less headroom for any additional  leveraging transactions, including material debt-funded acquisitions or return  of capital to shareholders. Offsetting this pressure is additional liquidity  from the recent sale of majority stake in eLong. In February, Expedia agreed to acquire Orbitz in a transaction valued at $1.6  billion and a 10.25x EV/EBITDA multiple. Approvals have been received from both  companies' board of directors and Orbitz's shareholders, but approval by  regulators remains outstanding. The deal follows on the heels of Expedia's $612  million acquisition of Wotif Holdings Ltd., $280 million acquisition of  Travelocity, $270 million investment in Decolar, and $229 million purchase of  corporate offices. Management has commented publically that they are comfortable  with leverage temporarily increasing above 2x due to an acquisition, and  debt-funded acquisitions are consistent with management's historical actions  (Wotif was largely debt-funded). On May 22, Expedia entered into an agreement to sell its entire 62.4% stake in  eLong Inc. to several buyers, including Ctrip.com, for roughly $671 million.  Divestitures have not been a common occurrence under management's current  strategy. Fitch believes Expedia can maintain commercial relations to continue  sourcing supply through eLong while also providing global supply, maintaining  access to the China market.  However, the terms of the commercial agreement and  how it evolves over time are unclear and is complicated due to Ctrip's  affiliation with Priceline.  Additionally, the asset sale clouds the company's  strategy with respect to the China market. Another upcoming potential use of cash is the call option on Trivago in 1Q16,  whereby Expedia can purchase up to 50% of the minority shares. Expedia currently  owns 63% of Trivago and the redeemable non-controlling interest balance was  carried on its balance sheet at $527 million as of March 31, 2015.  Fitch views the Orbitz transaction as strategically sound, as larger competitors  within the industry benefit from economies of scale and smaller players are  increasingly unable to compete as effectively on items such as marketing and  technology spend. Management expects an annual run-rate of $75 million in  synergies, which Fitch anticipates will be achievable (eliminating duplicative  functions). The integration of Orbitz is a larger endeavor than its recent  acquisitions: Orbitz's 2014 gross bookings were $12.5 billion while Expedia's  2014 gross bookings totaled $50.4 billion. However, mis-execution concerns are  offset by Expedia's historic track record of successful integration. Further,  Expedia should be close to completing the Wotif integration by the Orbitz  transaction close, alleviating concerns of missteps resulting from overextending  in an attempt to integrate too many brands into its platform in too short a  time. The deal will give Expedia access to Orbitz's base of air travel customers,  significantly increasing the size of the segment. While the unit economics on  air ticket sales is not as favorable as hotel sales, Fitch believes that  capturing a larger airline customer base is prudent over the longer term as it  adds to the comprehensiveness of Expedia's broad offerings while providing  opportunities to cross-sell other products or bundles to generate revenue  synergies.  As the competitive and technological landscape continues to change, traditional  online travel agents (OTAs) will vie to increase their global share and maintain  their relevance in the face of other travel providers moving down the purchase  funnel (i.e. TripAdvisor's instant book). Fitch expects Expedia to continue  growing organically and by acquisition. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE At March 31, 2015, Expedia had $1.7 billion in cash and generated $1 billion in  free cash flow (FCF) during the trailing 12-month period. With FCF expected to  be in the $800 million - $1 billion range, and an increase in cash from this  note offering, Fitch believes Expedia will be able to continue capital returns  to shareholders at a pace similar to 2014 while maintaining leverage around 2.0x  or below (Expedia paid $85 million in dividends and repurchased $538 million of  shares on a gross basis during 2014). If operating performance is weaker than  expected, Fitch expects Expedia would consider reallocating capital from share  repurchases to debt reduction in an effort to remain within the current rating.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch projects strong revenue growth in the double-digit range thanks to  organic growth and continued strategic acquisitions. --EBITDA margins hold steady in the 17%-18% range through leveraging of fixed  cost on aggressive revenue growth offset by the levels of investments in sales  and marketing expense that support a longer term view.   --No additional debt raised through the forecast period as future acquisitions  are in the $400 million range and funded through cash flow from operations.  --Fitch assumes share repurchases of $550 million annually, consistent with 2014  gross levels, and steady dividend increases to $109 million annually.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: -- Fitch believes there are minimal business considerations to support the  company maintaining a rating above 'BBB-' which will likely forestall positive  rating action for the foreseeable future. However, a more conservative financial  profile coupled with increased revenue diversification from the growth of the  Egencia segment and Ad and Media revenues could have positive implications for  the rating. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: -- An increase in expected volatility in profitability, potentially due to  greater volatility in travel services demand or a higher fixed cost component to  Expedia's financial model;  -- A secular decline in the OTA business model, potentially the result of a  shift to direct bookings with travel providers;  -- The potential for a substantial financial loss from any future conclusion of  the occupancy tax lawsuits facing the company; -- A more aggressive financial policy, reflected through material debt-funded  acquisition, share repurchase, or dividends that drive leverage sustainably  above 2.0x. Fitch currently rates Expedia as follows: --IDR 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured bank credit facility 'BBB-'; --$500 million in 7.456% senior unsecured notes due 2018 'BBB-'; --$750 million in 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2020 'BBB-'; --$500 million in 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2024 'BBB-'.

With a mixed bag of corporate earnings over halfway through second-quarter reporting season and a sharp focus on when the Fed will begin raising interest rates from near zero, investors on Thursday saw few reasons to pay more for shares.""We've been stuck in a 3-percent band since almost the beginning of the year,"" said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. ""There's nothing motivating investors to push it outside of that in either direction.""The Dow Jones industrial average ended 0.03 percent weaker at 17,745.98, while the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,108.63. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.33 percent to 5,128.79.Six of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the utilities index leading gainers, up 0.72 percent, and the energy index the biggest decliner, down 0.65 percent. Thursday's GDP report lifted the dollar as some investors bet on a September, rather than December, rate hike. The dollar index rose 0.6 percent to 97.545 after touching its highest in a week.With 64 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter results, analysts expect overall earnings to edge up 1 percent and revenue to decline 3.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.Valuations remain a concern. The S&P 500 is trading near 16.8 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.""Earnings haven't been great,"" said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial. ""We are in a slow-growth environment and anything that knocks that down further is not a plus for the market.""

91,"  Priceline Group Inc (PCLN.O) reported second-quarter profit above analysts' estimates on Wednesday, although weakness in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar continued to weigh down results as well as its third-quarter outlook in dollar terms.Priceline, the world's second largest online travel services company by bookings after Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said net income fell 10.3 percent to $517 million from a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, it earned $653 million, or $12.45 per diluted share in the quarter. Analysts estimated, on average, it would earn $625 million, or $11.98 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Bookings through the company, which operates its namesake website as well as Booking.com, OpenTable, Kayak and others, rose almost 11 percent to $14.96 billion in the quarter. Hotel room and rental car bookings experienced ""accelerating growth"" for the second quarter in a row, it said.""We believe we are well set up to deliver the largest quarter in our company's history,"" Chief Executive Officer Darren Huston said of the third quarter.Priceline expects third-quarter bookings to fall as much as 1 percent or increase as much as 6 percent compared with the prior year, assuming exchange rates of $1.09 per euro and $1.56 per British pound. Adjusting rates to year-earlier exchange levels, it expects bookings to grow between 13 percent and 20 percent in dollar terms. The company also forecast adjusted earnings between $22.95 and $24.45 per share in the quarter, compared with $22.16 a year earlier.Priceline shares rose nearly 9 percent to $1,396 in premarket trading. ""Priceline.come continues to be a tale of two cities, with strong retail performance offset by a shrinking but still large name-your-own-price business,"" Huston said on an investor call, noting that its feature allowing customers to suggest a price they would pay has hurt its business.""OpenTable continued to produce double-digit domestic diner growth,"" he said of the service, acquired by Priceline last year that allows customers to make restaurant reservations online.

The $1.3 billion deal closed last month.Orbitz sites will have access to hotel, rental car and cruise listings from Expedia, boosting revenue as its customers gain more options for booking, Okerstrom said. He added that savings will come as Expedia cuts staff and legal and audit services that Orbitz will no longer need as an unlisted company. However, Expedia reported it will incur restructuring charges of up to $30 million in the fourth quarter and up to $50 million in 2016 related to the integration of Orbitz and the Wotif Group, which it purchased in 2014.The company narrowed its forecast for this year's growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to between 12 percent and 15 percent, from prior guidance of a rise between 10 percent and 15 percent.

104,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 05 (Fitch) Expedia, Inc.'s (EXPE) 'BBB-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) is not affected by the $3.9 billion acquisition of vacation  rental/alternative accommodation website HomeAway, Inc., according to Fitch  Ratings. We expect the company's leverage to moderately exceed our 2.0x target  for the company at the 'BBB-' rating level. However, organic growth and Orbitz  and HomeAway acquisition-related synergies should allow Expedia to reduce its  leverage back under 2.0x over the one-to-two-year Stable Rating Outlook horizon.  Expedia has a history of moderately increasing leverage to make acquisitions and  reducing leverage to (or slightly below) its 2.0x target during the subsequent  six-to-12 months. Fitch believes the company is committed to maintaining its low  investment-grade rating.  Expedia will gain a solid beachhead in the so-called 'sharing economy' by  acquiring HomeAway that will diversify its product offering in a manner that  complements its existing customer base. HomeAway's website has over 1.2 million  vacation rental listings in over 190 countries, which should appeal to Expedia's  customers, who are increasingly looking for/open to alternative forms of  vacation lodging.  Adding HomeAway will also reduce Expedia's supplier concentration at a time when  hotels, for example, are capitalizing on strong industry demand by reducing  their exposure to discounted inventory distribution channels (i.e. on-line  travel agencies ).   Fitch sees some execution risk to boosting HomeAway's monetization, which will  likely require a transition away from the company's predominantly  subscription-based business model to a more transaction-oriented approach that  includes some upselling of products and services. Expedia's expertise in  transaction-oriented business models, as well as its familiarity with HomeAway  gained through their partnership during the last two years should facilitate the  integration and mitigate execution risk.  The purchase will be immediately dilutive to Expedia's earnings. However, the  company expects to more than double HomeAway's EBITDA by 2018 to $350 million  from $120 million going in, primarily through organic growth and better  monetization. HomeAway's monetization rate is approximately one-third the rate  of Trip Advisor, Inc. and Airbnb, Inc.  On Nov. 4, 2015 Expedia announced it will purchase HomeAway, Inc. for $3.9  billion. HomeAway will be the company's largest acquisition, to-date. Expedia  plans to fund the purchase with approximately $2.3 billion of equity issuance,  $1 billion of cash (including $500 million of net cash at HomeAway) and $600  million of incremental borrowings. The latter could include an unsecured bond  issuance or borrowings under its revolving credit facility. CREDIT STRENGTHS Credit strengths include: --Expedia is one of the largest OTAs, with advantages in scale that have  contributed to the company gaining significant share in the market for travel  services over the past several years;  --Broad customer and geographic diversification have a positive impact on the  stability of end-market demand for travel services which are inherently highly  correlated to the macro-economic environment; --Expedia benefits from the expected continuation of a secular shift toward use  of OTAs which should support revenue growth in excess of both overall travel  services and GDP growth; --A relatively high-variable-cost model limits potential negative pressure on  profitability during business downturns, although much of the variable-cost  items are specific to marketing expense which, if reduced, could have a negative  effect on the company's competitive position. RATING CONCERNS Ratings concerns include: --Increasing competition from other online travel businesses including  TripAdvisor & Google, as well as the potential for non-traditional suppliers to  evolve into significant competitors in the future; --Expedia faces a potentially significant contingent liability due to lawsuits  related to hotel occupancy taxes; --Ongoing pricing pressure in the OTA market combined with increasing  competition with direct sales channels could negatively affect future revenue  growth and profitability;  --Inherent volatility in travel service demands from macroeconomic drivers as  well as the potential for significant volatility due to travel demand shocks; --Liberty Interactive holds shares representing approximately 57% of the voting  power in Expedia. While Liberty has given Expedia's Chairman of the Board, Barry  Diller, a proxy to vote these shares, Fitch's ratings take into account  Liberty's historical track record of shareholder-friendly actions; --In a slower growth or negative revenue environment, the Fitch-defined net  working capital deficit of $4.7 billion at June 2015 is expected to be a use of  cash; --Expedia competes directly with the online presence of its suppliers in the  travel services industry, which could lead to future disruptions in the  company's business model. Fitch believes, however, that OTAs represent a valued  source of market information to, as well as being a marketing arm of, travel  service providers. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: --Positive rating action will likely be forestalled for the foreseeable future  due to minimal business considerations to support the company maintaining a  rating above 'BBB-' and certain secular challenges. These include an  intensifying competitive environment, shifting consumer behaviors, and  technological shifts. However, a more conservative financial profile coupled  with increased revenue diversification from the growth of the Egencia segment  and Ad and Media revenues could have positive implications for the rating. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --An increase in expected volatility in profitability, potentially due to  greater volatility in travel services demand or a higher fixed-cost component to  Expedia's financial model;  --A secular decline in the OTA business model, potentially the result of a shift  to direct bookings with travel providers;  --The potential for a substantial financial loss from any future conclusion of  the occupancy tax lawsuits facing the company; --A more aggressive financial policy, reflected through material debt-funded  acquisition, share repurchase, or dividends that drive leverage sustainably  above 2.0x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Expedia as follows: Expedia, Inc. --IDR at 'BBB-', Outlook Stable; --Senior unsecured bank credit facility at 'BBB-'; --$500 million in 7.456% senior unsecured notes due 2018 at 'BBB-'; --$750 million in 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2020 at 'BBB-'; --EUR650 million in 2.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022 at 'BBB-'; --$500 million in 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2024 at 'BBB-'.

105,"   By Jeffrey Dastin and Ankit Ajmera  Expedia Inc on Wednesday said it agreed to buy vacation rental site HomeAway Inc for about $3.9 billion in cash and stock, in a move that could ramp up competition with apartment-sharing startup Airbnb.Expedia, the world's largest online travel agency by bookings, said it expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2016 subject to regulatory approval.

107,"  (Adds detail from other cities, new quotes and Expedia deal, changes slug to AIRBNB-SANFRANCISCO/ELECTION)By Heather SomervilleSAN FRANCISCO Nov 4 Airbnb said on Wednesday it plans to form 100 home-sharing clubs in cities across the United States during 2016, seeking to organize advocates of home-and room-sharing companies to head off regulatory crackdowns.These clubs are an extension of the $8.4 million ground campaign Airbnb organized ahead of Tuesday's election in San Francisco, which included an initiative to restrict short-term rentals.The company won that battle, with Proposition F, a measure to limit short-term rentals to 75 nights a year, defeated 55 percent to 45 percent.""We're going to use the momentum of what took place here to do what we did in San Francisco around the world,"" Chris Lehane, Airbnb's global policy chief who led the campaign, said during a news conference.The home-sharing clubs will be organized and supported by Airbnb and run by hosts and guests who use the website. Lehane declined to say how much the community home-sharing advocacy clubs would cost, but said, ""we'll spend what it takes to succeed.""In San Francisco, Airbnb outspent Prop. F supporters by more than 30 times, organizing 2,000 volunteers and knocking on about 285,000 doors.The company wants to replicate that ground campaign in anticipation of more regulatory battles. ""It's not a question of if but more a question of when those conversations will take place,"" Lehane said.Fending off restrictions is particularly important in light of steeper competition from Expedia Inc, which on Wednesday said it would buy vacation rental site HomeAway Inc  for about $3.9 billion in cash and stock.The move is expected to extend HomeAway's reach and help Expedia compete for customers that use Airbnb. While Airbnb scored a victory on Prop. F, the election also brought a new challenge. Former Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, an Airbnb critic, was voted back into office.And cities including New York and Los Angles will continue mulling tough restrictions on Airbnb, according to city council members and affordable housing advocates in those cities.New York's city council is preparing to vote on a proposal that would levy steeper fines against Airbnb violators. New York already has among the toughest laws for short-term rentals.""What happened in San Francisco will have zero impact in New York City,"" said Austin Shafran, spokesman for ShareBetter, the coalition advocating for a crackdown on illegal Airbnb rentals.

Rival Expedia Inc's shares were down 1.74 percent at $131. Priceline, Expedia and other travel companies have been facing increased pressure in its hotel bookings business from the rise of apartment-sharing startups such as Airbnb, which is expected to double its bookings this year.Analysts have warned that competition with Airbnb could become fierce by 2018 and could transform the travel market by adding new capacity that competes directly with hotel operators.Expedia, the world's second largest online travel services company by bookings, last week agreed to buy vacation rental site HomeAway Inc for about $3.9 billion. Expedia's move could ramp up competition with Airbnb, and bolster it's position in the apartment sharing market, which might be the next frontier for leisure travel.Priceline said on Monday it expect fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $11.10 to $11.90 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $12.42, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said it expects U.S. gross travel bookings to decrease by 5-10 percent in the quarter. Priceline also reported a 12.7 percent rise in third-quarter profit on higher hotel and rental car bookings.Net profit applicable to common shareholders rose to $1.20 billion, or $23.41 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $1.06 billion, or $20.03 per share, a year earlier.

110,"  (Adds details, background)Nov 12 Media mogul John Malone, known for striking complex deals and running companies with intricate structures, is restructuring two companies he controls using tracking stocks and spinoffs.Liberty Interactive Corp, which mainly houses Malone's e-commerce interests, said it would spin-off some of its businesses along with its 18 percent stake in online travel company Expedia Inc into two newly-formed units - CommerceHub Inc and Liberty Expedia Holdings Inc.Liberty Interactive itself is structured into two tracking stocks - QVC Group, its home-shopping business, and Liberty Ventures Group, its cable assets.The spun off stocks will be distributed to Liberty Ventures Group shareholders.Separately, Liberty Media Corp - which was spun off from Liberty Interactive in 2011 - said it would reclassify its shares into three new tracking stock groups. A tracking stock is a type of common stock that ""tracks"" or depends on the financial performance of a specific business unit or operating division of a company rather than the operations of a company as a whole.One tracking stock will be designated as the Liberty Braves Group and will track its Atlanta Braves baseball holdings.The second, Liberty Media Group, will track its ownership in stakes in Time Warner, Viacom and Live Nation. The Liberty Sirius Group will track its unit Sirius XM Holdings Inc . ""The move is positive and hints at more to come especially with the Sirius tracker,"" Robert Routh, an analyst at FBN Securities said.""I don't see more trackers created but do think a deal with Sirius XM as well as Expedia is likely in the works as well as a combination of Liberty Broadband Corp with Liberty Interactive in the future,"" he said.

112,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to  Expedia, Inc.'s (Expedia) announced issuance of senior unsecured notes. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Expedia plans to use the note proceeds for a portion of the HomeAway acquisition  and other general corporate purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch calculates pro forma unadjusted leverage of 2.3x for the notes offering  and all three recent transactions (HomeAway, Orbitz, eLong). This is slightly  higher than Fitch's Sept. 30, 2015 pro forma unadjusted leverage of 1.8x, which  does not include the HomeAway transaction. There is headroom for leverage to  spike above 2.0x due to strategic acquisitions as long as Fitch views the  transaction as favorable and is comfortable that leverage will be reduced over  the one-to-two year Stable Rating Outlook horizon. This note offering and the  HomeAway transaction fall within this context, similar to the note offering and  Orbitz acquisition earlier in the year. However, there is now less headroom for  any additional leveraging transactions, including material debt-funded  acquisitions or return of capital to shareholders.  On Nov. 4, 2015 Expedia announced it will purchase HomeAway, Inc. for $3.9  billion. HomeAway will be the company's largest acquisition to date. Expedia  plans to fund the purchase with approximately $2.3 billion of equity issuance  and $1 billion of cash (comprised of net cash at HomeAway and the most recent  note offering). Fitch views Expedia's planned funding mix for the acquisition as  a positive and shows the company's commitment to maintaining its low  investment-grade rating. The transaction has been approved by both companies'  board of directors and was granted regulatory clearance by the Federal Trade  Commission. The deal follows on the heels of Expedia's $1.6 billion acquisition  of Orbitz, $612 million acquisition of Wotif Holdings Ltd., $270 million  investment in Decolar, and $229 million purchase of corporate offices.  Fitch views the HomeAway transaction as strategically sound and gives Expedia a  solid beachhead in the so-called 'sharing economy'. HomeAway helps diversify  Expedia's product offering in a manner that complements its existing customer  base. HomeAway's website has over 1.2 million vacation rental listings in over  190 countries, which should appeal to Expedia's customers, who are increasingly  looking for and open to alternative forms of vacation lodging. Adding HomeAway  will also reduce Expedia's supplier concentration at a time when hotels, for  example, are capitalizing on strong industry demand by reducing their exposure  to discounted inventory distribution channels (i.e. online travel agencies   ). Fitch sees some execution risk to boosting HomeAway's monetization, which will  likely require a transition away from the company's predominantly  subscription-based business model to a more transaction-oriented approach that  includes some upselling of products and services. Expedia's expertise in  transaction-oriented business models, as well as its familiarity with HomeAway  gained through their partnership during the last two years should facilitate the  integration and mitigate execution risk. In addition, growth in HomeAway's  overall bookings ($14 billion-$16 billion currently) should also provide  additional tailwinds to the business as Expedia plans to leverage its expertise  and become more aggressive through variable marketing channels.  The purchase will be immediately dilutive to Expedia's earnings. However, the  company expects to more than double HomeAway's EBITDA by 2018 to $350 million  from $120 million going in, primarily through organic growth and better  monetization. HomeAway's monetization rate is approximately one-third the rate  of Trip Advisor, Inc. and Airbnb, Inc.  Expedia's EBITDA target is reasonable given the upside potential in HomeAway's  monetization rate. Fitch estimates that a 100 basis point increase in  monetization rate can generate incremental EBITDA of roughly $30 million.  Fitch's Base Case includes $280 million of 2018 HomeAway EBITDA, under  conservative estimates around growth in HomeAway's gross bookings, monetization  rate, and margin, given the timing considerations and execution risk. Under  these assumptions, Expedia is expected to delever below 2.0x over the one-to-two  year Stable Rating Outlook horizon.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's expectations are based on the agency's internally produced, conservative  rating case forecasts. They do not represent the forecasts of rated issuers  individually or in aggregate. Key Fitch forecast assumptions include: --Strong revenue growth in the double-digit range driven by organic growth and  recent strategic acquisitions. --EBITDA margins hold steady in the 16%-17% range through leveraging of fixed  costs on aggressive revenue growth offset by the levels of investments in sales  and marketing expense that support a longer term view.  --No additional debt raised through the forecast period as future acquisitions  are in the $400 million range and funded through cash flow from operations.  --Share repurchases remain subdued until the HomeAway transaction closes, and  resume at $550 million annually thereafter. Steady dividend increases consistent  with 2014 payout ratio.  --HomeAway transaction closes in first half of 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: --Positive rating action will likely be forestalled for the foreseeable future  due to minimal business considerations to support the company maintaining a  rating above 'BBB-' and certain secular challenges. These include an  intensifying competitive environment, shifting consumer behaviors, and  technological shifts. However, a more conservative financial profile coupled  with increased revenue diversification from the growth of the Egencia segment  and Ad and Media revenues could have positive implications for the rating. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --An increase in expected volatility in profitability, potentially due to  greater volatility in travel services demand or a higher fixed-cost component to  Expedia's financial model;  --A secular decline in the OTA business model, potentially the result of a shift  to direct bookings with travel providers;  --The potential for a substantial financial loss from any future conclusion of  the occupancy tax lawsuits facing the company; --A more aggressive financial policy, reflected through material debt-funded  acquisition, share repurchase, or dividends that drive leverage sustainably  above 2.0x. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE At Sept. 30, 2015, Expedia had $1.5 billion in cash and generated $527 billion  in Fitch-defined free cash flow (FCF) during the trailing 12-month period. With  FCF expected to be in the $1 billion - $1.2 billion range, and an increase in  cash from this note offering, Fitch believes Expedia will be able to maintain  steady dividend increases consistent with the 2014 payout ratio while delevering  to below 2.0x within one to two years on EBITDA growth. There is flexibility for  some level of share repurchases, but Fitch does not expect repurchases  consistent with 2014 levels ($538 million gross repurchases) to resume until  after the HomeAway acquisition is completed. Fitch expects Expedia to grow its  cash balance over the next year as the company has historically held outsized  cash balances to partially offset the working capital deficit.  HomeAway has $403 million in 0.125% convertible notes which Fitch assumes will  be converted or repurchased by Expedia. The convertible notes contain certain  clauses that, under specified corporate transactions, allow holders to convert  or put the notes at 100% plus accrued and unpaid interest. There is a  possibility that the convertible notes remain outstanding in whole or partially  if noteholders elect to retain their notes. Fitch assumes the convertible notes  do not remain outstanding in its Base Case. In the event the notes remain  outstanding, Fitch would treat them as 100% debt with no equity credit. The full  balance would represent incremental pro forma leverage of 0.3x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Expedia as follows: Expedia, Inc. --IDR 'BBB-', Outlook Stable; --Senior unsecured bank credit facility 'BBB-'; --$500 million in 7.456% senior unsecured notes due 2018 'BBB-'; --$750 million in 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2020 'BBB-'; --EUR650 million in 2.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022 'BBB-'; --$500 million in 4.5% senior unsecured notes due 2024 'BBB-'.

Shares of the company, which also beat revenue expectations, rose 11.7 percent to $119.50 in after-market trading on Thursday.

However, the company was certainly not closed for business from M&A, he added. Acquisitions added about 28 percentage points to revenue growth in the first quarter ended March 31, the company said. (bit.ly/1NDNySx)    Revenue rose about 39 percent to $1.90 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $1.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Despite a strong first quarter, the company expects vast majority of adjusted EBITDA dollar growth to come in the back half of the year, CFO Okerstrom said on a post-earnings  conference call.The company reiterated its forecast of 35-45 percent boost in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2016, excluding the eLong business it sold in May. The value of bookings on Expedia sites rose nearly 32 percent to $18.88 billion in the quarter.Excluding items, the company earned 9 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of a loss of 6 cents.

The two investors have backed a string of start-up successes including Skype and Spotify.Berlin-based GoEuro declined to comment on where the fundraising leaves it in terms of valuation, but suggested in a statement that it was on track to attain coveted ""unicorn"" status, which refers to firms valued at $1 billion or more.""GoEuro is now poised to join the small circle of European start-ups seen to have the potential to become multi-billion dollar companies,"" the company said.  The company said it plans to use the funds to expand its ground travel and domestic flight booking service to 30 countries in Europe from the 12 mostly Western European markets it serves, Naren Shaam, the company's founder and chief executive said in an interview. While search sites for airline travel abound, GoEuro specialises in hooking into the booking systems of ground transportation networks, which remain underdeveloped, with more than 80 percent of tickets still sold in local stations.Travellers can book journeys with more than 500 European transport operators, including railway companies, bus operators and airlines offering flights within the region. The site provides a range of ground transportation connections.""We are the largest source of information on ground transportation options in Europe. It is a huge barrier to entry,"" Shaam said. The company enables travellers both within and beyond Europe to book tickets on their mobile phones. ""Many operators don't have mobile applications. You should be able to click a button and hop on the next train.""GoEuro says it attracts 10 million users a month to its travel booking app. That's well less than a tenth of the audience of decade-old airline and hotel search site Trivago, but GoEuro is distinguished by its focus on ground travel. The site allows consumers to search in 12 languages, including Chinese and Russian, and nearly a third of GoEuro users are tourists from overseas, Shaam says.Trivago, which was founded in 2004 in Duesseldorf and acquired by global travel site Expedia in 2012, is planning a U.S. stock market listing in coming months (reut.rs/2dp6aai).

140,"   By Nate Raymond  A former Expedia Inc computer support technician pleaded guilty on Monday to having secretly accessed senior executives' emails in order to engage in insider trading based on confidential information he stole.Jonathan Ly, 28, entered his plea in federal court in Seattle to one count of securities fraud stemming from an insider trading scheme that prosecutors said netted the San Francisco resident $331,000.He is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 28. As part of a plea deal, Ly agreed to repay Expedia the $81,592 it spent investigating the computer intrusion. He also reached a $375,907 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.""Mr. Ly is deeply sorry for the activity he engaged in and the people and corporation he has impacted,"" John Runfola, his lawyer, said in a statement. According to court papers, in 2013, Ly began exploiting his administrative access privileges to secretly review the contents of devices belonging to executives including Expedia's chief financial officer and head of investor relations.Prosecutors said that using the non-public information he obtained, Ly executed a series of well-times trades in Expedia stock options.Even after he left the company in 2015, prosecutors said, Ly kept a company laptop and continued accessing the electronic devices and email accounts of Expedia executives. ""The irony of our increasingly digital world is that the greatest threat to our networks is a human one,"" U.S. Attorney Annette Hayes said in a statement. ""In this case, an IT professional used his employer's networks to facilitate a get-rich-quick scheme.""Prosecutors said Expedia ultimately discovered the computer intrusion and reported it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Expedia in a statement confirmed it worked closely with law enforcement in the probe. ""Expedia has been and remains committed to a rigorous and continual improvement cycle for all elements of its security posture,"" the company said in a statement.The case is U.S. v. Ly, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 16-cr-00316.
