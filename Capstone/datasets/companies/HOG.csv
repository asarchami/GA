2,"   By James B. Kelleher  Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday, lifted by growing global motorcycle sales, while its preliminary 2014 shipment forecast suggested its efforts to reach non-traditional riders will continue to gain traction.The results initially sent its shares up as much as 4 percent in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, before they gave up those gains to trade down 0.6 percent at $63.65.The Milwaukee-based company posted a fourth-quarter net profit of $75.4 million, or 34 cents a share, up from $70.6 million, or 31 cents a share, last year.Overall revenue from bikes, parts and accessories, financial services and apparel rose 1.5 percent to $1.2 billion, Harley-Davidson said.Analysts, on average, expected the company to report a profit of 34 cents a share on sales of $1.04 billion.The company said it expects shipments to dealers to rise between 7 percent and 9 percent to 279,000 to 284,000 motorcycles in 2014.Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar, said the shipment guidance was ""pretty good for a mature business"".She said it suggested the company expects double-digit sales gains among customers outside its core demographic group of white males over 50 years of age.Harley-Davidson has long known its reliance on an overwhelmingly white, male and middle-aged consumer base would ultimately challenge sales in North America, where it still earns two-thirds of its revenue. That so-called ""baby boomer"" cohort is growing at a low-single-digit rate.So in recent years, the company has aggressively courted non-core customers - young adults, women, African-American and Hispanic riders - with a variety of new designs.This spring, the motorcycle maker's dealers in the United States, Canada, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and India will begin selling Harley-Davidson's new line of lighter, more affordable motorcycles - the Street 500 and the Street 750.The bike is its first foray into the smaller motorcycle market in nearly 40 years, and Harley-Davidson's effort to win over these outreach customers appear to be working. According to RL Polk, a leading provider of auto industry data, Harley-Davidson has been the market leader among riders ages 18-to-34, as well as women, African-Americans and Hispanics, for five years running.DEMAND RISE Harley-Davidson, which sells its bikes through a global network of about 1,500 independent dealers and distributors, said it shipped 46,618 motorcycles to dealers during the quarter, down from 47,067 in the year-ago period.Fourth-quarter shipments are often weak because it marks the beginning of the winter season in the United States, where Harley-Davidson derives two-thirds of its sales.But consumer demand at the retail levels rose during the fourth quarter and dealer retail motorcycle sales were up nearly 6 percent. Sales rose in every region except Latin America, where they fell nearly 3 percent, the company said. Harley-Davidson said issues getting the company's new bikes certified for sale in Brazil accounted for that decline.Harley-Davidson's annual worldwide shipment levels peaked at about 350,000 units in 2006, right before the U.S. housing bubble burst.Consumer demand for its motorcycles, which are priced from $8,000 to more than $30,000, tumbled along with the broader economy.It only bottomed out in 2010, when Harley-Davidson shipped 210,494 bikes to dealers - 40 percent fewer than it did just four years before.The company responded to the sharp downturn with a wide-ranging restructuring program that - among other things - squeezed wage concessions from its unionized workers in Milwaukee, Kansas City, Missouri and York, Pennsylvania.It also saw it drop non-core motorcycle brands, including Buell and MV Agusta.Those concessions, and the adoption of a ""surge manufacturing"" work schedule, which permits Harley-Davidson to bring on workers during seasonally strong quarters and lay them off during slower quarters, saved it $310 million in 2013.(Reporting by James B.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG) and its Harley-Davidson Financial  Services, Inc. (HDFS) subsidiary to 'A' from 'A-'. In addition, Fitch has  withdrawn HOG's senior unsecured rating, now that all of the motor company's  senior unsecured debt has been repaid. Fitch does not expect HOG to issue debt  at the parent company level in the intermediate term. HDFS' senior unsecured  rating has been upgraded to 'A' and its short term rating has been upgraded to  'F1'. The Rating Outlook for HOG and HDFS is Stable. A complete list of rating  actions follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of the IDRs of HOG and HDFS reflects the motorcycle manufacturer's  strengthened credit profile now that its restructuring is complete. Also, on  Feb. 3, 2014, HOG repaid the remaining $303 million in senior unsecured notes  outstanding at the motor company, leaving the motor company debt free. All  remaining debt is at the HDFS subsidiary, and Fitch expects all debt issuance  going forward will be at HDFS. In addition to its relatively strong credit  profile, HOG's ratings are also supported by the company's leading position in  the U.S. heavyweight motorcycle segment, strong cash liquidity position,  relatively high margins, well-funded pension plans, and conservative financial  policies. HOG commands more than 50% of the U.S. heavyweight motorcycle market, and sales  outside the U.S. continue to grow, particularly in emerging markets such as  India and Latin America. Over the past several years, demand in Europe has been  pressured by the region's challenging economic conditions, but over the  intermediate term, Fitch expects HOG to further grow the percentage of its sales  generated outside the U.S. Helping in this regard will be the new Street  motorcycles, whose lighter weight and lower price should appeal to non-U.S.  customers, especially in emerging markets. Fitch also expects HOG's cost  structure to improve now that its restructuring program has been largely  completed and its Kansas City plant has been shifted to a flexible production  system. HDFS' asset performance and funding access remain strong and the  subsidiary continues to increase the proportion of unsecured debt in its funding  profile. Fitch notes, however, that loss rates could rise modestly over the  intermediate term as HDFS has increased the number of subprime originations in  its asset base. HDFS' ratings reflect its close operating relationship with HOG, which is  governed by a support agreement under which HOG must maintain HDFS' fixed-charge  coverage at 1.25 times (x) and minimum net worth of $40 million. HDFS' ratings  are linked to HOG, as Fitch believes that the company is a core subsidiary of  HOG and there is an implicit level of support between the two entities.  The primary risk to HOG's ratings is the potential for an economic slowdown to  result in lower motorcycle demand and reverse the positive growth trends that  have taken hold over the past several years. This could weaken HOG's  profitability and pressure the company's liquidity. A downturn that is  accompanied by tightened credit markets would exacerbate the pressure by  potentially limiting HDFS' access to stable sources of capital and forcing HOG  to provide financial support to the subsidiary. Despite these risks, HOG is now  in a significantly better position to withstand a future downturn than is was  prior to the last recession, with a more flexible cost structure and a  commitment to maintaining liquidity (including both cash and revolver  availability) sufficient to meet its consolidated cash needs over a rolling  12-month period. The motor company's debt-free balance sheet and well-funded  pension plans also enhance its financial flexibility. The operational restructuring that HOG began in 2009 is complete. In January  2014, the company transitioned its Kansas City plant to the same flexible  manufacturing process that it implemented at its York plant in 2012. With surge  capability in place at its primary manufacturing facilities, HOG is now able to  flex all of its production in line with the significant seasonality in its  business, which will help to reduce costs and better align dealer inventories  with seasonal demand patterns. Through Dec. 31, 2013, the company had spent  about $302 million in cash related to the restructuring since the program began.  HOG estimates annualized expense savings associated with the restructuring  (compared with 2008 levels) were about $310 million for the full year 2013 and  will be $320 million going forward. Fitch views the restructuring as an  important driver of HOG's financial flexibility and credit profile improvement,  and it has already had a meaningful effect on HOG's financial and operational  performance.  For the 2014 model year, HOG has introduced its heavily updated line of Touring  motorcycles known as 'Project Rushmore'. These are the first motorcycles  designed under the accelerated product development process that HOG implemented  several years ago. The Rushmore motorcycles feature a number of new design  elements, upgraded technology and updated motors. HOG has raised prices on the  Rushmore bikes, but the company has noted that their higher level of equipment  actually results in slightly lower margins. In addition to the Rushmore  motorcycles, in the spring of 2014, HOG will introduce the entirely new Street  line of motorcycles. The Street motorcycles are lighter weight and will have a  lower base price than HOG's existing motorcycles, and they are powered by new,  smaller engines. The Street motorcycles have been designed with non-U.S. markets  in mind, but they will be sold as entry-level motorcycles in the U.S. as well.  Although the lower price of the Street motorcycles risks some cannibalization  with lower-end Sportsters, Fitch views the introduction of both the Rushmore and  Street motorcycles positively, as their updated technology and design will help  to further diversify HOG's customer base without diluting its strong brand  image. The motor company's credit profile remains strong and, following the debt  repayment, is characterized by zero debt, high margins and robust liquidity.  Fitch-calculated EBITDA for the motor company in the 12 months ended Sept. 29,  2013, was $1.1 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 20.3%, up from $962  million and a 19.4% EBITDA margin in the year-earlier period. The motor  company's liquidity position remains solid as well, with about $820 million in  cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at Dec. 31, 2013. Year-end  liquidity remained robust despite the company voluntarily contributing $175  million to its pension plans in early 2013. Dividend payments in 2013 were $188  million, up from $142 million in the year-earlier period, while net share  repurchases increased to $479 million in 2013, up from $312 million in 2012. The motor company's free cash flow remained robust in the 12 months ended Sept.  29, 2013, totaling $440 million. This was $100 million higher than the  corresponding year-earlier period despite increases in both capital spending and  dividends. As a result, the motor company's free cash flow margin grew to 8.4%  from 6.8% in the year-earlier period. Going forward, increased capital spending  and higher dividends will put some downward pressure on free cash flow, but  Fitch expects it to remain positive and relatively strong. Consolidated capital  spending in 2013, most of which was at the motor company, was $208 million, up  from $189 million in 2012. With no obvious acquisition opportunities, Fitch  expects HOG to allocate excess future cash flows to share repurchases. However,  the company appears resolute in its strategy to keep all debt at the HDFS level,  so Fitch does not expect it to fund any share repurchases with incremental motor  company borrowing. At year-end 2012 (the most recent detailed information available), HOG's pension  plans were 82% funded on a projected benefit obligation (PBO) basis, with a PBO  of $1.9 billion and total assets of $1.5 billion. As noted above, in the first  quarter of 2013, the company voluntarily contributed $175 million to its plans,  and no further contributions were required in 2013. HOG noted on it recent  earnings call that a combination of strong asset returns and a higher discount  rate improved the funded status of its pension and post-retirement plans by  about $600 million at year end 2013, suggesting that the pension plan may have  been fully funded at the end of 2013. As such, the company does not expect to  make any contributions to its funded plans in 2014. HDFS' operating performance has been stable. In 2013, its operating income of  $283.1 million was relatively flat year-over-year compared to $284.7 million in  2012. Total delinquencies (30-plus days past due) as a percentage of retail  receivables were 3.71%, compared to 3.94% one year prior. Annualized net losses,  as percentage of retail receivables, were 1.09% as of Dec. 31, 2013 compared to  0.79% one year prior. Fitch expects operating performance for 2014 to continue  to be flat to modestly lower, as lower cost of funds will be offset by higher  credit loss provisioning for the year. As of year-end Dec. 31, 2013, HDFS had $2.45 billion of liquidity, which was  comprised of $1.17 billion of balance sheet cash (including $820 million at the  motor company) and $1.28 billion of availability under its credit facilities.  HDFS' debt maturities are well laddered, with no significant long-term debt  maturing within the next year. Fitch believes HDFS has sufficient liquidity to  meet upcoming debt maturities and fund new motorcycle receivables. Leverage, as measured by total debt divided by tangible equity, was 6.0x at Dec.  31, 2013, compared to 5.5x the same period, one year prior. The company's equity  base is of high quality with no material goodwill or intangibles. Fitch believes  HDFS' leverage is consistent with similarly rated peers and within the  historical range of between 5.0x and 7.0x.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Fitch does not anticipate upgrading the ratings of HOG or HDFS in the  intermediate term. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --A severe downturn in global heavyweight motorcycle demand; --A change in financial policy that leads to the motor company once again  carrying debt, particularly to fund shareholder activities; --A shift in business strategy away from a focus on the namesake brand; --Difficulty in HDFS accessing long-term funding for new originations; --A significant increase in HDFS' reliance on secured debt or commercial paper; --A meaningful deterioration in HDFS' asset quality; --A change in the perceived core relationship between HOG and HDFS. Fitch has taken the following rating actions on HOG and HDFS:  HOG --Long-term IDR upgraded to 'A' from 'A-'; --Senior unsecured rating withdrawn. HDFS --Long-term IDR upgraded to 'A' from 'A-'; --Senior unsecured rating upgraded to 'A' from 'A-'; --Short-term IDR upgraded to 'F1' from 'F2'; --Commercial paper rating upgraded to 'F1' from 'F2'. Harley-Davidson Funding Corp. (HDFC) --Senior unsecured rating upgraded to 'A' from 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Or tour its York, Pennsylvania, plant, which has cranked out motorcycles since the early 1970s and builds some of its biggest cruising bikes, including the Road King and Electra Glide.But for a look at the company's future, head for its vehicle and power-train plant in Kansas City. Opened in 1998, the 435,000-square-foot factory produces several of Harley's most popular bikes, including the Sportster and V-Rod.Earlier this year a motorcycle unlike any Harley has made in decades began coming off the line. Known as the Street, it is the company's first entirely new bike in more than a decade and the first U.S.-built small bike bearing the Harley name in nearly 50 years. With an expected retail price of $6,500 to $7,500, the Street is the most affordable bike Harley has brought to market under its name in decades and an unapologetic effort to bring young riders around the world into the company's two-wheeled fraternity.""This basically targets a whole new market of people who want to try a Harley-Davidson but don't have the money to try one of the bigger bikes with all the bells and whistles,"" said Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar.The Street, which will arrive in dealerships this spring, is a stripped-down bike built for urban environments -- a major departure Harley, known for heavy touring bikes built for the open highway. It is also proof, according to Chief Executive Officer Keith Wandell, that a company whose products have been dismissed as ""geezer glides"" has no plans to shamble off into the sunset along with the baby boomers who built the brand.""Street is really symbolic,"" Wandell said. ""It's the first new product we've brought to market under the Harley-Davidson badge that is intended to bring new riders -- and even younger riders -- into the Harley-Davidson family.""It also illustrates Wandell's commitment to transform the company into a leaner, more nimble manufacturer. The last time Harley introduced a new bike, in 2002, it spent big bucks -- it refuses to say how much -- building a new line in Kansas City dedicated to the motorcycle. This time, Harley did it on the cheap, incorporating its new bike into an existing line.The Street's introduction is not without risks. It puts Harley in direct competition with Japanese bike makers, which have strong brands of their own. The yen's current weakness against the dollar will also help the Japanese defend their small-displacement, sport-bike turf.Meanwhile, Harley faces a unique problem: convincing its core customers that the new bike does not undermine the brawny, muscular quality of the Harley brand. Company executives insist they aren't worried.""It's a Harley that just happens to be a little smaller,"" says Mark-Hans Richer, Harley's top marketing executive. The Street's exhaust, he noted, was specifically tweaked to make generate the distinctive Harley ""potato-potato-potato"" rumble.""We worked really hard on that,"" he said.The debut will also make it harder for investors to understand where profit margins on motorcycles will settle after years of restructuring under Wandell. Harley has acknowledged that the Street may pull buyers away from higher-margin entry-level heavyweight motorcycles in its line, like the Sportster. ""As that mix shifts, it could hurt gross margins -- at least temporarily,"" said Morningstar's Katz.Harley saves considerable cost by building the Street on the same line, and often at the same time, as its larger V-Rod.Changeover from V-Rod to Street production can take place on the fly, several times in a 24-hour period. The process could easily devolve into chaos, said Steve Wiggins, manager of the Kansas City plant, but factory workers quietly choreograph the changeover, swapping components and tools in and out and just in time.Workers on the line, who are briefed during a pre-shift huddle on the day's production schedule, ""don't see anything happen (during the changeover) except they look up, see we've switched to Streets, and the parts and tools they need are there."" Wiggins said.""So we do not lose any build time. … There's not a single skipped carrier or anything.""SMALL FLOPS  The last U.S.-made, Harley-badged small bike, the 1966 BTH Bobcat, was an underpowered flop, discontinued after a year. More recent efforts to break into the market with the Buell and MV Agusta brands also ended badly.The Street's stripped-down design and low price -- it costs just a bit more than some Vespa scooters -- reflect the need to find a new generation of buyers. The Street is the simplest motorcycle Harley has offered since it discontinued the Buell Blast, a bike ridiculed by Harley stalwarts as the ""Be-Last.""Neil Howe, a demographer who helps companies market to younger consumers, said Harley needs to show twenty- and thirtysomethings that the Street meets their transportation needs. That age group has a ""brutal pragmatism,"" he said.""It's one of their most impressive characteristics, the urge to simplify,"" he said.Harley expects to ship just 7,000 to 10,000 Streets in 2014 and has confined the rollout to half a dozen countries, including the United States, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Still, executives see the debut as a pivotal event. ""We don't come out with a new platform every day,"" Richer said.Doing nothing is not an option. Harley faces a growing number of challenges, including shrinking demand in the United States, its No. 1 market, for the big, expensive bikes it has made for years. And even as that market shrinks, new competitors, including the relaunched Indian brand from Polaris Industries Inc (PII.N), are moving into the space.Harley has problems overseas as well. Europe hasn't provided the boost the company needs to offset the slowdown at home. And sales in China have been disappointing since they began in 2006.""They've found it hard to break into China with a $20,000 bike,"" said Morningstar's Katz.If the Street -- water-cooled like the V-Rod, with either a 500cc and 750cc engine -- takes off, it could reestablish Harley-Davidson as a growth stock by increasing sales to members of the ""millennial"" generation worldwide.The Street will be Harley's first global bike, with models built in Kansas City for North America and at a plant in Bawal, India, for the rest of the world.It's also not clear that Europeans, who have until now been supplied by U.S. factories, will accept an Indian-made Harley, though company executives downplay those concerns.""The ‘made in America' cachet is certainly more real in the United States maybe than anywhere else in the world,"" Wandell said.It may be some time before investors will know whether the Street is a hit. Most of the bikes produced in 2014 won't be sold to consumers straightaway but will instead be used as training bikes in dealer-run motorcycle riding classes.Even if the Street's launch is a success, Katz said she doesn't see Harley's global shipments returning to their 2006 highs until 2019, in part because so many boomers are aging out of their motorcycle riding years.""You're going to have that massive user base that takes off their helmets and stops riding,"" she said.""So they are hoping that this smaller, lighter, less expensive bike caters to a much wider audience and moves volume through the channel. And then they're just crossing their fingers that Street buyers trade up as they get older and convert to heavy bike riders.""(Editing by David Greising and Douglas Royalty)",2014-04-07,HOG,"Mon Apr 7, 2014 | 11:57am EDT",Not your old man's Hog: Harley bets big on a small bike,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-harleydavidson-debut-idUSBREA3618P20140407?type=companyNews

10,"   By James B. Kelleher  Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) shares surged nearly 9 percent on Tuesday after the iconic U.S. motorcycle maker posted a better-`than-expected quarterly profit, lifted by strong international demand.The company's results were also lifted by its continued success in cutting production costs. Harley-Davidson said its gross margins grew a full percentage point year-over-year to 37.7 percent during the most recent quarter, a testament analysts said to the company's five-year restructuring under CEO Keith Wandell. The austerity drive concluded last year and pulled $300 million in annual costs out of its manufacturing operations.""These are obviously very good results,"" said Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar. ""All the work they've done in recent years at their facilities are bearing fruit."" Katz said she planned to update her fair-value estimate of the company's stock, which she currently pegs at $68.Harley-Davidson said it had shipped 80,682 motorcycles to its independent dealers and distributors worldwide during the quarter, in line with its expectations and up 7.3 percent from a year earlier.Sales jumped 20.5 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, 8.9 percent in Latin America and 8.2 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the company said. Sales were also up a modest 3 percent in the United States, where Harley-Davidson still sells the majority of its bikes, despite bitterly cold winter weather that gripped much of the country. During a conference call, executives said ""significant"" sales growth in warmer regions of the country, like California, helped offset weakness in colder regions. Sales in Canada fell 2.4 percent, the company said.The international sales growth is welcome news. Harley-Davidson has long known that its reliance on an overwhelmingly white, male and middle-aged consumer base would ultimately challenge sales in North America, where it still earns two-thirds of its revenue. That so-called ""baby boomer"" cohort is growing at a low-single-digit rate. So in recent years, the company has aggressively courted non-core customers, such as young adults, women, African-American and Hispanic riders, and riders in international markets, with a variety of new designs.This spring, the motorcycle maker began shipping a new line of lighter, more affordable motorcycles, the Street 500 and the Street 750, to a handful of markets, including Italy, Spain, Portugal, and India. The company has said it believes the new bikes can significantly grow its share of overseas markets.The Milwaukee-based company reported first-quarter net income of $265.9 million, or $1.21 a share, up from $224.1 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.08 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales rose 10.2 percent to $1.73 billion, the company said.In early afternoon trading, Harley-Davidson shares were up 8 percent at $72.98 after earlier trading as high as $73.50.(Reporting by James B.

""Looking at the way fuel consumption is going, it's a good move."" Sharma said he wouldn't trade in his Harley Sportster SuperLow for an electric bike. But might buy one as a second vehicle - provided it looked like a cruiser.Other companies have electric motorcycles in production or in the planning stage. But none have created the buzz of the new Harley, which is not yet in dealerships.Harley-Davidson started touring the prototype around U.S. dealerships this week, offering rides to potential customers to gather feedback before deciding on production plans. The tour is scheduled to move to Europe and Canada next year.One task is to convince riders about the range of the bike's lithium-ion battery. Will they still be able to ride into the desert sunset without getting stranded? ""We rode on a highway on Thursday and almost ran out of gas,"" said Barokas, who's road trip included a stretch of road  known as 'America's loneliest highway'.""When we pulled into a small town, a shopkeeper brought up the electric Harley and said 'what are you going to do when you're on a road like this, stop and plug the bike into a cow?'""Other riders see potential for the bike, even if its range is limited.""The electric bike (is) geared more for people that are going to be urban and commuting and having some fun at the same time,"" said John Kerecz, a 52-year-old Harley enthusiast in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.Kerecz, whose 1984 Iron Head is the oldest of his three Harleys, said he would consider buying the electric motorcycle as a ""retirement toy"".Harley-Davidson has not disclosed a price for the bike, but Kerecz said he would be willing to pay as much as $16,000.The cost of current models range from $8,700 to $39,000, according to the company's website.

(on.fb.me/1ln8EV9)Rajesh Sharma, a 31-year-old Harley enthusiast in Bangalore, India, liked the idea, even though no plans have been announced to sell the bike in India - or anywhere else, for that matter. ""If you're giving me the same look, the same performance, why won't I switch to it?"" asked the architect, a member of the Bangalore Harley Owners Group. ""Looking at the way fuel consumption is going, it's a good move.""Sharma said he wouldn't trade in his Harley Sportster SuperLow for an electric bike. But might buy one as a second vehicle - provided it looked like a cruiser.Other companies have electric motorcycles in production or in the planning stage. But none have created the buzz of the new Harley, which is not yet in dealerships.Harley-Davidson started touring the prototype around U.S. dealerships this week, offering rides to potential customers to gather feedback before deciding on production plans. The tour is scheduled to move to Europe and Canada next year. One task is to convince riders about the range of the bike's lithium-ion battery. Will they still be able to ride into the desert sunset without getting stranded?""We rode on a highway on Thursday and almost ran out of gas,"" said Barokas, who's road trip included a stretch of road  known as 'America's loneliest highway'.""When we pulled into a small town, a shopkeeper brought up the electric Harley and said 'what are you going to do when you're on a road like this, stop and plug the bike into a cow?'""Other riders see potential for the bike, even if its range is limited.""The electric bike (is) geared more for people that are going to be urban and commuting and having some fun at the same time,"" said John Kerecz, a 52-year-old Harley enthusiast in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.Kerecz, whose 1984 Iron Head is the oldest of his three Harleys, said he would consider buying the electric motorcycle as a ""retirement toy"".Harley-Davidson has not disclosed a price for the bike, but Kerecz said he would be willing to pay as much as $16,000.The cost of current models range from $8,700 to $39,000, according to the company's website.

18,"   By James B. Kelleher  The second quarter is typically peak selling season for Harley-Davidson Inc as warmer weather in North America, the motorcycle maker’s No. 1 market, lures riders back into dealer showrooms.But there is mounting evidence Harley's retail sales came in on the light side in the three months ended June 30, raising the possibility it will have disappointing news for shareholders when it reports results next week.The issue already appears to be weighing on Harley's shares. While the S&P 500 is up nearly 7 percent year-to-date, the stock is down 4.6 percent. Much of the sell-off occurred in the past month as dealer surveys by Wall Street analysts have found that retail sales were “not quite as robust as we had initially hoped,” says William Blair & Co analyst Sharon Zackfia.Going into the quarter, analysts like Tim Conder at Well Fargo Securities had expected that pent-up demand after the long, bitter winter would grow Harley-Davidson’s retail sales by double-digits. Also expected to rev up rider interest this season: Harley-Davidson’s introduction of the Street, its first entirely new motorcycle in more than a decade and its first Harley-badged foray into the lightweight market since the 1970s. But last week, after talking to dealers, Conder slashed his estimate for U.S. retail growth, from up 11 percent to up 6.3 percent. Harley-Davidson was not the only motorcycle manufacturer to experience disappointing customer traffic during the quarter. Conder says rival Polaris Industries Inc, was ""challenged"" by the retail market in the second quarter too.But Harley-Davidson's woes may help explain its decision in mid-June to deliver with great fanfare, a handful of electric-powered demonstration bikes to select dealers, a move that seemed odd given its admission that it had no plan to manufacture or sell the bikes. The PR blitz struck some as gimmick designed to drive customers into showrooms and suggested the current lineup, Street included, was coming up short.Robin Farley, an analyst at UBS Investment Research, says the skeptics were right. Her retail checks found few dealers received Streets to sell during the second quarter, despite a pledge they would arrive by then, because of what Harley-Davidson called unspecified ""delivery issues.""  “Most (Street) shipments for retail sales have been pushed back from the May timeframe dealers had originally expected,” Farley said. Harley-Davidson declined to comment on Farley’s findings or talk about second-quarter sales or Street deliveries.But spokesman Bob Klein says the electric bike tour was in the planning stages for months because the task of hand-fabricating the fleet of demo bikes was complex and time-consuming.""Bottom line, we didn’t introduce an electric Harley to drive traffic (into showrooms),"" Klein says. ""If there were a need to do so, there are lots of less complicated ways to achieve that."" (Reporting by James B.

19,"   By James B. Kelleher  Harley-Davidson Inc cut its full-year forecast for motorcycle shipments on Tuesday, citing weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales and a delay in getting its newest bike into dealer showrooms.The new outlook, which came as the Milwaukee-based company reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings, sent Harley-Davidson shares down nearly 6 percent to $63.33 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.Harley said it now expected to ship between 270,000 and 275,000 bikes to its worldwide network of independent dealers in 2014, down from a previous forecast of 279,000 to 284,000.The low end of the new range translates into year-over-year worldwide shipment growth of just 3.5 percent.Harley said its second-quarter sales had suffered from prolonged poor weather across parts of the United States and soft demand for its low-priced Sportster motorcycles. The company attributed the weakness in Sportster sales to the anticipated introduction of the Street platform, its first all-new bike in more than a decade and its first Harley-badged foray into the lightweight market since the 1970s.But those new bikes, which are even cheaper than Sportsters and were supposed to begin appearing in dealer showrooms in May, did not show up until late June, Harley said. The company blamed the delay on problems with foreign component makers whose parts failed to get to the company's Kansas City, Missouri, plant on time.""This is the first time we're manufacturing product internationally, and with that, a majority of the supply chain is international,"" Chief Financial Officer John Olin told investors during a conference call. ""And not only is it a much longer supply chain, but it's with a lot of new suppliers ... We're going through a learning curve.""    Harley said its quarterly profit rose to $354.2 million, or $1.62 a share, from $271.7 million, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.46 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Although the company maintained its outlook for operating margins, Morningstar Jaime Katz said its admission that the bargain-priced Street was affecting Sportster sales suggested pressure in the coming quarters.   Harley said its worldwide network of independent dealers had sold 90,218 new motorcycles in the second quarter, virtually unchanged from a year earlier. Sales by U.S. dealers dipped to 58,225 motorcycles from 58,241. The headwinds Harley-Davidson faced during the quarter did not appear to affect rival motorcycle maker Polaris Industries Inc, which also reported higher earnings on Tuesday but raised its full-year forecast.The Minneapolis-based company, whose brands include Indian and Victory, said its worldwide bike sales jumped 107 percent to $103.1 million in the second quarter.

20,"   By James B. Kelleher | July 22  July 22 U.S. motorcycle maker Harley Davidson Inc came late to the offshoring game.But now that the company has moved some production overseas and built up a roster of foreign suppliers, it is discovering why so many pioneers of the strategy are scrambling to relocate back home.Far-flung supply chains required by overseas sourcing can create all kinds of unforeseen inventory expenses, quality control problems and unanticipated delays, as the Boston Consulting Group and other analysts have pointed out.For Harley-Davidson, they turned a happy debut into a near-debacle, as its second-quarter earnings released on Tuesday showed.Until this year, all Harley-badged motorcycles were built in the United States using parts that were almost exclusively sourced domestically.That changed earlier this year with the introduction of the Street, the Milwaukee-based company's first new motorcycle platform in more than a decade and its first Harley-badged lightweight bike since the 1970s. Street motorbikes destined for the North American market would be built at the company's Kansas City, Missouri plant. But to keep prices low, Harley-Davidson said the U.S.-built bikes would feature more foreign-made content and components than any motorcycle in the company's history.Streets bound for the rest of the world, meanwhile, would be built in India.Harley-Davidson hoped to begin shipping Streets to its U.S. dealers this spring. But on Tuesday, it admitted the launch had not gone as planned. Instead of showing up in showrooms in large numbers in May, the Streets only began to trickle in at the end of June. The company blamed foreign component makers whose parts failed to get to the Kansas City plant on time.Bob Klein, a spokesman for Harley-Davidson, said the problems forced the company to ""slow-walk"" the startup of Street production. He said the issues have been addressed, that the company is ""catching up on parts deliveries to the U.S."" and that Harley-Davidson's ""ability to supply the U.S. dealer network will improve"" later in the year.Ironically, Harley-Davidson's decision to move production overseas comes as many other U.S. manufacturers are doing the opposite. Analysts at BCG, which first flagged the reshoring trend in 2011, say a number of factors, including rising overseas wages, are driving the return of manufacturing to the United States.But BCG says a key factor is concern about ""supply chain risks"" and ""headaches associated with operating a supply chain extending halfway around the world.""It is a lesson Harley-Davidson is learning.""This is the first time we're manufacturing product internationally, and with that, a majority of the supply chain is international,"" Chief Financial Officer John Olin told investors during a conference call.""And not only is it a much longer supply chain, but it's with a lot of new suppliers ....

25,"  * Big motorbike sales in several countries outstrip broader market* Ducati, Kawasaki, KTM, Harley-Davidson cart out bigger models* Southeast Asia is No.3 motorbike market after China, IndiaBy Yantoultra NguiKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 6 Roads in Southeast Asia have been getting a little louder lately as motorcycle makers, an aspiring middle class and easy bank credit come together to breed a new genus of motorcyclists - the big-bike rider.Traffic in urban centres such as Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City has long been characterised by swarms of small motorbikes and scooters. Honda Motor and Yamaha Motor , the world's biggest motorbike makers, have dominated this sprawling regional market.The landscape is slowly shifting as the Southeast Asian market, the world's third-largest after China and India, undergoes a structural change. In Malaysia and Vietnam, motorbikes with bigger engine capacities are outselling their smaller cousins.Italy's Ducati Motor Holding, Japan's Kawasaki and Austria's KTM are among motorbike makers looking to build a new axis of growth in this market of 600 million people as orders for larger bikes in first-world countries slow.They are wooing not just small-bike owners graduating to larger models. They are also chasing riders who already own a four-door subcompact sedan but have no qualms about taking on an additional financial commitment.Harley-Davidson plans to roll out a new entry-level motorcycle, the Street 750, in Southeast Asia early next year. The 749cc model has been a hit in India, with sales accounting for 60 percent of the company's local revenue two months after its launch in February. The bike costs 410,000 rupees ($6,663).""We are optimistic about the Southeast Asian premium leisure motorcycle market,"" Marc McAllister, vice president and managing director of Harley-Davidson Asia-Pacific, told Reuters. ""The motorcycle is perfectly suited to the region's infrastructure and fast-growing urban cities filled with a younger generation of riders who want an accessible premium ride.""The demand for premium bikes is in step with rising gross national income (GNI) in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines - vast countries held together by miles and miles of high-speed motorways, urban roads and rural byways.In Vietnam, GNI per capita is approaching the key $2,000 level, data from the World Bank shows. Crossing that threshold marks the first phase of a shift in a population's spending from subsistence to moderate consumption, U.S.-based private equity and investment consulting firm TorreyCove Capital Partners said in a report in 2013.Indonesia and the Philippines both breached the $3,000 level in 2012, while in Malaysia and Thailand, GNI per capita stood at $10,400 and $5,370, respectively, last year, according to the World Bank data. In Vietnam, sales of larger models are outpacing the broader market, according to Harley-Davidson and Ducati. In Malaysia, sales of bikes with capacities of 250cc and above surged 49 percent last year, while the overall market was almost flat, local industry association data shows.In Indonesia, the region's largest motorcycle market, bikes with similarly bigger capacities comprised 13 percent of total sales in 2013, up from 11 percent in 2012.""We also see that not only bigger and heavier bikes will have a better volume, but also cross-touring motorcycles like BMW and Triumph will have a better opportunity here,"" said Tony Tardjo, head of consumer lending of Indonesia's Bank CIMB Niaga.""This kind of motorcycle offers the ability for on and off-road, which is suitable for Indonesian road infrastructure,"" he said.EXTRA COMMITMENTS  With a monthly salary of 4,000 ringgit ($1,229), Hor Chee Fung, 28, is one of the region's new middle class earners, working hard to pay off monthly commitments from phone bills to car loans. But that didn't stop him from taking another loan to buy a larger and more powerful motorcycle.""I don't mind taking that extra commitment to join my fellow riding friends,"" said Hor, a Kuala Lumpur-based financial analyst with International Business Machines Corp.Hor is moving from a moped to a 250cc sports motorbike - the Kawasaki Ninja 250R. He plans to eventually upgrade to a Harley-Davidson or Ducati entry-level model when he gets a pay rise and promotion.An entry-level Ducati, such as the Monster 795 assembled in Thailand, costs 59,900 ringgit in Malaysia, 18 percent cheaper than an entry-level Toyota Vios car. A Kawasaki Ninja 250R costs less, at 22,590 ringgit.""These superbikes are highly affordable from 60,000 ringgit to the dream machines costing 500,000 ringgit and above,"" said Khairul Kamarudin, business development director at Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, a unit of BIMB Holdings Bhd.""As there are presently not many financial institutions providing superbike financing, we view this under-served community as an exciting prospect,"" he said. ""We are in this superbike financing for the long haul."" A consumer banking manager from a Kuala Lumpur-based bank was more cautious. He said the superbike market is still small compared with car financing, though he agreed it is growing.""I would say a lot of it is impulse buying,"" he said, adding that interest rates are high, as much as 10 percent if the client chooses zero downpayment.Market research firm Nielsen estimates that middle class earners in Southeast Asia, or those with disposal incomes of as much as $3,000 a month, will more than double to 400 million by 2020.CLOSE TO YOU To be closer to this new growth segment, KTM, Europe's second-largest motorcycle maker, last year opened its first assembly plant outside Austria in the northern Malaysian state of Kedah. That came two years after Ducati, a unit of Audi AG , set up a factory in Thailand.""We notice in Southeast Asia a clear demand for bigger engine capacities. Even premium high-end models like our 1290 Super Duke R show potential. But clearly the main business is done with products between 200 and 400cc,"" Thomas Kuttruf, PR manager at KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH, told Reuters.Apart from being closer to their customers, it also makes more economic sense for manufacturers to produce in Southeast Asia.A regional free trade pact has meant lower import tariffs in the single digits. Bikes and components imported from outside the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are slapped with duties of up to 30 percent, making them more expensive.""The choice of the factory in Thailand, the first for us outside of Italy, was an important step... We are able to deliver Ducati motorcycles throughout Asia taking advantage of the ASEAN duty agreement,"" Pierfrancesco Scalzo, general manager of sales and marketing at Ducati Asia, told Reuters.For now, market leaders Honda and Yamaha remain unfazed by the entry of other motorbike makers.Like Ducati, KTM and Kawasaki, a unit of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, Honda is starting to offer bigger bikes, producing the CB500 and CB650 series in Thailand.""We are not competing with the other manufacturers,"" Yuka Abe, a Tokyo-based Honda spokeswoman told Reuters. ""But we do this because in Asia, demand for bigger models is increasing while in developed countries, the demand for the same is decreasing.""Yamaha is not about to be left behind. The world's second-largest motorcycle maker has recently started producing a new 250cc sports motorcycle in Indonesia - the R25 - and is looking to launch the model worldwide soon.

26,"   By James B. Kelleher  Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) reported stronger-than-expected quarterly financial results on Tuesday, lifted by increased motorcycle sales in key markets, including the United States.Harley's shares, which were down more than 15 percent year- to-date ahead of the report, surged more than 8 percent in early trading in New York, though later gave up some of those gains.From the outside, the third quarter appeared to be another tough one for the iconic motorcycle maker, with several recalls tarnishing the roll-out of the ""Street,"" its first entirely new bike in more than a decade and its first Harley-badged lightweight motorcycle since the 1970s.Meanwhile upstart competitors, including Polaris Industries Inc, (PII.N), continued to make inroads into Harley’s big-bike market with revived brands like Indian, while long-time rivals, including Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T), introduced well-received starter bikes to compete with the Street.But appearances were deceiving. Worldwide, the company's network of independent dealers sold 73,217 new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the third quarter, up from 70,517 during the same period last year. That helped Harley report a third-quarter profit of $150.1 million, or 69 cents a share. While that was down from the $162.7 million, or 73 cents a share, it reported a year ago, it was well above the 59 cents a share analysts expected, according to Reuters estimates.Retail sales at dealers in the United States, where Harley sells two-thirds of all its bikes, rose 3.4 percent during the quarter.Harley also stood by its full-year shipment guidance, a move Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said reassured investors spooked by the company's troubles even earlier this year, when the company said unusually frigid weather during the second quarter, its key selling season in the United States, weighed on sales there. ""Standing by the guidance in the wake of a really weak second quarter allayed concerns that the bad weather explanation was just an excuse and that there was a deeper problem with the business fundamentals or with the products,"" Katz said.The company, which rose to prominence thanks to its popularity with the Baby Boomer demographic in the United States, is working hard to appeal to new riders as its core customer group ages.  It has had some success in developing new products to appeal to younger and more diverse consumers. But the Street suffered an ill-starred debut this spring despite a very limited roll-out because of difficulties involving suppliers. The company was also forced to recall 130,000 bikes, including more than 1,000 of the Streets. Harley said the recalls costs it about $14 million during the quarter.Harley shares were last up 6.2 percent in mid-morning trading at $62 after earlier trading as high as $63.41.

Retail sales at dealers in the United States, where Harley sells two-thirds of all its bikes, rose 3.4 percent during the quarter.Harley also stood by its full-year shipment guidance, a move Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said reassured investors spooked by the company's troubles even earlier this year, when the company said unusually frigid weather during the second quarter, its key selling season in the United States, weighed on sales there.""Standing by the guidance in the wake of a really weak second quarter allayed concerns that the bad weather explanation was just an excuse and that there was a deeper problem with the business fundamentals or with the products,"" Katz said. The company, which rose to prominence thanks to its popularity with the Baby Boomer demographic in the United States, is working hard to appeal to new riders as its core customer group ages.It has had some success in developing new products to appeal to younger and more diverse consumers. But the Street suffered an ill-starred debut this spring despite a very limited roll-out because of difficulties involving suppliers.The company was also forced to recall 130,000 bikes, including more than 1,000 of the Streets. Harley said the recalls costs it about $14 million during the quarter.Harley shares were last up 6.2 percent in mid-morning trading at $62 after earlier trading as high as $63.41.

29,"   By Aman Shah | MUMBAI  MUMBAI Oct 30 Harley-Davidson Inc, battling upstart competitors in its traditional markets, says it is betting on India's young and affluent urbanites to help establish a ""leisure riding"" culture there and boost sales of its first new bike in over a decade.With Lynyrd Skynyrd and Deep Purple playing in the background, the iconic United States motorcycle company on Thursday launched three new bikes in India, a country more associated with pot holes and traffic snarl-ups than open roads.""I think there's a lot of people (in India) who are enthusiastic, who are riders at heart, and are now seeing an opportunity to enter into this lifestyle. It is much more accessible,"" India Managing Director Anoop Prakash told Reuters on the sidelines.The bikes launched included the company's costliest offering in India to date, a limited edition CVO Limited, priced at 4.9 million rupees (almost $80,000). That is the equivalent of a BMW 5 Series sedan or almost seven decades of pay for many families in country where average income is closer to $1,200 a year. But Prakash, a former U.S. Marine, said he was confident the brand -- which Harley nourishes in India with rock music festivals and bike rallies -- would prove attractive to aspirational young Indians, for whom a motorcycle is more than simply the cheapest form of motorised transport.India is the world's largest motorcycle market after China, but the roads are packed with cheaper models. Makers of high-end motorcycles, from Ducati to Yamaha Motor, are only just breaking into the market. ""We are reaching out to a lot of younger riders,"" Prakash said.Harley Davidson has suffered recalls that tarnished the roll-out of the ""Street,"" its first entirely new bike in more than a decade and its first Harley-badged lightweight motorcycle since the 1970s. But in India, its stripped-down 'Street' series launched earlier this year at $7,000 has helped it more than double sales in the six months through September, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.""We're looking at the establishment of a long-term leisure riding culture and doing it the Harley-Davidson way,"" he said.Harley, which entered India five years ago, has since set up its own assembly line in the country.

31,"  Third-ranked Virginia has been thriving with a stingy defense and seeks its 12th consecutive victory when it hosts Davidson on Tuesday. The Cavaliers have posted the top two defensive outings in program history, holding Rutgers to 26 points on Nov. 29 and Harvard to 27 on Dec. 21. “We love to see it,” forward Evan Nolte said in a press conference. “We take so much pride in our defense, at the end of the games we’ll say, ‘Don’t let them get ‘x’ number of points.’”The Cavaliers allow 46.2 points per game and hold opponents to 31 percent shooting from the field, including setting a school record by limiting Harvard to 16 percent.

38,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO When iconic motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc warned on Tuesday that discounting from foreign rivals would dent its profits, the message resonated beyond the motorcycle business.From cars to construction equipment, the impact of the strong dollar is a big problem for U.S. companies selling overseas. But the U.S. dollar's recent surge to multiyear highs against major currencies, such as the euro and yen, has also become a challenge to their efforts to protect market share on home turf.Harley's U.S. market share slipped nearly five percentage points in the first quarter to 51.3 percent as competitors offered discounts of up to $3,000 per bike and slashed suggested retail prices by up to 25 percent.Honda Motor Co Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp both currently offer $1,000 cash back on selected models. Suzuki has cut the suggested retail price on 13 models and Honda is offering low-interest financing.Harley says it will not compete on price to protect its brand, a declaration welcomed by industry analysts.""They (Harley) are taking a reasonable long-term view of the market,"" said Michael Millman, founder of Millman Research Associates in New Jersey. ""They want to maintain their pricing and their image and will have to take some of the competitive knocks that go with that.""AUTOS, HEAVY EQUIPMENT HIT  Harley-Davidson is not alone in feeling pricing pressures from the dollar. Many companies including Caterpillar Inc and U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Chrysler also face tougher competition as result.Unlike Harley, Caterpillar benefits from the natural hedge of having much of its production overseas, said Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten. The Peoria, Illinois-based construction equipment maker does face ""stiff face-to-face competition"" from Japanese rival Komatsu Ltd when bidding on projects, he said. Other market factors face Caterpillar besides the dollar. While the U.S. construction market is solid, Caterpillar's energy- and commodity-related businesses have ""gone off the cliff"" as oil and commodity prices have fallen, Lustgarten said.But U.S. automakers face a different challenge. Many ""foreign"" brand vehicles are now built in the United States of parts sourced from North American factories, said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson. Rather than competing on car price tags, automakers like Toyota Motor Corp  are instead likely to focus on adding more frills and gadgets to vehicles without raising prices.This could put pressure on suppliers like Delphi Automotive that produce added options like advanced driver assistance programs or infotainment, rather than GM, Ford or Chrysler directly, Johnson said.To ride out the currency turmoil, manufacturers such as Harley, with production mostly in the United States, will have to weigh tough choices between cutting prices to spur demand, or cutting production to avoid getting stuck with too much inventory.Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar, said thanks to more flexible just-in-time manufacturing, Harley can quickly adjust production up or down. The company signaled it expects shipments to drop as much as 10 percent in the second quarter. If the dollar remains strong, she will be watching to see if the motorcycle maker cuts its shipment forecast when it next reports earnings in July, as it did on Tuesday.At some point, Harley could face a tough choice about what to do with its existing floor models if it cannot sell them later in the year, she added, noting that is some way off.The problem with discounts is that customers come to expect them, said S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Efraim Levy.""If you cut prices, people expect discounts hold out for a better deal,"" he said.Foreign motorcycle makers are also taking a gamble by cutting retail prices that could hurt them if the dollar weakens, Levy added.""Reinstating prices is harder than raising prices again,"" he said. ""Then you run the risk of consumers getting sticker shock.""

Many companies including Caterpillar Inc  and U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Chrysler  also face tougher competition as result.Unlike Harley, Caterpillar benefits from the natural hedge of having much of its production overseas, said Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten.The Peoria, Illinois-based construction equipment maker does face ""stiff face-to-face competition"" from Japanese rival Komatsu Ltd when bidding on projects, he said.Other market factors face Caterpillar besides the dollar. While the U.S. construction market is solid, Caterpillar's energy- and commodity-related businesses have ""gone off the cliff"" as oil and commodity prices have fallen, Lustgarten said. But U.S. automakers face a different challenge. Many ""foreign"" brand vehicles are now built in the United States of parts sourced from North American factories, said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson.Rather than competing on car price tags, automakers like Toyota Motor Corp  are instead likely to focus on adding more frills and gadgets to vehicles without raising prices.This could put pressure on suppliers like Delphi Automotive  that produce added options like advanced driver assistance programs or infotainment, rather than GM, Ford or Chrysler directly, Johnson said.To ride out the currency turmoil, manufacturers such as Harley, with production mostly in the United States, will have to weigh tough choices between cutting prices to spur demand, or cutting production to avoid getting stuck with too much inventory. Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar, said thanks to more flexible just-in-time manufacturing, Harley can quickly adjust production up or down. The company signaled it expects shipments to drop as much as 10 percent in the second quarter.If the dollar remains strong, she will be watching to see if the motorcycle maker cuts its shipment forecast when it next reports earnings in July, as it did on Tuesday.At some point, Harley could face a tough choice about what to do with its existing floor models if it cannot sell them later in the year, she added, noting that is some way off.The problem with discounts is that customers come to expect them, said S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Efraim Levy.""If you cut prices, people expect discounts hold out for a better deal,"" he said.Foreign motorcycle makers are also taking a gamble by cutting retail prices that could hurt them if the dollar weakens, Levy added.""Reinstating prices is harder than raising prices again,"" he said. ""Then you run the risk of consumers getting sticker shock.""

40,"  CHICAGO A strong U.S. dollar allowed Harley-Davidson Inc's (HOG.N) foreign competitors to aggressively undercut its prices in the first quarter, the iconic motorcycle maker said on Tuesday, hurting sales and prompting it to lower 2015 shipment forecasts.The news sent the company's shares down more than 9 percent in early trading. Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson said the discounting had primarily affected sales in the United States, where it does most of its business. Executives said on a conference call that the company's U.S. market share had slipped close to 5 percentage points to 51.3 percent in the quarter as competitors offered discounts of up to $3,000 per bike and slashed their suggested retail prices by up to 25 percent.Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) and Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T)  both currently offer $1,000 cash-backs on selected models. Suzuki has cut the suggested retail price on 13 models and Honda is offering low financing.Discounts like these have been ""enabled by a dramatic shift in world currencies"", Chief Financial Officer John Olin said on the call with analysts. ""This is going to continue for some time as they [competitors] work through what we consider to be excessive inventory.""""We are not going to discount,"" Olin told analysts.   The company said that the second quarter will be its weakest of the year as the full impact of the strong dollar hits home.Harley-Davidson posted a quarterly net profit of $269.9 million, or $1.27 per share, for the first quarter, up 1.5 percent from $265.9 million, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.Analysts had expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.25. Revenue dipped to $1.67 billion from $1.73 billion a year earlier. That came in above analysts' expectations of $1.58 billion.Harley-Davidson's worldwide retail sales fell 1.1 percent to 56,661 motorcycles from 57,415 in the first quarter of 2014. Sales in its key U.S. market fell 0.7 percent to 35,488 from 35,730. Harley-Davidson said it now expects motorcycle shipments to rise by about 2 percent to 4 percent in 2015, down from its previous forecast of about 4 percent to 6 percent growth.In the second quarter, the company expects to ship between 83,000 to 88,000 motorcycles, down from 92,217 shipped in the same quarter in 2014. In early trading, Harley-Davidson shares were down 9.3 percent at $56.

43,"  CHICAGO, April 21 Harley-Davidson Inc on Tuesday posted a higher quarterly net profit, as a lower tax rate helped offset lower sales and the impact of a strong U.S. dollar.The Milwaukee-based company reported net income of $269.9 million or $1.27 per share in the first quarter, up 1.5 percent from $265.9 million or $1.21 per share a year earlier.  Analysts had expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.25.

44,"  (Repeats story from Tuesday with no changes to headline or text)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, April 21 When iconic motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc warned on Tuesday that discounting from foreign rivals would dent its profits, the message resonated beyond the motorcycle business.From cars to construction equipment, the impact of the strong dollar is a big problem for U.S. companies selling overseas. But the U.S. dollar's recent surge to multiyear highs against major currencies, such as the euro and yen, has also become a challenge to their efforts to protect market share on home turf.Harley's U.S. market share slipped nearly five percentage points in the first quarter to 51.3 percent as competitors offered discounts of up to $3,000 per bike and slashed suggested retail prices by up to 25 percent.Honda Motor Co Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp  both currently offer $1,000 cash back on selected models. Suzuki has cut the suggested retail price on 13 models and Honda is offering low-interest financing.Harley says it will not compete on price to protect its brand, a declaration welcomed by industry analysts.""They (Harley) are taking a reasonable long-term view of the market,"" said Michael Millman, founder of Millman Research Associates in New Jersey. ""They want to maintain their pricing and their image and will have to take some of the competitive knocks that go with that."" AUTOS, HEAVY EQUIPMENT HIT Harley-Davidson is not alone in feeling pricing pressures from the dollar. Many companies including Caterpillar Inc  and U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Chrysler  also face tougher competition as result.Unlike Harley, Caterpillar benefits from the natural hedge of having much of its production overseas, said Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten.The Peoria, Illinois-based construction equipment maker does face ""stiff face-to-face competition"" from Japanese rival Komatsu Ltd when bidding on projects, he said. Other market factors face Caterpillar besides the dollar. While the U.S. construction market is solid, Caterpillar's energy- and commodity-related businesses have ""gone off the cliff"" as oil and commodity prices have fallen, Lustgarten said.But U.S. automakers face a different challenge. Many ""foreign"" brand vehicles are now built in the United States of parts sourced from North American factories, said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson.Rather than competing on car price tags, automakers like Toyota Motor Corp  are instead likely to focus on adding more frills and gadgets to vehicles without raising prices.This could put pressure on suppliers like Delphi Automotive  that produce added options like advanced driver assistance programs or infotainment, rather than GM, Ford or Chrysler directly, Johnson said. To ride out the currency turmoil, manufacturers such as Harley, with production mostly in the United States, will have to weigh tough choices between cutting prices to spur demand, or cutting production to avoid getting stuck with too much inventory.Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar, said thanks to more flexible just-in-time manufacturing, Harley can quickly adjust production up or down. The company signaled it expects shipments to drop as much as 10 percent in the second quarter.If the dollar remains strong, she will be watching to see if the motorcycle maker cuts its shipment forecast when it next reports earnings in July, as it did on Tuesday.At some point, Harley could face a tough choice about what to do with its existing floor models if it cannot sell them later in the year, she added, noting that is some way off.The problem with discounts is that customers come to expect them, said S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Efraim Levy.""If you cut prices, people expect discounts hold out for a better deal,"" he said.Foreign motorcycle makers are also taking a gamble by cutting retail prices that could hurt them if the dollar weakens, Levy added.""Reinstating prices is harder than raising prices again,"" he said. ""Then you run the risk of consumers getting sticker shock.""

45,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A U.S. appeals court on Thursday tossed out a former Harley-Davidson Inc employee's lawsuit over her exposure to chemicals in paint used on the company's iconic motorcycles, rejecting her claim that an appeals court ruling handed down shortly after her suit was dismissed gave it new life. A unanimous three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Michelle Ideker, who said she developed non-Hodgkins lymphoma from exposure to benzene, was barred by collateral estoppel from trying to resurrect her suit after a change in Missouri law.

46,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings affirmed the long-term Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG) and its Harley-Davidson Financial  Services, Inc. (HDFS) subsidiary at 'A'. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the  senior unsecured ratings of HDFS and Harley-Davidson Funding Corp. (HDFC) at  'A', and Fitch has affirmed HDFS' short-term IDR and commercial paper ratings at  'F1'. The Rating Outlook for HOG and HDFS is Stable. See the full list of rating  actions at the end of this press release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOG The affirmation of the ratings of HOG and HDFS follows the motorcycle  manufacturer's announced plan to issue $750 million in debt at the motor company  in the third quarter of 2015 (3Q15) to fund share buybacks. Although the  recapitalization plan represents a significant change from Fitch's prior  expectation that the motor company would remain debt free over the long term,  the motor company's leverage will be low following the issuance and Fitch  expects it to remain consistent with the 'A' IDR. However, headroom within the  rating will be diminished, increasing the potential for a downgrade in a severe  market downturn. Aside from the recapitalization plan, Fitch expects many of the company's  fundamental credit qualities to remain intact, despite foreign exchange-related  pressures that have recently affected the company's sales. HOG continues to lead  the U.S. heavyweight motorcycle segment, with a substantial lead over its  nearest competitors, and its credit profile is still supported by strong  liquidity, high margins and well-funded pension plans. Fitch views the planned  third-quarter issuance as a one-time event, as the company is not likely to  issue any further motor company debt over the long term. The substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past several quarters  has negatively affected HOG's business. The vast majority of the company's  motorcycles are built in the U.S., but with more than one-third of its sales  generated outside the U.S., there has been an increasing mismatch between the  company's U.S. dollar-based cost structure and the revenue derived from its  foreign currency-denominated non-U.S. sales. Adding to the pressure, many of  HOG's competitors in the U.S., mostly Japanese and European manufacturers who  export motorcycles to the U.S. from overseas factories, have taken advantage of  the strong U.S. dollar by drastically cutting prices, some by as much as $3,000  off the manufacturer's suggested retail price. HOG has responded to the heightened competition in the U.S. with an increase in  subvented financing offers, increased advertising and stepped-up customer  outreach activities. Outside the U.S., the company has instituted modest price  increases in certain markets to offset a portion of the foreign exchange effect.  The company also has some natural hedges related to foreign-sourced components,  and it has hedged a substantial portion of its currency exposure. With lower  sales projected, HOG has reduced its planned motorcycle production in 2015 by  6,000 units or roughly 2% from its previous guidance. The company noted in April  2015 that if foreign exchange rates stayed at the levels seen at that time, its  full-year 2015 revenue would be negatively affected by 4.25%, with about half of  that flowing through to the company's gross profit.  Despite the recent pressures, HOG's fundamental business position and credit  profile remain relatively strong. The company's share of the U.S. heavyweight  motorcycle market remains above 50% despite some share erosion due to the  heightened price competition, and it continues to have the top market share in  each of its targeted outreach customer demographic segments. In addition, the  company's flexible manufacturing process, the result of its multiyear  restructuring program that was largely completed in 2014, has helped to support  HOG's profitability in the face of lower sales and foreign exchange pressure.  Based on Fitch's calculations, HOG's EBITDA margin in the 12 months ended March  29, 2015, was 22.1%, and although it is likely to decline for the full-year  2015, Fitch expects it to remain at least in the high teens, which is still  strong for the sector. Fitch also expects free cash flow (FCF) to remain  relatively strong, with FCF margins in the high-single-digit range. Fitch expects other elements of the motor company's credit profile to remain  solid despite the expected increase in debt and heavy share repurchase activity.  Fitch estimates EBITDA (debt/Fitch-calculated EBITDA) leverage will rise to  about 0.7x following the issuance, up from zero currently but still relatively  low by industry standards. Fitch expects funds from operations (FFO) adjusted  leverage to rise to about 0.9x from 0.1x today. Based on the motor company's  performance in the last downturn, Fitch expects leverage would remain at or  below 1.0x at the cyclical trough, assuming no further debt issuance. Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong, as the company has not wavered from  its strategy of maintaining a sufficient amount of liquidity (cash and revolver  capacity) to meet its consolidated liquidity needs on a rolling 12-month basis  (including HDFS). As noted above, Fitch expects FCF to remain relatively strong  despite an increase in capital spending and common dividends (although the  latter will decline as a result of the increased share repurchases.) The  midpoint of the company's 2015 capital spending guidance is $250 million, up  from actual capital spending of $224 million in 2014, and in February 2015, HOG  raised its dividend per share by about 13%. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HDFS HDFS' ratings reflect its close operating relationship and support agreement  with HOG, under which the parent must maintain HDFS' fixed-charge coverage at  1.25x and its minimum net worth at $40 million. The ratings of HDFS and HOG are  linked, as Fitch believes that the finance company is a core subsidiary of the  parent as demonstrated by the explicit and implicit level of support between the  two entities. Further, despite the increase in leverage at HOG, Fitch believes  the parent still has sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to support  HDFS if required under the terms of the support agreement. Nonetheless, Fitch  will continue to monitor for future events which could adversely impact HOG's  liquidity and/or financial flexibility and thereby constrain its ability to  support HDFS.   HDFS' operating performance has been relatively stable amid modestly rising  credit costs. The company reported operating income of $64.7 million in 1Q15,  relatively consistent compared to $63.2 million reported in 1Q14, driven  primarily by portfolio growth, partially offset by lower yields due to increased  competition. Total retail delinquencies (30+ days past due receivables) as a  percentage of total retail receivables stood at 2.64% as of March 31, 2015,  compared to 2.66% a year earlier. However, managed retail losses as a percentage  of average retail receivables were modestly higher, at 1.56% in 1Q15 compared to  1.33% in 1Q14. Fitch expects operating performance for 2015 to be modestly lower  relative to 2014 due to lower yields driven by increased lending competition in  the prime segment, rising interest rates and a normalizing credit environment.  As of year-end 2014, HDFS had $1.23 billion of liquidity, which included  approximately $405 million of cash and marketable securities and $1.88 billion  of availability under its global credit and asset-backed conduit facilities.  HDFS' debt maturities are well laddered, with manageable maturities between  September 2015 and 2019. Overall, Fitch believes HDFS' funding profile has  improved markedly since the financial crisis, evidenced by the lengthening of  debt maturities, reduced reliance on commercial paper and increased amount of  unsecured funding. As of March 31, 2015, unsecured debt represented  approximately 68% of total debt, which is viewed favorably by Fitch. Fitch  believes HDFS has sufficient liquidity to meet upcoming debt maturities and fund  new motorcycle receivables.  Leverage, defined as total debt divided by tangible equity was 6.5x at 1Q15  compared to 5.9x at YE14. Leverage increased modestly, as the company increased  debt to fund growth in its receivables portfolio, which grew approximately 6.5%  in the first three months of 2015. HDFS' historical leverage has ranged been  between 5x-7x debt/tangible equity, which is moderately lower than captive  finance company peers, but higher than many stand-alone finance companies. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Heavyweight motorcycle demand grows modestly in the U.S. and Western Europe  over the next several years, with faster growth in developing markets like China  and India. --HOG's U.S. market share remains at or above 50% over the intermediate term. --Margins grow modestly over the forecast period as motorcycle as production  increases, but in the near term, margins are pressured by negative foreign  exchange. --Capital spending rises through the intermediate term to support new product  development. --The motor company issues $750 million in debt in 2015, but it issues no  further debt after that. --HDFS repays loans made to it by the motor company over the next several years. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Due to the inherent cyclicality and risk of the motorcycle industry,  Fitch does not anticipate upgrading the ratings of HOG or HDFS in the  intermediate term. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --A severe downturn in global heavyweight motorcycle demand; --An inability to maintain motor company leverage below 1.2x through the cycle; --A shift in business strategy away from a focus on the namesake brand; --A need for HOG to provide material support to HDFS. HDFS' ratings and Rating Outlook are linked to those of its parent. However,  negative rating action could also be driven by a change in the perceived  relationship between HOG and HDFS. Additionally, a change in profitability  leading to operating losses, meaningful deterioration in asset quality, material  change in leverage, difficulty in accessing long-term funding for new  originations and/or a significant increase in reliance on secured debt or  commercial paper could also yield negative rating action. Positive rating  momentum for HDFS would be limited by Fitch's view of HOG's credit profile.  Fitch cannot envision a scenario where the captive would be rated higher than  its parent. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings of HOG, HDFS and HDFC with a Stable  Outlook: HOG --Long-term IDR at 'A'. HDFS --Long-term IDR at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at 'F1'. HDFC --Senior unsecured rating at 'A'.

47,"   By Meredith Davis | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) beat Wall Street profit and sales expectations on Tuesday despite headwinds from a strong U.S. dollar and steep discounts by rivals, sending shares up 4 percent.The company cited strong demand for new models and a rebound in U.S. sales late in the quarter. Harley also said it will not lower prices on its iconic motorcycles and that a recent drop in its share price warrant ramping up a share buyback.The stock jumped $2.21 to $57.13, but remains well below its Dec. 2014 52-week high of $70.41. ""We will not meet discounting with discounting. We will not be putting tags on our motorcycles. That is certainly the easiest way to address some of the competitiveness we are experiencing in the United States,"" CFO John Olin said on a conference call.The company beat analysts' expectations, reporting net income of $299.8 million, or $1.44 per share, in the second quarter, down 15 percent from $354.2 million or $1.62 share a year earlier.  Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.39. Total revenue fell to $1.82 billion from $2 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected $1.67 billion. Harley-Davidson's worldwide retail motorcycle sales fell to 88,931 in the second quarter, from 90,218 a year ago.  Harley said the strong dollar's impact on its core U.S. market was significant because it drove ongoing, aggressive price discounts by rivals.Asia-Pacific retail sales jumped 16.6 percent in the second quarter, while sales in Europe, Latin America and Canada were lower.Sales of the ""Street,"" a lighter, smaller model aimed at a urban buyers, brought new riders into the brand both in the United States and internationally.  ""In its initial year alone, seven out of 10 Harley-Davidson Street motorcycles in the United States were new to the brand, in EMEA it was nine out of 10 and in the India nearly all Street customers were new to our brand,"" Olin said. The company kept its motorcycle shipment forecast unchanged, predicting a 2 percent to 4 percent increase from 2014, or 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles. The company plans to issue $750 million in long-term debt in coming weeks to fund an expanded share buyback that will add to 2015 earnings, CEO Matt Levatich said.

62,"  U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (HOG.N) beat Wall Street estimates with its first-quarter sales and earnings, but shares dipped amid concern about the company's eroding U.S. market share, rising bike inventories and higher marketing costs.Harley shares were down 3.3 percent in midday trading to $45.42, reversing direction after initially trading up 6 percent before the open. Shares retraced gains as analysts asked company executives about the company's inventory levels, production schedules and marketing spending. CFO John Olin said retail inventory was up about 4,900 units because nearly 730 dealerships need models on sales floor, but the company expects inventory to level out as the year progresses. The higher inventory was due in part to marketing spending going up by 60 percent, which should attract new buyers at a time when its U.S. market share is slipping. A sales decline in its main U.S. market, where its core baby boomer demographic is aging, was due to increased discounting by competitors and continued weakness in areas of the country that are dependent on the oil industry, the company said. Sales in the United States, where it is typically the market leader, slipped 0.5 percent. Its U.S. market share dipped to 50.9 percent from 51.3 in a year ago. Harley's market share has slipped in recent years as other brands, such as Polaris’ (PII.N) revived Indian motorcycles, gain popularity and competitors such as Honda (7267.T), helped by a weak Japanese yen, offer discounts. Harley-Davidson's global sales, however, rose 1.4 percent to 57,458 motorcycles, as strong sales in Asia, Europe and the Middle East offset declines in Latin America and the United States.

Company executives said they were surprised by U.S. industry weakness. ""We did not expect the industry as a whole would be as soft as it is.

Harley-Davidson's domestic sales fell 5.2 percent in the quarter, while U.S. motorcycle industry sales overall dropped 8.6 percent in the same period.  The company cut its 2016 full-year outlook for motorcycle shipments to a range of 264,000 to 269,000 motorcycles. It  previously estimated shipments of 269,000 to 274,000 motorcycles.

The impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union on the company's international sales is unclear, Olin said.

74,"   By David Shepardson and Meredith Davis | WASHINGTON/CHICAGO  WASHINGTON/CHICAGO Harley-Davidson Inc  agreed to pay a $12 million civil fine and stop selling illegal after-market devices that cause its motorcycles to emit too much pollution, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.The settlement resolves government allegations that Harley sold roughly 340,000 ""super tuners"" enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the Milwaukee-based company certified to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Harley did not admit liability, and said in a statement it disagrees with the government's position arguing that the devices were designed and sold to be used in ""competition only.""The company said the settlement represents ""a good faith compromise with the EPA on areas of law we interpret differently, particularly EPA's assertion that it is illegal for anyone to modify a certified vehicle even if it will be used solely for off-road/closed-course competition.""An EPA spokesman said that the vast majority of these tuners were used on public roads.According to the government, the sale of such ""defeat devices"" violates the federal Clean Air Act.

""There is really an incredible amount of potential for us in the region,"" he said in an interview at the company's regional headquarters in Singapore.     Levatich did not provide a specific outlook figure for Asia-Pacific, but said the ""vast majority"" of its new international dealerships would be in the region. Asia-Pacific contributed about 12 percent to Harley's retail unit sales in 2015. ""I think (Asia-Pacific) is going to become a more and more significant part of our business,"" he said. ""There are so many untapped markets, there is incredible passion for the brand, the growing middle-class and disposable income and time people have for more leisure-oriented pursuits - that's only increasing.""Harley is facing slowing demand for motorcycles in its biggest market, the United States, and cut its outlook in July.But in Asia's emerging economies, Harley hopes to attract riders who want to buy two-wheelers not just for commuting but also as an aspiration. Asia is home to some of the world's largest two-wheeler markets, although its roads are dominated by lower-end commuter bikes rather than the luxury models Harley makes.The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company has set out a plan to grow its international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships through 2020. Harley had previously said retail sales for its bikes in Asia were hurt after it exited Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy where bikes are hugely popular, at the end of last year. Levatich said Harley was rebuilding its distribution network and would re-enter the country of about 250 million people by year-end.It competes with the likes of Polaris Industries (PII.N), Italy's Ducati and Germany's BMW (BMWG.DE) as well as the high-end ranges from Japanese rivals Honda (7267.T), Yamaha Corp (7951.T) and Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T).
