0,"  (Corrects currency in paragraph 8 to dinars from dollars)* Upgrade of two refineries is part of development plan* Tenders committee oks JGC Corp, Fluor and Petrofec bids* KNPC says contracts will be signed in AprilKUWAIT, Feb 10 Kuwait has approved bids worth a total of $12 billion for major upgrades at two oil refineries, the state-run oil company said on Monday, in a sign it is moving ahead with large infrastructure projects. The Clean Fuels Project is a specification upgrade and expansion of Kuwait's largest refineries as part of the Gulf state's economic development plan, which has faced delays partly due to political instability.A consortium led by Japan's JGC Corp won a tender for work worth 1.361 billion dinars ($4.82 billion) at the 460,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) Mina Ahmadi refinery, a Kuwait National Petroleum Company spokesman said, citing a decision from the country's central tenders committee.Britain's Petrofac, in a bid worth 1.07 billion dinars, is expected to carry out work at the 270,000 bpd Mina Abdullah refinery, and U.S.-based Fluor Corp. will also work on Mina Abdullah after a bid of 962 million dinars, he said. Contracts for the work are expected to be signed with the companies in April and construction work should begin shortly afterwards, the spokesman said.Kuwait awarded Foster Wheeler with the management and service contract for the clean fuels project in December 2012 in a deal worth around $500 million. Foster Wheeler said at the time that the project would increase the amount that the refineries can process per day by 264,000 barrels to 800,000 and be ready in 2018.Apart from the Clean Fuels Project, worth around 4.6 billion dinars in total, Kuwait also wants to build a new 4 billion-dinar refinery called Al Zour and then shut its third, older 200,000 bpd Shuaiba refinery.Such projects in Kuwait's 30 billion dinar development plan, announced in 2010, are a test for a country which has struggled to invest in infrastructure and attract foreign investors, partly due to the political instability and bureaucracy.Last week Kuwait's parliament voted to investigate a contract awarded to a GDF Suez-led consortium for a power project and a deal between the state carrier and Airbus  to buy and lease aircraft, in a sign that lawmakers will continue to question state investment decisions.

1,"  * One of largest UK public contracts ever put out to tender* Estimated savings of at least 1 bln stg over 14 years* Babcock shares climb as much as 7 percent   (Adds background, updates share price)By Li-mei Hoang and Brenda GohLONDON, March 31 Britain awarded a 7-billion-pound ($11.65 billion) contract to manage the decommissioning of nearly half its nuclear sites to engineering contractors Babcock and U.S. group Fluor in one of the largest UK government contracts ever put out to tender.The 14-year deal covers some of Britain's oldest nuclear power sites include Hinkley, Sizewell and Dungeness.Britain has moved to outsource large swathes of its public sector services over the last 30 years, a practice which has been heavily criticised in recent months after contractors such as G4S and Serco were found to have overcharged the government on contracts.Among the services the government has recently attempted to outsource include its defence equipment buying arm, a process which collapsed after one of the only two bidders left in the competition pulled out. Britain's public services market is estimated to be worth up to 50 billion pounds, according to the UK's National Audit Office, second only in size to the U.S. market.The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) said the contract would cover 12 of Britain's 25 nuclear sites and should bring a saving of at least 1 billion pounds from the previous contract, handled by EnergySolutions for the past 14 years.The U.S. group had bid jointly with U.S. engineering sector peer Bechtel for the new deal and said it would now ""evaluate its options"" without giving any further details.Shares in Babcock were the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 Index, trading 4.6 percent higher by 1412 GMT having risen as much as 7 percent. Numis Securities analyst Mike Murphy said the deal would be worth more than 170 million pounds a year to Babcock, representing over 4 percent of group revenue after adding sales from the soon to be acquired helicopter transport services firm Avincis.""(This) cements their position as one of the UK's premier critical engineering support services group,"" Murphy said.""Babcock have got such a tremendous reputation with the government in terms of delivering and I think that is the important thing at the end of the day,"" he said. Aside from EnergySolutions and Bechtel, Babcock and U.S. group Fluor beat two other groups: Serco, Areva  and CH2M Hill, and Amec, Atkins and Rolls-Royce in a two-year-long bidding process.Sources familiar with the situation said that at least one of the losing consortiums was looking at its legal options to challenge the decision.Cavendish Fluor, the joint venture between Babcock-owned subsidiary Cavendish Nuclear and Fluor, will be formally awarded the contract - pending legal approval - on Sept. 1, after a ten-day mandatory standstill and a five-month transition period.""Cavendish Fluor Partnership bring a successful track record and extensive nuclear experience that will bring enormous benefits to the decommissioning and clean-up programme,"" NDA Chief Executive John Clarke said.Although the government is focused on building new nuclear plants, Britain's old stations and nuclear research sites will remain sizeable employers as companies such as Babcock are hired to clean up radioactive materials over decades.The GMB union, which represents energy workers, said it would be seeking urgent talks with the partnership and that it was still ""extremely concerned"" that Britain had no strategic direction for nuclear.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner earlier on Tuesday said the House would simply strip any changes made by the Senate to the transportation funding bill and send back the original House version to the Senate for approval.Such legislative ""ping-pong"" with time running out raises the risk that Congress will not replenish the rapidly dwindling Highway Trust Fund before Friday. The Department of Transportation has said that it will begin to curtail payments from the fund to states by as much as 30 percent starting that day, a move that lawmakers and state transportation directors say could halt planning work for major projects and lead to the layoffs of hundreds of thousands of construction workers.State transportation directors and business groups have been clamoring for a long-term solution that would eliminate uncertainty over the funding of road and rail transit projects that benefit the heavy construction industry and its suppliers, including Fluor Corp, Vulcan Materials, LaFarge SA and Caterpillar Inc.

8,"  (Updates with planned Senate vote on House plan)By David LawderWASHINGTON, July 31 With time running out to avert cutbacks in federal transportation money due to start on Friday, Democratic leaders in the U.S. Senate agreed to accept a Republican plan to extend funding for highway and transit construction through May 2015.Senate Majority Harry Reid said he would put the House of Representatives' $10.9 billion funding plan to a vote on Thursday evening after the House rejected a shorter, $8.1 billion extension passed by the Senate.The legislative ping-pong has heightened uncertainty over the dwindling Highway Trust Fund as Congress prepares to start a five-week summer recess this weekend. The Department of Transportation has said it will start on Friday reducing payments to states by as much as 30 percent from the dwindling Highway Trust Fund.Lawmakers and transportation officials say that failure to approve new funding would cause work slowdowns at the height of summer road construction season and halt planning for new projects, putting thousands of construction jobs at risk.The Senate on Tuesday approved the shorter extension, lasting only through the end of 2014, because Democrats wanted to force Congress to act on a long-term funding plan during the post-election, lame duck session of Congress in November. But in a vote that Democratic aides said was engineered to ""jam"" the Senate just before the recess, the House earlier on Thursday rejected the Senate plan and sent back its original version. That left senators little choice but to take the House plan or face criticism for allowing the trust fund to be depleted.Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, complained that the Republican extension bill would discourage Congress from passing a multi-year transport funding plan until next year. ""We'll limp along until next May and there'll be incredible uncertainty about the next construction season,"" DeFazio said. ""There won't be major new projects planned.""State transportation directors and business groups have been clamoring for a long-term solution that would eliminate uncertainty over the funding of road and rail transit projects that benefit the heavy construction industry and its suppliers, including Fluor Corp, Vulcan Materials, LaFarge SA and Caterpillar Inc.The Highway Trust Fund has suffered chronic shortfalls in recent years as revenue from fuel taxes, unchanged since 1993, have failed to keep pace with rising construction costs and been hit by improved vehicle fuel economy.

9,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON, July 31  WASHINGTON, July 31 The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday was poised to reject a Senate-passed $8.1 billion measure to fund transportation projects through 2014 in a bid to force through Republicans' plans that would extend funding until May.The House's vote to send its $10.9 billion plan back to the Senate, scheduled for Thursday afternoon, would raise the risk that Congress fails to meet a Friday deadline to avert federal funding cutbacks for road, bridge and rail transit construction projects.Congress is set to begin a five-week summer recess on Friday, the day that the Department of Transportation has said it will start reducing payments to states by as much as 30 percent from the dwindling Highway Trust Fund.Lawmakers and transportation officials say that failure to approve new funding would cause work slowdowns at the height of summer road construction season and halt planning for new projects, putting thousands of construction jobs at risk. The House vote was engineered to ""jam"" the Senate, Democratic aides said. With no legislative time left, senators would be faced with a difficult choice: Accept the House plan as is or face criticism for allowing the Highway Trust Fund to run dry in August.A temporary $10.9 billion transportation funding extension through May 2015 seemed on a drama-free path toward approval until Tuesday, when a Senate amendment cut the amount to $8.1 billion. Senate Democrats wanted the shorter extension to try to force Congress to act on a long-term funding plan during the post-election, ""lame duck"" session of Congress in November. They argued that the House plan would put off action until next year, creating a funding crisis at the start of a new construction season and leaving decisions to the next Congress.State transportation directors and business groups have been clamoring for a long-term solution that would eliminate uncertainty over the funding of road and rail transit projects that benefit the heavy construction industry and its suppliers, including Fluor Corp, Vulcan Materials, LaFarge SA and Caterpillar Inc.

But the House earlier on Thursday rejected the Senate plan and sent back its longer extension, which Democrats complained would put off consideration of long-term funding until next year, when a newly elected Congress takes office.In the end, senators from both parties were unwilling to  risk blame for allowing the Highway Trust Fund to run dry as they start a five-week summer recess on Friday.""We really can't walk away from the Highway Trust Fund, we can't let it stagger and fall. Millions of jobs and thousands of businesses depend on it,"" said Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat who was the chief proponent of the shorter extension.

14,"  BAKU, March 30 A subsidiary of Fluor Corp.  will manage the construction of Azerbaijan's new $16.5 billion oil, gas and petrochemicals processing plant, the U.S. Embassy in the former Soviet republic said.The new complex will replace Azeri state energy company SOCAR's two ageing downstream refineries - the Baku and Azerneftyag oil refineries - as well as the Garadagh gas processing plant and the facilities of chemicals firm Azerikimya.It will be built at Sangachal, 60 kilometres (37 miles) south of Baku, where Azerbaijan's main oil and gas pipelines reach the Caspian Sea.Fluor Ltd., which was chosen by SOCAR via tender, is a unit of Fluor Corp, one of the world's largest publicly traded engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management companies.Fluor will choose subcontractors to carry out engineering works. SOCAR said last week it would ask the oil-rich country's central bank for a 10-year loan worth 1 billion manats ($952 million).The money is needed for the first stage of the project, which is estimated to cost $2.1 billion. Construction is expected to begin at the end of this year and be completed by 2020. SOCAR said last year it had delayed the completion date of the complex by four years until 2030 due to a lack of funds.Within the complex, a gas processing plant and a petrochemicals plant are due to be completed by 2020 instead of 2017, and an oil refinery by 2030 instead of 2026. Industry sources say the new petrochemical complex will allow the country to profit from processing oil rather than just exporting it.SOCAR hopes that investment firms and private companies will provide 70 percent of the funds for the project, and the rest will be financed by SOCAR and Azerbaijan's $37 billion state oil fund.Once completed, annual oil refinery capacity will rise to 8 million tonnes of crude, from 6 million tonnes.The gas processing plant is expected to have an annual capacity of 12 billion cubic metres (bcm), while the petrochemical plant will produce about 800,000 tonnes of polyethylene and 300,000 tonnes of polypropylene.

16,"  (Adds comments from Brookings expert, President Obama and senators Schumer, Ayotte)By David LawderWASHINGTON May 14 The Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia revived concerns on Thursday about the crumbling infrastructure in the United States and Washington's failure to address the problem, with U.S. House Speaker John Boehner lashing out at Democrats who linked the two.Boehner, a Republican, said Democrats were wrong to suggest that Amtrak funding cuts were partly to blame for the train crash on Tuesday that killed eight people.Dismissing a reporter's question about Amtrak's budget in light of the accident as ""stupid,"" he said the passenger service's safety programs were adequately funded.""Obviously, it's not about funding,"" the Republican leader told a news conference.""The train was going twice the speed limit. Adequate funds were there, no funding has been cut from rail safety and the House passed a bill earlier this spring to reauthorize Amtrak and authorize a lot of these programs."" But rail experts and Democrats contend that Amtrak budget cuts have caused delays to the installation of ""positive train control"" technology, which can automatically slow or stop a train to prevent an accident.Although Congress in 2008 mandated it for all rail lines by the end of 2015, it was not deployed on the rail yard curve where the train derailed.""There's a lot we don't know, but it does appear clear that if there was this positive train control technology deployed throughout the corridor, particularly around this curve, which has been historically dangerous, that the crash could have been prevented or could have been mitigated,"" said Robert Puentes, an infrastructure expert at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution in Washington.Senator Charles Schumer, the Senate's third-ranking Democrat, called Boehner's comments ""patently false"" and said insufficient funding has delayed positive train control. ""To deny a connection between the accident and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality,"" the New York Democrat added.President Barack Obama called for more investment in infrastructure.""We are a growing country with a growing economy. We need to invest in the infrastructure that keeps us that way. And not just when something bad happens, like a bridge collapse or a train derailment, but all the time,"" he said at a news conference at Camp David in Maryland. In an apparent change of heart, Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte said Congress should re-examine the timing of adoption of positive train control and asked the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to schedule a hearing on the issue.Ayotte was a co-sponsor of legislation passed by the committee that would have given the rail industry five more years, until 2020, to deploy the technology.""The committee should use this hearing to examine the circumstances of the crash in Philadelphia and revisit the issue,"" Ayotte wrote in a letter to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota.The Republican-controlled House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday approved a $262 million cut in Amtrak's capital investment programs as part of a $54 billion spending bill for transportation and housing programs.Tensions on infrastructure funding were rising as a May 31 deadline approached to renew federal Highway Trust Fund spending authority for road, bridge and rail transit projects.Boehner joined other lawmakers on Thursday in acknowledging only a short-term extension of the fund could be arranged by May 31. Some lawmakers pressed for only a two-month extension, while others want to extend transportation authority until the end of 2015.

Stork's main business is in modifying and maintaining large gas, oil and power plants.Fluor said the Dutch firm would combine well with its own operations in the same industry and give it access to Stork's customer base, which spans the globe but is most focused in Europe.""Fluor expects ... significant synergies including increased revenues from cross-selling and expansion into new markets,"" the companies said in a statement. Fluor will combine Stork with its own operations and maintenance business, which will take the Stork name and operate with a headquarters in the Netherlands under Stork Chief Executive Arnold Steenbakker.""Fluor mostly works on the capital expenditures oriented side of big (oil and gas) investments, while Stork is in the operational expenditures budget of the same facilities,"" Steenbakker told reporters.""So, we pick them up once they've been constructed, that's where Stork begins, and now we can give continuity to the whole life cycle of a structure."" The offer price is around seven times Storks' annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 100 million euros ($109 million), the companies said.Candover bought Stork in 2008 in a 1.6-billion-euro deal and ownership transferred to Arle in 2010 as part of agreements Candover made when it decided to wind itself down.Arle combined some of Stork's operations with Scotland's RBG, which it purchased in 2011.Arle split off one of Stork's former divisions, aerospace component maker Fokker Technologies, in 2012.

The Zurich-based company, which also poached Nokia's finance chief to be its CFO, reported net profit of $568 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, down from $577 million a year earlier. The figure beat forecasts of $555 million in the poll.European demand was dented by Britain's decision to exit the European Union as well as ""considerable investment delays"" that ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer pinned on the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.""We face continued adverse market conditions. That will not go away quickly,"" Spiesshofer said on a conference call. ""Brexit had a massive dampening effect.""Spiesshofer added he was unable to predict when ABB would return to growth, cautioning ""it will take a while."" ABB shares were down 7.1 percent in early trading.""The headwinds have become even stronger,"" Bank Vontobel analyst Panagiotis Spiliopoulos said. ""We fear the inflection point has been further delayed and all operations improvements are eaten up by top-line headwinds for more quarters.""Orders in Power Grids, which makes everything from microgrid equipment to big HVDC converters, were also hurt by the hesitation of customers in the months leading up to ABB's October announcement it would keep the division. INVESTOR PRESSURE ABB rejected pressure from Sweden's Cevian, its second- biggest investor, to unload Power Grids. Its profitability has been improving, in part as ABB partners with others including Fluor, to cut risks that led to large losses on projects like North Sea wind parks.Spiesshofer said his ""White Collar Productivity"" cost-cutting program, now targeted at saving $1.3 billion by the end of nest year, helped boost overall profitability for an eighth straight quarter.The margin on operating earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation rose to 12.6 percent from 12.5 percent.ABB named Nokia's Timo Ihamuotila as its CFO to replace Erik Elzvik, who is leaving in April after more than three decades to ""pursue career opportunities outside of ABB"".""We change the shape of the company and you have to look at the shape of the team,"" Spiesshofer said. ""We saw that it is time to move on and bring in new additional talent.""
