0,"   By Sophie Sassard and Arno Schuetze | LONDON/FRANKFURT  LONDON/FRANKFURT Novartis AG NOVN.VX is discussing swapping its animal health and human vaccines businesses for Merck & Co Inc's (MRK.N) over-the-counter products unit in a deal that could boost earnings at both companies.Healthcare bankers said an asset swap with Merck was the main focus for the Swiss drugmaker as it reviews its portfolio, although an outright sale of animal health or an exchange with other companies were still possible.One of the bankers said Novartis and Merck had been in talks for some time but asset swaps were hard to execute, due to the difficulty of comparing the relative attraction of different businesses.If the hoped-for swap with Merck does not work out, Novartis is likely to opt for a sale or swap with another leading animal health firm, such as Bayer (BAYGn.DE), Zoetis (ZTS.N), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Eli Lilly (LLY.N) or unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim.Bloomberg reported earlier that Novartis and Merck might each trade about $5 billion in assets under an eventual deal.Sources with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters last month that Novartis was ready to sell its animal health unit and had opened its books to Bayer and others for the business that could change hands for more than 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion). New chairman Joerg Reinhardt is casting a fresh eye over the Basel-based group following the departure of veteran chairman and one-time CEO Daniel Vasella, the architect of the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz that created Novartis in 1996.Reinhardt has defended the firm's diversified strategy, but has stressed Novartis will only hang on to businesses that are among world leaders. That has left uncertain the future of sub-scale operations like animal health and vaccines.PORTFOLIO FIT Novartis already agreed to sell its blood transfusion testing unit to Spain's Grifols (GRLS.MC) for $1.7 billion in November. Merck, meanwhile, has been saying for some time that its over-the-counter (OTC) consumer health business lacks scale and Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said a swap could boost earnings per share at both companies by around 3 percent.Merck's OTC line-up would add products such as Claritin medicine for allergies, Coppertone sunblock and Dr Scholl's foot care, boosting Novartis's already strong consumer care portfolio.Analysts said Merck's products would fit well within the Novartis OTC business, since it is currently dominated by remedies for coughs, colds and pain. The Novartis animal health products include Sentinel and Prac-tic flea and tick treatments for dogs, as well as a range of other products for pets and farm animals, while its human vaccines operation mainly makes flu shots.Many drugmakers are currently shedding businesses, prompted by pricing pressures and increasing competition from generics that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation.

2,"  Jan 8 Novartis AG is in talks with Merck & Co Inc to exchange its animal-health and human vaccines businesses for the drugmaker's over-the-counter health-products unit, Bloomberg reported, quoting people familiar with the matter.The two drugmakers may each trade about $5 billion in assets as part of the trade, the report said. ()The Swiss drugmaker was ready to sell its animal health subsidiary and opened its books to Bayer and other rivals for the business that could change hands for more than 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion), sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters last month. Drugmakers are shedding businesses and cutting costs due to overseas price controls and pressure on payments from insurers and the government. Pfizer Inc completed a spin off of its animal health products business in June. Novartis has not finalized a deal with Merck, and may choose another option, Bloomberg said.

3,"   By Toni Clarke  Shares of Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) rose as much as 6.5 percent Monday after it filed the first part of an application to market its experimental drug, MK-3475, for advanced melanoma, putting the treatment on track to become the first in a new class of promising cancer drugs to reach the market.The application was filed earlier than investors had expected and ups the ante in a race between Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co(BMY.N) for dominance of a class of drugs known as anti-PD-1 inhibitors that are expected to generate billions of dollars in peak sales.Merck's drug is designed to treat patients with advanced melanoma who have previously been treated with Bristol-Myers' melanoma drug Yervoy. The company is also testing the drug in other cancers, including lung and renal cancer.Bristol is testing its own PD-1 drug nivolumab in a variety of cancers, with lung cancer likely to be one of the first to move forward.""This is probably one of the most important classes of new drug,"" said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar, who forecasts peak sales for Merck's drug, including multiple cancer indications, of $3 billion. He forecasts peak sales for Bristol's drug of $6 billion. The drugs are designed to restore the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target cancer cells.While Bristol has more clinical trials and data to show for nivolumab, Merck's move in filing for MK-3475 early ""is a way to fight Bristol by getting out ahead of them,"" Conover said. Merck said it expects to complete its application in the first half of this year. Under a rolling application, completed portions of the package may be submitted and reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration on an ongoing basis.Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a research note that the future of PD-1 development could focus on combination regimens. He said it is too early to decide on a winner in the PD-1 space, though he said Merck's drug ""does appear to have the best overall profile as a monotherapy.""Merck also benefited from other news on Monday. The company said it is pursuing strategic options for its animal health and consumer businesses and expects to complete any action it takes this year. It previously said it was looking at options for separating the businesses but the company's statement reinforces the likelihood something will in fact occur.Separately, a preliminary review of Merck's experimental blood clot-preventing drug vorapaxar by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found clinical trial data to be ""robustly positive"" and recommended the drug be approved in patients who have previously suffered a heart attack.Merck's shares rose 5.7 percent to $52.72 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

8,"   By Toni Clarke  Merck & Co Inc's experimental blood clot-preventing drug vorapaxar should be approved, based on ""robustly positive"" clinical trial results, according to a preliminary review of the data by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The review, posted on the FDA's website on Monday, comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside medical experts who are expected to recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels.The drug, which would be sold under the brand name Zontivity, is designed to prevent heart-related deaths, cardiac arrests and strokes in patients who have had a recent heart attack. It would not be recommended for patients who have previously had a stroke because of an increased risk of bleeding in the brain.Results from a trial known as TRA 2P ""are sufficient to establish the effectiveness of vorapaxar for its proposed indication,"" the review found. The main safety concern with the drug is bleeding, the review found, though it noted that the rate of fatal bleeding was low in the population for whom the drug is proposed.The FDA did not recommend that the company establish a risk management program, nor did it recommend that the company conduct additional trials following approval. Vorapaxar works by preventing blood cells, known as platelets, from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks. Other anti-platelets include aspirin and Plavix, which is made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Merck's drug works in a different way, by inhibiting a receptor known as PAR-1.Each year about 525,000 Americans have heart attacks and about 190,000 have a second heart-related event, according to Merck. Standard therapy to prevent a second episode often includes treatment with aspirin and Plavix. Voraxapar would be given in addition to standard treatment. During clinical trials, safety monitors found that patients who had previously had a stroke were at higher risk of bleeding in the brain and were instructed to stop taking the drug. Merck then focused its analysis on patients who had had a heart attack but no stroke.Merck's shares rose 2.7 percent to $51.21 in early trading, helped also by news it had initiated its application to market a drug for patients with advanced melanoma.The company also said it is pursuing strategic options for its animal health and consumer businesses and expects to complete any action this year.(Reporting by Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Bernadette Baum)",2014-01-13,MRK,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 9:57am EST",Merck's anti-blood clot drug should be approved: FDA review,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-merck-vorapaxar-idUSBREA0C0SZ20140113?type=companyNews

12,"   By Ransdell Pierson | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Merck & Co's (MRK.N) researchers need to regain their confidence after an eight-year drought in developing important new medicines sapped employee morale, the company's recently hired research chief told Reuters.Employees of the second-largest U.S. drugmaker have been so badly shaken by rejected or failed drugs that their gloom has further undermined its legendary research, Merck Research Laboratories President Roger Perlmutter said in an interview during the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference late on Monday.""What's missing may be less the absence of a specific capability than it is a loss of esprit,"" said Perlmutter, who at age 60 replaced decade-long research chief Peter Kim in April. ""The various unfortunate occurrences caused people to lose the sense of joie de vivre. They lost the sense they could actually make a real difference.""At the same time, Perlmutter said he was optimistic that Merck's slump would soon end as important new products are approved.""Much of what I need to do is reinstill in the organization the sense of competence, of vigor, of thoroughness and the willingness to take real risks in order to achieve something great,"" he said.Perlmutter was no stranger to Merck when he came aboard last spring at the urging of Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier. He had overseen the company's basic research and preclinical development for four years before joining Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), the largest U.S. biotech company, in 2001 and heading its research until 2012. ""When I retired from Amgen, it was not my goal to take a job like this again; I'd done that,"" he said. ""And when Ken came to talk to me in the bucolic setting of Santa Barbara, with sailboats bobbing in the harbor, it was not my first thought that this is what I wanted to do.""But Perlmutter said his memory of the talent at Merck, including its respected chemists, drew him back to the New Jersey drugmaker, once dubbed ""The House that Research Built"" because of its emphasis on breakthrough medicines over the past half-century.The company developed the first statin, the first ACE inhibitor blood-pressure drug, the first measles vaccine. The first-in-class, best-in-class mindset was largely inspired by Roy Vagelos, a physician who was Merck's chief executive officer from 1985 to 1994. But the situation Perlmutter faced was sobering. Merck had introduced no important innovative medicines since 2006, when it won approvals for Gardasil, the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, and a new type of diabetes drug called Januvia.A trail of disappointments had ensued, including failed studies of cholesterol treatment Tredaptive and migraine drug telcagepant and ongoing regulatory delays for osteoporosis medicine odanacatib.""I had one of our very senior chemists express to me her concern that maybe she just isn't any good at this,"" Perlmutter said. ""She got to the point where she really doubted her own ability. And that level of self-doubt has an effect on people's performance."" Perlmutter said some promising developments with new drugs were beginning to lift morale, including a closely watched cancer treatment called MK-3475 that works by harnessing the immune system, highly potent new oral therapies for hepatitis C and an improved version of Gardasil.Shares of Merck jumped Monday after it announced it had applied for U.S. approval for MK-3475 in patients with advanced melanoma. The company is testing this PD-1 inhibitor against other cancers and is expected to combine the drug with its other experimental treatments for the disease.Merck also aims to license or buy more drugs from other companies. Perlmutter said research and development executives could now pursue deals and buy products on their own - tapping the company's chief financial officer only as a financial adviser - to speed up the process.""It's not an overnight thing, but people are developing a certain bounce to their step that was missing before,"" Perlmutter said, ""an actual sense they can achieve something.""(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-01-14,MRK,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 11:46am EST","Merck needs a dose of joie de vivre, research chief says",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-merck-perlmutter-idUSBREA0D12C20140114?type=companyNews
13,"   By Toni Clarke  Merck & Co Inc's experimental blood clot-preventing drug vorapaxar should be approved to reduce the risk of further heart problems in people who have suffered a recent heart attack, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Wednesday.The panel voted 10-1 in favor of the drug, which would, if approved, be sold under the brand name Zontivity. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.Results from a trial known as TRA 2P were ""robust,"" panelists said, and justified approval for patients who had suffered a heart attack.They agreed with the company that the drug should not be used in patients with a history of stroke, since there was an increased risk of bleeding in the brain in this group of patients.""I think this drug addresses a real unmet medical need,"" said Dr. Philip Sager, consulting professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. The vote followed a positive analysis by reviewers for the FDA, whose report, published on Monday, also recommended the drug be approved.Vorapaxar works by preventing blood cells, or platelets, from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks.Other anti-platelets include aspirin and Plavix, which is made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Merck's drug works in a different way, by inhibiting a receptor known as PAR-1. The drug increased the overall risk of bleeding in clinical trials, though the risk in patients who had not had a stroke did not outweigh the drug's benefit, panelists said.Still, Dr. Sanjay Kaul, a cardiologist and professor at UCLA School of Medicine who voted in favor of approval, urged the FDA to ""do its due diligence"" around the bleeding risk. Each year about 190,000 Americans have a second heart-related event, according to Merck. Standard therapy to prevent a second episode often includes treatment with aspirin and Plavix. Vorapaxar would be given in addition to standard treatment.""The results of today's advisory committee mark an important milestone in our effort to bring vorapaxar to appropriate patients with a history of heart attack,"" Dr. Daniel Bloomfield, who leads Merck's cardiovascular research, said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with the FDA as it completes its review.""Merck has proposed that the drug's label urge caution when prescribing the drug for patients who weigh less than 60 kilograms (132 lbs) since the risk of bleeding in these patients appears to be higher than in heavier patients.Panelists could not reach a consensus recommendation on how lower-weight patients should be treated.

22,"   By Soyoung Kim and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) has received approaches from large consumer companies interested in buying its consumer healthcare business, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, according to people familiar with the matter.Merck's consumer healthcare business, which also includes Dr. Scholl's foot care and other consumer products, could be worth as much as $8 billion to $10 billion in a sale, or roughly four to five times the unit's annual revenue, some of the people said.Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker after Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), is considering alternatives for both its consumer and animal health businesses and has said it expects to complete the review in 2014.Among a range of options it has considered for the consumer unit, Merck discussed a potential asset swap with Novartis AG NOVN.VX, under which Merck would give up its consumer assets in return for the Swiss drugmaker's animal health and other units, Reuters and others previously reported.The probability of carrying out such a deal, however, is currently seen as low due to the complexity of valuing different businesses, prompting Merck to explore an outright sale of its consumer unit as well, people familiar with the matter said.Merck has been in conversations with several interested parties and is being advised by Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on the process, the people said, asking not to be named because the conversations are private. For its much larger animal health unit, the second-largest in the industry after Zoetis Inc (ZTS.N), Merck is evaluating the potential of spinning it off as a separate publicly traded company, people familiar with the matter said.Analysts and people familiar with the industry say big consumer companies such as Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) could be logical buyers for Merck's consumer healthcare business.Reckitt already owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in a September interview that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and has the firepower to do sizeable deals. Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) also has a portfolio that includes a range of medicines and beauty products.Reckitt and P&G declined to comment.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is the biggest player in the $200 billion global consumer health industry, with about 4 percent of the market, followed by Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L). Merck, however, is relatively small with around 1 percent of the market. Merck has said in the past that it views its consumer business as sub-scale.In considering options for the consumer and animal health businesses, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which created shareholder value by seperating non-core assets.Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA NESN.VX for $11.9 billion in 2012, and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis.Many other drugmakers have been looking to shed businesses, prompted by pricing pressure and increasing competition that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation. They have shown a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets.A Merck spokeswoman declined to comment on details of the strategic review.

This is not just Merck trying something. That was the first deal in 2012,"" he said. ""The conclusion from that first project is that they are very pleased with how Ablynx works and they are now coming with a much bigger project.""Ablynx, loss-making since it listed its shares on the stock market in 2007, makes its revenues through development deals with large pharma groups such as Merck Serono, AbbVie  and Boehringer Ingelheim.",2014-02-03,MRK,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 7:28am EST",UPDATE 1-Ablynx agrees Merck cancer deal worth up to 1.7 bln euros,http://www.reuters.com//article/ablynx-merck-idUSL5N0L81E720140203?type=companyNews
26,"  * FTSE 100 down 0.3 percent* Lloyds falls; delays dividend prospect after mis-selling charge* Reckitt up on talk of move for Merck unitBy Tricia WrightLONDON, Feb 3 Britain's top shares inched lower on Monday, extending recent hefty falls, led down by Lloyds Banking Group.Lloyds fell 2.4 percent after it said it had set aside a further 1.8 billion pounds ($2.96 billion) in the fourth quarter to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI), and dividend payouts were to come later than some in the market had anticipated.""Continued higher-than-expected PPI claims - now elongated to an extent than surprised me - and the resumption of dividend payments moved back later than expected has certainly taken the shine of the stock,"" said Jordan Hiscott, sales trader at Gekko Global Markets.However, he said the 100-day moving average, currently at 77.8, could act as support - noting that Gekko's client base is using Monday's weakness in the shares, now trading at 81.3 pence, as a buying opportunity. Consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, however, rose 1.9 percent, one of the biggest boosts to the FTSE 100, with traders citing speculation the maker of Nurofen pain relief tablets may make a move for Merck & Co's consumer healthcare (CH) business.""We believe the acquisition of Merck's OTC/CH assets would ... be very attractive to RB (Reckitt Benckiser),"" analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note.""We estimate this would push RB up from global #9 to #3 in CH and would result in RB becoming the global leader in Cough, Cold and Allergy."" The FTSE 100 was down 21.01 points, or 0.3 percent, at 6,489.43 points by 0924 GMT, having dropped 0.4 percent on Friday. It fell 3.5 percent in January, its biggest monthly decline since last June and its worst January since 2010.After an encouraging start to the year, which saw the UK benchmark post gains in the first two weeks, equity markets took a turn for the worse as unease about slowing Chinese growth and the withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus spread from emerging market currencies to the world's big stock markets.Alongside the emerging market worries, investor concern has focused on the current earnings season, and whether it will result in profits strong enough to justify lofty valuations after a bumper 2013.While Monday was quiet on the earnings front, there are plenty of releases later on in the week - from the likes of oil majors BG and BP, drugmakers AstraZeneca  and GlaxoSmithKline, and mobile phone group Vodafone . Vodafone is set to become one of the latest high profile victims of the chaos engulfing the emerging economies of Africa and Asia, readying itself for a big slide in its overseas revenues, weekend press reports said.""(Earnings have) been particularly ropey in the UK,"" Peel Hunt equity strategist Ian Williams said.""I think one or two investors have realised that valuations are at the top end of that recent range and you can't afford the number of disappointments on the trading front which we still appear to be getting,"" he said.The FTSE 100 is trading on a 12-month forward price/earnings ratio of 13.3 times, against its 10-year average of 11.9 times, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows.Of the 17 percent of European companies to have reported so far, 44 percent have missed profits expectations, while 46 percent have missed expectations on revenue, Thomson Reuters Starmine data shows.",2014-02-03,MRK,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 4:37am EST","FTSE inches lower, pulled down by Lloyds",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-britain-stocks-idUSL5N0L814X20140203?type=companyNews

The average analyst estimate was $3.48 per share.""Overall, I view this guidance as 'good enough,' given fairly widespread Street concerns about a 'mega-miss,'"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said, adding that investors remain more focused on prospects for the company's array of experimental drugs.Separately on Wednesday, Merck said it plans to test its closely followed immuno-oncology drug MK-3475, in combination with medicines being developed by Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc and Incyte Corp. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed.Merck shares were up 0.3 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as much as 3.1 percent earlier on Wednesday.Schoenebaum said investors were enthused about the planned new studies of MK-3475, a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that works by harnessing the immune system to find and destroy cancer cells.Industry analysts believe the medicine, if approved, could generate annual sales of $2 billion or more and greatly improve treatment of melanoma and potentially other cancers. They also believe such immuno-oncology drugs may have special promise if used in combination with each other. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday it earned $781 million, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter.

Merck shares rose 22 percent in 2013, underperforming a 27 percent average gain for other large U.S. and European drugmakers, amid waning sales of its Januvia diabetes medicines and uncertainty about its drug pipeline.The company is hoping that MK-3475 and other drugs will be approved and revive sales and earnings growth, following failures or setbacks over the past five years for its treatments for heart disease, osteoporosis and other diseases.Sales of Januvia, Merck's biggest product, fell 1 percent to $1.12 billion in the fourth quarter, while sales of a related combination medicine called Janumet rose 11 percent to $503 million. Double-digit sales gains were seen for arthritis treatment Remicade and HIV treatment Isentress.But sales of asthma drug, Singulair, now facing generics, tumbled 38 percent to $298 million.

35,"  Feb 6 Merck & Co has agreed to pay $100 million to settle hundreds of lawsuits accusing the U.S. drugmaker of downplaying serious health risks associated with its NuvaRing contraceptive device, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the deal.The agreement, which would settle cases in federal and state courts, will be announced on Friday and pay about $58,000 per complaint, according to the report.Merck is facing more than 1,700 lawsuits accusing it of failing to adequately warn NuvaRing users or downplaying a potential increased risk of developing dangerous blood clots known as venous thromboembolism, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Plaintiffs are seeking damages for a range of injuries allegedly caused by the birth control device, including heart attack, stroke and sudden death.A judge presiding over federal cases, which have been consolidated in Missouri federal court, has scheduled a hearing on the matter for Friday morning. NuvaRing has been available to women in the United States since 2001. It is one of several contraceptive products that have been linked to an increased risk of developing blood clots that can cause strokes and heart attacks. Should the $100 million figure prove to be accurate, Merck would pay a fraction of what at least one company has paid in similar settlements. German drugmaker Bayer AG last year said it had so far paid nearly $1.6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits involving accusations that its Yaz and Yazmin birth control pills caused blood clots that led to strokes and heart attacks.Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.",2014-02-06,MRK,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 6:10pm EST",Merck to settle NuvaRing lawsuits for $100 mln -media report,http://www.reuters.com//article/merck-settlement-idUSL2N0LB27M20140206?type=companyNews
36,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Feb 6 AstraZeneca is moving an experimental Alzheimer's drug into late-stage development, taking on U.S. rival Merck & Co which announced plans to start similar final-stage research in December.Britain's second-biggest drugmaker revealed its plan to move AZD3293 into the last phase of testing needed for registration as it announced full-year results on Thursday.Both the AstraZeneca and Merck medicines work by blocking an enzyme called beta secretase that is involved in production of beta-amyloid, a protein that creates brain plaques considered a major cause of Alzheimer's disease.Such oral drugs are known as BACE inhibitors and are viewed as a promising new approach to fighting the memory-robbing condition. BACE inhibitor drugs have taken centre stage after an injectable class of medicines targeting beta-amyloid plaque failed or fell short in trials conducted by Pfizer and Eli Lilly.Not all experts accept that reducing beta-amyloid is the key to defeating Alzheimer's, however, and the safety of the new BACE drugs has also been a subject of concern after Lilly pulled the plug on its product due to liver toxicity.Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's head of innovative medicines and early development, told analysts there had been no signs of similar problems with his company's product. AZD3293 also had a clean profile in terms of potential heart problems, he added. ""We have a very potent molecule, not dissimilar to Merck's molecule,"" he added.AstraZeneca is integrating Phase II and Phase III trials for its drug, which Pangalos said could either lead to a second pivotal Phase III study or, if the data was strong enough, an immediate filing for regulatory approval. ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said Merck was probably some six months ahead of AstraZeneca in the BACE race, with the first Phase III data from the U.S. company's programme likely to emerge in around 2017.Dementia - of which Alzheimer's disease is the most common form - already affects 44 million people worldwide and this is set to reach 135 million by 2050, according to Alzheimer's Disease International, a non-profit campaign group.Unlike heart disease and cancer, no major advancements have been seen in Alzheimer's drug research since the first treatment was approved in 1993 by U.S. regulators.Current Alzheimer's drugs, including generic forms of Pfizer's Aricept (donepezil), can minimally and briefly help memory and ability to perform daily functions, but do not slow the disease.",2014-02-06,MRK,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 9:03am EST",AstraZeneca takes on Merck in Alzheimer's drug race,http://www.reuters.com//article/astrazeneca-earnings-alzheimers-idUSL5N0LB31520140206?type=companyNews

46,"   By Olivia Oran, Soyoung Kim and Anjuli Davies | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON A handful of consumer and healthcare companies including Bayer AG and Novartis are exploring a deal for Merck & Co Inc's consumer healthcare business, as they seek to gain scale in a fragmented industry, according to several people familiar with the matter.Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC and Procter & Gamble Co are also among the parties that have held discussions with Merck about buying the unit, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, the sources said this week.The Merck business, which also includes Dr. Scholl's foot care and other consumer products, could be worth $10 billion to $12 billion in a potential sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because the process is private.Despite the large size of a potential deal and the unit's various product lines, Merck is focused on selling the consumer health business in its entirety, not in parts, the people said.Merck, Bayer, Novartis, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment.Merck is meeting with potential buyers after receiving preliminary offers a few weeks ago, and is expected to seek second-round offers in late March, the people said.Germany's Bayer already has a strong portfolio of consumer products including pain medication Aleve and antacid Alka-Seltzer, but is looking at deals to expand the business further. In 2012, Bayer lost a bidding war with Reckitt for Schiff Nutrition International Inc, which agreed to sell to the British consumer products group for $1.3 billion.Reckitt owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in September that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and has the firepower to do sizeable deals. Procter & Gamble also has a portfolio that includes a range of health products, including Vicks cold and flu treatment and Prilosec heartburn medication.Among a range of options it has considered for the consumer unit, Merck discussed a potential asset swap with Novartis AG under which Merck would give up its consumer assets in return for the Swiss drugmaker's animal health and other units, Reuters and others previously reported.The probability of carrying out such a deal, however, was seen as low due to the complexity of valuing different businesses, prompting Merck to explore an outright sale of its consumer unit as well, Reuters reported in January.Novartis remains interested, and could offer cash instead if an asset swap does not pan out, the people familiar with the matter said. Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker after Pfizer Inc, is being advised by Morgan Stanley on the process, Reuters reported last month.FRAGMENTED INDUSTRY Johnson & Johnson is the biggest player in the $200 billion global consumer health industry, with about 4 percent of the market. Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi SA are the other major players, each with a market share of more than 2 percent.Merck, however, is relatively small with around 1 percent of the market, and has said in the past that it views its consumer business as sub-scale. Other large companies with consumer healthcare divisions, such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, have competing products to Merck and are seen as unlikely buyers. Sanofi's Allegra allergy medication and Johnson and Johnson's Zyrtec may overlap with Merck's Claritin brand.GSK is not pursuing the Merck business either, given its current low appetite for deals and the poor fit between the firms' consumer health portfolios, according to one person familiar with the matter. Merck's Claritin allergy franchise would also overlap with GSK's Flonase nasal spray, the person added.A GSK spokesman declined to comment.In exploring alternatives for the consumer business, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer, which created shareholder value by separating non-core assets.Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA for $11.9 billion in 2012, and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis Inc.Many other drugmakers have been looking to shed businesses, prompted by pricing pressure and increasing competition that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation. They have shown a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets.(Reporting by Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim in New York and Anjuli Davies in London; additional reporting by Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt; Editing by Richard Chang)",2014-02-19,MRK,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 4:12pm EST","Exclusive: Bayer, Novartis, others eye Merck's consumer health unit - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-merck-bids-idUSBREA1I22T20140219?type=companyNews

49,"   By Bill Berkrot | March 4  March 4 An immunotherapy pill to treat an allergy to house dust mites being tested by Merck & Co  significantly reduced common nasal symptoms, such as sneezing and stuffy nose, according to data from a midstage clinical trial, the company said on Tuesday.The drug, MK-8237, reduced nasal symptoms by 49 percent at the higher tested dose and 27 percent at the lower dose compared with a placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. The results, which were deemed to be statistically significant, were presented on Tuesday at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) meeting in San Diego.MK-8237, a once-a-day tablet designed to dissolve under the tongue, is the third oral allergy immunotherapy treatment being developed by Merck. The U.S. drugmaker and its Danish allergy development partner ALK Abello are awaiting U.S. approval decisions likely this year for sublingual tablets that treat grass and ragweed allergies that would be alternatives to regular allergy shots at a doctor's office.Over time, the drugs train the immune system to stop reacting abnormally to exposure to allergens. The primary goal of the 124-patient study was a significant reduction at week 24 in average total nasal symptom score (TNSS) reported over the last four hours of a six-hour session in a special room where they were exposed to enough dust mites to set off allergic reactions. TNSS was comprised of itchy nose, blocked nose, runny nose and sneezing.A secondary goal combined TNSS results at 24 weeks with a measure of ocular symptoms, such as red, itchy or watery eyes. By that measure, the higher dose of the Merck drug reduced symptoms by 52 percent compared with placebo and by 29 percent for the lower dose. The reduction in eye symptoms alone was as high as 68 percent, Merck said. ""We had not expected to see such pronounced effects on both nasal and ocular symptoms with this product, so we are very encouraged by this data,"" Dr. Hendrik Nolte, clinical leader of Merck's allergy immunotherapy program who presented the data at the meeting, said in a telephone interview.No serious adverse side effects were reported by patients in the study. The most common side effects, deemed to be mild to moderate, included throat irritation, mouth edema and lip swelling.Merck said it is recruiting patients for a large, pivotal Phase III trial of the dust mite allergy treatment that it hopes to complete next year.",2014-03-04,MRK,"Tue Mar 4, 2014 | 5:30pm EST",Merck says dust mite allergy drug reduces symptoms in midstage study,http://www.reuters.com//article/merck-allergy-idUSL1N0M11X520140304?type=companyNews
50,"  March 5 A combination of oral drugs for hepatitis C developed by Merck & Co appeared to be well tolerated and highly effective in treating the liver disease in patients also infected with HIV, according to data from a midstage clinical trial presented on Wednesday.The Merck drugs, MK-5172 and MK-8742, which belong to promising new classes of anti-viral medicines, were tested over a 12-week course of treatment both with and without the older hepatitis C drug ribavirin in co-infected patients.After 12 weeks of treatment, all 29 patients who received the two Merck drugs and ribavirin had undetectable levels of the hepatitis C virus. Among those who got just the experimental Merck drugs, 26 of 29, or 90 percent, appeared to have the hepatitis C virus eliminated from their blood.If the virus remains undetectable 12 weeks after completion of treatment, those patients are considered cured. The available data from the ongoing study was presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Boston. More detailed results of the study dubbed C-Worthy are expected to be presented at a European medical meeting in April, Merck said.No co-infected patients discontinued treatment due to either an adverse side effect or study medication intolerance, Merck said. The most common side effects of fatigue and headache were no more prevalent in patients with hepatitis C and HIV infection than what had been observed in patients with hepatitis C alone. A new era in treatment for the serious liver disease has begun with several companies, including Gilead Sciences Inc , AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, developing all oral treatment regimens that have demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with treatment durations of just 12 weeks or shorter. Current standard treatments take 24 to 48 weeks and include the injected drug interferon that causes miserable flu-like symptoms and cure about 75 percent of patients.Those also living with the virus that causes AIDS are an important patient population.About seven million people worldwide are co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C (HCV). Co-infected patients have a three times higher rate of progression to cirrhosis and a six times higher risk of liver decompression than those with HCV alone.",2014-03-05,MRK,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 5:56pm EST",Merck hepatitis C drugs work in HIV co-infected patients -study,http://www.reuters.com//article/merck-hepatitis-idUSL1N0M22FO20140305?type=companyNews
51,"  (In 2nd paragraph adds dropped word ""not"" to show that vaccine also shrank tumors not injected with the drug.)By Bill BerkrotMarch 14 An experimental Amgen Inc  cancer vaccine used to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, proved effective in a late-stage study in shrinking tumors in a way that suggests the drug triggered the intended systemic immune response, according to data presented on Friday.The vaccine shrank tumors that were directly injected with the drug and tumors around the body that were not injected, according to the data.The drug, talimogene laherparepvec, also known as T-vec, is an engineered virus designed to replicate inside the injected tumor, killing cancer cells there, as well as prime the immune system to attack other cancer cells around body.Dr. Robert Andtbacka, one of the study's lead investigators, in a telephone interview, called the results ""very encouraging.""Amgen last year released initial data from the 295-patient Phase III study showing that T-vec succeeded in demonstrating a significant tumor response that lasted at least six months. The latest data analyzed 4,000 tumor lesions to study the response to the drug in injected versus non-injected tumors. Of the directly injected tumors, 64 percent shrank by at least half, and 47 percent of those had a complete response, meaning the lesion had disappeared, researchers said.Of the uninjected lesions in the skin or lymph nodes, known as non-visceral tumor lesions, 34 percent shrank by at least half with a complete response seen in 21 percent of those.""We also want to see responses in distant lesions that are not injected such as in the liver, in the lung and other places,"" Andtbacka explained. Of those so-called visceral tumors on solid organs, 15 percent shrank by at least 50 percent, said Andtbacka, who presented the data at the Society of Surgical Oncology Cancer Symposium in Phoenix.""This indicates to us that we have activation of the immune system to fight these tumors at a distant site,"" Andtbacka said.""This is a new generation of oncolytic immunotherapy where you're seeing very robust responses in injected lesions but  also robust responses in non-injected lesions. This bodes well for the future for this product,"" added Andtbacka, an associate professor in the division of surgical oncology at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Amgen said it expects to have further data in the first half of this year showing whether T-vec ultimately helped patients in the study to live longer. The company has not yet said when it will apply for approval of the medicine.Andtbacka said he expects the future of the drug will involve its use in combination with other types of cancer immunotherapies, especially in treating patients with non injectable visceral tumors.Amgen is already testing T-vec in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's melanoma drug Yervoy and has agreed to study T-vec in combination with Merck & Co's  experimental immunotherapy from a highly promising class called PD-1 inhibitors.Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. About 132,000 melanoma cases occur globally each year, according to World Health Organization.""We are extremely excited about the data and the potential for combinations with other treatments,"" said David Chang, Amgen's head of global oncology development.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-03-14,MRK,"Fri Mar 14, 2014 | 5:19pm EDT",CORRECTED-Amgen vaccine triggers immune response in advanced melanoma -study,http://www.reuters.com//article/amgen-cancer-idUSL2N0MB1PD20140314?type=companyNews
52,"  Merck and Co Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc are not reimbursing drug co-payments for patients who purchase their health insurance through state and federal exchanges set up under the Obamacare program.The two drugmakers said their decision, first reported by Bloomberg News, is based on uncertainty about whether insurance programs offered under the Affordable Care Act are governed by federal laws that ban kickbacks to businesses.To cap rising healthcare costs and give consumers more incentive to reduce spending, insurers in recent years have increased the out-of-pocket costs patients are expected to pay for medications.

59,"  SEOUL, April 1 South Korea will allow certain levels of animal feed additive zilpaterol in beef from June, a government official said on Tuesday, opening the door to imports of some meat containing the growth enhancer and its domestic sale.Seoul had said in October that restrictions would be eased sometime in 2014, ending a zero tolerance policy on zilpaterol-based drugs such as Merck & Co's Zilmax.The feed additive has been under global scrutiny since a video emerged in the United States in August showing animals struggling to walk and with other signs of distress after taking a growth drug.South Korea suspended some U.S. beef imports for more than two months last year after traces of zilpaterol were found in two shipments. Son Seong-wan, a director in South Korea's food ministry, told Reuters that from June the government would allow 1 part per billion (ppb) of zilpaterol in beef muscle and 5 ppb in beef liver. He said that compared with levels of 2 ppb in beef muscle permitted in Canada and 12 ppb in beef liver in the United States.He added that 60 days of public hearings on the move had begun in February.

60,"  * Drug is first such immunotherapy pill licensed in U.S.* Merck and partner ALK Abello expected to launch rival drug this year* Shares in Stallergenes rise 6 percent   (Adds detail, share price, analyst comment)CHICAGO/PARIS, April 2, France's Stallergenes  has received U.S. regulatory approval to sell the first immunotherapy pill against grass allergies in the world's biggest pharmaceutical market, sending its shares up 6 percent on Wednesday.Stallergenes has said it sees a potential U.S. market of nearly 3 million patients that will eventually be worth $1 billion in annual sales for these types of drugs. ""That's very positive news as the group is considerably expanding its market,"" Gilbert Dupont analysts wrote in a note.Oralair is a fast-dissolving tablet to be placed under the tongue that contains extracts from five types of grass pollen: sweet vernal, orchard, perennial rye, timothy and Kentucky bluegrass. It harnesses the immune system to alleviate allergies and is an alternative to current treatments that need to be injected. Merck and Danish partner ALK Abello are also expected to launch their rival therapy Grastek in the United States this year. In December, both drugs received strong recommendations from outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Oralair was approved in the European Union in 2008 and is also sold in Canada, Australia and Russia for the treatment of grass pollen allergy. It generated revenue of 22.2 million euros ($30.5 million) in 2013, up 37 percent from 2012. Greer Laboratories, Stallergenes' U.S. partner, aims to begin selling Oralair within weeks of the FDA's go-ahead. But the peak season for Oralair prescriptions is between December and June, so U.S. revenue from the drug this year should be limited, Stallergenes' former chief executive said last month.The approval of Oralair triggers a first milestone payment of $10 million from Greer to Stallergenes. Overall, Stallergenes is due to receive milestone payments totaling up to $120 million, plus royalties and an undisclosed transfer price.Shares in Stallergenes were 6 percent higher at 61.49 euros at 0840 GMT, trading at more than twice their average daily volume and giving the company a market capitalisation of 843 million euros.

61,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Merck & Co Inc wants to feed its controversial feed additive Zilmax to 240,000 U.S. cattle to prove it is safe. But there is a problem: giant meat processors like Cargill Inc don't want to touch animals fed with the drug.Merck plans to conduct the biggest ever test of its kind in an effort to reintroduce the weight-adding drug into the United States and Canada after suspending sales last August. A test herd of this size is currently worth up to $500 million.Feedlot owners, however, are reluctant to participate in the study until they get a guarantee that slaughterhouses will be willing to buy the Zilmax-fed animals.Snags with the study, whose size was confirmed to Reuters by Merck, have not been previously reported.""I'd be happy to sign up, just as soon as Merck tells me who is going to pay me after they're done,"" said a feedlot owner in Texas. ""It's been a horrible time, with the drought. I can't afford to give away a steer, let alone hundreds.""Cargill Inc and Tyson Foods Inc, two of the world's largest beef processors, told Reuters their stance on Zilmax had not changed since last autumn, when they stopped accepting cattle fed the drug following reports it may cause lameness. Together the two companies control 37 percent of the daily U.S. beef processing capacity.Reuters reported in December that Tyson stopped taking Zilmax-fed livestock after more than two dozen animals that had been fed the drug arrived at one of its slaughterhouses with missing hooves.The beef processors said their ban would remain until Merck had scientifically proven that Zilmax was safe for animals. They also want certainty that key export markets in Asia and elsewhere will accept such beef products.Merck has said it is confident in the ""safety and performance"" of Zilmax. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has deemed the drug safe for both animals and humans. A source with National Beef Packing Company said the company was not accepting Zilmax-fed cattle. JBS USA Holdings Inc, another major beef processor, did not return calls and emails for comment.Merck in December said the evaluations would start in the first quarter. But company spokeswoman Pamela Eisele declined to say this week where the 240,000 cattle would come from in the United States, whether the tests had started, or whether Merck had signed up any packing plants, ranchers or feedlots - which house and fatten up the cattle before they are slaughtered.Eisele said the company's current plan was to sign up at least 50 U.S. feedlots, out of more than 73,000 nationwide, to participate in field tests over several months. Merck hopes to enroll five to 15 feedlots for each slaughterhouse that agrees to process the cattle, she added.Anne Burkholder, who runs a 3,000-head feed yard in Cozad, Nebraska, is eager to hear results.""We need to have a large study, where we can really look at mobility and well-being issues we're seeing in the present,"" said Burkholder, who switched to another feed additive after Merck suspended Zilmax sales. She said she never had any problems with Zilmax.QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDY The attempt to launch a large-scale study underscores Merck's determination to put zilpaterol-based Zilmax, once the largest-selling growth drug for cattle, back on the lucrative agriculture drug market.The scale is unprecedented for a randomized, controlled study of cattle, and the logistics involved with tracking so many cattle ""boggle the mind,"" said Morgan Scott, an epidemiology professor at Kansas State University. Merck said it believed the field evaluations will ""support the results of previous studies and the safety of the product.""A principal investigator hired by Merck, who is an epidemiologist and veterinarian, will oversee the study and analyze data, Eisele said.Merck has declined to name the investigator, or any of the scientists or other academic experts involved in the study, but said it would release the results once the study was completed.Some livestock researchers have questioned why Merck has declined to say who is leading the research effort. Others have criticized the company for promoting the study's outcome before data are collected or analyzed.""It would suggest that they've already decided the results,"" Scott said.Christopher Reinhardt, a feedlot extension specialist at Kansas State University, said meat packers and feedlots will make certain results are objectively reported. Merck has ""a vested interest in the outcome but their partners don't, so there is sort of a check and balance in place,"" he said.Animal science experts said large-scale field studies - if done well - can offer valuable insight into drug interactions and impacts in the real world after the initial laboratory vetting required for federal regulatory approval.With Zilmax off the market since last August, rival pharmaceutical firms have grabbed market share. Many U.S. feedlots have switched to ractopamine-based Optaflexx, made by Merck rival Eli Lily & Co.'s Elanco Animal Health unit.(Reporting by P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek.

62,"  * Senate Finance Committee Chairman Wyden calls for reform* Total of profits stashed abroad up 93 percent 2008-2013* GE tops list, followed by Microsoft, Pfizer, Merck, AppleBy Kevin Drawbaugh and Patrick Temple-WestWASHINGTON, April 8 Foreign profits held overseas by U.S. corporations to avoid taxes at home nearly doubled from 2008 to 2013 to top $2.1 trillion, said a private research firm's report, prompting a call for reform by the Senate's top tax law writer.""The new numbers ... certainly highlight what is one of the key challenges for tax reform. I do think there need to be some reforms in this area,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden told reporters on Tuesday on Capitol Hill.Under U.S. law, corporations do not have to pay income tax on most of their overseas profits until they are brought into the United States. These earnings can be held offshore for years if they are classified as indefinitely invested abroad. Research firm Audit Analytics said in a report issued last week that the total of such earnings was up 93 percent from 2008 to 2013, citing federal financial filings for companies listed in the Russell 1000 index of U.S. corporations.Conglomerate General Electric Co had the biggest pile of earnings stored abroad, at $110 billion, the firm said.Next were software maker Microsoft Corp, with $76.4 billion; drugmakers Pfizer Inc, with $69 billion, and Merck & Co Inc, with $57.1 billion; and high-tech group Apple Inc, with $54.4 billion, it said.In response, GE said in a statement: ""GE operates in more than 170 countries, and most of these overseas earnings have been reinvested in active business operations like manufacturing facilities and loans to non-U.S. customers."" Microsoft, Merck and Pfizer were not immediately available for comment. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.BAUCUS AND WYDEN  Congress has quarreled for years over the law that lets multinationals stash profits abroad tax-free. Some favor killing the law - known as offshore corporate income tax deferral - and some back a one-time tax holiday that would let companies bring foreign profits home, or ""repatriate"" them, at a low tax rate.Debate over offshore deferral flared again in November when Wyden's predecessor as finance committee chairman, former Democratic Senator Max Baucus, proposed doing both. Baucus resigned weeks later to become U.S. ambassador to China.Wyden in the past has called for repeal of offshore deferral, along with a repatriation holiday, among other changes to the tax code, which he last month called ""a rotten carcass that the special interests feast on.""No decisive action is likely for now, however, with Congress deadlocked over fiscal issues at least until after the November mid-term congressional elections, according to policy analysts.Next year lawmakers are likely to mount another push to overhaul the tax code, a politically difficult feat that has not been pulled off since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan and a divided Congress managed to get it done.The top U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, though few multinationals pay anywhere near that thanks to tax-reducing loopholes written into the code in the past 28 years, including some that have enabled wider use of offshore deferral.

63,"   By Bill Berkrot  A two-drug combination being tested by Merck & Co to treat hepatitis C cured 98 percent of previously untreated patients without cirrhosis in a midstage clinical trial, providing the latest evidence that the U.S. drugmaker will be highly competitive in the fast evolving field.Results of the study called C-Worthy were presented on Thursday at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in London. Researchers are due on Friday to present results of how the Merck pills fared in more difficult to treat patients, such as those who failed to be helped by prior treatments and those with more advanced liver disease.In the arm of the Phase II study presented on Thursday, 43 of 44 patients treated with 100 milligrams of MK-5172 and 50 mg of MK-8742 once a day for 12 weeks achieved sustained virologic response (SVR), which is considered cured. One patient relapsed, researchers said.Those who have no detectable levels of the hepatitis C virus in their blood 12 weeks after completing the 12 weeks of treatment are deemed to have achieved SVR.Current standard treatments take 24 or 48 weeks, cure about 75 percent of patients and involve miserable side effects that have led thousands of patients to put off treatment and wait for highly touted new drugs to become available. The study also included results of patients treated with the two Merck drugs plus the older drug ribavirin for both 12 weeks and eight weeks. But all eyes will be on the ribavirin-free results as several companies race to produce all-oral treatment regimens that include neither ribavirin nor interferon, which are both used in current treatments and cause flu-like symptoms, anemia and other side effects.Gilead Sciences Inc, AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co are also developing a new generation of all-oral hepatitis C treatments that in previous trials have demonstrated cure rates in excess of 90 percent, while cutting treatment duration to 12 weeks with few side effects. Gilead, which later this year could have a one pill, once a day two-drug regimen approved in the United States, is widely perceived by Wall Street to be the best of the bunch with some analysts forecasting annual sales of $9 billion or more.Merck is a bit behind the other three companies in its development timeline, but could prove to be the one that gives Gilead a run for its money as it aims to also produce a one pill, once a day regimen. The AbbVie and Bristol-Myers programs involve more pills and more drugs, but equally impressive cure rates so far in clinical testing.""Merck has begun a Phase III trial in (previously untreated patients) using one pill, once per day. This should increase everyone's confidence that Merck really has a regimen competitive with Gilead's,"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. The Merck anti-viral medicines, which hamper the virus' ability to replicate in different ways, were tested in patients who had the genotype 1 form of the virus - the most prevalent and considered the most difficult to treat.The most common side effects seen with the Merck drugs were fatigue, headache and nausea.An estimated 170 million people are believed to be infected with hepatitis C worldwide.

65,"  Merck & Co said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved its grass pollen allergy drug Grastek, becoming the second such immunotherapy treatment to be given the go-ahead in recent weeks.The company, which developed the tablet with Denmark's ALK Abello, said it expects to launch the drug, approved for patients age 5 to 65, in the United States by late April.Immunotherapies work by boosting the body's immune system and making it less sensitive to allergens.Grastek contains extracts of the timothy grass allergen.

70,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Merck & Co.'s (Merck)  long-term ratings, including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'. The Rating  Outlook remains Negative. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the company's  short-term ratings at 'F1'. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of  this release.  The ratings apply to approximately $24.6 billion in outstanding debt.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Outlook mainly reflects that leverage (total debt/EBITDA) has  remained above 1.5 times (x) since Merck's $5 billion, largely debt-funded share  repurchases in second-quarter of 2013. While leverage has declined to 1.65x from  its peak of 1.92x at June 30, 2013, it remains higher than what Fitch would  expect for an 'A+' credit rating for this issuer.  Fitch expects that Merck will continue to favor share repurchases over  deleveraging, acknowledging the possibility of further debt-funded stock  buybacks. Notably, the company has roughly $10.4 billion remaining on its  existing repurchase authorization. Sales at-risk to patent expiries have declined to roughly 20% of total firm  sales. Roughly one-third of those sales are generated by biologics, which tend  have significantly less market share erosion in the face of generic (biosimilar)  than do traditional small molecule drugs. Merck has made progress in building its late-stage pipeline. The company has  approximately 20 new molecular entities (NMEs) in phase 3 development or  registration. Merck initiated a restructuring program in October 2013, which Fitch expects  will be supportive to margins during the intermediate term. The company will  focus on costs in a number of areas including manufacturing, general  administration and research & development. Fitch believes the rumored sale of the company's consumer business would be  strategically sound, as it would increase the company's focus on its core  mission of developing and marketing innovative medicines. However, unless the  company were to use some of the proceeds to pay down debt, the incremental loss  of diversification and EBITDA would be incrementally negative for Merck's credit  rating. Fitch expects modest growth for Merck's Januvia/Janumet franchise, as the market  becomes increasingly crowded with new entrants. Although, the growth in the  number of diabetic patients and some share gains from older generic treatment  modalities should offset the competitive headwind. Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $5.8 billion - $6.1 billion in FCF  during 2014 as improving margins offset soft revenue. Debt Financed Share Repurchases Fitch expects that Merck will continue with shareholder friendly actions during  the near term, some of which may be funded by debt. Merck purchased $5.3 billion  (net of issuances) of its common stock during 2013, compared to $1.3 billion  during 2012. The repurchases were executed under a $15 billion program  authorized in May 2013 and a previously authorized program. The company has  approximately $10.4 billion remaining under the May 2013 share repurchase  program. The repurchases were funded, in large part, with debt issuances. Patent Exposure Easing The company faces significant number of patent expiries during the next two  years. However, roughly only 20% of total firm sales are at risk. In addition,  Remicade and PEG-Intron, which account for about 6.2% of total firm, are  biologics and tend not to experience the rapid sales loss to generic competition  as do traditiona, one small molecule pharmaceuticals. Expanding Late Stage Pipeline Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its late-stage pipeline, despite the  company's intention to narrow its focus its focus on R&D projects. The company's  late stage pipeline is broad with new molecular entities (NMEs) to treat cancer,  bacterial and viral infections, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, central  nervous system disorders, osteoporosis, allergies and other maladies.  While the majority of these projects are internally developed, Merck has  partnered with other innovator firms to take advantage of technological  advancements that were discovered externally. The landscape for drug development  is expanding, particularly as more is learned about how genetics influence the  development, prevention and treatment of disease.  Cost Cutting Continues In October 2013, Merck initiated a new global restructuring program, in an  effort to sharpen its global commercial and research & development focus. The  company expects to reduce its total workforce by approximately 8,500 positions,  including those in sales, administration and research & development.  Merck will sell some real estate, move its corporate headquarters and continue  to work towards improving the efficiency of its manufacturing and supply  network. The restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by  the end of 2015. Estimated pre-tax restructuring costs are approximately $2.5  billion - $3 billion, of which two-thirds will be cash-related. Consumer Business Possibly for Sale  Fitch believes the sale of Merck's consumer products business would be a net  negative for the company's credit profile, with the expectation that the  proceeds of the sales would not be used for debt reduction. While the consumer  business accounts for roughly 4% of total firm sales, Fitch estimates the  segment's contribution to the firm's total EBITDA is less than that. Regardless,  we believe the negative effects of a less diversified product portfolio and a  lower base of profitability will more than offset the benefits to the firm from  increasing its focus on its core competency of drug development and marketing in  the near term. More Competition for Januvia/Janumet Fitch expects that the growing number of diabetic patients and continued market  share gains from some older generic diabetes treatments will more than offset  the increasing number of competitors in the diabetes treatment market, resulting  in relatively soft sales growth for Januvia/Janumet, Merck's largest selling  franchise. Growth has slowed in recent years due to competition (DPP-4  inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists) entering the diabetes market. In  addition, concerns over the safety of these drugs(DPP-4 inhibitors) have been a  headwind to growth, although the FDA recently reaffirmed their safety regarding  pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.  Solid Free Cash Flow Expected Fitch forecasts that Merck will continue to generate significantly positive free  cash flow generate, including expected 2014 FCF of $5.8 billion - $6.1 in FCF  during 2014. Improving margins driven by an improving sales mix and strong cost  control should more than offset the negative effect that expected soft top-line  growth will have on cash generation. Adequate Liquidity Fitch looks for Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through strong FCF  generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending Dec.  31, 2013 was $8.35 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had approximately  $17.5 billion in cash plus short-term investments and full availability on its  $4 billion revolver, maturing in May 2017.  At Dec. 31, 2013, Merck had roughly $24.6 billion in debt outstanding, with $4.7  billion maturing in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, $2.3 billion in 2016 and $1  billion in 2017. Fitch expects near- to mid-term maturities will be satisfied  primarily through refinancing in the public debt markets. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch would consider revising the Rating Outlook to Stable if Merck pursued a  capital deployment strategy that maintained gross debt leverage below 1.5X  during the long term, including managing through operational stress such as  patent expiries and clearly taking a more conservative approach to its use of  debt. In addition, the company must demonstrate long-term positive sales growth  through demand for core drug products and uptake of new medicines.  Rating pressure would stem from total debt leverage remaining above 1.5x in the  intermediate term. The high leverage would likely be driven by incremental  borrowing to fund acquisitions or share repurchases. Leverage pressure could  also result from operational weakness due to an inability to achieve in  achieving cost containment targets or generating sales growth despite is  improving patent risk profile and expanding late-stage pipeline. In addition,  Fitch anticipatates that FCF would be constrained in this scenario. RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the follow ratings for Merck:   --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';  --Senior unsecured debt rating at 'A+'; --Bank loan rating at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook on the long-term ratings remains Negative.

71,"   By Anjuli Davies, Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK Merck & Co Inc is in the final stages of selling its consumer healthcare unit for close to $14 billion, with Bayer AG and Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc among final contenders to clinch a deal as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter said.Germany's Bayer and British consumer products giant Reckitt have emerged as frontrunners to win the auction after each offering roughly $13.5 billion for the Merck consumer unit, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, the sources said.Both bidders are very keen to buy the asset and the price tag could go higher in the final days, one person added. All the people asked not to be named because the matter is not public.Representatives for U.S. drugmaker Merck, as well as Bayer and Reckitt, declined to comment.The sale would be the latest in a wave of healthcare deals in recent days, including Zimmer Holdings Inc's $13.35 billion acquisition of orthopaedics rival Biomet Inc and the agreement between Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline Plc to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets, with Eli Lilly and Co buying Novartis' animal health business for $5.4 billion.At the same time, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and Bill Ackman are locked in a $47 billion battle for Allergan Inc; Mylan Inc is seeking to buy Sweden's Meda AB for around $9 billion including debt; and there is talk of a $100 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc from Pfizer Inc. RECORD HEALTHCARE M&A The deal surge has driven healthcare M&A volumes to $153.3 billion so far this year, the highest year-to-date level since Thomson Reuters has started tracking data. Pharmaceutical deals have accounted for 71 percent of overall healthcare deals.The Merck auction also drew interest from several other healthcare and consumer giants including Procter & Gamble Co, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis and Sanofi SA, people familiar with the matter have said. The impending sale underscores drugmakers' efforts to bolster their best businesses and exit weaker ones as the drug industry contends with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition.Reckitt owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in September that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and had the firepower to do sizeable deals.Germany's Bayer already has a strong portfolio of consumer products including pain medication Aleve and antacid Alka-Seltzer, but is looking at deals to expand the business further. In 2012, Bayer lost a bidding war with Reckitt for Schiff Nutrition International Inc, which agreed to sell to the British consumer products group for $1.3 billion. Over-the-counter health products are attractive to companies like Reckitt and Bayer because they tap into consumer and demographic trends such as aging populations, ballooning healthcare costs and more interest in wellness.They also enjoy brand loyalty, fat margins and strong growth - and because of that they don't come cheap.Merck is looking to sell its consumer unit as it is not a leader in the space and holds only around 1 percent of the market. In exploring alternatives for the consumer business, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer, which has created shareholder value by separating non-core business units.Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA for $11.9 billion in 2012 and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis Inc.(Additional reporting by Martinne Geller and Ben Hirschler; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)",2014-04-26,MRK,"Sat Apr 26, 2014 | 3:21pm EDT",Exclusive: Merck in final talks to sell consumer unit for near $14 billion - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-merck-co-sale-idUSBREA3P0I220140426?type=companyNews

86,"   By Soyoung Kim, Olivia Oran and Sophie Sassard | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) is considering selling a big portfolio of mature drugs that could fetch more than $15 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, as the U.S. drugmaker continues to streamline businesses to focus on high-growth areas.Merck, which is also in the process of selling its $14 billion consumer healthcare unit, is working with an investment bank on the potential sale of the off-patent drugs, which could draw interest from generic drugmakers, the people said.Merck's off-patent drugs are called ""diversified brands"" and many are sold in emerging markets. The sale processes underscore efforts by large drugmakers to shed smaller divisions they view as non-core so they can better focus on their mainstay products. They have shown new willingness to consider large asset swaps with rivals to exit weaker businesses and bolster core areas where they are already top players.Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), being advised by Evercore Partners Inc (EVR.N), is also in the market with its aging drug portfolio, which could fetch between $7 billion and $8 billion, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Representatives for Merck declined to comment. The sources asked not to be named because the matter is not public.Both Merck and Sanofi have an extensive line-up of older products that could be carved out, following similar moves now under way at Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) to place older products in separate divisions. Pfizer announced last year it planned to separate its business into three units - innovative pharmaceuticals; vaccines, oncology and consumer health; and established products.

Patients on the late-stage trial either received the drug in combination with a chemotherapy drug, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), or a combination of PLD plus a placebo.Baird's Raymond said that Friday's news can also raise questions on Endocyte's entire technology platform.The company's technology works by binding anti-cancer agents to certain receptors on cancer cells, thereby improving their efficacy.Apart from vintafolide, which is also being tested in lung and breast cancers, Endocyte is developing two more cancer drugs  based on the same technology.Endocyte and Merck signed a $1 billion partnership for the drug, also called Vynfinit, in April 2012.Endocyte's shares were down 62 percent at $6.66 in late morning trading on the Nasdaq. Merck was down about 2 percent at $58.49.

100,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Ransdell PiersonNEW YORK May 4 Leading global pharmaceutical companies have started to view their vast portfolios of older, established prescription drugs as vehicles for raising large sums of cash to fuel development of new medicines with far higher profit margins.France's Sanofi and U.S. drugmakers Merck & Co  and Abbott Laboratories are exploring selling off their mature drugs that have lost patent protection, Reuters reported this week, citing people familiar with the plans. Officials at the three companies declined to comment.The divestments could bring in more than $7 billion for Sanofi, north of $15 billion for Merck and over $5 billion for Abbott, the sources said, giving them considerable firepower to develop, or buy, promising experimental medicines.Such a shift would also remove a source of pricing pressure, since many of the older medicines are sold in emerging markets, where governments are increasingly demanding lower prices.""It makes sense to sell your low-growth assets that drag down profit margins and to redeploy that cash to higher-value innovative biotech assets,"" said John Boris, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.The trickier part, according to some people familiar with the processes, is finding a buyer, particularly if many of these assets reach the market around the same time. Suitors could include generic or specialty drugmakers looking to widen their product line, or private equity firms content to milk the cash flow from the aging products without having to worry about the expense of drug development.The Merck products in particular could attract the interest of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which derives a quarter of its revenue from branded generics sold in emerging markets, said Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. Valeant's Chief Executive Michael Pearson has said he favors established products over pumping cash into risky research and development projects.Once companies divest their mature drugs, good-selling patent-protected drugs can have a bigger impact on financial results, said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the healthcare fund at StockDoc Partners in San Francisco.Patent protection for a new drug is generally 20 years from the time the patent was approved, but it can then take a medicine 10 or more years to be developed and reach the market, giving a limited window for exclusivity.""From a smaller revenue base, it's easier to grow revenue and earnings faster,"" Yaffe said, especially as new drugs are approved and make contributions. CASH COWS LOSE APPEAL The interest in unloading these older assets represents a shift for Big Pharma, which has relied on them as cash generators to cushion steep revenue declines from more recent drug patent expiries. Almost all are sold outside the United States, where governments are increasingly demanding lower prices.""That makes them less profitable and attractive,"" said Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang. ""It's gotten tougher in the past two or three years.""The divestments would also feed into a larger shakeout of the pharma industry, whose major players are in the midst of a series of asset sales and swaps to better focus on the types of medicines that will bring them the most growth. That logic has fueled Pfizer Inc's $106 billion unsolicited takeover bid for AstraZeneca and a $20 billion swap between Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline.Merck drugs likely to be sold include blood pressure treatments Cozaar and Hyzaar, with combined sales of $1 billion last year; cholesterol fighter Zocor, with sales of $301 million, and hair growth drug Propecia, with sales of $283 million. Sales of Abbott's aging drugs, which it calls ""established pharmaceuticals,"" fell 3 percent last year to $4.97 billion, irking many investors.When GSK reported quarterly financial results on Wednesday, it announced separate results for its established products division. Pfizer on Monday is expected to do the same, as a possible prelude to eventually divesting its mature drugs.GSK last September sold two blood clot medicines that are branded generics, Arixtra and Fraxiparine, and a related factory, to South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare for $1.1 billion, as part of its strategy to focus on growth products.""You should not be surprised if we were able to transact a disposal of some of that established product portfolio in the next year or two,"" Chief Executive Andrew Witty told reporters last week. ""That is not part of our future.""Pfizer, which recently spun off its animal health and infant formula businesses, is considering whether to divest its own established products unit, which includes hundreds of off-patent drugs and ones that will soon lose patent protection.Some analysts say an AstraZeneca purchase would allow Pfizer to combine the mature drugs divisions of both for a more significant sale or spin-off.But Pfizer has said it would not be able to divest the unit until 2017, following a review of its financial performance. It is one of the company's three main businesses, and with revenue of $9.46 billion last year, it generated 18 percent of total Pfizer sales.There are clear risks for Merck, Sanofi and others, however, in concentrating their bets so much more heavily on the success of new medicines""Being more focused cuts both ways: your successes are magnified, but if you have failures, you feel them more when you have a less-diverse business,"" said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark.

101,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot  Merck & Co (MRK.N) Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said he does not expect a wave of giant mergers in the drug industry despite a spate of recent activity, adding that Merck will seek out promising medicines rather than lower taxes in any future deals.""I don't see an arms race"" in the industry ""although different companies are sizing up their own (drug) portfolios and growth prospects and some feel they will be enhanced through combinations,"" Frazier said in a telephone interview after a company meeting with investors in Boston.Earlier on Tuesday Merck announced the sale of its own array of consumer care products to Germany's Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) for $14.2 billion.Sale of the products, including brands such as Coppertone sunscreen, MiraLAX laxative and Claritin allergy pills, will allow Merck to focus on its more-lucrative prescription drugs business.Frazier is no stranger to mega-mergers, having been head of Merck's pharmaceuticals operations when the company paid $41 billion in 2009 to buy U.S. rival Schering-Plough Corp. He became CEO of Merck in 2011. The industry's merger pace had fallen off until recent weeks, when a series of large deals and takeover attempts emerged, highlighted by Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) now-$106 billion unsolicited bid for British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L).Pfizer aims to buy AstraZeneca and domicile the combined company in the United Kingdom to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates, a growing trend called tax inversions.Frazier said his company was not interested in such financial engineering. ""Tax inversions clearly have value, but what motivates us is to bring medically important products to patients,"" he said. Adam Schechter, Merck's head of global human health who oversaw the integration of Schering-Plough, does not expect Merck to enter into another major acquisition in the foreseeable future, although that may be wishful thinking on his part.""It takes a lot of effort and energy to try to pull two big companies together. Having done it once, it's not something you look forward to doing ever again,"" he said. ""We realize that we have to pay attention to things that are going on around us and take notice. We would be interested in looking at bolt-ons,"" he said, referring to smaller acquisitions.Asked about reports that Merck was considering selling its portfolio of older branded drugs no longer under patent protection, Schechter said those so-called diversified products were vital to Merck's growth in emerging markets, where there tends to be a preference for known brands over generics.""It's also a part of manufacturing and how we have our facilities organized, so it's not easy to think of a way just to pull that out,"" he said.Merck believes developing markets, with their burgeoning middle classes, will continue to be an important growth driver for the number two U.S. drugmaker, he said.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Ken Wills)",2014-05-06,MRK,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 5:58pm EDT",Merck executives say not tempted by merger mania,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-merck-mergers-idUSBREA450ZE20140506?type=companyNews

103,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 06 (Fitch) The sale of Merck's consumer products business will  increase the company's focus on its core mission of developing and marketing  innovative medicines, according to Fitch Ratings. German-based Bayer AG Tuesday  said it planned to buy Merck's consumer health unit for $14.2 billion. The transaction is consistent with Fitch's expectation that a number of major  pharmaceutical companies will continue to consider divestitures of businesses  that are not core to a business model focused on biomedical innovation. This is  particularly relevant to firms such as Merck who have strengthened product  pipelines that are expected to support long-term growth. The consumer business only accounts for approximately 4% of Merck's total sales,  and Fitch estimates the segment's EBITDA margin is less than that of the  pharmaceutical business and the total firm. Nevertheless, the incremental loss  of diversification and EBITDA would be marginally negative for Merck's credit  profile. We view the $14.2 billion cash sale as incrementally negative for the  company's credit profile, with the expectation that the proceeds of the sales  would not be used for debt reduction, but rather to fund payments to  shareholders and business development activities, including acquisitions. While the transaction will significantly increase liquidity, the relatively  modest estimated loss of EBITDA will further stress gross debt leverage of  1.65x, which is currently high for the company's current 'A+' credit rating.  Fitch looks for Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through strong FCF  generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending Dec.  31, 2013, was $8.35 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had approximately  $17.5 billion in cash plus short-term investments and full availability on its  $4 billion revolver maturing in May 2017.  At Dec. 31, 2013, Merck had roughly $24.6 billion in debt outstanding, with $4.7  billion maturing in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, $2.3 billion in 2016 and $1  billion in 2017. Fitch expects near- to midterm maturities will be satisfied  primarily through refinancing in the public debt markets. Fitch rates Merck 'A+' with a Negative Rating Outlook, and a downgrade of the  ratings could stem from total debt leverage remaining above 1.5x in the  intermediate term. The high leverage could be driven by incremental borrowing to  fund acquisitions or share repurchases; although incremental liquidity provided  by the cash proceeds from the sale of the consumer health business mitigates  this concern in the near term. Leverage pressure could also result from  operational weakness due to an inability to achieve cost-containment targets or  by generating sales growth despite an improving patent risk profile and an  expanding late-stage pipeline.

Drug makers have embarked on a major reshuffling of their business portfolios. Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) last month agreed to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets, while AstraZeneca is fighting off a $106 billion takeover approach from Pfizer.Meanwhile companies including France's Sanofi, Merck & Co and Abbott are looking at selling off mature drugs that have lost patent protection.OTC drugs units carry far lower margins than prescription drugs businesses but many drug majors regard them as attractive complements due to the stable stream of cash they can generate.They akso require less spending on research and development and can be less exposed to the loss of patent protection where consumers remain loyal to a brand even when cheap copies become available.But Reckitt Benckiser Group, one of the final contenders in Merck's auction, said on April 30 it was no longer in active talks to buy the Merck business, leaving Bayer in pole position.Bayer also edged out other rival bidders, including Procter & Gamble Co, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis and Sanofi , people familiar with the matter have said. J&J commands about 4 percent of the consumer health market - worth nearly $200 billion at the retail level.Merck & Co has around 1 percent with brands including Dr Scholl foot care, Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine.The fragmented OTC industry is consolidating fast. Novartis and GSK will form a joint venture in consumer healthcare as part of their agreement last month.That deal is set to elevate the combined group, with $9.5 billion in sales, to the top of the global consumer health ranking, overtaking Johnson & Johnson and Bayer.But Bayer said the Merck deal will put it back on the second rung, with $7.4 billion in combined sales. J&J's consumer unit has $14.7 billion but market observers exclude many of its products, such as Listerine mouth wash, from their analysis of the OTC market.With Bayer paying 6.5 times 2013 revenue and 21 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), analysts at Deutsche Bank said the price tag may seem ""eye-watering"" at first sight.""The deal works both strategically and financially, and creates value (albeit to a modest degree),"" the analysts said, adding it reduces volatility in the Bayer business and provides a predictable cash flow.Bayer's enlarged consumer care unit will account for about 13 percent of group sales, up from 10 percent now.Bayer's shares closed 0.9 percent lower at 99.07 euros, while the STOXX Europe 600 health care index slipped 0.4 percent.Reuters first reported last month that Bayer and Reckitt had  emerged as frontrunners in the auction with each initially offering roughly $13.5 billion.In addition, Bayer agreed to sell to Merck some rights to its Adempas drug against high blood pressure in the lung and other experimental cardiovascular drugs, saying it needed a marketing partner.As part of that alliance, Merck will pay up to $2.1 billion, including $1.1 billion in milestone payments contingent on development achievements.Bayer said it plans to finance the OTC acquisition with a bridge loan facility provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch , BNP Paribas and Mizuho, which will be syndicated to a larger group of banks.It added no asset sales were needed to preserve its credit rating of ""A-"".

108,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Merck & Co said on Tuesday it plans to seek marketing approvals this year for an osteoporosis drug and a product to reverse the effects of anesthesia that have long been delayed by safety concerns.The No. 2 U.S. drugmaker will seek approval in the second half of the year for odanacatib, its experimental treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and will seek approval in 2014 for sugammadex, meant to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants after surgery.Merck shares were down 2 percent at $57.50 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.The company is counting on odanacatib, sugammadex and other experimental drugs, including promising treatments for hepatitis C and cancer, to boost its earnings growth following generic competition for its Singulair asthma treatment and other brands.But Merck research chief, Roger Perlmutter, in a company meeting with investors in Boston to review research projects, said a numerically higher incidence of stroke and atrial fibrillation - a type of irregular heartbeat most common in the elderly - was seen in patients taking odanacatib than those taking placebos in studies. Perlmutter also said a type of skin thickening and itching called morphea was seen in 0.2 percent of patients taking odanacatib. He said 0.1 percent of patients had fractures in the shaft of the femur, or thigh bone, a greater incidence than seen in the placebo group.ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the half-day Merck research meeting had been relatively uneventful, except for news that Merck would seek approval this year for odanacatib. ""That's an upside surprise,"" he said in a research note. ""But the news was tempered perhaps by their disclosure that there was a numerical imbalance in atrial fibrillation and stroke"" and there were skin issues.Analysts at Cowen and Co have predicted that odanacatib, if approved, could reap Merck annual sales of $1 billion by 2020. Odanacatib works through a new mechanism of action, by blocking a protein called cathespin K, and would compete with widely used older drugs called bisphosphonates that include Merck's own Fosamax.Bisphosphonates, leading treatments for osteoporosis, have raised concern because of rare cases of disintegration of jaw bone as well as femur fractures. Merck said the jaw condition had not been seen with odanacatib. Merck last year said it was delaying its application for odanacatib because it needed additional data from a clinical trial.As for sugammadex, the FDA declined to approve the injectable product in 2008, citing concerns about its possible association with allergic reactions and bleeding. Sugammadex has already been approved in more than 50 countries, where it is sold under the brand name Bridion. It generated worldwide sales of $73 million in the first quarter. But analysts believe the medicine, if approved in the United States, could generate annual sales of $500 million or more. Earlier on Tuesday, Merck said it would sell its consumer healthcare business for $14.2 billion to Germany's Bayer AG, adding to a string of major cross-border deals in the healthcare industry.Merck's consumer brands include Dr Scholl foot care, Coppertone sunscreen and its Claritin allergy medicine.

111,"  * AstraZeneca forecasts show variables in drug modelling* $45 bln sales prediction widely seen as over-optimisticBy Ben HirschlerLONDON, May 7 Ten-year sales forecasts from AstraZeneca - a central plank of its defence against a $106 billion bid approach from Pfizer - underscore how valuing drugs is an art as well as a science.While imponderables exist in any corporate valuation, pharmaceuticals are especially tricky, given the hazards of drug development and the long timelines of an industry where it typically takes 10 to 15 years to bring a new product to market.AstraZeneca's prediction of sales above $45 billion by 2023 was widely seen as over-optimistic by industry analysts who have a more conservative view on many of the myriad factors that feed into modelling future drug sales.One thing is certain: most experimental drugs fail.The average new drug has just a 6 percent chance of making it to market when it enters initial Phase I testing in humans, according to Thomson Reuters CMR International, which specialises in measuring pharmaceutical R&D performance.This rises to 69 percent by the time a new medicine reaches final Phase III clinical trials, and 90 percent once it is submitted for regulatory approval.""There will be things in our pipeline that won't work - that's par for the course,"" Briggs Morrison, AstraZeneca's global head of medicines development, said on Wednesday.Nonetheless, Morrison, who worked for Pfizer until 2012, believes his colleagues at AstraZeneca have honed the art of predicting future sales by blending the factors behind a new drug's commercial success. The first pass involves evaluating the technical aspects of whether a medicine actually works, followed by judging whether wary regulators are likely to give it a green light, and then finally assessing its likely market share and pricing.Given the many variables and the risk of over-promising and under-delivering, most drug companies prefer not to make long-term sales forecasts in normal times.But these are not normal times for AstraZeneca, and it hopes that by sharing key parts of its internal Long Range Plan, prepared for the board each year, it can prove it is worth a lot more than the 50 pounds per share offered by Pfizer. MOLECULAR ROULETTE For investors, pharmaceutical investment remains to a large degree a game of molecular roulette.Skimming through a 44-slide presentation on the new forecasts this week, AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot acknowledged the uncertainties but argued his group had one of the most compelling and visible pipelines in the industry.He compared his forecasts to those made by Genentech before it was acquired by Roche in 2009. In that case, the numbers were achieved, but the sales did not all come from the expected products.Overall, AstraZeneca believes its drug pipeline has a 36 percent chance of success, with potential peak annual sales of $63 billion translating to $23 billion on a risk-adjusted basis. But the success rate varies hugely from product to product.Alzheimer's drug AZD3293, which is about to enter Phase III testing and could in theory have annual sales of $5 billion, has a mere 9 percent probability of success, while the Phase III inhaled lung drug PT003 has a better than two-thirds chance.Competitors, too, can skew prospects. AstraZeneca's benralizumab for severe asthma, for example, faces a rival biotech drug from GlaxoSmithKline, and clinical trials for both will ultimately determine if it is a hit or a miss.Pricing is another major uncertainty, especially in specialty medicines where prices have gone through the roof in recent years, sparking a backlash in areas like hepatitis C.Morrison said AstraZeneca's forecasts assumed more pricing pressure over time, but he acknowledged there was a risk.""It's a problem - let's be candid,"" he said. ""You need creative ways of pricing that society will feel offer fair value.""That is relevant in the hot field of cancer medicine, where AstraZeneca is chasing Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co  and Roche in the emerging field of immuno-oncology, which involves using drugs to boost the body's immune system.AstraZeneca said it broadly agreed with forecasts that immuno-oncology could be a $28-35 billion a year market - but those numbers assume no dislocation in the current market that prices some cancer drugs at more than $100,000 per patient.Overall, AstraZeneca expects the pipeline to make up a third of sales by 2023, with the balance coming from existing drugs, where market expectations are more solid but still far from certain.The company's 2023 forecast for sales of $3.5 billion of heart drug Brilinta, for example, is far higher than the $1.3 billion consensus forecast for 2018 sales - a big gap that leaves many analysts scratching their heads.

116,"   By Bill Berkrot  When the world's leading cancer doctors meet in Chicago next month, new treatments from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Roche Holding AG that help the immune system fight disease are expected to capture much of the spotlight. The drugs, known as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 therapies, are biotech medicines that work by blocking a tumor's ability to camouflage itself, thereby allowing T cells in the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer.They have shown great promise against advanced melanoma - the deadliest of skin cancers - as well as advanced lung and kidney cancers, with relatively mild side effects, generating  excitement among researchers and investors. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago beginning May 30, researchers will for the first time present data on Roche's anti-PDL1 drug in advanced bladder cancer for which there have been few advances in decades. Merck will have no less than 16 studies involving its highly touted anti PD-1 drug, MK-3475, including a first look at the drug as an initial lung cancer treatment. Early data released on Wednesday showed 36 percent of 45 patients had an initial immune response to the treatment. Merck will also provide results from the first trial of the drug in head and neck cancer.Brief summaries, or abstracts, of thousands of studies to be presented at the ASCO meeting were released on Wednesday. ""This area should represent a major advance in cancer therapy and patient survivability,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager for the healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. ""Wall Street is increasingly recognizing the multibillion-dollar potential for cancer immunotherapies."" The potential for lasting effects of these drugs will be on display in a pair of studies involving the Bristol-Myers anti PD-1 drug nivolumab.Researchers will present follow-up data from a 107-patient nivolumab study in metastatic melanoma showing that 41 percent were still alive after three years, an apparent leveling off from the 48 percent survival rate after two years.Three-year survival with advanced melanoma was virtually unheard of prior to the advent of cancer immunotherapy.In a trial of patients whose advanced kidney cancer had progressed following prior treatments, the mean overall survival was 25.5 months for the 2 milligram nivolumab dose. Past kidney cancer studies of drugs currently in use have demonstrated a mean survival of about 14 months, said Fouad Namouni, Bristol's head of global development for nivolumab.MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT  As drugmakers face greater scrutiny over how they price new therapies - with immuno-oncology expected to be among the most expensive - several studies will aim to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the new treatments.Researchers can now perform a test to determine the degree to which the PD-L1 protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. On a 0 to 3 scale, a score of 0 or 1 is considered PD-L1 negative, while 2 or 3 is deemed PD-L1 positive.If early data is confirmed in larger trials, this class of immunotherapies could become standalone treatments for some patients, while PD-L1 negative patients may require combination or alternative therapies, according to some researchers.In a small, Phase I study of Bristol's nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, five out of 10 PD-L1 positive patients saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent. No such responses were seen among 7 PD-L1 negative patients.

117,"  (Adds more information on Bristol-Myers Phase III plan in final paragraph)By Bill BerkrotMay 14 When the world's leading cancer doctors meet in Chicago next month, new treatments from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Roche Holding AG that help the immune system fight disease are expected to capture much of the spotlight.The drugs, known as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 therapies, are biotech medicines that work by blocking a tumor's ability to camouflage itself, thereby allowing T cells in the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer.They have shown great promise against advanced melanoma - the deadliest of skin cancers - as well as advanced lung and kidney cancers, with relatively mild side effects, generating  excitement among researchers and investors.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago beginning May 30, researchers will for the first time present data on Roche's anti-PDL1 drug in advanced bladder cancer for which there have been few advances in decades.Merck will have no less than 16 studies involving its highly touted anti PD-1 drug, MK-3475, including a first look at the drug as an initial lung cancer treatment. Early data released on Wednesday showed 36 percent of 45 patients had an initial immune response to the treatment. Merck will also provide results from the first trial of the drug in head and neck cancer.Brief summaries, or abstracts, of thousands of studies to be presented at the ASCO meeting were released on Wednesday. ""This area should represent a major advance in cancer therapy and patient survivability,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager for the healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. ""Wall Street is increasingly recognizing the multibillion-dollar potential for cancer immunotherapies.""The potential for lasting effects of these drugs will be on display in a pair of studies involving the Bristol-Myers  anti PD-1 drug nivolumab.Researchers will present follow-up data from a 107-patient nivolumab study in metastatic melanoma showing that 41 percent were still alive after three years, an apparent leveling off from the 48 percent survival rate after two years. Three-year survival with advanced melanoma was virtually unheard of prior to the advent of cancer immunotherapy.In a trial of patients whose advanced kidney cancer had progressed following prior treatments, the mean overall survival was 25.5 months for the 2 milligram nivolumab dose.Past kidney cancer studies of drugs currently in use have demonstrated a mean survival of about 14 months, said Fouad Namouni, Bristol's head of global development for nivolumab. MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT As drugmakers face greater scrutiny over how they price new therapies - with immuno-oncology expected to be among the most expensive - several studies will aim to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the new treatments.Researchers can now perform a test to determine the degree to which the PD-L1 protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. On a 0 to 3 scale, a score of 0 or 1 is considered PD-L1 negative, while 2 or 3 is deemed PD-L1 positive.If early data is confirmed in larger trials, this class of immunotherapies could become standalone treatments for some patients, while PD-L1 negative patients may require combination or alternative therapies, according to some researchers.In a small, Phase I study of Bristol's nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, five out of 10 PD-L1 positive patients saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent. No such responses were seen among 7 PD-L1 negative patients.

121,"  (Adds background on Cialis, Viagra, regulatory issues)NEW YORK May 28 Sanofi and Eli Lilly and Co on Wednesday said they would ask health regulators for permission to sell Cialis, the world's top-selling anti-impotence drug, without a prescription.Currently available by prescription only, the tablet was first approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2002 and then by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003.It is one of Lilly's biggest products, having generated almost $2.2 billion in worldwide sales last year. The drug is also approved to treat enlarged prostate glands.Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi is buying the exclusive rights to apply for approval of Cialis tablets over the counter in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. Terms of the licensing agreement were not disclosed. The tablet would be sold by Sanofi's consumer healthcare unit, which had sales last year of $4.1 billion from a wide array of non-prescription brands, including vitamins and treatments for allergies, coughs, colds and the flu.It remains to be seen, however, whether regulators will allow Cialis to be sold without a prescription, in view of possible side effects. Like rival anti-impotence drugs, such as Pfizer Inc's Viagra, Cialis can cause a dangerous fall in blood pressure if taken with nitrates, a class of heart drugs that include nitroglycerin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in weighing whether to allow prescription drugs to be sold over the counter, weighs whether patients are able to understand complex aspects of their disease, or exactly when to take the drug to ensure safe use.The FDA in 2008, for instance, rejected Merck & Co's  bid to sell its Mevacor cholesterol-lowering drug without a prescription, after an independent panel of medical experts expressed concern that patients might take it instead of more-effective newer medicines. Cialis will face competition from cheaper generics in the United States in 2017, the same year that Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries is expected to begin selling generic prescription forms of Viagra under an agreement reached with Pfizer last year.Viagra, the first drug to treat impotence, was approved by U.S. regulators in 1998. It has annual sales of about $1.5 billion.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2014-05-28,MRK,"Wed May 28, 2014 | 4:07pm EDT","UPDATE 1-Sanofi, Lilly pursue Cialis over-the-counter approval",http://www.reuters.com//article/sanofi-lilly-cialis-idUSL1N0OE1P920140528?type=companyNews
122,"   By Deena Beasley  A highly anticipated new immunotherapy from Merck & Co Inc proved effective in patients with advanced melanoma as well as some with lung cancer or head and neck cancer, according to early-stage studies presented on Monday.Merck filed in January for U.S. Food and Drug approval of MK3475, now known as pembrolizumab, as a treatment for melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. But the drug's biggest sales opportunity is expected to be in treating lung cancer, which causes the most cancer deaths in the United States each year.The drug is part of an emerging class of medications that work by blocking a protein called PD-1, or Programmed Death receptor, used by cancer cells to evade the body's immune system.Morningstar has estimated that Merck's peak annual sales of pembrolizumab could reach $6 billion.A Phase I study in 411 patients with melanoma that had spread to other parts of the body found that 69 percent were alive after a year of treatment. At 18 months, researchers estimated that overall survival was 62 percent, with some patients on the drug for more than two years. The findings were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.Patients with metastatic melanoma often have high levels of PD-L1 protein in their tumors. When PD-L1 attaches to its receptor PD-1 on immune cells, tumors are able to hide from the immune system; drugs that target either PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibit this interaction.More than half the patients in the melanoma trial had previously been treated with ipilimumab, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co under the brand name Yervoy. It is part of a class known as CTLA-4 blockers that work by unleashing a different part of the immune system. Overall, 34 percent of patients had tumor shrinkage after treatment with Merck's drug, including 40 percent not treated with ipilimumab and 28 percent whose cancer worsened despite ipilimumab. The most common immune-related adverse events included thyroid problems. Four percent of patients stopped treatment due to side effects.""In general, this is probably the safest drug I have ever used in metastatic melanoma patients,"" said Dr Antoni Ribas, professor of hematology-oncology at the University of California, Los Angeles and the study's lead investigator. A separate arm of the trial - 45 previously untreated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who tested positive for PD-L1 - showed by one measurement that 47 percent had tumor shrinkage. A different measurement showed that 26 percent of those patients responded to the drug.Two different methods were used because standard measures can underestimate the impact of drugs that work by targeting the immune system, said Dr Alise Reicin, Merck vice president oncology.She estimated that around 70 percent of advanced non small-cell lung cancer patients have tumors that express PD-L1.Merck said the median duration of response had not been reached in the lung cancer trial, with some patients continuing on the drug for at least a year. Results for a trial segment involving 217 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had previously been treated with other drugs were slated for presentation at the ASCO meeting on Tuesday.Dr Reicin declined to comment on when Merck would file for regulatory approval of pembrolizumab as a treatment for lung cancer. The company did say it plans to launch in September a Phase III study comparing the drug to chemotherapy in previously-untreated patients with PD-L1 positive, advanced NSCLC.Merck on Sunday presented data from a small number of patients with advanced head and neck cancer who were treated with pembrolizumab. Of the patients deemed to be high expressers of PD-L1, 45 percent experienced tumor shrinkage, compared with 11 percent for the overall group.The FDA is slated to decide by late October whether to approve pembrolizumab for patients with advanced melanoma previously treated with ipilimumab.Merck is studying pembrolizumab across more than 30 types of cancers, as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with other drugs.Drugs targeting either PD-1 or PD-L1 are also under development at companies including Roche AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Bristol-Myers.",2014-06-02,MRK,"Mon Jun 2, 2014 | 7:34am EDT","Merck immune system-booster effective in skin, lung cancer",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-health-cancer-merck-co-idUSKBN0ED12120140602?type=companyNews

126,"   By Ransdell Pierson  An infectious disease expert and former head dealmaker at Merck & Co is racing against his ex-employer and other drugmakers to develop a treatment for a germ that ravages the colon and kills as many as 14,000 Americans each year.Roger Pomerantz on Monday became chief executive officer of privately held Seres Health, whose lead product has proven highly effective against the c. difficile bacteria in early-stage clinical trials. The condition occurs in patients who have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill off ""friendly"" bacteria in the gut, allowing c. difficile to take root and prosper there. It causes colitis, including serious diarrhea and fever that can recur and are not well-controlled by current treatments. The infections, which are most dangerous for the elderly and others with weakened immune systems, typically occur in hospitals, nursing homes and doctor's offices, but are becoming more common in the community at large.Some industry analysts have said effective treatments against c. difficile could have blockbuster sales potential.   The Seres oral capsule, called SER 109, in early clinical trials quickly eliminated symptoms in more than 90 percent of patients, Pomerantz said in a telephone interview. All patients previously had multiple recurrences of c. difficile after standard antibiotic treatments such as vancomycin and metronidazole.Rather than killing c. difficile, SER 109, which contains spores from bacteria initially harvested from human stool, restores balance to the microbiome, where millions of types of bacteria interact in the colon, Pomerantz said.""There's no ick factor,"" he said. ""There's no stool in our capsules, just (bacterial) spores"" that have been replicated countless times on laboratory dishes, refined and purified. Mid-stage trials of SER 109 involve about 40 patients and are being conducted at numerous centers, including the Mayo Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital. They should be completed in the next six weeks, after which Seres aims to conduct late-stage studies, Pomerantz said. ""We have multiple large pharmaceutical companies interested in our company,"" Pomerantz said, but he would not comment about any possible licensing plans. Merck's injectable treatment, called MK-3415A, is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies that do not target c. difficile itself but instead block toxins produced by the germ. It is now in late-stage studies.  Pomerantz, who once headed infectious disease research for Johnson & Johnson, joined Merck in 2010 in a similar capacity. Soon afterward he took charge of business development, overseeing licensing deals and acquisitions.But he left Merck last summer after an executive reshuffling and in November became chairman of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Seres, a role he retains.Pomerantz said SER 109 and other Seres products also could treat diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, diseases the microbiome is believed to affect.

136,"  Merck & Co Inc's (MRK.N) research chief Roger Perlmutter said the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker would consider big acquisitions of biotech companies for their medicines, rather than to obtain their drug-development technologies.Perlmutter, speaking on Thursday to analysts and investors at the annual Goldman Sachs healthcare conference being held near Los Angeles, said Merck continues to have an appetite for deals following its planned $3.85 billion purchase of Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc IDIX.O.Merck earlier this week announced its agreement to buy Idenix, and  plans to combine the two companies' most promising oral drugs for hepatitis C to produce a faster, more effective cure for the often-fatal liver infection affecting 170 million people worldwide.Perlmutter on Thursday said Merck has been a pioneer in development of hepatitis C drugs, including injectable interferon medicines that had been the backbone of therapy but which are now being sidelined in favor of more effective and better-tolerated drugs. He said newer Merck drugs, including a hoped-for triple therapy using an experimental Idenix treatment called IDX21437, will make Merck a top hepatitis C competitor in years to come.""The best (drug) regimen that has a fair cost proposition will take a substantial part of the market and that's where I want to be,"" he said.

138,"   By Andrew Longstreth | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Within the next two weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in a major case that could make it much harder for shareholders to band together against public companies in securities fraud class actions. If the court rules in favor of Halliburton (HAL.N) and against a group of shareholders, then the oilfield services company won't be the only business to gain. A handful of other major companies would also likely reap immediate benefit.Those companies, including drug makers Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), banks HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) and Regions Financial Corp (RF.N), and casino company Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N), are defendants in shareholder lawsuits that have been granted class action status. A decision setting a higher bar for class actions would not end the lawsuits, but it would allow these defendants to file briefs demanding that shareholders have to again seek court approval for the status - and this time under a new, tougher standard. If they fail to get that approval, the cases would effectively end.In 2013, settlements were reached in 67 cases totaling $4.8 billion, according to Cornerstone Research. A ruling in the oil company's favor in Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund could save other businesses facing pending class actions hundreds of millions of dollars collectively. Around 200 shareholder class actions are filed every year alleging that misleading statements and material omissions made by companies and their executives caused a stock’s share price to drop. Nearly 400 shareholder securities class actions are  pending in various stages of litigation, according to data gathered by the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.But only a relatively small number of the pending cases have been granted class action status. In each instance, a judge must determine at a certification hearing whether the status is appropriate. One consideration is whether the people in the class have common issues or merely related ones. To be a class, they must have common issues.'FRAUD ON THE MARKET' Class certification is a critical stage in shareholder class actions because it puts pressure on defendants to settle by increasing the liability they face. Generally, the larger the class size, the more damages a company faces and the more that plaintiffs' lawyers can make. Law firms can receive as much as a third of the settlement in attorneys' fees.In the case before the Supreme Court, Halliburton is seeking to overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, which adopted the “fraud on the market theory.” Under the theory, a defendant's material misrepresentation that affects the price of publicly traded securities is presumed to have been relied on by a purchaser who suffered a loss.That theory assumes public information about a company is known to the market and plaintiffs do not have to show that they relied on a specific misrepresentation, only that they purchased shares before the truth came out.In the case against Halliburton, shareholders alleged it understated asbestos liabilities while overstating both  revenues in its engineering and construction business and the benefits of its merger with Dresser Industries. The court has several options, including leaving intact Basic v. Levinson to maintain the status quo. At the other extreme, it could overturn Basic v. Levinson - and so doom securities class actions by requiring plaintiffs to show they relied on misinformation when they purchased securities. A third option would be to find a middle ground that would require plaintiffs to show that the misrepresentation had a significant effect on the stock price but that would not overturn Basic. During oral arguments, some of the justices appeared to signal that the middle option would be their preference. The middle option would still be a win for the defendant corporations by creating more hurdles for shareholders to clear before being allowed to sue as a group.Merck is facing one of the largest pending shareholder cases that already has class action status. The lawsuit, filed in 2005, alleges that the company made misleading statements about its painkiller drug Vioxx, which the company withdrew from the market in 2004 over concerns that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The plaintiffs alleged that after Merck disclosed the problems with Vioxx, its market capitalization shrunk by billions of dollars.In January 2013, U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler of New Jersey certified a class of individuals and entities who purchased Merck securities from May 21, 1999, to Sept. 29, 2004. HALT IN THE PROCEEDINGS Foreshadowing the potential impact of the Halliburton decision, a lawyer for Merck in November asked a federal judge in New Jersey to put a halt to proceedings in the case pending the outcome of the Supreme Court decision in Halliburton. The lawyer said the plaintiffs’ case rested squarely on the fraud on the market theory and that part of the case would likely have to be re-litigated following the Halliburton decision. The court denied the request. Merck and an attorney for the plaintiffs had no comment on the potential impact of Halliburton on the case.HSBC could also benefit from the Supreme Court’s ruling. The bank is appealing a $2.46 billion judgment against one of the company’s units, formerly known as Household International Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that Household was engaged in systemic predatory lending and that it misrepresented the credit quality of its loan portfolio.The judgment, entered by a federal judge in Chicago last year, was the largest ever following a securities fraud class action trial, according to the plaintiffs’ law firm.On appeal to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for HSBC are seeking an order vacating the judgment and sending the case back to the district court. In a brief filed in February, HSBC said that if the Supreme Court jettisons Basic’s presumption of reliance on a misrepresentation, a class status review ""will be beyond question.”Pfizer is facing a trial later this year over allegations made by shareholders that it fraudulently misrepresented the safety of its Celebrex and Bextra pain-relieving drugs. The lawsuit covers investors who bought Pfizer stock between Oct. 31, 2000, and Oct. 19, 2005, a period in which the company's share price fell by roughly half and its market value tumbled by well over $100 billion.Pfizer and the plaintiffs agreed to delay the trial until after the Halliburton decision. In a letter to the court, Pfizer said it believed that after the Halliburton decision, it “may be necessary to revisit class certification or other pre-trial motion practice.”",2014-06-12,MRK,"Thu Jun 12, 2014 | 11:35am EDT","Merck, Pfizer, HSBC could be big winners from shareholder case",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-court-halliburton-analysis-idUSKBN0EN10620140612?type=companyNews

On Tuesday, Bayer said that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had approved the Merck deal, which was the largest in the German healthcare sector since Bayer bought rival Schering for 17 billion euros ($24 billion) in 2006. Antitrust clearance in some other markets remains outstanding.But with Bayer's existing OTC medicines business listing products like aspirin and Canesten antifungal creams, some are questioning the logic of it wanting to keep everyday products like sunscreen.""They aren't really part of the core business and don't have much to do with medicines in the strict sense,"" said Warburg Research analyst Ulrich Huwald.Offloading Dr. Scholl's foot care and Coppertone, which account for 27 percent of the Merck bundle's combined annual sales, would allow Bayer to focus on Merck's core healthcare products such as allergy remedy Claritin and MiraLAX laxative, analysts say, and give it the resources to make the most of those brands. Repeated comments by chief executive Marijn Dekkers in the past that Bayer - the inventor of aspirin - is mainly about life sciences and molecular research, seem to have given hope to consumer goods companies that he might yet have wanted to part with brands that have little to do with healthcare.Reckitt Benckiser, which owns the Scholl foot care brand outside the United States, as well as Beiersdorf and L'Oreal were seen as potential acquirers. Officials at the three companies declined to comment.GOING FOR SHELF SPACE?

146,"  (Adds background on Sovaldi, rival drugs)By Ransdell PiersonJuly 11 Two members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, including Chairman Ron Wyden, on Friday asked Gilead Sciences Inc to defend the more than $80,000 cost of its breakthrough  treatment for hepatitis C, citing the expense to federal healthcare programs.""Given the impact Sovaldi's cost will have on Medicare, Medicaid and other federal spending, we need a better understanding of how your company arrived at the price for this drug,"" the lawmakers said in a release. ""It is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi.""Sovaldi's cost can soar to $168,000 in patients that need longer treatment periods, not including the costs of other drugs used with it, the senators said. Gilead acquired Sovaldi (sufosbuvir) in 2012 by paying more than $11 billion for Pharmasset Inc. The deal began to bear fruit after Sovaldi produced stellar results in late-stage clinical trials and was approved by U.S. regulators late last year.The nucleotide analog inhibitor, or ""nuke,"" blocks a protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. Other companies, including Merck & Co, are developing their own nukes and other new types of hepatitis C treatments. The criticism from the two senators follows complaints from private healthcare insurers about the price of the most potent new treatment for the dangerous liver disease, which affects more than 3 million Americans.Gilead's pill, which cures patients more quickly than older drugs, and with fewer side effects, captured $2.3 billion in sales during its first full quarter on the market, a record for the drug industry. The drugmaker has defended the price, saying Sovaldi reduces overall treatment costs for hepatitis C by lowering the number of required healthcare visits and sidestepping the need for other medicines that treat side effects of older therapies.Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and committee member Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said in a letter to Gilead Chief Executive Officer John Martin that Sovaldi's price could also dramatically increase the cost of caring for an estimated 1.8 million prisoners infected with the hepatitis C virus.The senators said Pharmasset, before being acquired by Gilead, had expected to profitably sell the drug in the United States for $36,000, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents.

148,"   By Ransdell Pierson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Pfizer Inc's vulnerability to cheaper generics and its weak roster of experimental medicines will be on display Tuesday when the company reports quarterly earnings, reviving interest in its pursuit of AstraZeneca Plc or other deals to fortify its pipeline.The largest U.S. drugmaker, whose laboratories have not come up with any big-selling new medicines for a decade, is expected to report significantly lower second-quarter revenue.While many industry watchers expect Pfizer to re-engage with Britain's AstraZeneca in coming months, some say the U.S. drugmaker should consider targets more focused on biotechnology, a strategy that has paid off for Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Although Pfizer is conducting trials of promising products - including breast cancer drug palbociclib and vaccines against meningitis and staph aureus - it needs far more drugs to generate meaningful sales growth, said Ori Hershkovitz, analyst with the Tel Aviv-based Sphera Fund, which holds Pfizer shares.    ""Pfizer is in a very desperate spot, having seen most of its pipeline disappoint and facing multiple patent expirations,"" he said. ""It needs growth; it needs to buy a pipeline."" Pfizer on May 26 officially abandoned its six-month quest for AstraZeneca after its final $118 billion offer was spurned. Investors still see a rationale for the deal, which would allow Pfizer to enjoy lower corporate tax rates as a UK-based company and a promising pipeline of new cancer treatments. Under British takeover law, AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer in August and Pfizer could make renewed overtures to its smaller rival in November.""I definitely think Pfizer will come back for Astra at a somewhat higher bid,"" Hershkovitz said. But he recommended Pfizer consider smaller targets whose treatments might broaden  its existing research priorities, such as Belgium's UCB SA and Switzerland's Actelion Ltd. UCB, which makes treatments for epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson's disease, has annual sales of $5 billion, and a market value of $17 billion. Actelion sells lucrative drugs for orphan diseases, rare and often life-threatening conditions that command high prices. It has annual sales of $2 billion and a market capitalization of $15 billion.  Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry has said it might make sense for Pfizer to buy Dublin-based generic drugmaker Actavis, which itself just bought U.S. specialty drugmaker Forest Laboratories for $25 billion.Disappointment with Pfizer is reflected in its stock price, which has fallen 1.4 percent this year, against a 11 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers. Over the past two years, its shares have risen 27 percent, versus a 44 percent jump for the drug sector.A fresh wave of patent expirations on Pfizer's top drugs is approaching. Its Celebrex painkiller faces generics in the United States late this year, while impotence treatment Viagra goes generic in 2017. The company's biggest product, Lyrica for nerve pain, loses U.S. patent protection by 2018. The three drugs have combined annual sales of almost $9 billion, and account for almost 20 percent of Pfizer's total revenue.     Biotechs with drugs already on the market and which also  have exciting technologies should be on Pfizer's wish list, said Navid Malik, analyst with London-based Cenkos Securities. He cited companies such as Celgene Inc and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.Roger Pomerantz, who headed business development at Merck from 2010 until last summer, said the potential of Merck's immuno-oncology drugs - medicines which train the immune system to recognize cancer cells - was not recognized even within the company for several years after it acquired them.""It's who you have on the inside helping you understand the science"" that counts, he said.

Nine of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors fell on the day.United Parcel Service shares fell 3.7 percent to $98.86 after the world's biggest courier company slashed its earnings forecast for the year due to spending to boost capacity. It also reported second-quarter earnings that were below expectations. Rival shipping company FedEx Corp was down 1.6 percent at $147.14. The Dow Jones Transportation index, which is often viewed as a proxy for business activity, fell 1.4 percent. It is about 3 percent away from the record closing high hit last week.UPS is the latest bellwether name whose results have disappointed investors, following Amazon.com Inc and Boeing Co last week. Nonetheless, this earnings season has largely been a positive for equities.With more than half the S&P 500 having reported already, almost 70 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, well above the long-term average of 63 percent. More than 63 percent have topped revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent.""If we started to see more negative outlooks, that would be a reason to pause, but so far this earnings season speaks to the health of corporate America and suggests markets still have room to run,"" said David Lebovitz, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. Telecom stocks were the only sector of the market to rise on Tuesday, adding 2.2 percent after Windstream Holdings  filed to spin off assets into a tax-efficient publicly traded real estate investment trust. The stock jumped 12.3 percent to $11.83 in its busiest trading day on record. Frontier Communications added 14.3 percent to $6.79.After the market closed, Twitter Inc jumped 14.5 percent to $44.20 in extended trading after the social networking company reported second-quarter results, which included revenue that more than doubled. The shares had closed up 1.7 percent in regular NYSE trade ahead of the results.Dow component American Express Co also reported after the market closed; its shares were little changed after the bell.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.16 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,912.43, the S&P 500 lost 8.93 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,969.98, and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 2.21 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,442.70. The Nasdaq's decline was tempered by biotechnology shares, with the Nasdaq Biotech index up 1.1 percent.Dow components Pfizer and Merck, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. drug companies, respectively, reported better-than-expected results. Merck's new drugs offset declining sales of those facing generic competition. Pfizer was helped by growing sales of its cancer medicines. Merck rose 1.1 percent at $58.58 while Pfizer shed 1.2 percent to $29.73.Corning Inc dropped 9.3 percent to $20 after reporting earnings that came in below estimates as demand fell for its Gorilla Glass, which is used in iPhones and Galaxy devices.Economic data had little impact on the direction of equities.U.S. consumer confidence jumped in July to a high not seen since October 2007, but single-family home prices fell 0.3 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, falling short of expectations.President Barack Obama said the United States was imposing new sanctions on Russia in the energy, arms and finance sectors, following similar moves by the European Union in reaction to Moscow's support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.About 57 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed lower on the day while about 47 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended in negative territory.

United Parcel Service shares fell 3.1 percent to $99.47 after the world's biggest courier company slashed its earnings forecast for the year due to spending to boost capacity. It also reported earnings that were below expectations.Rival shipping company FedEx Corp was down 0.8 percent at $148.36. The Dow Jones Transportation index, which is often viewed as a proxy for business activity, fell 0.7 percent. It is about 2.3 percent away from a record closing high hit last week.UPS is the latest bellwether name to disappoint in its results, following Amazon.com Inc and Boeing Co  last week. Nonetheless, this earnings season has largely been a positive for equities. With more than half the S&P 500 having reported, almost 70 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, well above the long-term average of 63 percent. More than 63 percent have topped revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent. ""If we started to see more negative outlooks, that would be a reason to pause, but so far this earnings season speaks to the health of corporate America and suggests markets still have room to run,"" said David Lebovitz, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York.Telecom stocks were by far the strongest of the day, up 2.7 percent after Windstream Holdings filed to spin off assets into a tax-efficient publicly-traded real estate investment trust. The stock jumped 12.8 percent to $11.88 in its busiest trading day on record. Frontier Communications added 11.1 percent to $6.60.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 28.61 points or 0.17 percent, to 16,953.98, the S&P 500 lost 4.13 points or 0.21 percent, to 1,974.78 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 4.78 points or 0.11 percent, to 4,449.69. The Nasdaq was boosted by biotechnology shares, with the Nasdaq Biotech index up 1.4 percent.Dow components Merck and Pfizer reported better-than-expected results. Merck's new drugs offset declining sales of ones facing generic competition and Pfizer was helped by growing sales of its cancer medicines. Merck rose 1.7 percent at $58.95 while Pfizer shed 0.9 percent to $29.83.Corning Inc dropped 9.8 percent to $19.90 after reporting earnings that came in below estimates.U.S. consumer confidence jumped in July to a high not seen since October 2007 but single-family home prices fell 0.3 percent in May on a seasonally-adjusted basis, falling short of expectations.The Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on monetary policy.

153,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Merck & Co Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of consumer products and medicines for arthritis and HIV, sending its shares up more than 1 percent in morning trading.  Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker, has been busy with deal-making in recent months, including an agreement to sell its consumer care business to Germany’s Bayer AG for $14.2 billion. In June, it agreed to buy Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc for $3.85 billion and hopes to combine the two companies' most promising drugs to produce a faster, more effective cure for hepatitis C.Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier, in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, said Merck was not interested in major acquisitions, but instead favors smaller ""bolt-on"" deals like the Idenix transaction.Merck is counting on its experimental drugs, including an immuno-oncology drug called pembrolizumab, to help drive revenue and earnings growth in coming years, Frazier said.The company plans to launch pembrolizumab by late October for treatment of melanoma and is testing the drug for cancers of the lung, head and neck and bladder. It plans to introduce insomnia drug Suvorexant, long been delayed by safety concerns, by late 2014 or 2015, if it is approved by regulators.""Merck will likely have another flattish year in 2014 in terms of financial performance but then growth should return more consistently thereafter,"" helped by new drugs, Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.

159,"   By Toni Clarke | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday it has approved a new insomnia drug made by Merck & Co.The drug, to be called Belsomra, is the first in a new class of sedatives that block chemicals in the brain called orexins that help keep people awake.Belsomra, known generically as suvorexant, has the potential to cause next-day sleepiness and impaired driving. As a result, the FDA said, no more than one pill should be taken per night and the dose should not exceed 20 milligrams.The FDA had asked Merck to study the next-day driving performance of people who took the drug amid concerns the sedative could lead to next-day drowsiness.The test showed impaired driving in patients who took 20 milligrams of the drug. Patients therefore ""should be cautioned against next-day driving or activities requiring full mental alertness,"" the FDA said in a statement.Even those who take a lower dose should be made aware of the potential for next-day driving impairment because individuals may respond differently to any given drug, the agency said. The FDA approved the drug in 5, 10, 15 and 20 milligram doses.Merck said it expects the drug to be available in late 2014 or early 2015, once the Drug Enforcement Administration has made its final decision on the scheduling of the drug.The FDA recommended that Belsomra be listed as a controlled substance because it can be addictive and has the potential to be abused. The DEA has proposed that the drug be given a Schedule IV designation. Schedule 1 drugs have the greatest potential for abuse while Schedule V drugs have the least potential.Merck's shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday to close at $57.85.Merck had originally proposed that non-elderly adults start on 20 milligrams and increase to 40 milligrams if needed. It recommended that elderly patients start by taking 15 milligrams and increase to 30 if necessary. FDA officials said at an advisory committee meeting in May 2013 that there was little evidence to show the drug was more effective at higher doses and considerable evidence to show it was less safe.""Using the lowest effective dose can reduce the risk of side effects, such as next-morning drowsiness,"" said Dr. Ellis Unger, an official in the FDA's drugs division.Merck said on Wednesday that the recommended dose of Belsomra is 10 milligrams within 30 minutes of going to bed, with at least seven hours before a patient needs to wake up. The drug is designed for people who have difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep.

162,"   By Deena Beasley | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES U.S. regulators are likely to approve Merck & Co's highly anticipated immuno-oncology drug, pembrolizumab, as a treatment for melanoma well ahead of a late October deadline, according to three sources familiar with the situation.If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the drug would be the first in a promising new class designed to help the body's own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells.Companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are racing to develop similar treatments for a variety of cancers. Some analysts expect the new class could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2025.The FDA is slated to decide on New Jersey-based Merck's application no later than October 28, but sources said the agency could give its approval within coming weeks. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the FDA's plans, also acknowledged that the early approval was not guaranteed.A spokeswoman for the FDA said the agency cannot discuss the status of applications.Merck is first seeking to sell its PD-1 drug for patients whose skin cancer does not respond to treatment with Yervoy, a Bristol-Myers immunotherapy that targets a different part of the immune system.Studies have shown that pembrolizumab shrinks tumors in about a third of patients with late-stage melanoma, a disease that kills around 10,000 Americans each year.""My hope is that over the next five to 10 years, we will be curing over half of melanoma patients,"" said Dr Steven O'Day, director of the Los Angeles Skin Cancer Institute.Dr Antoni Ribas, professor of hematology-oncology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a pembrolizumab trial lead investigator, said having the drug on the market will be ""a big deal"" for patients who currently have few options. ""If we have pembro approved, it makes a big difference. About a third of those patients will have a chance of a durable, long-lasting response,"" he said.Merck and its rivals are also studying PD-1 drugs as a treatment for several types of cancer. Lung cancer, which kills nearly 160,000 Americans annually, is seen as the biggest sales opportunity for the new class of treatments.Most current oncology treatments seek to kill cancer cells directly whereas immuno-oncology drugs unleash the body's own ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells, which medical  researchers say could have broader reach.A potential risk is that stimulating the immune system could cause side effects ranging from mild rash to more serious liver problems or colitis. FIRST IN LUNG CANCER    Bristol hopes to be first to the market with an immunotherapy for lung cancer. It is studying its experimental PD-1 drug, nivolumab, both as a stand-alone therapy and in combination with Yervoy, also known as ipilimumab, which inhibits a protein called CTLA-4. ""We believe a combination of immuno-oncology agents represents the best chance for patients to achieve long-term survival,"" said Michael Giordano, head of development, oncology and immunology, at Bristol.He said Bristol is submitting lung cancer data to the FDA on a rolling basis and expects to complete its application by year-end, which ""certainly gives us confidence that we are in the lead, potentially first in lung cancer."" Merck is not studying pembrolizumab in combination with its own experimental drugs, but does have studies underway with  drugs from Amgen and others. Merck is also conducting a study of the PD-1 drug in combination with its older melanoma drug Sylatron.""In oncology, combinations typically provide superior  benefit,"" Roger Perlmutter, head of research at Merck, said in a June interview. ""But picking them is tricky. We first need to understand it as monotherapy.""Perlmutter could not be reached for comment regarding pembrolizumab's approval timeline.Roche, granted FDA ""breakthrough therapy"" designation in June for its experimental drug MPDL3280A as a treatment for bladder cancer, is conducting a range of trials in various types of cancer, including combination treatment studies.""We have a broad pipeline of targeted therapies,"" said Sandra Horning, chief medical officer at Roche's Genentech unit.(This version of the story corrects paragraph 17 to remove reference to Novartis as a research partner) (Reporting By Deena Beasley; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Diane Craft)",2014-08-25,MRK,"Mon Aug 25, 2014 | 6:14pm EDT",Exclusive: U.S. approval of Merck cancer immunotherapy expected soon,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-merck-cancer-fda-idUSKBN0GP0VU20140825?type=companyNews
163,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Aug 25 Advaxis Inc on Monday said it will test an experimental immuno-oncology drug in combination with a high-profile immunotherapy from Merck & Co Inc as a treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer.The tiny U.S. biotechnology company, in its second cancer collaboration with a large drugmaker in the past month, said it would evaluate the use of its ADXS-PSA as a standalone treatment and also study it in combination with Merck's pembrolizumab in the Phase I/Phase II trial.Merck's drug is a member of an exciting new class of medicines called ""PD-1 inhibitors"" that work by blocking the PD-1 protein, thereby taking the brakes off immune system cells and prodding them to attack tumors.The Advaxis drug consists of a modified form of the Listeria bacterium fused to a protein called PSA that is shed by prostate tumors.

165,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Pfizer Inc said Tuesday it will test its Xalkori lung cancer drug with Merck & Co's experimental immunotherapy pembrolizumab, in hopes the combination will improve the outcomes for patients taking the approved Pfizer therapy.The largest U.S. drugmakers said the combination study will begin in 2015 and be conducted by Pfizer. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Xalkori, which has annual sales of $400 million and is also known by its chemical name, crizotinib, was approved in 2011 for lung cancer patients who have a specific mutation in the so-called ALK gene, as determined by an approved diagnostic test.The mutation occurs in a small percentage of patients with non small cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer. It makes them good candidates for treatment with Xalkori, a targeted drug that can help shrink or slow tumor growth for these patients.    Pembrolizumab works by removing the brakes from the immune system, allowing it to detect and destroy cancer cells. The differing mechanisms of action from combination therapy are meant to deliver a one-two punch to cancer cells.The Merck drug, called a PD-1 inhibitor, is expected to be approved within months in the United States and to become a blockbuster treatment for melanoma, and possibly later for lung cancer and other types of cancer, depending on results of ongoing clinical trials. Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Swiss drugmaker Roche and AstraZeneca Plc are leading the charge in developing PD-1 inhibitors or similar immunotherapies. Some industry analysts believe the medicines will capture combined annual sales of up to $30 billion by 2025. Merck and Pfizer previously said they would collaborate in combination trials of pembrolizumab both with Pfizer's approved Inlyta (axitinib) treatment for kidney cancer, and with an experimental drug called PF-2566 that Pfizer is evaluating in numerous cancer types.

Many European countries as well as China ban the import of zilpaterol-fed beef due to concerns about side effects of the  additive, which is used to aid growth in the weeks before animals are slaughtered.South Korea last year suspended some U.S. beef imports for more than two months after traces of zilpaterol were found in two shipments. An official at South Korea's food ministry confirmed on Tuesday that imports of beef muscle with 1 part per billion (ppb) of zilpaterol, 5 ppb in beef liver and 10 ppb in beef kidney had been approved as of late last month.""The approved levels are scientifically safe even if consumers have them for the rest of their lives,"" the official told Reuters by phone. ""The decision has come after asking farmers via months of public notices.""He noted the approved levels were lower than in other countries, such as the United States, which permits 12 ppb of zilpaterol in beef liver. South Korea delayed the decision to lift the ban for a month earlier this year after a request from China. The reason for the request was not known, the ministry official said on Tuesday.South Korea is a major importer of beef from Australia, the United States and New Zealand.Zilmax was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006.

The company also plans to file an FDA application by the end of this month for use of the drug, which is approved in Japan, for patients with advanced melanoma.

172,"  Sept 4 U.S. regulators on Thursday approved the use of Merck & Co Inc's immuno-oncology drug Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab, as a treatment for patients with advanced melanoma who are no longer responding to other therapies.The drug is the first in a promising new class designed to help the body's own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells. Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is diagnosed in around 76,000 Americans each year and around 10,000 will die from the disease annually, according to the National Cancer Institute. The FDA said in a statement that clinical trials of Keytruda showed that it shrank tumors in around 24 percent of patients with advanced melanoma whose disease worsened after prior treatment. The agency had designated Keytruda as a ""breakthrough therapy,"" and approved the drug nearly two months ahead of an  Oct. 28 decision deadline.

176,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Merck & Co said it will seek U.S. approval next year for its long-delayed experimental osteoporosis drug, odanacatib, after it proved effective in a late-stage trial but was associated with rare thigh-bone fractures seen with standard treatments. The once-weekly pill, deemed a potential blockbuster product by some industry analysts, significantly reduced risk of fractures of the hip and spine, and of non-vertebral fractures, compared with placebo, Merck said on Monday.The trial, called LOFT, involved almost 17,000 women, 65 years or older, who had been diagnosed with the bone-thinning disease that primarily affects postmenopausal women.Although the overall rate of side effects was similar in the two patient groups, those taking odanacatib had slightly higher incidence of death and atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause stroke.There were similar numbers of cardiovascular events in both patient groups, although a numerically higher incidence of strokes in the odanacatib group was not deemed statistically significant.Five patients taking odanacatib developed atypical fractures of the thigh-bone, compared with none in the placebo group. Similar rare femur fractures have been among the most worrisome side effects of the leading class of treatments, called bisphosphonates, which include Merck's own Fosamax and generic forms of it sold by others.Keith Kaufman, a senior Merck research official, said all patients who developed the thigh fractures had encountered some form of trauma and had severe osteoporosis. By contrast, he said many such fractures associated with bisphosphonates have been ""spontaneous.""    Kaufman noted that certain skin lesions occurred more often in patients taking odanacatib, than those in the placebo group, but said the condition went away or moderated after treatment was stopped. ""The safety profile (of odanacatib) has some red flags"" which could create concern among regulators, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note. Even so, he said odanacatib's benefits appear to outweigh its risks.Arfaei predicted the drug will be approved by early 2016 and have sales of $536 million in 2020.In a late-stage trial whose results were described in 2012, odanacatib demonstrated effectiveness in preventing fractures, boosting Wall Street hopes that the new type of osteoporosis treatment would be approved and eventually generate annual sales of up to $2 billion.  Merck initially planned to seek marketing approval in the first half of 2013. But the company early last year said it would delay its filing until 2014 because of certain ""safety issues"" that needed to be resolved in an ongoing extension of the LOFT study.Kaufman said the marketing application has now been delayed again, until 2015, ""to collect additional long-term data"" on the relative benefit and risk of odanacatib.Odanacatib works by blocking cathepsin K, an enzyme involved in the body's natural process of resorbing bone.Merck shares closed down 3 cents at $59.52 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

182,"   By Ludwig Burger | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Drugs and chemicals maker Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) agreed on Monday to acquire U.S.-based Sigma-Aldrich Corp SIAL.O for $17 billion in cash to boost its lab supplies business, the biggest takeover in the German group's history.The deal helps Merck, 70 percent controlled by the descendants of its 17th century founder, to focus more on supplying drugmakers and academic institutions with chemicals and services, seen as offering a steadier income stream than drug development.""With this acquisition we have the opportunity to turn one of our most reliable businesses into a core earnings contributor,"" said finance chief Marcus Kuhnert.Merck, which has been hit by several drug development failures, said it was happy for its own pharmaceuticals business to remain a medium-sized entity.The deal was approved by Sigma-Aldrich's management but still needs acceptance from more than 50 percent of the target's shareholders. Merck said it will acquire Sigma-Aldrich shares for $140 apiece, a 36 percent premium over the one-month average closing price and a 37 percent more than the latest closing price of $102.37 on Friday, Sept. 19.St Louis, Missouri-based Sigma had 2013 sales of $2.7 billion and provides big pharma groups including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Novartis AG NOVN.VS with lab substances such as cell culture substrates. It also makes chemicals for the technology sector and food testing products.The combined lab supplies business would gain more exposure in North America and Asia, taking on global players such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N). The deal would immediately top-up adjusted earnings per share. RECORD PACE The move comes as healthcare companies strike deals at a record pace, with year-to-date activity in the sector topping $380 billion, well over double the year-ago level, according to Thomson Reuters data.It represents the second major transatlantic deal for a German company in the space of a few hours, after Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) agreed to buy oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc DRC.N for $7.6 billion. Shares in Merck, which initially turned negative on the news, closed 4.3 percent higher at 72.63 euros, against a 0.2 percent lower European chemicals index .SX4P.Merck expects the tie-up, funded from about 2 billion euros in cash reserves and the issue of new debt, to yield annual synergy benefits of 260 million euros ($334 million) within three years after closing, by measures such as streamlining manufacturing, administration and research. It said it was too early to say if any jobs would be cut. The deal would more than double the lab equipment unit's adjusted core earnings, even without such synergy gains; including them, the increase would be 139 percent, based on proforma 2013 results.""The fact that (the Merck family) are not taking a big step further into pharma shows that continuous returns on their investment over time are certainly important to the family,"" said analyst Ulrich Huwald at brokerage Warburg.At about 6 billion euros in annual sales, Merck's pharmaceuticals unit is well outside the global top 20, having suffered a series of drug development setbacks such as with an experimental cancer vaccine known as tecemotide, or Stimuvax, which did not come to market due to poor study results. WAY FORWARD   The group said on Monday that alliances, not major takeovers, would be the way forward for the unit. ""The pharmaceuticals business (will) remain a good and solid mid-sized player"", Kley said.Merck had earlier this year signaled that big pharma assets were on its radar and some analysts took a positive view on the fact it had steered clear of such moves. Citi analyst Andrew Baum said in a note the acquisition came at a steep premium of about 30 times Sigma's expected 2015 earnings per share, but argued the deal was better than buying a biotech or pharmaceutical asset given what he said was Merck's ""long-standing poor track record in pharmaceutical R&D"". Merck, the largest maker of liquid crystals for TV and computer screens, made lab supplies a major pillar of its business when it purchased U.S. group Millipore for $6 billion in 2010. Combining with Sigma would make it one of the global market's top three, the group said.Merck's biggest deal before this one was the takeover of Swiss biotech company Serono for 10.3 billion euros.Initial bridge loans to finance the deal will be replaced by about 4 billion euros in bank loans and 7 billion euros in bonds. Merck said strong combined cash flows would allow for rapid deleveraging.Guggenheim Securities and JP Morgan advised Merck on the deal, together with law firm Skadden, while Morgan Stanley acted as financial adviser to Sigma-Aldrich, with Sidley Austin as legal adviser.

183,"   By Ben Hirschler | MADRID  MADRID Merck & Co's drug Keytruda, the first in a new wave of immune-boosting medicines to be approved for treating melanomas  in the United States, also has potential in stomach cancer, new research shows.Early clinical trial results reported on Sunday mean that gastric, or stomach cancer can be added to a growing list of tumor types where so-called immunotherapy may have an important role to play.Keytruda belongs to a drug class designed to help the body's own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells.On Sept. 4 it became the first drug of this type to win U.S. approval, although rivals including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca are working on similar products.While developed first for melanoma, these medicines are also showing promise in a range of other tumor types, including kidney, lung, bladder, and head and neck cancer. In a small Phase I study involving 39 patients with PD-L1 positive, advanced stomach cancer, a total of 12 people - or 31 percent - saw their tumors shrink after being given Keytruda, Kei Muro of Japan's Aichi Cancer Center Hospital told the European Society of Medical Oncology annual congress.Importantly, overall response rates were similar in Asian patients -- a population with a high rate of stomach cancer -- and non-Asian patients, Muro said.The Phase I clinical trial is continuing but at the time of analysis the duration of responses in individual patients ranged from more than eight weeks to more than 20 weeks.  Merck said it planned to start a larger Phase II study in the first quarter of 2015 on the back of the encouraging data.Common adverse side effects included thyroid problems and fatigue, while serious grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in three patients. There was one treatment-related death.Immunotherapy is dominating the meeting of oncologists in Madrid as excitement builds about an approach that promises to push many cancer patients into remission by unleashing the power of their own immune systems to fight tumors. Further data on Merck's drug as a treatment for bladder cancer is also due to be released on Monday in Madrid. Some analysts believe the new immunotherapy drug class could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2025 - a figure that reflects both the wide range of patients who could benefit and the high price of the medicines.The U.S. price for Keytruda is around $12,500 per month in melanoma patients, for whom the median duration of treatment has been 6.2 months.

There was one treatment-related death.Immunotherapy is dominating the meeting of oncologists in Madrid as excitement builds about an approach that promises to push many cancer patients into remission by unleashing the power of their own immune systems to fight tumours.Further data on Merck's drug as a treatment for bladder cancer is also due to be released on Monday in Madrid.Some analysts believe the new immunotherapy drug class could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2025 - a figure that reflects both the wide range of patients who could benefit and the high price of the medicines.The U.S. price for Keytruda is around $12,500 per month in melanoma patients, for whom the median duration of treatment has been 6.2 months.

187,"  (Adds share move, analyst forecast)By Bill BerkrotOct 1 An experimental cholesterol-fighting drug being developed by Esperion Therapeutics Inc lowered LDL levels significantly more than Merck & Co Inc's  Zetia in a midstage clinical trial, Esperion said on Wednesday.Esperion shares rose more than 40 percent in after-hours trade.In a 12-week study involving 348 patients with high LDL cholesterol, the Esperion drug, ETC-1002, led to an average 30 percent reduction in levels of the ""bad"" cholesterol for those who received a 180 milligram dose and a 27 percent reduction with a 120 mg dose, according to initial results.Both were deemed to be statistically significant differences compared with reductions in patients taking Zetia, known chemically as ezetimibe, Esperion said. The LDL reductions seen with the once-daily ETC-1002 pill were somewhat less than can be achieved by more powerful statins, such as Pfizer Inc's Lipitor, now available as generic atorvastatin, and AstraZeneca Plc's Crestor. The reductions were roughly half of the LDL-lowering magnitude seen with new injectable biotech cholesterol drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors, likely to be approved next year.The Esperion drug, when combined with 10 mg of Zetia, led to LDL reductions of 48 percent for the high dose of ETC-1002 and 43 percent with the lower dose.""These are very encouraging results. It basically shows efficacy, and it shows that it can be added to ezetimibe to get more efficacy,"" Dr. Christie Ballantyne, chief of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and one of the study's investigators, said in a telephone interview. ""Statins are going to stay first-line drugs,"" he said. ""There's lots of people who have a hard time taking a high dose of statin or taking a statin at all.""Esperion is also conducting trials combining its drug with various statins.If approved, the Esperion drug is almost surely going to be less expensive than the more effective biologics, making it a potential option that physicians could reach for before putting patients on the injectables, Ballantyne said. JMP Securities analyst Jason Butler has forecast annual peak sales in excess of $1 billion for the medicine.ETC-1002 also led to significantly greater reductions than Zetia in C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation associated with heart disease, the company said.ETC-1002 is the first in a new class of drugs called ACL inhibitors that work by reducing cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increasing expression of LDL receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood.The most common side effects were common cold symptoms and upper respiratory tract infections. The rates of muscle-related adverse side effects seen with ETC-1002 patients, including those with statin intolerance, were similar to rates for Zetia, Esperion said.Esperion shares rose to $35 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $24.42.

192,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating Merck &  Co.'s (Merck) Euro denominated senior unsecured notes offering. Merck intends to  use all or a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the offering to  refinance existing debt. The Rating Outlook is Negative and applies to approximately $23.1 billion in  outstanding debt. A full list of Merck's ratings follows near the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The Negative Outlook mainly reflects that leverage (total debt/EBITDA) has  remained above 1.5 times (x) since Merck's $5 billion, largely debt-funded share  repurchases in second-quarter 2013 (2Q'13). While leverage has declined to 1.52x  from its peak of 1.92x at June 30, 2013, the Oct. 1, 2014 sale of its consumer  business to Bayer will modestly weigh on EBITDA and leverage.  --Fitch expects that Merck will continue to favor share repurchases over  deleveraging, acknowledging the possibility of further debt-funded stock  buybacks. Notably, the company has roughly $7 billion remaining on its existing  repurchase authorization. --Sales at-risk to patent expiries have declined to roughly 20% of total firm  sales. Roughly one-third of those sales are generated by biologics, which tend  to have significantly less market share erosion in the face of generic  (biosimilar) than do traditional small molecule drugs. --Merck has made progress in building its late-stage pipeline. The company has  approximately 20 new molecular entities (NMEs) in phase 3 development or  registration. --Merck initiated a restructuring program in October 2013, which Fitch expects  will be supportive to margins during the intermediate term. Merck will focus on  costs in a number of areas including manufacturing, general administration and  research & development. --Fitch believes the sale of Merck's consumer business was strategically sound,  as it increasec the company's focus on its core mission of developing and  marketing innovative medicines. However, the sale incrementall decreases the  diversification of the company's business model. --Fitch expects modest growth for Merck's Januvia/Janumet franchise, as the  market becomes increasingly crowded with new entrants. Although, the growth in  the number of diabetic patients and some share gains from older generic  treatment modalities should offset the competitive headwinds. --Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $5.8 billion - $6.1 billion in FCF  during 2014 as improving margins offset soft revenue. Debt Financed Share Repurchases Fitch expects that Merck will continue with shareholder friendly actions during  the near term, some of which may be funded by debt. Merck purchased $2.3 billion  (net of issuances) of its common stock during the first six months of 2014. The  repurchases were executed under a $15 billion program authorized in May 2013 and  a previously authorized program. Merck has approximately $7 billion remaining  under the May 2013 share repurchase program.  Patent Exposure Easing Merck faces significant number of patent expiries during the next two years.  However, roughly only 20% of total firm sales are at risk. In addition, Remicade  and PEG-Intron (accounting for about 6.2% of total firm) are biologics and tend  not to experience the rapid sales loss to generic competition as do traditiona,  one small molecule pharmaceuticals. Expanding Late Stage Pipeline Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its late-stage pipeline, despite the  company's intention to narrow its focus its focus on R&D projects. Merck's late  stage pipeline is broad with new molecular entities (NMEs) to treat cancer,  bacterial and viral infections, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, central  nervous system disorders, osteoporosis, allergies and other maladies. The  September 2014 FDA approval of Keytruda was a significant milestone in Merck's  development of cancer treatments. While the majority of these projects are internally developed, Merck has  partnered with other innovator firms to take advantage of technological  advancements that were discovered externally. The landscape for drug development  is expanding, particularly as more is learned about how genetics influence the  development, prevention and treatment of disease.  Cost Cutting Continues In October 2013, Merck initiated a new global restructuring program, in an  effort to sharpen its global commercial and research & development focus. Merck  is working on reducing costs in the areas of sales, administration and research  & development. Merck continues to work towards improving the efficiency of its  manufacturing and supply network. The restructuring program is expected to be  substantially completed by the end of 2015. Estimated pre-tax restructuring  costs are approximately $2.5 billion - $3 billion, of which two-thirds will be  cash-related. Consumer Business Sale  Fitch believes the sale of Merck's consumer products business is a modest  negative for its credit profile, with the expectation that the proceeds of the  sales would not be used for debt reduction. While the consumer business  accounted for roughly 4% of total firm sales, Fitch estimates the segment's  contribution to Merck's total EBITDA is less than that. Regardless, Fitch  believes the negative effects of an incrementally less diversified product  portfolio and a lower base of profitability will more than offset the benefits  to the firm from increasing its focus on its core competency of drug development  and marketing in the near term. More Competition for Januvia/Janumet Fitch expects that the growing number of diabetic patients and continued market  share gains from some older generic diabetes treatments will more than offset  the increasing number of competitors in the diabetes treatment market. This will  result in relatively soft sales growth for Januvia/Janumet, Merck's largest  selling franchise. Growth has slowed in recent years due to competition (DPP-4  inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists) entering the diabetes market. In  addition, concerns over the safety of these drugs(DPP-4 inhibitors) have been a  headwind to growth. However, the FDA recently reaffirmed their safety regarding  pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.  Solid Free Cash Flow Expected Fitch forecasts that Merck will continue to generate significantly positive free  cash flow generate, including expected 2014 FCF of $5.8 billion - $6.1 in FCF  during 2014. Improving margins driven by an improving sales mix and strong cost  control should more than offset the negative effect that expected soft top-line  growth will have on cash generation. Adequate Liquidity Fitch looks for Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through strong FCF  generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending June  30, 2014 was $5.1 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had approximately  $13.4 billion in cash plus short-term investments and full availability on its  $4 billion revolver, maturing in May 2017.  At June 30, 2014, Merck had roughly $24.1 billion in debt outstanding. Fitch  expects near- to mid-term maturities will be satisfied primarily through  refinancing in the public debt markets. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch would consider revising the Rating Outlook to Stable if Merck pursued a  capital deployment strategy that maintained gross debt leverage below 1.5X  during the long term, including managing through operational stress such as  patent expiries and clearly taking a more conservative approach to its use of  debt. In addition, Merck must demonstrate long-term positive sales growth  through demand for core drug products and uptake of new medicines.  Rating pressure would stem from total debt leverage remaining above 1.5x in the  intermediate term. The high leverage would likely be driven by incremental  borrowing to fund acquisitions or share repurchases. Leverage pressure could  also result from operational weakness due to an inability to achieve in  achieving cost containment targets or generating sales growth despite is  improving patent risk profile and expanding late-stage pipeline. In addition,  Fitch anticipatates that FCF would be constrained in this scenario. Fitch currently rates Merck as follows:   --Long-term IDR 'A+';  --Senior unsecured debt rating 'A+'; --Bank loan rating 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating 'F1'. The Rating Outlook on the long-term ratings is Negative.

194,"   By Sophie Sassard and Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON Oct 14 GlaxoSmithKline is seeking binding bids by next month for a range of older drugs worth more than $3 billion, which it is likely to sell by geographical region, according to people with direct knowledge of the process.Potential bidders include private equity firm KKR, India's Lupin and Denmark's Lundbeck, all of which are interested in acquiring rights to products in certain regions.Britain's biggest drug maker is looking to divest the mature products in a bid to improve its growth profile and wants to dispose of off-patent drugs marketed in North America and western Europe.The medicines on the block, known as established products, are expected to have combined 2014 sales of around 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), although their sales are declining due to competition from cheap generic drugs.The sources said GSK was looking for a multiple of more than two times sales, suggesting a price of at least $3.2 billion.GSK, which is being advised by Lazard, aims to find buyers by the end of the year and is keen to maximise returns for shareholders, whether that means selling the products as a single unit or splitting them up by region, they added.Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck is reviewing a bid for products marketed in North America as it seeks to expand there, two of the sources said. KKR has teamed up with private Netherlands-based gastrointestinal specialist Norgine in a bid to acquire some of GSK's drugs sold in Europe, said the same people.Indian generics firm Lupin is also expected to participate in the second round of the auction and would be interested in products in the United States, said the sources.Other private equity funds with an interest in healthcare are also looking at some specific products. Some bidders might still emerge with an interest in the entire portfolio, although this scenario is seen as less likely.Acquiring GSK's older drugs would be more complicated for private equity funds than other drug manufacturers as GSK is not planning to sell the factories, which means the funds would need to outsource manufacturing and distribution operations. GSK, Lundbeck, KKR and Norgine all declined to comment.Lupin, meanwhile, has said for some months it wants to enhance its U.S. branded generics business and a company official previously confirmed to Reuters it was looking for deals, while declining comment on specific targets.SIGNIFICANT INTEREST  GSK Chief Executive Andrew Witty said in July that there had been significant interest from both mid-sized pharmaceutical companies and buyout specialists in the assets now on the block.The GSK brands up for sale include antidepressant Paxil, migraine treatment Imitrex, Zantac for stomach acid and Zofran for nausea. The company intends to retain the rights to such products in emerging markets, where they are still growing.Ditching mature products sold in Western markets makes long-term sense, since sales are declining. However, these items remain very profitable, so a sale may dilute earnings per share, which could further strain GSK's already stretched dividend cover.Sales of all GSK's established products - including those being retained - totalled 1.51 billion pounds in the first half of 2014, down 18 percent on a year earlier.GSK's decision to carve out some of its mature drug portfolio is part of a wider industry trend, with Mylan  agreeing in July to buy Abbott Laboratories' branded specialty and generics business in non-U.S. developed markets.Other companies including Sanofi and Merck & Co  are also looking at similar divestments.(1 US dollar = 0.6277 British pound)   (Additional reporting by Freya Berry and Anjuli Davies in London; editing by Susan Thomas)",2014-10-14,MRK,"Tue Oct 14, 2014 | 12:55pm EDT",Geographic split likely for GSK mature drugs sale -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/gsk-ma-mature-drugs-idUSL6N0S93D820141014?type=companyNews
195,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A subsidiary of Merck & Co has agreed to pay U.S. states $31 million to settle claims that it overcharged their Medicaid programs for an antidepressant it had sold at a discount to pharmacy companies, attorney generals from three states said on  Wednesday.The officials from Idaho, New York and Florida said Organon USA Inc offered the drug, Remeron, to nursing home pharmacies at a discount to encourage its use over competitors. At the same time, the company reported the full cost of the drug when seeking reimbursements from state Medicaid programs, the states claimed.New Jersey-based Organon, which did not admit any wrongdoing, also was accused of improperly promoting use of the drug by children and teens.  The agreement, which includes Washington, D.C., and every state besides Arizona, settled whistleblower lawsuits filed in 2007 in federal courts in Massachusetts and Texas. Under the deal, New York will receive about $2.5 million, Idaho about $53,000, and Florida $483,000, the states' attorney generals said in separate statements. “Preserving the integrity of our Medicaid program and weeding out those who seek to defraud it is a top priority for my office,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company was ""pleased to put this matter behind us."" Organon, originally based in the Netherlands, was acquired in 2007 by Schering-Plough Corp, which later merged with Merck.

At the same time, the company reported the full cost of the drug when seeking reimbursements from state Medicaid programs, the states claimed. New Jersey-based Organon, which did not admit any wrongdoing, also was accused of improperly promoting use of the drug by children and teens. The agreement, which includes Washington, D.C., and every state besides Arizona, settled whistleblower lawsuits filed in 2007 in federal courts in Massachusetts and Texas. Under the deal, New York will receive about $2.5 million, Idaho about $53,000, and Florida $483,000, the states' attorney generals said in separate statements. ""Preserving the integrity of our Medicaid program and weeding out those who seek to defraud it is a top priority for my office,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said.A spokeswoman for Merck said the company was ""pleased to put this matter behind us."" Organon, originally based in the Netherlands, was acquired in 2007 by Schering-Plough Corp, which later merged with Merck.

197,"  LONDON Swiss drugmaker Roche and U.S. group Merck & Co are to present data on their rival immunotherapy drugs in breast cancer in December, extending the novel approach to fighting tumors to another cancer type.Early clinical results with Roche's drug, known as MPDL3280A, in so-called triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be revealed at the Dec. 9-13 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the firm said after announcing third-quarter results.TNBC does not respond to either of two kinds of hormonal therapy or drugs that target HER2 receptors, such as Roche's own Herceptin.Merck later confirmed that it, too, would present data on TNBC with its competitor drug Keytruda at the same breast cancer meeting.Both drugs belong to a class designed to help the body's own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells. Developed first for melanoma, these medicines are also showing promise in a range of other tumor types. Roche's MPDL3280A, which is not yet approved for any type of cancer, is already being tested in melanoma, as well as lung, bladder, kidney, bowel and blood cancers. Merck's Keytruda became the first in the new wave of immune-boosting medicines to be approved for treating melanoma in the United States last month and is also being tested in a range of other tumor types.Some analysts believe the new immunotherapy drug class could generate more than $30 billion (18.66 billion pounds) in annual sales for the industry as a whole by 2025, reflecting both the wide range of patients who could benefit and the high cost of the medicines. The two other main rivals in the space are Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.

Adjusted core earnings at the CropScience unit rose by more than a quarter to 278 million euros, shored up by growth in recently launched products, in particular fungicides and herbicides.Bayer now aims to raise group EBITDA before special items by a mid-single-digit percentage, taking into account the acquisition of Merck & Co. Inc.'s consumer health business it wrapped up on Oct. 1 as well as more favourable currency effects. It had previously forecast a low to medium single-digit percentage gain.The euro was up slightly against the U.S. dollar on average over the third quarter but the European currency has lost about 8 percent against the dollar over the last six months, bolstering the euro-value of overseas revenues.Bayer, the inventor of Aspirin and maker of Yasmin birth-control pills, said pharmaceuticals sales rose by a currency- and portfolio-adjusted 10.3 percent to 3.04 billion euros, boosted by a better-than-expected 70 percent gain of sales in anti-clotting drug Xarelto, mainly used to prevent strokes in the elderly.

208,"   By P.J. Huffstutter  Merck & Co. is taking steps to resume sales of its controversial cattle feed additive Zilmax by changing the way the drug is administered, hoping to recapture some market share in the beef industry, where the U.S. herd has the fewest animals in more than 60 years.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved adjustments to the drug's label that would allow veterinarians and feedlot operators to use a lower dose and alternative method of feeding the drug to beef cattle, Merck said Wednesday. The new ""component feeding"" option would allow Zilmax, which can add up to 30 pounds of marketable meat to a 1,300-pound steer, to be fed in one smaller daily ration, rather than continually throughout the day, Merck nutritionist Dr. David Yates told Reuters. ""We began working on this component feeding (label change) several years ago,"" Yates said. The decision to do so was prompted by cattle producers, he said, looking for more ""efficiency and convenience at a feedyard.""In August 2013, Merck suspended sales of Zilmax in the United States and Canada amid concerns about animals showing signs of distress after use of the weight-gain product. A study published in March suggested that the number of U.S. cattle deaths that may be linked to Zilmax was much higher than the figures reported by the drug company to the federal government.U.S. regulators approved the label change on Friday, Yates said. The label still allows the drug to be fed continually to cattle.Merck, which said Zilmax is safe if properly used, also recently filed a proposed label update in Canada. When Zilmax was pulled off the market, many U.S. feedlot operators switched to ractopamine-based Optaflexx, made by Merck rival Eli Lily & Co.'s Elanco Animal Health unit.

209,"  (New throughout, adds details, interview, adds  byline)By P.J. HuffstutterNov 5 Merck & Co. is taking steps to resume sales of its controversial cattle feed additive Zilmax by changing the way the drug is administered, hoping to recapture some market share in the beef industry, where the U.S. herd has the fewest animals in more than 60 years.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved adjustments to the drug's label that would allow veterinarians and feedlot operators to use a lower dose and alternative method of feeding the drug to beef cattle, Merck said Wednesday.The new ""component feeding"" option would allow Zilmax, which can add up to 30 pounds of marketable meat to a 1,300-pound steer, to be fed in one smaller daily ration, rather than continually throughout the day, Merck nutritionist Dr. David Yates told Reuters.""We began working on this component feeding (label change) several years ago,"" Yates said. The decision to do so was prompted by cattle producers, he said, looking for more ""efficiency and convenience at a feedyard."" In August 2013, Merck suspended sales of Zilmax in the United States and Canada amid concerns about animals showing signs of distress after use of the weight-gain product.A study published in March suggested that the number of U.S. cattle deaths that may be linked to Zilmax was much higher than the figures reported by the drug company to the federal government.U.S. regulators approved the label change on Friday, Yates said. The label still allows the drug to be fed continually to cattle. Merck, which said Zilmax is safe if properly used, also recently filed a proposed label update in Canada.When Zilmax was pulled off the market, many U.S. feedlot operators switched to ractopamine-based Optaflexx, made by Merck rival Eli Lily & Co.'s Elanco Animal Health unit. Elanco's patent on ractopamine has expired, and Zoetis Inc's  generic products are eating into Elanco's dominance. Zoetis said on Tuesday that sales of livestock products grew 12 percent in the company's third-quarter, compared to the year-ago period.If Zilmax becomes available to U.S. feedlots again, it could appeal to U.S. livestock industry scrambling for tonnage.

210,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Merck & Co on Monday said long-awaited data from an 18,000-patient trial suggest the company will not have to write down the value of its blockbuster Zetia and Vytorin cholesterol drugs. ""The company has determined that the Zetia and Vytorin intangible assets are not impaired,"" the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker said on Monday in a regulatory filing, noting its assessment was based on having seen ""unblinded"" data from the huge study.Merck's statement suggests that the study, meant to determine whether Zetia can prevent heart attacks, strokes and deaths, proved favorable to its $2.5 billion-a-year drug. A related Merck drug, Vytorin, pairs Zetia with Merck's statin Zocor (simvastatin), and has annual sales of $1.5 billion.Pam Eisele, a Merck spokeswoman, said the company had no further comment on the trial results, or their likely financial impact on Zetia and Vytorin.   Merck almost a decade ago began the study, called IMPROVE-IT, to determine whether adding Zetia to simvastatin is better at preventing heart attacks, deaths and strokes than simvastatin alone.Trial results are slated to be unveiled on Nov. 17 in Chicago, at the annual scientific sessions of the American Heart Association. Merck earlier this year warned that it might have to write down the value of Zetia and Vytorin if the study did not prove Zetia provided an incremental benefit to patients.Zetia, which prevents absorption of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the intestines, was approved by U.S. regulators in 2002 based on its ability to lower cholesterol 25 percent beyond reductions seen with simvastatin alone. Statins work by reducing the liver's production of cholesterol, and can cut LDL levels by 50 percent or more. No previous studies have ever proven conclusively whether Zetia or Vytorin actually improve patient outcomes.Despite longstanding doubts about Zetia's effectiveness, many doctors have prescribed it and Vytorin on the assumption that Zetia's demonstrated ability to further lower cholesterol will lead to better patient outcomes.

219,"   By Bill Berkrot  An attempt by Merck & Co to shorten hepatitis C treatment to just four weeks by adding Gilead Sciences Inc's huge selling Sovaldi to its own oral two-drug combination came nowhere near the desired efficacy due to a high rate of relapses, according to interim data from a midstage study.Several companies have been working to find ways to further reduce the number of weeks of treatment needed, while keeping cure rates above 90 percent.A just approved pill called Harvoni that combines Sovaldi  with another Gilead drug requires eight weeks of treatment for many patients, and longer for tougher to treat patients.In the ongoing Merck trial of previously untreated patients, only 38.7 percent had no detectable sign of the liver destroying virus after four weeks of treatment with Sovaldi and Merck's grazoprevir/elbasvir combination. Nineteen of the 31 patients in the four-week treatment arm relapsed prior to the planned end of the study, which is 12 weeks after completion of dosing. The preliminary data was set to be presented on Monday at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting in Boston.The best result so far in the multi-arm, three-drug study called C-Swift was observed with eight weeks of treatment of patients with cirrhosis in which 94.7 percent had no detectable virus. They will be deemed cured if the virus has not reappeared 12 weeks after stopping treatment.With a six-week regimen in non-cirrhotics, 86.7 percent of patients had no sign of virus up to 8 weeks after completing treatment, according to the interim results. ""These findings will inform the design of larger studies aimed at understanding the potential of short-duration triple therapy across multiple patient types,"" Dr. Eric Lawitz, the study's lead investigator, said in a statement.The three drugs each work in a different way to help prevent the virus from replicating. But following failure of the 4-week experiment, Merck said it will turn its attention to studying a combination of three of its own drugs in development rather than involving the Gilead medicine in future studies.

220,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Rare mutations in a single gene may help lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of a heart attack by half, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday in a study that could have implications for Merck and Co's closely watched heart drug Zetia.The study involved individuals with mutations in a gene called NPC1L1, the gene targeted by Zetia, a cholesterol fighter known generically as ezetimibe.While common cholesterol fighters known as statins keep the body from making cholesterol, Zetia blocks the body's ability to absorb cholesterol in the gut. And while there is clear evidence that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks, there is scant evidence to show that Zetia does much more than lower cholesterol.That is where the new genetic study comes in.Researchers at the Broad Institute and Washington University in St. Louis combed through data on some 113,000 people from multiple studies looking for individuals with rare mutations that shut off the activity of NPC1L1. They found 82 people who inherited a single mutated copy of this gene, leaving them with one working copy. Among these individuals, LDL cholesterol, the so-called ""bad"" cholesterol, was 10 percent lower than in individuals in the study with two working copies of the gene.People with the mutated gene also had half the risk of heart disease as people with two working copies. Although the findings cannot be used to draw direct conclusions about Zetia, they do suggest that the drug may be hitting an important target for reducing the risk of heart attacks, study author Dr. Nathan Stitziel of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis said in a statement.""Whether ezetimibe specifically is the best way to target NPC1L1 remains an open question,"" he said. That answer may come on Monday when Merck releases the long-awaited results from the large clinical trial called IMPROVE-IT. That trial looks specifically at whether people who took statins plus ezetimibe were less likely to have heart attacks than people who took statins alone.

222,"   By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson  A nine-year, 18,000-patient study of Merck & Co's $4 billion Zetia and Vytorin cholesterol franchise is likely to show some benefit but keep open the question of whether it can significantly reduce heart attacks, strokes and death.    The Improve-It trial is aimed at determining whether Zetia -  which is also combined with Merck's now generic statin Zocor (simvastatin) to make Vytorin - does more than reduce ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream, the basis for which it was approved.Statins have been proven to reduce heart attacks and deaths. Zetia, which lowers LDL in a different way, has been used for a dozen years without any such assurances.Results comparing Vytorin with Zocor alone will be released at the American Heart Association meeting in Chicago next week.""If it's positive, I'm eager to have another drug I can feel confident is helping people,"" said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a prominent cardiologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. ""Now, I generally don't use it except as a last resort,""  Krumholz said. ""This drug lowers your cholesterol quite effectively, but we're not sure yet whether it actually improves your health.""Merck this week signaled that it had avoided the worst possible outcome, saying in a regulatory filing it will not have to write down the value of Zetia and Vytorin, which could have been necessary if Zetia harmed patients or provided no benefit. Many drug industry analysts expect Vytorin will show some patient benefit, if not a significant one. Combined sales of Zetia and Vytorin have fallen since 2008 as smaller studies raised concerns about safety and effectiveness.     If Improve-It results are favorable, that sales decline ""will certainly stabilize and potentially improve,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Zetia and Vytorin have two more years of U.S. patent life.The study was designed to continue until about 5,200 patients had experienced cardiac-related death, a non-fatal heart attack or stroke or the need for an artery clearing procedure. Due to Zocor's effectiveness, patients already had LDL levels at the recommended target of 70 or below before adding Zetia. Dr. Steve Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, has long criticized that aspect of Improve-It's design.""It's studying the drug in a way that nobody uses it clinically,"" Nissen said. ""We use it when we can't get them to treatment goal, to try to get them there.""

231,"  * Innovative Medicines and MedTech Review to report in 2015* Follows criticism that Britain is too slow to adopt new drugs* Britain eager to promote itself as life-science hub* Merck, Becton Dickinson plan 63 mln stg investmentLONDON, Nov 20 The British government has launched a review to speed the path to market for new drugs and medical devices in an attempt to improve patient care and make the country a more attractive place for investment in life sciences. British manufacturing relies heavily on the pharmaceuticals sector, including domestic giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, but companies complain that the state-run National Health Service (NHS) is too slow to adopt new treatments.The review, announced at a meeting between industry leaders and ministers at Prime Minister David Cameron's Downing Street office on Thursday, aims to tackle the issue by studying innovative models for drug development.This will include an examination of the scope for more collaborative work between companies and regulators to ensure that new medicines and devices are assessed more quickly, with greater input from patient groups and charities such as Cancer Research UK. An independent organisation will be appointed to carry out the Innovative Medicines and MedTech Review, starting work early next year and reporting later in 2015.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the initiative is ""a big step in the right direction"" but that it needs to dovetail with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which assesses whether treatments are sufficiently cost-effective for the NHS. NICE has frequently clashed with industry over its rejection of some expensive new medicines, notably cancer treatments.Cameron first announced a drive to make Britain a leading hub for life sciences in 2011, welcomed at the time by industry.In the latest boost to the sector, United States-based Merck & Co plans to invest at least 42 million pounds ($66 million) in Britain over the next three years, while Becton Dickinson is investing 21 million pounds, the government said.Merck plans a new licensing hub in London and will expand drug research facilities, while Becton Dickinson is to build a plant in southwest England to produce blood separation tubes.

But the family-controlled company insists it has no intention of quitting.""We really want to stick to that business,"" Uta Kemmerich-Keil, chief executive of Merck Consumer Health, said during a media briefing in London highlighting the unit's strengths.""Our strategy is a pure growth strategy and by the end of this year we will hopefully hit the $1 billion sales mark."" Consumer health is smaller than Merck's other businesses selling prescription drugs, high-tech chemicals and laboratory  equipment but has strong brands like Seven Seas vitamins and Bion probiotics.It also received a boost in January from the transfer of Neurobion and Floratil, for muscle soreness and diarrhoea, from the prescription drug unit Merck Serono. Kemmerich-Keil said she aimed to have at least three leading brands with a minimum 3 percent market share in key target countries, which include a number of emerging markets, like Brazil, where demand for self-medication is growing strongly.While securing strong positions in local markets could involve small bolt-on acquisitions or licensing deals, she sees no need for large-scale acquisitions, despite recent moves by leading players Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline to boost their OTC footprints.""OTC is a local play, so you need to make sure in the markets you are in that you are strong,"" she said. ""It's not important how big the overall business is.""This year's deal-making has seen Bayer acquire the OTC business of Merck's U.S. namesake Merck & Co, following a fiercely contested auction also involving Reckitt Benckiser . GSK has also clinched a complex deal for a stake in Novartis's consumer products, while Perrigo  has agreed to buy Belgian OTC firm Omega Pharma.Following the deals, Germany's Merck now has a No. 11 position in consumer health.

It has also left Cubist as a leading investor in the field, with an annual research budget for antibiotics of $400 million.More recently, however, there have been signs of a revival, with Roche Holding AG, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Sanofi SA all investing in new approaches to fight superbugs.Cubist shares were trading at $101.04 premarket. Merck shares were unchanged from Friday's close at $61.50.The New York Times, citing people briefed on the matter, first reported the deal on Friday.The Cubist deal is Merck's second big acquisition this year.

245,"   By Robert Cyran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Superbugs may have beneficial side effects - for giant pharmaceutical companies. In agreeing to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Merck  is betting $8.4 billion that the antibiotics used to fight them will become more profitable.In the 1990s and 2000s, big pharma lost interest in new antibiotics. Existing drugs worked very well and were cheap, so there seemed little reason to spend heavily to develop new ones. Regulators demanded more stringent trials after one approved drug turned out to have life-threatening side effects. That raised costs further. And a perverse financial logic ruled: antibiotics usually cure patients rapidly, limiting revenue. The pursuit by the likes of Cubist of new ways to treat bacterial diseases looked increasingly lonely.The mood has, however, been changing as bacteria have developed resistance to existing antibiotics. The World Health Organization warned earlier this year that gonorrhea could soon become untreatable. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the extra cost of treating antibiotic-resistant infections runs up to $35 billion a year. That could rocket higher as infections become harder to contain.In response Uncle Sam is spending more on research and development and U.S. regulators are giving new drugs that combat life-threatening infections an extra five years of market exclusivity. They are also promising to approve new antibiotics quickly. The drive by governments worldwide to tie drug prices to efficacy will help further. New cancer treatments can cost $100,000 but may only add a few months of life. Antibiotics that permanently cure fatal diseases for $3,000 look cheap in comparison. That could mean a renaissance for antibiotics, with profit opportunities to match. But the pace of drug development is still glacial, which makes big drug groups eager to buy companies that already have compounds in clinical trials. Despite the above-average outlook for new antibiotics and the fact that Cubist has one potential blockbuster that just hit the market and another awaiting approval, Merck is paying only about 4.3 times Cubist's estimated revenue for next year.That's about the same multiple as investors give Merck's own business, making it look like a relative bargain. More alarm about superbugs will only make the deal look better.CONTEXT NEWS  - Merck said on Dec. 8 that it would acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals for $8.4 billion, or $102 per share. The drug company will also take on the antibiotic maker's debt. Merck is paying a 37 percent premium based on Cubist's closing price on Dec. 5, the last day of trading before the deal was announced.- In June, Merck paid $3.9 billion for Idenix, a biotech company developing treatments for hepatitis C. - Company statement: bit.ly/1vEyzg6- Reuters: Merck to take on superbugs with Cubist Pharma buy- For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on    (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

246,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc options had one of their most active weeks this year last week ahead of Monday's announcement that Merck & Co will buy Cubist for a hefty premium.One series of trades on Thursday appears to have generated at least a 10-fold windfall profit on paper.Merck said it will pay $102 a share for Cubist, 37 percent above the Lexington, Massachussetts, company's closing share price of $74.36 on Friday. Cubist shares were up 35 percent at $100.70 on Monday.Open interest in Cubist call options, which convey the right to buy the stock at a fixed price in the future, jumped by 25 percent between Dec. 1 and Dec. 5 to 13,864 contracts, according to Trade Alert data. That ranks among the largest increases in open interest over a five-day period this year for Cubist calls.On average, Cubist options are not very actively traded, but trading volume was unusually heavy on Thursday, said Fred Ruffy, options strategist at WhatsTrading.com.  Ruffy also noted an increase in Cubist's implied volatility, a gauge of the risk of large moves in a stock and a key component to options pricing. Implied volatility jumped to 51.49 percent on Thursday from 43.15 percent on Wednesday, according to Livevol Inc data.One call strike in particular saw a big increase in activity on Thursday. Around 1,000 Cubist calls at the $85 strike and set to expire on Jan. 17 were bought for between $1.25 to $1.50, according to Livevol Inc data.Ahead of those trades on Thursday afternoon, the January 85 calls had fewer than 300 contracts of open interest, according to Reuters data. By the end of the day that had risen to more than 1,300. Since going on the board in October 2013, the average volume of January 85 calls had been about 14 contracts a day, and their largest daily total before Thursday had been 175 contracts. Thursday's volume was more than 45 standard deviations above the norm.""To expect the stock to move past $85 and be willing to pay over a $1 for it with about a month and a half to go suggests that they were expecting some kind of major catalyst,"" said optionMonster.com lead analyst David Russell.Until Monday, the high for Cubist shares was $82.12, set in February this year. With the stock soaring to a record above $100 on the merger news, the January 85 calls are now quoted at about $16, making for a huge profit on the trades, Russell said.One other possible catalyst for the shares involves a possible resolution of a lawsuit surrounding a generic challenge to Cubist’s lead drug, Cubicin, by Hospira Inc.

They take root in patients who have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill off ""friendly"" bacteria in the gut, allowing C. difficile bacteria to multiply. C. difficile can cause colitis, including attacks of diarrhea and fever that can recur and are not well controlled by current treatments.Merck's experimental drug, called MK-3415A, combines two antibodies that chew up deadly toxins produced by C. difficile.

257,"   By Robert Cyran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The M&A frenzy appears to have influenced Merck's risk assessment. Just hours after unveiling its $8.4 billion acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals on Monday, a judge invalidated patents owned by the antibiotics maker. Potential lost sales are reflected in the billions erased from Merck's market value.Cubist's biggest drug is Cubicin, which currently accounts for nearly all the company's estimated $1.2 billion in annual sales. The ruling by a Delaware court means Cubist could face generic competition in the United States as soon as the middle of 2016, instead of waiting until 2020.The healthy 37 percent premium Merck paid for Cubist, and the limited wiggle room it left itself to pull out of the deal, suggests it was undeterred by the outstanding legal danger. There are other known unknowns, too. For one, Cubist will soon go before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to seek approval of a new antibiotic, which could be a blockbuster. Waiting for confirmation might have increased the takeover tab or left the door open for an interloping suitor. Assuming regulators sign off, though, Merck's experienced presence might smooth the launch. Even so, there is probably a higher cost for its aggression. Cubist is worth less today than it was yesterday. Merck argues the deal still creates value. Investors took a less charitable view, wiping more than $8 billion, or almost the entire purchase price, from Merck's market capitalization. It is probably an overreaction. Absent a successful appeal of the legal ruling, based on existing sales, the foregone Cubicin revenue should add up to no more than $3 billion in a worst-case scenario.Other buyers may want to pay heed to Merck's misstep. There already have been more than $3 trillion of deals announced globally this year, an increase of some 50 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters. Healthcare has been a leading sector, with more than twice as much activity this year than last. That makes it that much easier for buyers to get caught up in the excitement and look at potential merger liabilities though a rose-colored prism. CONTEXT NEWS  -  A Delaware judge on Dec. 8 invalidated several patents protecting Cubist Pharmaceuticals' Cubicin, allowing rival Hospira to sell the drug as soon as 2016. The patents would have provided market exclusivity until 2020.- Earlier the same day, Merck said it would buy Cubist for $8.4 billion. Following the patent ruling, Merck said it would stand by its agreement. Cubist said it would appeal the court's decision.- Merck shares fell 4.4 percent in morning trading on Dec. 9 and Cubist's were down 3.7 percent.     (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

258,"  (Repeating story first published late on Tuesday)By Ransdell PiersonDec 9 In its planned purchase of antibiotics maker Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc, Merck & Co  will gain a sales force well placed to propel its own experimental drug for an intestinal bug, C. difficile, that is a scourge among hospital patients.Merck announced on Monday an agreement to buy Cubist for $8.4 billion, with a focus on Cubist's drugs that address the growing threat of bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics.As many as 14,000 Americans die each year from C. difficile infections, which are spread by spores in hospitals. They take root in patients who have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill off ""friendly"" bacteria in the gut, allowing C. difficile bacteria to multiply. C. difficile can cause colitis, including attacks of diarrhea and fever that can recur and are not well controlled by current treatments.Merck's experimental drug, called MK-3415A, combines two antibodies that chew up deadly toxins produced by C. difficile. New data on its effectiveness is expected from two late-stage clinical trials in 2015.If the data is favorable, Merck could seek approval of the drug - the first antibody treatment for bacterial toxins - by early 2016. ""This is a blockbuster market opportunity for Merck,"" said Kevin Kedra, an analyst for Gabelli & Co. Cubist's expertise in turning its biggest product, the antibiotic Cubicin, into a $1 billion-a-year franchise could bode well for Merck.""Cubist is a company that built itself into an antibiotic power when bigger companies were getting out the business,"" Kedra said. Adam Schechter, head of global human health at Merck, said Cubist's sales force would strengthen Merck's relationships with insurers, gastroentrologists, infectious disease doctors, hospitals and outpatient centers.Cubist has the best-selling treatment for the condition, Dificid, but up to 15 percent of patients have relapses, sending many of them back to the hospital for retreatment. It also faces competition from far cheaper generics, including vancomycin.If Merck's treatment is approved, it is more likely to face competition down the road from products containing human fecal matter. The ""fecal transplants,"" which reintroduce healthy bacteria into the gastrointestinal tract, have proven extremely effective. But it could take years for a commercial version to be approved.""Merck couldn't have a better infrastructure than Cubist to launch its drug,"" said Ori Hershkowitz, a Tel Aviv-based partner for Sphera Funds.

Scientists are racing to develop Ebola vaccines after the world's worst outbreak of the virus has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa so far this year.Separately, safety data from a trial of a GlaxoSmithKline  Ebola vaccine on 120 volunteers is ""satisfactory"", the University of Lausanne Hospital said on Thursday.The first results of the Lausanne hospital's trial of the GSK vaccine and whether it provides immunity against the virus are expected by the end of December, the university said in a statement. ""The safety data looked satisfactory so far,"" said Professor Blaise Genton, who is leading the GSK trial in Lausanne. ""General symptoms such as fever might be slightly more frequent, though no serious adverse event has been observed so far.""Scientists reported on Nov. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine that another version of the experimental GSK vaccine caused no serious side effects and produced an immune response in all 20 healthy volunteers who received it in an early-stage trial.The Geneva researchers reported on Dec. 2 that the first people vaccinated with the Merck-NewLink shot had seen no serious side effects, but a few had mild fever. On Thursday, the team said that four patients had reported joint pains in the second week that had lasted a few days. Before it was suspended, this first phase of the trial had been due to continue for another week.""The Geneva team has decided to allow time to understand what is happening. This precaution of momentarily suspending the trial is usual and classic in all clinical trials,"" the team said.It was in close contact with researchers in the United States, Germany, Canada and Gabon who are carrying out the same trial on the Merck-NewLink vaccine, it said. ""These centres have not observed symptoms of inflammation in their volunteers to date.""Marie-Paule Kieny, vaccine expert at the World Health Organisation, said that the delay to the Merck-NewLink trial would allow time to see how widespread the problems are, but the trial should then be able to continue as originally planned.""It's not a setback, not at all,"" Kieny told a briefing.GAVI, the global vaccines alliance, pledged $300 million on Thursday to buy Ebola vaccines.

260,"  * NewLink/Merck vaccine trial paused due to joint pains* GAVI pledges up to $300 mln for 12 mln vaccine courses* Further funding of up to $90 mln to help vaccine roll-out   (Wraps stories on GAVI funding, NewLink vaccine trial, adds GAVI CEO comment)By Ben Hirschler and Stephanie NebehayLONDON/GENEVA, Dec 11 GAVI, the global vaccines alliance, said on Thursday it was committing up to $300 million to buy Ebola vaccines, as one experimental shot hit a snag in a Swiss clinical trial after some subjects reported joint pains.Scientists are racing to develop Ebola vaccines in record time but many questions remain unanswered, as evidenced by a decision to pause Swiss tests of the experimental vaccine from NewLink and Merck.GAVI, which is funded by governments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said it was ready to begin procurement as soon as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a vaccine for use.The world's worst Ebola outbreak has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa and experts believe millions of doses of vaccine may be needed both to help end the current epidemic and to contain future outbreaks. Officials involved in the Swiss study said the volunteers who had received the NewLink shot were all fine and the WHO played down the problem, pointing out that temporary suspensions were not uncommon in clinical trials.Researchers hope safe and effective vaccines will get a green light as soon as next year, although there is still uncertainty over how well they will work and how many doses are needed.Paying for vaccines is a challenge because the worst affected countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are some of the world's poorest, providing little commercial incentive for manufacturers. STOCKPILES The money now earmarked by Geneva-based GAVI will help bridge the gap and is expected to be enough to procure up to 12 million courses of vaccine. WHO vaccine expert Marie-Paule Kieny said the commitment was ""fantastic"".In addition to helping in the current epidemic, the money could also be used to create stockpiles of Ebola vaccines, similar to those that exist for yellow fever, meningitis and cholera. A further amount of up to $90 million will be made available from GAVI's coffers to help affected countries introduce the vaccines and to rebuild their health systems.GAVI, which was set up in 2000 with private and government donor backing, has a track record of bulk-buying vaccine supplies from manufacturers at a low price for the developing world. Since 2000, around 440 million children have been immunised against a range of diseases through its programmes.GAVI said its board had decided to prepare for procuring Ebola vaccines while still awaiting a green light for the first product, ""in light of the seriousness of the situation and the risks associated with delays in making a vaccine available"".Two vaccines, one from NewLink and Merck and a rival shot from GlaxoSmithKline, are already undergoing human trials and third one, made by Johnson & Johnson, is about to enter clinical testing.""We've had individual discussions with all of the manufacturers and continue to work closely with them,"" GAVI's chief executive, Seth Berkley, told Reuters.GAVI said it would meet the funding needs of the Ebola vaccine programme using a combination of existing and new financing. It also plans to join forces with other initiatives that have already pledged funding to address the Ebola crisis.(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Pravin Char and Greg Mahlich)",2014-12-11,MRK,"Thu Dec 11, 2014 | 10:29am EST",UPDATE 2-$300 mln pledged to buy Ebola vaccines as NewLink shot hits snag,http://www.reuters.com//article/health-ebola-vaccine-gavi-idUSL6N0TV24K20141211?type=companyNews
261,"  * Debate over ""prime-boost"" vaccination as epidemic evolves* Two shots offer more protection but cumbersome to deliver* Disease slowdown may weaken clinical trial results* GSK, J&J/Bavarian and Merck/NewLink vaccines studiedBy Ben Hirschler and Kate KellandLONDON, Dec 11 Scientists racing to develop vaccines against Ebola are trying to determine whether they can best fight the disease with a single injection or with two, a calculation that could determine how quickly and effectively a programme can be rolled out.Administering two vaccines, one after the other, would almost certainly give far greater protection than a single shot against a deadly virus that has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa this year.But it would also make mass immunisations far more complicated in the worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where weak health systems have all but collapsed under the weight of the epidemic.With the epidemic growing exponentially through much of 2014, the initial focus was on developing a single shot that could be tested and deployed as fast as possible.Now, however, with disease transmission rates tailing off markedly in Liberia, there is more debate about a double vaccine programme that would provide greater protection, even if it might take longer and be harder to implement. ""There is now more and more talk about what can we do to prolong vaccine protection,"" said Ripley Ballou, head of Ebola research at GlaxoSmithKline, which has one of the leading vaccine candidates.He still hopes a single-dose vaccine will be of use in the current outbreak, but also sees a need to evaluate the ""prime-boost"" approach of giving a first shot to stimulate the immune system, followed by a second booster a few weeks later.Health officials in London and Washington, as well as non-profit groups like the Wellcome Trust that are also helping fund clinical trials, are liaising closely on the best way forward.""We're trying to decide where it is best to put the money,"" said one senior government adviser. A big Liberia trial, involving up to 30,000 participants, will test single shots of GSK's vaccine, a rival one from NewLink and Merck, and a placebo.Although the Ebola slowdown in Liberia is clearly good news, it means the trial may not see enough new cases of disease to demonstrate the benefit of vaccination.PRODUCTION CAPACITY Other studies are starting to analyse the prime-boost approach. Johnson & Johnson expects to start testing its experimental shot with a booster developed by Denmark's Bavarian Nordic ""very soon"" and its chief scientific officer, Paul Stoffels, is convinced this is the right strategy. ""It is cumbersome, because you need two vaccines, but it is clear that you will get the best protection, both short and long term, from a prime-boost,"" he said.A prime-boost vaccine will be more difficult to make in large quantities, since the booster component from Bavarian needs to be grown in chicken eggs, limiting supply. But past experience suggests it should pack more punch.Tests of similar two-pronged vaccines in other diseases suggest the booster component can increase immune responses around 30-fold for the production of antibodies and up to 10-fold for the body's own disease-fighting T-cells - two of the key elements of the ability to fight off infection - said Adrian Hill, a vaccine expert at Oxford University's Jenner Institute.That extra protection may be needed in West Africa, where infection with malaria could also depress people's immune systems, limiting the effectiveness of immunisation.In the end, the wide programme of vaccine trials scheduled for the first half of 2015 may yield a variety of options, with some experts suggesting prime-boost may be particularly suited for healthcare workers facing regular high exposure and single shots the preferred choice for rapid containment of local cases.So far, the only human data on how well Ebola vaccines might work comes from the United States and Europe, with GSK's shot proving safe and showing some efficacy, although not comprehensive protection. NewLink's experimental shot had no serious side effects but caused some mild fever.With the epidemic still raging, tests are likely to try out combinations of vaccines in an opportunistic way. While their impact may not become clear until later next year, the lessons learned will still be valuable in responding to the next, inevitable, Ebola outbreak.""This disease is going to be endemic in West Africa,"" said GSK's Ballou. ""It's important for those countries either to have routine vaccination or a stockpile option.""   (Editing by Peter Graff)",2014-12-11,MRK,"Thu Dec 11, 2014 | 2:00am EST",One shot or two?

267,"  * GSK vaccine cuts risk of shingles by 97.2 pct in over 50s* Potentially strong competitor for Merck's Zostavax* Shares in GSK partner Agenus jump 10 percent   (Adds sales figures for Merck vaccine, forecast for GSK product)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, Dec 18 An experimental shingles vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline has produced impressive results in a late-stage study, giving the group's expanding vaccine unit a potential $1 billion boost.The data suggests the British company's new shot could be a strong competitor for Merck & Co's established vaccine Zostavax, which is currently the only product on the market. GSK's vaccine, known as HZ/su, reduced the risk of shingles by 97.2 percent in adults aged 50 years and older compared to placebo in the Phase III clinical trial involving more than 16,000 individuals, the drugmaker said on Thursday.That result looks compelling compared to Zostavax, which has showed 69.8 percent efficacy in patients aged 50 to 59 years, and lower efficacy in older people. However, the design of different clinical trials means direct comparisons are tricky.The two vaccines work in different ways. Zostavax is a so-called live attenuated virus vaccine while HZ/su combines a protein found on the virus that causes shingles with an adjuvant, or booster, which is intended to enhance the immunological response. The adjuvant includes a component from U.S. biotech firm Agenus, which is entitled to royalties on any future sales. Shares in Agenus jumped 10 percent in early U.S. trading on news of the good results.GSK has not said when HZ/su might reach the market and a company spokeswoman said more data would be collected on the experimental shot next year. Additional trials to evaluate the ability of HZ/su to prevent shingles are also underway in people aged 70 and older and in immunocompromised patients. The full set of safety data from the Phase III trial is currently being analysed and will be disclosed in the coming months, the company added.Merck's Zostavax, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006, generated sales of $758 million last year and is still growing strongly, since only a minority of elderly people have so far been vaccinated.

268,"  (Corrects second paragraph to say ""scholarships funded by Merck, Zoetis, Cargill and others this year."")By Duff Wilson and Mimi DwyerDec 23 The pharmaceutical industry has strong ties to veterinary education across the United States, providing financial support to professors, researchers and students.Zoetis, the world's leading animal drug maker, has given $3.6 million in scholarships over the past five years to more than 1,100 U.S. veterinary students. The American Association of Bovine Practitioners, a beef veterinary group, provided $300,000 in grants and scholarships funded by Merck, Zoetis, Cargill and others this year.A four-year veterinary education costs well over $200,000, and students often leave school with significant debt. But five pharmaceutical companies have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to help veterinary students pay back loans. One condition: that the students practice food-animal medicine for four years. Some students also are paid to serve as representatives of pharmaceutical companies on their campuses. ""I don't think they're pushing anything that's going to affect how we practice as veterinarians, but it certainly could be viewed that way,"" said Alexander Thomson, the Zoetis student representative at Cornell veterinary college. He declined to say how much he is paid.Leading veterinary professors are also accepting money from the pharmaceutical industry for everything from research to company-scripted promotional speaking. Such speaking arrangements are banned by many university medical faculties, according to Eric Campbell, a Harvard University professor who studies conflicts of interest between medical doctors and drug companies. ""The fact that they're being supported by the companies they're supposed to be overseeing raises issues about the impact of those payments,"" he said.Pamela Ruegg, a professor of dairy science at the University of Wisconsin, was paid to speak by Zoetis, among others. Then, she said, Zoetis stopped inviting her to forums when she voiced concerns that antibiotics were being overused on farms. ""They wouldn't sponsor me as a speaker because they're mad at me,"" Ruegg said. ""My message is we have to reduce the amount of antimicrobial use and use it properly."" Last week, however, Ruegg said a Zoetis representative called her to ask if the company could distribute a YouTube video she made and a paper she wrote advocating more ""watchful waiting"" and less antibiotic usage on dairy farms. ""It's a favorable development,"" she said. Zoetis declined to comment.Mark Papich, a professor of clinical pharmacology at North Carolina State's veterinary college, has received speaking and consulting fees, honoraria, research grants or gifts from nearly every pharmaceutical company, a fact he talks about openly.""It's a matter of survival for us to try and get support from the pharmaceutical companies,"" he said.

269,"  GENEVA The clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck and NewLink resumed on Monday at a lower dose after a pause to assess complaints of joint pains in some volunteers, the University of Geneva hospital said. An Ebola outbreak, the worst on record of the highly infectious hemorrhagic fever, has killed over 7,900 people over the past year, with more than 20,000 cases recorded mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus is still spreading in West Africa, especially in Sierra Leone. The Geneva hospital announced on Dec. 11 that its vaccine trial had been suspended as a precautionary measure after four patients complained of joint pains. On Monday, the hospital said 10 of 59 volunteers who received the vaccine had felt pains in their joints ""similar to rheumatism"" after some two weeks, but these symptoms had disappeared rapidly without any treatment.Swissmedic, the Swiss regulatory agency, and ethics and safety committees have approved the resumption of the trial at a lower dose, the hospital said in a statement.  ""The second part of this clinical trial will now test a dose of 300,000 vaccine particles, which should be better tolerated by volunteers and will hopefully trigger the production of enough antibodies,"" it said, noting that the initial phase had 10 million to 50 million vaccine particles.""Fortunately"", it said, the Merck-NewLink candidate vaccine ""seems able to induce the production of antibodies at lower doses than those previously used"" in the Geneva trial.  Vaccinations have now resumed for the last 56 volunteers, who will receive either a low dose of the vaccine or a placebo, by groups of 15 each week through January, it said. Geneva researchers are constantly exchanging information with teams carrying out similar studies in Canada, Gabon, Germany and the United States, the hospital said.

270,"  (Adds market value figure in paragraph 3)By Natalie Grover and Vidya L NathanJan 5 Cempra Inc moved a step closer to approval for its lead antibiotic, solithromycin, after an oral version of the potential blockbuster met the main goal in a late-stage trial.Investment by Big Pharma in antibiotic research has revived as bacteria grow increasingly resistant to existing drugs, leading Merck & Co to bid for Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc  and casting other antibiotic drug developers as potential targets.Shares of Cempra, among a clutch of smaller companies developing treatments to fight super-bugs, rose as much as 18 percent to $27.10 in early trading on Monday.Up to Friday's close, the company's shares had gained 43 percent since Merck's announcement on Dec .8. At Monday's high, Cempra was valued at about $970 million.Cempra Chief Executive Prabha Fernandes, speaking on a call with analysts, reiterated that the company was not looking for partners. The drug is a next-generation version of a class of oft-prescribed antibiotics called macrolides, which are used to fight pathogens that cause community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAPB).CAPB is the leading cause of death from infection and is characterized by shortness of breath, cough and fever. About 5-10 million cases are recorded in the United States annually.An oral formulation of solithromycin was as effective as Bayer AG's moxifloxacin 72 hours after dosing, Cempra said on Sunday. WBB Securities' Steve Brozak raised his price target on the stock to $40 from $25, estimating that solithromycin was worth about $1.4 billion to Cempra.On the call, a company executive said there were no signs of any serious adverse reactions in the solithromycin study.Prior-generation macrolides have triggered safety concerns. Sanofi SA's telithromycin, for example, was associated with liver toxicity, while Pfizer Inc's  azithromycin was linked to heart risk.The unparalleled rate at which the oral version of solithromycin is absorbed in the blood, or its oral bioavailability, differentiates it from standard treatments, Fernandes told Reuters in an interview in November.North Carolina-based Cempra is also evaluating an intravenous formulation of solithromycin for CAPB. Cempra expects to update investors on the study in April 2015, Fernandes said.The drug is also the first pediatric antibiotic-in-development in nearly three decades, she said.Solithromycin is commercially licensed to Fujifilm Holdings Corp in Japan.

279,"   By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Merck & Co Inc is funding the testing of lower dosages of its controversial cattle growth drug Zilmax, in a move that livestock experts say is crucial if the company is to resume sales of the product to the U.S. beef industry.Nearly 18 months after Merck pulled the drug from the U.S. and Canadian markets after videos and photographs surfaced showing Zilmax-fed cattle turning up in a distressed state, either lame or with hooves missing at slaughterhouses, scientists at Texas Tech University are testing beef carcasses taken from cattle fed different concentrations of Zilmax.The Merck-funded field study and lab work, which have not previously been reported, are designed to test Zilmax at its currently approved dosage of 6.8 grams per ton of feed for a 20-day period prior to slaughter, as well as dosages at about 60 percent and nearly 80 percent of that level, according to the title of the study. At the time Merck pulled Zilmax off the market, it had only one dosage level approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Merck awarded $1.85 million to the Texas Tech team in October to conduct the research, the university mentioned at the time in a newsletter that got little attention outside of the school. The research is ongoing and the specific time frame of the study was not clear. ""This study is an example of the company's ongoing research efforts to provide additional data on the use of Zilmax,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.Merck, which says it still sells Zilmax in Mexico and South Africa, declined to comment on why it was testing these particular levels or whether it was collecting data to submit to the FDA. Merck also declined to say how many cattle are being fed Zilmax as part of the tests, or where the animals are being raised or slaughtered. It declined to give any further details. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the study, citing confidentiality regarding drug applications. Texas Tech did not respond to requests for comment. In November, federal regulators approved changes proposed by the company in the way the drug is administered. The company has also been working with cattle feed lot operators on how best to administer the drug.""It looks to me like they're doing studies to determine if the lower dosages are efficacious in improving feed efficiency, growth rate and carcass leanness,"" said David Anderson, former head of swine research at Elanco Animal Health, a unit of Merck rival Eli Lily & Co, when Reuters told him about the study. A similar product called Optaflexx, made by Elanco ""has captured the market,"" said Arizona cattle rancher Harvey Dietrich, co-founder of advocacy group Beef Additive Alert, which is critical of growth-promotants such as Zilmax. ""Merck wants their market share back,"" he added.At the time the videos of the distressed cattle surfaced in 2013, some veterinarians argued that a key problem was that the drug, at its approved dosage, was too potent for some animals.  The drug company does not need federal approval to return Zilmax to the market. But all four of the nation's largest beef packers and many meat producers have told Reuters they won't accept Zilmax until Merck can scientifically prove the drug doesn't cause the animal welfare issues seen in the past. One option, say industry experts, would be for Merck to show the FDA that Zilmax is effective and safe at helping cattle gain weight at lower dosages, and petition the agency to alter the product's usage label.The multi-site study that Merck is funding could provide the data needed to make such a petition, according to industry experts. Current labeling covers both dosage and details about its effectiveness on cattle.    Major meat packers like Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Tyson Foods Inc say they are not processing any meat from Merck's study or slaughtering cattle fed with Zilmax. Spokesmen for Cargill, Tyson, National Beef Packing Co [NBEEF.UL] and JBS USA [JBS.UL] said their companies were not participating in the study.      (Reporting By P.J.

The 4.5 percent foreign exchange hit compared with an average 0.9 percent headwind in the first three quarters of the year. The diversified healthcare company now expects a foreign currency hit to earnings in 2015 of as much as 42 cents per share, versus the 15 cents to 20 cents it forecast in October.""Foreign exchange will be a focal point for the whole drug group"" in the fourth quarter and 2015, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. He predicted the stronger dollar will take a bigger bite out of other drugmakers' earnings than many expect, and said Pfizer and Merck are among the most vulnerable because they both derive more than 60 percent of their sales outside the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer declined to comment, saying the company will discuss the impact of foreign exchange when it reports quarterly results on Jan 27.

281,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Jan 20 Johnson & Johnson surprised investors by detailing the degree to which a strong dollar will hurt sales abroad this year, and industry watchers say Wall Street is underestimating the likely hit to other U.S.-based rivals such as Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co.J&J, the first large U.S. drugmaker to report fourth-quarter results, on Tuesday said sales fell 0.6 percent to $18.25 billion, but would have risen 3.9 percent if not for the stronger dollar. The 4.5 percent foreign exchange hit compared with an average 0.9 percent headwind in the first three quarters of the year.The diversified healthcare company now expects a foreign currency hit to earnings in 2015 of as much as 42 cents per share, versus the 15 cents to 20 cents it forecast in October.""Foreign exchange will be a focal point for the whole drug group"" in the fourth quarter and 2015, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. He predicted the stronger dollar will take a bigger bite out of other drugmakers' earnings than many expect, and said Pfizer and Merck are among the most vulnerable because they both derive more than 60 percent of their sales outside the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer declined to comment, saying the company will discuss the impact of foreign exchange when it reports quarterly results on Jan 27. Merck officials could not immediately be reached for comment.J&J shares fell 2.6 percent on Tuesday, while the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of U.S. and European drugmakers was little changed.

283,"  (Repeating to additional subscribers)By Tim McLaughlinFeb 2 At least 40 major U.S. companies have substantial exposure to Venezuela's deepening economic crisis, and could collectively be forced to take billions of dollars of write downs, a Reuters analysis shows.The companies, all members of the S&P 500, and including some of the biggest names in Corporate America such as autos giant General Motors and drug maker Merck & Co Inc , together carry at least $11 billion of monetary assets in the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, on their books.The official rate is at 6.3 bolivars to the dollar and there are two other rates in the government system - known as SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 - at about 12 and 50. The black market rate, though, was at about 190 bolivars to the dollar on Sunday, according to the website dolartoday.com.The problem is that the dollar value of the assets as disclosed in many of the companies' accounts is based on either the rates at 6.3 or 12 and only a limited number of transactions are allowed at those rates. The assets would be worth a lot fewer dollars at the 50 rate in the government system and the dollar value would almost be wiped out at the black market rate.The currency system is also about to be shaken up following an announcement by Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro on Jan. 21, leading to fears of a further devaluation.American companies will also have additional exposure to the bolivar that isn't disclosed because they don't see the size of that exposure as material to their results. The Reuters analysis also doesn't look at the thousands of publicly traded and private American companies that aren't in the S&P 500 and will in some cases have bolivar assets.BLACK MARKET RATE  Some leading American companies have already decided that the stronger exchange rates - the official rate at 6.3 and the SICAD 1 exchange market at 12 - are not reflective of the currency conditions they face in the South American country.Diaper and tissue maker Kimberly-Clark Corp recently announced a charge of $462 million for its Venezuelan business, leading to a fourth-quarter loss for the company, after it concluded that the appropriate exchange rate was the SICAD 2 exchange rate at 50 rather than the 6.3 it had previously used.Using the stronger exchange rates is unrealistic because of how hard it is to repatriate profits earned in Venezuela back to the United States at any rate, let alone those rates, securities analysts say. Citigroup Inc says it has not been able to buy U.S. dollars from the Venezuelan government since 2008.Companies can seek dollars at the official rate if they are using those dollars to import raw materials for production of priority goods such as food and medicine, and some can buy dollars at the SICAD 1 rate at around 12 bolivars to the dollar through auctions that are typically held several times per month but are only targeted at specific sectors. As tumbling oil prices have left Venezuela with fewer dollars, its currency board has steadily reduced approval for repatriation of dividends at the official rate - leaving companies with growing quantities of bolivars trapped by currency controls.""It's a huge deal and companies will get hit big,"" said Ali Dibadji, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co Inc. ""Take a look at what Kimberly-Clark did last week and what Clorox did a few months ago by getting out of Venezuela.""Cleaning and household products maker Clorox last year decided to exit Venezuela altogether. Its CEO Don Knauss said at the time: ""We saw no hope that we could create a sustaining business in that country."" The currency issues are hurting many U.S. companies much more than their sales might suggest. Many of the companies in the analysis have been getting between 1-3 percent of their global revenue from Venezuela.Ford Motor Co and oil services company Schlumberger NV   took big-ticket hits to their quarterly profits because of their Venezuelan operations. Ford took a fourth-quarter charge of $800 million and Schlumberger $472 million.A Ford spokeswoman said that it still values its Venezuela assets at about 12 bolivars per US dollar. But for Ford, the currency system and other conditions are so tough in the South American country that it has made an accounting change that will allow it to ring fence its Venezuela business so that it doesn't have a direct impact on the company's operating results.Schlumberger, which previously used the 6.3 rate, said it is now using the SICAD 2 rate of 50 as it ""best represents the economics of Schlumberger's business activity in Venezuela.""Another S&P 500 company to switch to the 50 rate from 6.3 in recent weeks was industrial gases producer Praxair Inc, which took a fourth-quarter charge of $131 million as a result. It also said the switch will hurt its revenue and earnings in 2015. ANOTHER DEVALUATION? Those changes don't reflect the prospect of another currency devaluation in Venezuela, as recently telegraphed by Maduro, who is struggling to keep a lid on consumer prices amid a 64 percent inflation rate and a plunge in oil revenue. The official rate was last devalued by 32 percent to the current 6.3 from 4.3 in February 2013, at that time the fifth devaluation in a decade.Maduro said in the Jan 21 announcement he would merge the two existing SICAD rates (the ones at 12 and 50 per U.S. dollar). He also would introduce another new rate to offer dollars via private brokers to vie with the black market rate. There has yet to be a further announcement providing details of the new system and the rates.Currency uncertainties aside, foreign companies face a myriad of other problems in Venezuela, from weak demand to shortages of many goods, difficulty in importing parts and products, and relying on the government to approve price increases to keep pace with hyperinflation.Most of the S&P 500 bolivar exposure is concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country's currency system, according to the Reuters analysis of their latest quarterly financial statements.But if those companies used Venezuela's SICAD 2 currency rate, the one at about 50 bolivars to the dollar, their assets would decline by as much as $5.8 billion. All of these companies currently either use the rates at 6.3 and 12.It would be far worse if they used Venezuela's black market rate of about 190 for the currency. The companies' bolivar assets would be worth only a tiny fraction of their current estimated value if they used that rate.GM, which ranked No. 1 out of the group analyzed, with $1.5 billion in Venezuela exposure, said it is closely monitoring conditions there. ""We have nothing to announce at this time,"" spokesman Tom Henderson said.Some U.S. companies, such as Merck, justify valuing their Venezuela assets at the most preferential rate because they are providing essential services and goods, like medicine, to the country. They report some success in translating bolivars into dollars at the 6.3 rate. Merck did not respond to a message seeking comment.Still, some of these same companies have prepared their investors for a currency hit in their latest round of quarterly disclosures. PepsiCo Inc said it would take an after-tax charge of up to $440 million if it revalued its Venezuela assets at the 50 rate. As of early September, the company disclosed $505 million in bolivar-denominated net monetary assets.""I do think that more companies may consider exiting Venezuela if the inability to remove cash or take prices to offset devaluations persist,"" said Dibadji, the Sanford Bernstein analyst.

The move means the Greek central bank will have to provide its banks with tens of billions of euros of additional emergency liquidity in coming weeks. ""It's kind of reconfirming what we've thought for a while, which is that there is going to be a liquidity crunch if they don't resolve this Greek situation,"" said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets Inc in Boston.""They make a little bit of progress and then they kind of fall back.""Shares of the Global X FTSE Greece 20 exchange-traded fund  dropped 10.4 percent, with volume spiking late in the session. The euro also fell on the news, while the S&P financial index turned lower and ended down 0.3 percent. The Dow ended in positive territory, lifted by shares of Walt Disney, up 8 percent to $101.64 after quarterly profit topped analysts' expectations.The S&P 500 energy index was off 1.6 percent as oil prices declined after a four-day surge of nearly 20 percent. U.S. crude sank 8.7 percent to settle at $48.45 following a new build in U.S. crude stockpiles.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.62 points, or 0.04 percent, to 17,673.02, the S&P 500 lost 8.52 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,041.51 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 11.04 points, or 0.23 percent, to 4,716.70. The day's dip followed a two-day gain of 2.8 percent for the S&P 500, driven largely by the rebound in energy shares.Big biotechnology names declined. Leading them lower was Gilead Sciences, whose stock dropped 8.2 percent to $98.43, a day after the drugmaker said it is offering steeper-than-expected discounts on its hepatitis C drugs.The news fueled concerns the sector would face increasing price pressure. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was down 1.8 percent.

287,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Merck & Co on Wednesday said U.S. regulators intend to rescind the ""breakthrough therapy"" designation for its  combination treatment for hepatitis C because other new drugs are available, a decision that could delay approval of the Merck product by several months.The Food and Drug Administration gives the designation to medicines it deems likely to demonstrate ""substantial improvement"" over existing drugs. The designation has hastened approval of some drugs by two to three months. Analysts said Merck's two-drug treatment would likely now require a standard 10-month review.Merck, in its fourth-quarter earnings report, said it plans to discuss the matter with the FDA and still expects to seek U.S. approval in the first half of 2015. The treatment consists of a protease inhibitor called MK-5172 and a so-called NS5A inhibitor called MK-8742 that together had received the FDA's ""breakthrough therapy"" designation. In a recent mid-stage trial, Merck's combo cured 98 percent of previously untreated patients with genotype 1, the most common and hardest to treat variant of hepatitis C.

Idenix had three hepatitis C drugs in development, most notably a pill in early-stage trials called IDX21437, which Merck has renamed MK-3682. Like Gilead's Sovaldi, it is a nucleotide inhibitor, or ""nuc,"" that blocks a protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate.Merck is conducting a mid-stage trial to study combinations of MK-3682 and MK-5172 (grazoprevir) with either MK-8742 (elbasvir) or another drug called MK-8408. It hopes to begin larger late-stage trials of the triplet therapies this year. Gilead introduced Sovaldi in late 2013 at a cost of $1,000 a pill, and reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.73 billion for the drug. Gilead later introduced Harvoni, a pill combining Sovaldi with another treatment, and it captured sales of $2.11 billion in the quarter.AbbVie launched its Viekira Pak treatment late last year. Since then, it has battled Gilead for market share by offering discounts to insurers and other group payers.Late on Tuesday, Gilead disclosed that its discounts will average 46 percent this year, up sharply from analyst expectations of 25 to 30 percent. Shares of Gilead and AbbVie both tumbled after the news.As many as 3.2 million people in the United States are estimated to be infected with the hepatitis C virus, which can lead to severe liver disease.Merck on Wednesday reported slightly disappointing fourth-quarter sales and predicted 2015 earnings below analyst forecasts.

297,"  * Biosimilars launched by Celltrion, Hospira and Mundipharma* New products are copies of J&J and Merck's Remicade* Biosimilars expected to disrupt market for biotech medicines   (Adds detail on price discount, paragraph 7)By Ben HirschlerLONDON, Feb 25 Cheap versions of a top-selling drug for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease are being launched across major European markets in an important advance for a new type of medicines known as biosimilars.The products from South Korean firm Celltrion  and its partners Hospira and Mundipharma will compete with Remicade, the original branded drug from Johnson & Johnson  and Merck & Co.The potential of biosimilars to grab substantial business from original brands was a key factor behind Pfizer's  decision this month to buy Hospira for about $15 billion. Unlisted Mundipharma said on Wednesday that it is launching its biosimilar Remsima in Germany, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, following expiry of  relevant Remicade patents.Hospira is to sell its product Inflectra in markets including Austria, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.Copies of Remicade have been on sale for several months in some smaller European markets, such as Norway, but the move into major economies is a big step forward for products that could disrupt the multibillion-dollar biotechnology industry.PRICE DISCOUNT  Paul Greenland, head of biologics at Hospira, said that biosimilars are likely to be priced about 20-30 percent cheaper than originals.Because biotech drugs are made from living cells it is impossible to manufacture exact copies, as happens with simple chemical medicines, so regulators have come up with the notion of approving products that are similar enough to do the job.Remicade, which has annual European sales of about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), and the two biosimilar copies all contain an antibody known as infliximab. There has been a fierce debate for many years on how rapidly biosimilars will be adopted by doctors and the take-up of Remsima and Inflectra in the likes of Germany, France and Britain will be an important test.Many more biosimilar copies of drugs for diseases ranging from cancer to eye disorders are now in development, posing a threat to leading biotech drugmakers such as Roche and AbbVie.Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum predicted this month that biosimilars would result in at least $110 billion of value being transferred from innovator companies to copycat producers between 2015 and 2025.The upside for society is that they could generate an estimated $50 billion in savings for healthcare systems, Citi says.Jorgen Jahnsen, professor of medicine and gastroenterology at the University of Oslo, said that in Norway the use of biosimilar infliximab had already enabled the healthcare system to make considerable savings.Another test for biosimilars is looming in the United States, where a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee will decide on March 17 whether to recommend Celltrion's biosimilar version of Remicade.

307,"  FRANKFURT, March 20 Germany's Merck KGaA  will promote its deputy chief executive, Stefan Oschmann, to the top job next year to replace Karl-Ludwig Kley, Manager Magazin reported on Friday, citing company sources.The publication said Oschmann, 57, would take on the new role after the group's annual shareholder meeting in April 2016 or in September next year at the latest, when Kley's current contract expires.The German drugs and chemicals maker last September appointed Oschmann, the head of its pharma business at the time, as deputy chief executive from January, sharing strategic management functions and representation of the company with Kley, who is 63. A Merck spokeswoman said a decision on Kley's succession has not yet been made and that this would be a matter for the family-controlled group's board of partners. She declined to comment further. Merck, which is also the world's largest maker of liquid crystals for flat-panel displays, is buying Sigma-Aldrich , putting it on track to become the world's second-largest lab supplies maker after Thermo Fisher. Before joining Merck KGaA in 2011, German-born Oschmann was in charge of Merck & Co Inc's emerging markets operations. The two companies share historic roots but are under separate ownership since World War One.

308,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Merck & Co.'s (Merck)  long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) by one notch to 'A' and revised the Rating  Outlook to Stable from Negative. In addition, the company's short-term IDR has  been affirmed at 'F1'. Merck had $21.7 billion in outstanding debt at Dec. 31, 2014. A full list of  Fitch's ratings actions follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch expects MRK's leverage (total debt/EBITDA) to remain above 1.7x for the  next several years, a level consistent with an 'A' rating given the company's  scale and strong industry position.    --Fitch believes Merck will pursue targeted acquisitions as opposed to large  transformative ones. An improving pipeline and narrowing strategic focus reduces  the need to do big deals, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Cubicin  Pharmaceuticals (Cubist).  --Fitch expects Merck will continue to favor share repurchases over  deleveraging, with the possibility of further debt-funded stock buybacks being  an overhang on the credit profile. The company has roughly $11.7 billion  remaining on its existing repurchase authorizations as of March 24, 2015. --Sales at risk to patent expiries through 2017 are roughly 23% of 2014  revenues. About one-quarter of those sales are generated by biologics, which  tend have significantly less market share erosion upon patent expiration than do  traditional small-molecule drugs. --Merck continues to make progress in building its late-stage pipeline, with  approximately 17 new molecular entities (NMEs) in phase 3 development or  registration. --Januvia/Janumet, Merck's largest prescription drug franchise, continued to  post low single-digit growth during 2014, despite ongoing competitive headwinds  in the diabetes treatment market.  --Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $3.7 billion-$3.8 billion in free  cash flow (FCF)/(cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) during 2015 as improving margins offset soft revenue. Aggressive Capital Deployment Drives Downgrade: Fitch believes that Merck's  operating outlook is favorable. This includes an improving drug development  pipeline, recently good results in securing FDA approvals for new therapeutic  products, and a manageable percentage of sales at risk to near-term patent  expiration.  Higher leverage (total debt-to-EBITDA of 1.8x pro forma for the Cubist  acquisition versus 1x in 2011) is partly the result of the effects of the U.S.  branded-drug patent cliff on the company's top line and EBITDA in 2012-2013.  However, the company has not prioritized deleveraging as the business profile  has recovered, instead choosing to be aggressive in returning cash to  shareholders.  Cubist Acquistion Expands Presence in Hospital Setting: Merck's January 2015  $8.4 billion acquisition of Cubist plus roughly $1.1 billion in net debt expands  its presence in the anti-infective market, particularly in the hospital setting.  The transaction also adds two of Cubist's pipeline products, bevenopran  (opioid-induced constipation) and surotomycin (clostridium difficile), to  Merck's drug development efforts. The acquisition was largely funded with $8  billion in new debt, which Merck issued in February 2015.  The Cubist acquisition is an example of the types of targeted acquisitions that  Fitch believes Merck will continue to pursue. A large, transformational type of  transaction is relatively less likely given the company's favorable operating  outlook.  Diabetes Franchise Growth Continues: Combined sales of Januvia and Janumet  continued to grow during 2014 by roughly 3% year-over-year. Favorable clinical  data, a growing number of diabetic patients, and investment in the franchise has  helped to support the underlying growth in sales. The positive trend has  occurred despite increasing competition from other recently introduced branded  pharmaceuticals within the diabetes market.  Patent Exposure Manageable: The company faces a significant number of patent  expiries during the next two years, but Fitch views the risk as manageable as  roughly only 23% of total firm sales are at risk. In addition, Remicade, which  accounts for about 5.6% of total firm sales, is a biologic that will probably  experience less rapid sales losses to generic competition compared to  traditional small-molecule pharmaceuticals. Expanding Late-Stage Pipeline: Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its  late-stage pipeline with NMEs to treat cancers, bacterial and viral infections,  diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, central nervous afflictions, osteoporosis  and allergies.  While most of these projects are internally developed, Merck has partnered with  other innovator firms to take advantage of technological advancements that were  discovered and cultivated externally. The landscape for drug development is  expanding, particularly as more is learned about how genetics influence the  development, prevention and treatment of disease. As such, Fitch believes that  it is a responsibility, and strategically advantageous, for firms to look  externally as well as internally regarding new drug development. Share Repurchases to Continue: Fitch forecasts continued shareholder-friendly  actions during the near term, some of which may be funded by debt. Merck has  occasionally funded its share repurchases with debt. During 2014, the company  purchased a net $6.1 billion of its common stock, compared to $5.3 billion  during the prior LTM period.  On March 24, 2015, Merck announced its board authorized an additional $10  billion share repurchase program and stated that it had $1.7 billion remaining  on a May 2013 program. Positive FCF Expected: Fitch forecasts that Merck will continue to generate $3.7  billion-$3.8 billion in FCF (cash flow from operations of $10.3 billion minus  capital expenditures of $1.2 billion minus dividends of $5.4 billion) during  2015. Improving margins driven by sales mix and strong cost control efforts  should more than offset expected soft top-line growth.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Merck include: -- Declining revenue, driven by weak utilization in developed markets, the  divestiture of the consumer business and foreign exchange headwinds. Somewhat  offsetting the decline are relatively stronger demand in emerging markets, a  moderating patent cliff and incremental revenue from pipeline commercialization.  --Margin improvement driven by a focus on costs and an improving sales mix  benefiting from the divestiture of the lower margin consumer health business. --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion during 2015. --Targeted acquisitions with no strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued significant capital deployment to share repurchases. --Leverage to range between 1.8x-2x during the next two years driven by an  additional $8 billion in debt issued in February 2015 to fund the Cubist  acquisition.  LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through strong FCF generation  and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending Dec. 31, 2014 was  $1.3 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had approximately $15.7 billion in  cash/short-term investments (U.S.: 10%-20% of total balances/OUS: 80%-90% of  total balances) and full availability on its $6 billion revolver, maturing in  August 2019.  At Dec. 31, 2014, Merck had roughly $21.7 billion in debt outstanding, although  the company issued an additional $8 billion in debt in February 2015. After the  issuance the company had roughly $30.5 billion in debt outstanding, with $2.7  billion maturing in 2015, $2.4 billion in 2016, $0.3 billion in 2017 and $3  billion in 2018. Fitch expects near- to mid-term maturities will be satisfied  primarily through refinancing in the public debt markets. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Improving operations including new product development that support long-term  positive revenue growth and margin stability/increases; --An operational profile that would consitently generate significantly positive  FCF; --Cash deployment strategy that maintains gross debt leverage below 1.7x,  including managing through operational stress such as patent expiries. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF, possibly driven by  patent expiries not being offset by new product development; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Persistent leverage above 2.2x. RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded Merck's ratings as follows:   --Long-term IDR to 'A' from 'A+';  --Senior unsecured debt rating to 'A' from 'A+'; --Bank loan rating to 'A' from 'A+'. Fitch has also affirmed Merck's short-term ratings as follows: --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook on the long-term ratings is Stable.

311,"   By Deena Beasley  Merck & Co Inc's Keytruda, approved for treating melanoma, was shown in a trial to shrink tumors in nearly half of advanced lung cancer patients with high levels of a protein used by tumors to evade the body's own disease-fighting cells.The company said it has filed for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug as a treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has worsened despite previous treatment.Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab, belongs to a new class of drugs designed to help the immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1.On Friday, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said a trial of its PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, was stopped early after the drug proved to work better than chemotherapy in previously treated patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Opdivo is already approved for treating the less-common squamous NSCLC, as well as metastatic melanoma. Merck said its FDA lung cancer filing is for patients with both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. Lung cancer, which kills nearly 160,000 Americans annually, is seen as the biggest opportunity for the PD-1 drugs, which analysts expect to reach billions of dollars in sales.Merck's Phase 1 study of 495 patients with NSCLC, the most common form of the disease, found that 45 percent of patients with high levels of PD-L1 responded to Keytruda, compared with 16.5 percent of patients with PD-L1 levels of 1 percent to 49 percent.For patients with PD-L1 below 1 percent, the response rate - defined as tumor shrinkage of at least 30 percent - was 10.7 percent. Researchers said about a quarter of trial patients had PD-L1 expression in at least half of their tumor cells. Overall, 19 percent of trial patients responded to the drug. Side effects of Keytruda included thyroid problems. One patient died from pneumonitis, or lung inflammation, which was seen in 3.6 percent of trial patients. The Merck results were presented at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Researchers also presented results from a trial showing that Keytruda improved the length of time before advanced skin cancer worsened by 42 percent and extended patient survival by 34 percent compared with treatment with ipilimumab, a different immunotherapy sold by Bristol-Myers under the brand name Yervoy.

315,"   By Deena Beasley | April 24  April 24 Merck and Co Inc presented trial results on Friday showing that a once-daily combination of two experimental pills cured 95 percent of previously untreated hepatitis C patients after 12 weeks.The trial included patients infected with the most common form of the liver-destroying virus, genotype 1, along with less common genotypes 4 and 6. It also involved patients with and without liver cirrhosis.Cure rates, defined as sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment, were 92 percent for patients with genotype 1a; 99 percent for genotype 1b; 100 percent for genotype 4; and 80 percent for genotype 6. Cures were achieved in 97 percent of cirrhotic patients and 94 percent of non-cirrhotic patients.Gilead Sciences Inc's Harvoni, currently the only hepatitis C drug that does not need to be taken with antiviral pill ribavirin, is approved only for genotype 1 patients, which account for about 70 percent of U.S. infections. ""We have a really high efficacy regimen in a single tablet without ribavirin,"" said Eliav Barr, Merck's vice president, infectious diseases. ""Current data that have been out there have really focused on a standard population for HCV.""Merck said it still aims to submit an application for the grazoprevir/elbasvir regimen to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first half of this year. The agency has granted Merck ""breakthrough therapy"" designation for the treatment in genotype 1 HCV patients with end stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis and for genotype 4 HCV patients. Results from the 412-patient trial were presented at a meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver in Vienna and published in Annals of Internal Medicine.Gilead secured an early lead in the lucrative market for oral hepatitis C drugs - first with Sovaldi, and now Harvoni, which has a list price of $94,500 for 12 weeks. AbbVie Inc  entered the market last year with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie secured exclusive contracts with payers such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co , forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices.

316,"  (Adds analyst comment)By Bill BerkrotApril 27 Merck and Co's diabetes drug Januvia achieved the main goal of a long-awaited heart safety study, according to preliminary results released by the drugmaker on Monday, likely removing a cloud of uncertainty from its biggest product.Merck shares rose nearly 4 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement. Januvia had sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet.The Tecos study involved 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease. Januvia plus regular care led to no significant difference in a composite of time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization compared with usual care alone, Merck said. Significantly, among the secondary goals of the study, there was no increase in hospitalization for heart failure in the Januvia group versus placebo, Merck said. That could give Januvia a leg up on rival drugs that have shown a potential heart failure connection.Full details of the study are expected to be presented at a major diabetes meeting in Boston in June, the company said. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said uncertainty over the Tecos study had been an overhang on Merck shares.With Monday's initial results, ""a psychological overhang has been removed and the threat of major downside has been eliminated,"" Anderson said in a research note. Earlier this month, a panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted that two similar diabetes drugs, AstraZeneca Plc's Onglyza and Nesina from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, had acceptable cardiovascular risk profiles. However, they recommended that product information labels warn about the risk of heart failure.The two rival medicines and Januvia belong to a class of diabetes treatments known as DPP-4 inhibitors.The Tecos heart safety study was conducted by an independent academic research collaboration between the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit and the Duke University Clinical Research Institute. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.Merck shares rose as much as 3.8 percent to $59.25 in extended trading from their New York Stock Exchange close at $57.10.

327,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Merck & Co's (MRK.N) shares jumped almost 5 percent after the U.S. drugmaker reported better-than-expected quarterly results and released favorable data late Monday about the safety of its Januvia diabetes drug.The second-largest U.S. drugmaker on Tuesday said it earned $953 million, or 33 cents per share, in the first quarter. That compared with $1.71 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the year earlier period.Excluding special items, Merck earned 85 cents per share, well above the average analyst estimate of 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company incurred significantly higher costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, while having smaller tax benefits than a year ago.Company sales fell 8 percent to $9.43 billion, but would have fallen only 3 percent if not for the stronger dollar. Sales topped Wall Street expectations of $9.07 billion, helped by hedging against foreign currency fluctuations.Despite its strong first-quarter results, Merck only slightly raised its 2015 earnings forecast, to between $3.35 and $3.48 per share, excluding special items. It had forecast earnings of $3.32 to $3.47 per share. Januvia sales rose 3 percent in the quarter to $884 million, while a related drug called Janumet rose 7 percent to $509 million.Late on Monday, Merck said Januvia achieved the main goal of a long-awaited heart safety study according to preliminary results, which likely removed a cloud of uncertainty from its biggest product.The Tecos study involved 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease. Januvia plus regular care led to no significant difference in a composite of time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization compared with usual care alone. Significantly, there was no increase in hospitalization for heart failure in the Januvia group versus placebo. Analysts said that could give Januvia a leg up on rival drugs that have shown a potential heart failure connection. Sales of Merck's animal health products rose 2 percent to $829 million, but would have risen 13 percent if not for the stronger dollar. ""Overall, a solid Q1 with raised guidance,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said of Merck's report. Among large U.S. drugmakers, he said, only Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) have raised their 2015 forecasts.The two companies are leaders in immuno-oncology, drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer.

329,"  (Repeats Tuesday story with no changes to text.)By Ransdell Pierson and Bill BerkrotApril 28 Investors betting that Bristol-Myers Squibb will emerge as the leading player in a hot new class of cancer drugs hit the pause button on Tuesday as a rival therapy from Merck & Co showed much higher sales.Bristol shares fell as much as 2.7 percent and closed off 1 percent after reporting sales of Opdivo, a therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, totaled $40 million in the first quarter of the year. That was below Wall Street forecasts of $50 million.Merck said its Keytruda treatment had quarterly sales of $83 million, topping Wall Street estimates of about $70 million, helped by early compassionate use patients converting to paying customers following approval.""When investors saw Opdivo's number was below Keytruda's, that caused concern,"" said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Merck shares closed up 5 percent, though the gains were mostly attributed to positive new safety data on its top-selling Januvia diabetes treatment.Boris and other industry analysts said the early sales data represent only the first skirmish in a long battle for market share between Bristol-Myers and Merck. Some expect both drugs will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer.In addition, excitement over Bristol-Myers' cancer treatments have pushed shares to trade at 28.5 times expected 2016 per share earnings, Boris said. That compares with a multiple of 15.1 for Merck and 17.6 for the pharmaceutical sector. ""Based on price per fundamentals, we like the value of Merck versus Bristol at the moment,"" said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for ESquared Asset Management, which currently holds Merck but not Bristol shares.Ori Hershkovitz, a managing partner at Nexthera Capital in New York, said Bristol-Myers is trading more like a high-flying biotech.""The minute biotech gets pummeled, Bristol bears the brunt,"" he said, noting biotech stocks have retreated sharply in recent weeks on fears they were overly inflated. EARLY ADVANTAGE Opdivo was approved in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it received clearance to treat a common form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early-mover advantage in a much larger market.Keytruda has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and awaits regulatory approval in lung cancer.Both drugs work by blocking a protein called PD-1, helping the immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells. Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc  are also developing similar treatments. Boris forecast Opdivo annual sales reaching $7 billion by 2020 and said Tuesday's weakness in Bristol shares represents a buying opportunity. Opdivo has been shown to prolong survival in melanoma and lung cancer, according to clinical trial data.Keytruda has not yet demonstrated a survival benefit but is expected to do so in coming trials. Boris predicted it will capture annual sales of $3.7 billion by 2020.Bristol Chief Scientific Officer Francis Cuss told analysts on Tuesday that strong data on Opdivo along with the U.S. approvals in lung cancer and melanoma and expected European approval ""really puts us in a very strong competitive position.""The company recently reported strong results from a combination of Opdivo and its older immunotherapy Yervoy in advanced melanoma. It plans to apply for approval of the combination therapy by mid-year.Merck head of global human health, Adam Schechter, told analysts that the market will be big enough to handle several competitors, ""so I don't think it should be looked at as one company versus the other.""Pfizer is racing to catch up with Merck and Bristol-Myers, by beginning late-stage trials this year of its PD-1 inhibitor and conducting trials of four other immuno-oncology drugs.PD-1 treatments ""will be the workhorses for the foreseeable future, but they will need to be added to standard therapies or to (other) immuno-oncology treatments,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview. ""That's where the market will be, and we will be well positioned with those combination agents.""

331,"  MUMBAI India's Supreme Court has barred Glenmark Pharmaceuticals from making and selling copies of U.S. drugmaker Merck's diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet, according to a court document released on Friday.The court has, however, allowed Glenmark to continue to sell existing inventory, according to the document posted on the Supreme Court's website after a hearing.The decision against Glenmark comes two years after Switzerland's Novartis AG was denied patent protection for its cancer treatment Glivec in a landmark decision by India's Supreme Court that was widely seen as boosting the local generic drugs industry.Anti-diabetes drugs are the top-selling therapy area in India, where about 65 million people live with the disease and that number is expected to reach 100 million by 2030.Merck sued Glenmark in 2013 for infringing a patent it has on sitagliptin, the chemical compound in Januvia and Janumet, both of which the company has been selling in India since 2008. A month's dose of Merck's drugs costs about 1,300 Indian rupees ($20) and 1,900 Indian rupees ($30), respectively. Merck has licensed the drugs to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for sale in India.Glenmark sells the medicines under the brand names Zita and Zita-met at a nearly 30 percent discount to Merck's price.  Glenmark is barred from producing sitagliptin until the next hearing on the case, the order said.Spokespersons for Glenmark and Merck declined to comment.  ""This is an interim sort of measure taken by the court, and the decision on the patent of sitagliptin is subject to final orders,"" said Ameet Hariani, managing partner at Mumbai-based law firm Hariani & Co.

334,"  (Adds details from court order)MUMBAI May 15 India's Supreme Court has barred Glenmark Pharmaceuticals from making and selling copies of U.S. drugmaker Merck's diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet, according to a court document released on Friday.The court has, however, allowed Glenmark to continue to sell existing inventory, according to the document posted on the Supreme Court's website after a hearing.The decision against Glenmark comes two years after Switzerland's Novartis AG was denied patent protection for its cancer treatment Glivec in a landmark decision by India's Supreme Court that was widely seen as boosting the local generic drugs industry. Anti-diabetes drugs are the top-selling therapy area in India, where about 65 million people live with the disease and that number is expected to reach 100 million by 2030.Merck sued Glenmark in 2013 for infringing a patent it has on sitagliptin, the chemical compound in Januvia and Janumet, both of which the company has been selling in India since 2008. A month's dose of Merck's drugs costs about 1,300 Indian rupees ($20) and 1,900 Indian rupees ($30), respectively. Merck has licensed the drugs to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  for sale in India.Glenmark sells the medicines under the brand names Zita and Zita-met at a nearly 30 percent discount to Merck's price. Glenmark is barred from producing sitagliptin until the next hearing on the case, the order said.Spokespersons for Glenmark and Merck declined to comment.""This is an interim sort of measure taken by the court, and the decision on the patent of sitagliptin is subject to final orders,"" said Ameet Hariani, managing partner at Mumbai-based law firm Hariani & Co.

336,"   By Tom Polansek | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Brazil's JBS SA, the world's largest meatpacker, this year will look at opportunities for acquisitions in North and South America and Australia, Chief Executive Wesley Batista said on Wednesday.Batista, in a wide-ranging interview with Reuters at a BMO investor conference in New York, also predicted that Zilmax, a controversial growth enhancer for cattle, will not return to market. Zilmax's maker, Merck & Co, could not immediately be reached.Batista's comments about the search for potential deals come after the company said in recent months that it was focused on organic growth, not on acquisitions.JBS will ""for sure"" be looking at potential acquisitions in the chicken, pork and branded, packaged food sectors during 2015, Batista said. ""I cannot say that, second half of this year, we are not going to be preparing ourselves, to (maybe) look something for late this year or next year,"" he added.JBS in November struck a deal to buy Primo Group, a leading producer of ham, sausage and bacon in Australia and New Zealand, for A$1.45 billion ($1.25 billion) in a bid to increase its access to fast-growing Asian markets. Four months later, JBS' director of investor relations, Jerry O'Callaghan, told analysts the company's top priority for 2015 was to focus on organic growth. Last week, Batista said on a conference call that the company was open to deals but still ""very focused on our current business.""""I'm more focused on some internal things, but this does not mean we are not going to be looking,"" he said on Wednesday.Regarding Zilmax, Batista predicted the product will not return to use in U.S. beef production after Merck suspended sales in 2013. Major beef processors at the time stopped accepting cattle fed Zilmax following reports it may cause lameness. Merck has previously said Zilmax is safe and that it planned to resume sales after doing more tests.""It's not going to happen,"" Batista said about a return of Zilmax.Reuters reported in 2013 that packer Tyson Foods Inc had stopped taking Zilmax-fed livestock after more than two dozen animals that had been fed the drug arrived at one of its slaughterhouses with missing hooves. ""The product was not a good fit for cattle production,"" Batista said. ""Everybody stopped. Some issues came about animal welfare and this kind of thing, and they just decided to stop. I don't see this changing.""(This story has been corrected to change million to billion in paragraph 6) (Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2015-05-21,MRK,"Wed May 20, 2015 | 10:28pm EDT","Brazil's JBS looking for deals in Americas, Australia: CEO",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-jbs-acquistions-ceo-idUSKBN0O52VW20150521?type=companyNews
337,"  European regulators have recommended approval of Merck & Co Inc's immune system-boosting cancer drug Keytruda, following a similar green light last month for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's rival product Opdivo.Merck's drug, also known as pembrolizumab, was endorsed on Friday by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of melanoma.Both Keytruda and Opdivo are already approved in the United States.The EMA said Keytruda was recommended for use on its own for the treatment of advanced melanoma, the most aggressive type of skin cancer, in both first-line and previously treated patients. (bit.ly/1FrWjYm) Keytruda and Opdivo belong to a highly promising new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system. It is expected to be one of the most commercially successful new drugs to reach major markets this year.  Although Keytruda is still waiting for final regulatory approval in Europe, some patients in Britain are receiving it through a new early-access scheme, under which highly promising new drugs are made available free of charge ahead of formal licensing. Friday's positive European opinion on Keytruda is an intermediary step on the drug's path to market, since it now has to be sent to the European Commission for formal adoption. After that, decisions on price and reimbursement will taken by individual governments around Europe.

340,"  BRUSSELS May 27 German drugmaker Merck  has offered concessions in a bid to convince European Union antitrust regulators to clear its proposed $17 billion acquisition of U.S. peer Sigma-Aldrich Corp.Earlier this month, Merck said the European Commission expressed concerns ""of a limited nature"" over its biggest ever takeover. It submitted concessions on May 22, according to a filing on the EU executive's website. No details were provided. The EU competition watchdog will now decide by June 15 instead of June 1 whether to approve the takeover.  Companies typically offer to sell overlapping assets or provide rivals access to technologies or patents to allay regulatory worries that the merged entity may have an excessive market share.

341,"   By Deena Beasley and Bill Berkrot  New data to be released this weekend should help deepen the understanding of how broadly new drugs that unleash the body's immune system to fight cancer can be used.Results from key clinical trials will be presented starting Friday in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. These will include studies aimed at defining ahead of time which patients are likely to benefit from the costly drugs.    At the forefront will be rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck and Co designed to block a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1) that is used by tumors to evade the body's natural defenses.""It's going to be an important meeting to get some more (details) on the PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs,"" said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.     Bristol's Opdivo, or nivolumab, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it also received clearance to treat a form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early advantage in the much larger market. Merck's Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and is awaiting regulatory approval in lung cancer treatment.    First-quarter sales of both drugs surprised Wall Street, with Keytruda sales reaching $83 million, compared to $40 million for Opdivo, suggesting an early advantage for Merck in what many expect will be a years-long battle for market share.  Other drugmakers working on similar treatments include Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc. Many industry experts expect the entire class will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer.    On Friday, the ASCO conference will feature studies looking at Opdivo’s use against advanced liver cancer and non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Results will also be presented from a trial of Keytruda in head and neck cancer.     ""Bristol's in a really good position,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. ""My expectation is that they're going to be and will continue to be the leader in the lung cancer space."" Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, is the largest cause of cancer deaths in the United States.     At the same time, he said, Merck may bolster its argument that Keytruda has proven the broadest possible use to date, with ""clear activity in 13 different tumor types.”Other data points that will be closely watched by oncologists and investors include whether the level of PD-1 protein in a tumor can predict how well the new immunotherapies will work. Earlier this month, Roche said that a mid-stage trial of its experimental immunotherapy, MPDL3280A, showed it doubled the likelihood of survival for lung cancer patients with the highest levels PD-L1.     A separate trial of Merck's Keytruda to be released at ASCO was designed to see whether a higher number of genetic mutations in a tumor can lead to better results in treating colorectal and other cancers.Doctors at the meeting will also hear more on the potential for combining different types of immunotherapies to make them more effective, as well as the high costs associated with multiple treatment regimens. Treatment with Opdivo or Keytruda alone in the United States, for example, costs about $12,500 per month, or $150,000 a year.""Really the name of the game is having overall survival data in your label,"" said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris.

342,"   By Bill Berkrot  A Merck & Co drug that helps the immune system fight cancer was about twice as effective as the current standard therapy for patients with recurrent or advanced head and neck cancers, according to study data released on Friday.A quarter of the 132 patients who received the drug, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent. Fifty-six percent of patients experienced at least some tumor shrinkage in the ongoing single drug Phase I study dubbed Keynote-012, researchers reported.""This is remarkable because we don't usually see this level of activity with new agents. We have a track record of failure,"" said Dr. Tanguy Seiwert, lead investigator of the study from the University of Chicago.Advanced head and neck cancer is currently treated with Eli Lilly's Erbitux, known chemically as cetuximab, which typically has a response rate of 10 percent to 13 percent.""The only thing that works is cetuximab and this looks at least twice as good,"" said Seiwert, who was presenting the Keytruda data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. Merck shares rose more than 1 percent to $60.43 on the New York Stock Exchange.Keytruda and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co are at the forefront of a promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade the immune system. Keytruda is approved to treat advanced melanoma and awaits a decision for use in lung cancer. It is being tested against 30 types of cancer alone and in various combinations.While overall survival data was not yet available, Keytruda and Opdivo have extended survival for some patients in other cancers. ""Response rate doesn't do this justice,"" Seiwert said. ""A fraction of those patients will probably have long term survival. It can really make a difference for some patients who have incurable metastatic disease.""The drug appeared to work as well for patients whose cancer tested positive for human papillomavirus as those who were HPV negative. Some older treatments may be less effective in HPV positive patients, researchers said.  Keytruda was well tolerated with few side effects, Seiwert said. Serious immune-related side effects, such as inflammation of the lungs or colon, were reported in a very small number of patients in the study.Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer are usually expected to live about 10 to 12 months.

345,"   By Brendan Pierson  Two former Merck & Co Inc scientists accusing the drugmaker of falsifying tests of its exclusive mumps vaccine said in a court filing on Monday that Merck is refusing to respond to questions about the efficacy of the vaccine.Attorneys at Constantine Cannon, who represent the scientists, asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Lynne Sitarski of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to compel Merck to respond to their discovery request, which asks the company to give the efficacy of the vaccine as a percentage.Instead of answering the question, the letter said, Merck has been consistently evasive, using ""cut-and-paste"" answers saying it cannot run a new clinical trial to determine the current efficacy, and providing only data from 50 years ago.""Merck should not be permitted to raise as one of its principal defenses that its vaccine has a high efficacy, which is accurately represented on the product's label, but then refuse to answer what it claims that efficacy actually is,"" the letter said. A representative of Merck could not immediately be reached for comment.The two scientists, Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski, filed their whistleblower lawsuit in 2010 claiming Merck, the only company licensed by the Food and Drug Administration to sell a mumps vaccine in the United States, skewed tests of the vaccine by adding animal antibodies to blood samples. As a result, they said, Merck was able to produce test results showing that the vaccine was 95 percent effective, even though more accurate tests would have shown a lower success rate.

The marketing caused doctors to prescribe AzaSite for uses not covered by federal healthcare programs, which paid millions of dollars in false claims, the lawsuit said.As part of the settlement, which will go to the United States and various state governments, Inspire made several admissions related to its conduct, Bharara's office said.

371,"  Merck & Co said its experimental once-weekly diabetes drug was found to be as good as its blockbuster Januvia, which is taken once a day.The late-stage study compared 25 mg of the drug, omarigliptin, to 100 mg of Januvia. Both treatments belong to a family of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors that help lower blood sugar levels.Fifty-one percent of patients taking omarigliptin reached required sugar levels at week 24, compared with 49 percent of those who took Januvia. Merck, which has already applied for marketing approval for the drug in Japan, said it would submit its application in the United States by the end of 2015.Januvia, among Merck's best-selling drugs, raked in sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet.

372,"  (Adds American Diabetes Association comment)By Ransdell PiersonSept 17 Eli Lilly and Co's new Jardiance pill slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack and stroke, a finding that could make it a mainstay diabetes treatment and triple its use, according to researchers and analysts.Lilly shares jumped as much as 9 percent after data from the trial was released Thursday at a medical meeting in Stockholm.""This is the first diabetes therapy to show robust effect in reducing cardiovascular death. It really is big news,"" said Dr. Bernard Zinman, director of the Diabetes Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who led the three-year study of 7,000 people.Because about one-half of the deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, reducing cardiovascular risk is considered essential to diabetes care. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is linked to obesity.Jardiance, a once-a-day pill which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson's Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc's Farxiga. They lower blood sugar by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys.Jardiance was developed jointly with Germany's privately held Boehringer Ingelheim. Zinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events.About 26 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, according to federal data for 2014. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.""The big news here is that the drug reduced cardiovascular stuff. That has not been the case with all things in diabetes,"" said David Marrero, president of health care and education at the American Diabetes Association. ""It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that.""JARDIANCE COULD BOOST EARNINGS  Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. He cut his 2020 sales forecast for Merck & Co Inc's Januvia, the leading member of a competing class of oral diabetes drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors, to $6 billion from $7.8 billion.Anderson estimates Jardiance could boost Lilly's earnings per share by 8 percent on average across 2016 to 2020.In the study, patients taking Jardiance had a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular death, including from heart attacks and strokes. There was no significant difference in non-fatal heart attacks or non-fatal strokes.Those taking Jardiance had a 32 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 35 percent lower rate of hospitalizations from heart failure. The benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said.""This is a wonderful thing,"" said Dr. Jerome Tolbert of Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data.Zinman noted that Jardiance, like other SGLT2 drugs, causes weight loss and reduced blood pressure, besides lowering both blood sugar levels and body fat, and also reduces swelling, which all help the cardiovascular system.Lilly and Boehringer last month disclosed that Jardiance met its primary study goal, becoming the first diabetes drug to show heart-protective results in a large cardiovascular trial. But they did not unveil detailed data until Thursday at the medical meeting.Shares of Lily closed up 6.5 percent at $89.98 on Thursday, after rising as high as $92.83.In calculating the combined number of cardiac deaths, non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal strokes, 14 percent fewer events were seen in patients taking Jardiance in combination with standard treatments, compared with patients who took standard treatments alone, meeting the study's main goal.Standard treatments included statins, which lower cholesterol, and blood pressure drugs.

375,"  (Adds futures prices, company news items)     LONDON, Sept 25 European equity futures rose on Friday, although the region's major indexes could still end the week with a loss following blows dealt to the market this week by an emissions test debacle at Volkswagen and new signs of a slowdown in China.     The prospect of a U.S interest rate rise has also weighed on equities, and Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen said late on Thursday she expects the U.S. central bank to begin raising interest rates later this year as long as inflation remains stable and the U.S. economy is strong enough to boost employment.      Nevertheless, European equity futures were up on Friday, partly helped by firmer oil prices. Futures on the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX, France's CAC and Britain's FTSE 100 were all up between 1.4-1.6 percent.      Volkswagen shares will be in focus again in the wake of the company's U.S. emissions test rigging scandal.      Volkswagen will name Matthias Mueller, the head of its Porsche sports car brand, as its chief executive, a source close to the matter said on Thursday. California was also preparing a major enforcement action against Volkswagen over its admitted cheating on tailpipe emissions tests.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MARKET SNAPSHOT AT 0620 GMT                                                                                          LAST    PCT CHG  NET CHG  S&P 500                                      1,932.24    -0.34 %    -6.52  NIKKEI                                      17,880.51     1.76 %   308.68                                                                             EUR/USD                                        1.1153    -0.68 %  -0.0076  USD/JPY                                        120.43     0.31 %   0.3700  10-YR US TSY                                    2.141         --     0.02  YLD                                                                 10-YR BUND YLD                                  0.618         --     0.03  SPOT GOLD                                   $1,146.90    -0.58 %   -$6.72  US CRUDE                                       $45.30     0.87 %     0.39     > Asian shares erase gains, dollar gains as Yellen revives rate talk     > US STOCKS-Wall St ends lower as Caterpillar, health stocks weigh    > Nikkei edges down after weak inflation data, China woes    > TREASURIES-U.S. bonds rise on stock losses, economic worries    > FOREX-Dollar rebounds after Yellen keeps alive 2015 Fed rate hike view     > PRECIOUS-Gold dips as Yellen says Fed on track to hike rates this year     > METALS-London copper eyes largest weekly drop in two months    > Oil prices stable as firm Chinese seasonal demand offsets weak Japan data             COMPANY NEWS:     ACCOR :     The French hotel group is considering the possibility of transfering some 80 hotels in a new entity in which it would hold a minority stake, according to Les Echos newspaper.

As part of the probe, the group will send subpoenas to Volkswagen, she said.Australia and India also said they would look into whether Volkswagen misled consumers over its emissions claims.DEUTSCHE BANK Indicated 0.9 percent higherDeutsche Bank AG must face a U.S. government lawsuit seeking to recoup more than $190 million over an alleged tax fraud 15 years ago, after a federal judge on Thursday turned down the German's bank's request to dismiss the case.BAYER Indicated 1.6 percent higherDozens of women urged the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday to withdraw Bayer AG's permanent contraceptive device, Essure, saying not enough is known about its potential to harm users.

377,"  (Adds company news items)     LONDON, Sept 25 European stocks were seen opening higher on Friday, although the region's major indexes could still end the week with a loss following blows dealt to the market this week by an emissions test debacle at Volkswagen and new signs of a slowdown in China.     The prospect of a U.S interest rate rise has also weighed on equity markets, and Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen said late on Thursday that she expects the U.S. central bank to begin raising interest rates later this year as long as inflation remains stable and the U.S. economy is strong enough to boost employment.      Financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 to open up by 59-69 points, or 1-1.2 percent higher. Germany's DAX was seen opening up by 119-143 points, or 1.3-1.5 percent higher, while France's CAC 40  was seen up by 53 points, or 1.2 percent higher.     Volkswagen shares will be in focus again in the wake of the company's U.S. emissions test rigging scandal.      Volkswagen will name Matthias Mueller, the head of its Porsche sports car brand, as its chief executive, a source close to the matter said on Thursday.

382,"   By Deena Beasley and Natalie Grover  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Merck & Co Inc's immunotherapy, Keytruda, for patients with the most common form of lung cancer whose tumors produce a specific biological marker.The FDA approval for Keytruda in advanced non-small cell lung cancer is for patients whose tumors express PD-L1, a protein targeted by the drug, and includes a companion diagnostic, made by a unit of Agilent Technologies Inc, to measure those protein levels. A Merck spokeswoman said clinical trials found that 22 percent of patients with this type of cancer had PD-L1 scores of at least 50 percent.""The restricted label is generally in line with expectations and is likely to broaden over time as data from additional trials support Keytruda's efficacy in a larger patient population,"" JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note.The FDA decision ""has the potential to transform the way that lung cancer is treated,"" Dr. Edward Garon, associate clinical professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and a lead investigator on Keytruda clinical trials, said in a statement. Merck said the price of Keytruda for health insurers and other payers is around $12,500 per month, or $150,000 a year.Keytruda and another similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient's own immune system to attack the cancer.Wall Street analysts expect cancer immunotherapies to earn combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020. Bristol's Opdivo is approved by the FDA to treat melanoma as well as squamous non-small cell lung cancer, a smaller subset of the disease, but without a requirement for protein testing.Keytruda, now approved for both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, is also approved to treat patients with advanced melanoma.

386,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A former Merck & Co Inc  employee was sentenced to more than three years in prison on Tuesday for engaging in an insider trading scheme by tipping a friend at Bank of New York Mellon Corp about potential pharmaceutical mergers.Zachary Zwerko, a former senior finance analyst at Merck who was involved with performing work on potential corporate deals, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan to pay more than $694,000.The case was the latest in a string of insider trading prosecutions pursued under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office confirmed Zwerko's sentence. Bharara's office since 2009 has secured convictions of 83 people.Zwerko, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was sentenced to 37 months in prison. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud charges in February. His plea followed that of David Post, a friend from Rutgers Business School and a former BNY Mellon product manager, who pleaded guilty in October 2014.Prosecutors said Zwerko in 2010 proposed passing along information about drug company deals to Post to trade on in exchange for a cut in the profits. After some time passed, Zwerko began funneling information to Post, resulting in him buying shares of Ardea BioSciences Inc, which while not bought by Merck was ultimately acquired by AstraZeneca Plc in 2012, prosecutors said.Post's trading that time resulted in $105,000 in profits, prosecutors said, and Zwerko subsequently passed along tips on five other transactions. While some of Post's trades were not profitable, his trading in 2014 ahead of Merck's acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals resulted in a major windfall of $579,000, which he had planned to split with Zwerko, prosecutors said.In total, the insider trading scheme generated illegal profits of at least $737,000, and Post paid Zwerko $57,000 as part of his expected cut, prosecutors said.The case is U.S. v.

Dr Reddy's is developing biosimilars such as rituximab and pegfilgrastim for use in cancer treatment under a pact with Germany's Merck KGaA and said it plans to launch its first biosimilar in the United States by 2018.A spokesman at Intas, which developed pegfilgrastim in partnership with Canada's Apotex Inc, told Reuters the company was considering partnering with a Swiss drugmaker to launch the product in the United States. It declined to name the firm.Chandru Chawla, head of Cipla Ltd's new ventures unit, said India's ""fundamental disadvantage"" over United States, Europe and South Korea was that biotechnology never evolved in India to the extent that chemistry did.""In terms of having the right knowledge ecosystem and the pools of talent, India is far behind,"" he said.Globally, Western pharmaceutical firms such as Novartis AG; Pfizer Inc, in partnership with South Korea's Celltrion Inc; and Merck & Co with partner Samsung Bioepis, are leading in the race to dominate the Western biosimilars market.""South Korea has made very significant strides in a very short period of time,"" said Cartikeya Reddy, Dr Reddy's executive vice president for biologics.

It declined to name the firm.Chandru Chawla, head of Cipla Ltd's new ventures unit, said India's ""fundamental disadvantage"" over United States, Europe and South Korea was that biotechnology never evolved in India to the extent that chemistry did.""In terms of having the right knowledge ecosystem and the pools of talent, India is far behind,"" he said.Globally, Western pharmaceutical firms such as Novartis AG  ; Pfizer Inc, in partnership with South Korea's Celltrion Inc ; and Merck & Co with partner Samsung Bioepis, are leading in the race to dominate the Western biosimilars market.""South Korea has made very significant strides in a very short period of time,"" said Cartikeya Reddy, Dr Reddy's executive vice president for biologics. ""In this regard they have indeed pulled ahead of Indian companies.""

396,"   By Deena Beasley | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Oct 21 Investor concerns over accounting practices at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc have put a spotlight on the little-known and fast-growing specialty pharmacy industry.Shares of Valeant fell 19 percent on Wednesday after influential short-seller Citron Research accused the company of using specialty pharmacies, through a network led by its partner Philidor Rx Services, to inflate its revenue, an allegation the drugmaker denied.Specialty pharmacies are designed to deliver medications with unique handling, storage and distribution requirements, often for patients with complex conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. They can provide more detailed guidance for patients on how to take the drugs. Specialty drugs are often expensive, sometimes priced at over $100,000 a year.The industry has been growing quickly as drugmakers shift research and sales efforts to more complex medications. Pembroke Consulting estimated early this year that the number of accredited specialty pharmacies would jump by nearly 100 to a total of 250 in 2015.In the past, drugmakers were directly involved in distribution of their products. Merck & Co, for example, owned a pharmacy service company known as Medco. But it spun off that business in 2003, partly due to concerns over potential conflicts of interest.Medco was later acquired by Express Scripts Holding Co , which is now the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager. A New York Times report earlier this week said that Valeant worked with Philidor Rx Services, based in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, to increase sales, and prices, for treatments that don't meet the specialty criterion, including drugs for acne and toenail fungus, and that regular pharmacies may not prescribe.The same day, Valeant disclosed that a growing percentage of its revenue is coming from products dispensed through specialty pharmacies, and that it had purchased an option to acquire Philidor. Valeant is Philidor's main customer.""We find specialty pharmacies improve patients' access to medicines at an affordable price, and help ensure physicians are able to prescribe the medications they believe most appropriate for their patients,"" Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson told investors on a conference call.He said that for many of the company's skin products, Philidor and other specialty pharmacies fill a customer's prescription before reimbursement is worked out with an insurer, and that Valeant only recognizes revenue from the products once the drug reaches a patient. Pearson also described how Valeant's relationship with another specialty pharmacy, R&O Pharmacy LLC of Camarillo, California, turned sour. Valeant said it had shipped $69 million worth of medications at wholesale prices to R&O, and that the pharmacy ""is currently improperly holding significant amounts it receives"" from insurers.R&O has sued Valeant in California over its efforts to claim the money, saying it has no contractual relationship with the drugmaker. Representatives of R&O declined to comment.Citron alleged that R&O and Philidor may actually be the same company, and that the two were used by Valeant to create phantom accounts to inflate revenue. In a statement, Philidor said R&O is part of its network of affiliated pharmacies and that it provides services to those partners including call center functions, help with insurance claims, technical support and ""certain management services."" ""Philidor does not currently have a direct equity ownership in R&O Pharmacy or the affiliated pharmacies, but does have a contractual right to acquire the pharmacies now or in the future subject to regulatory approval,"" the statement said.Scott Knoer, chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic, said the web of relationships raises concern. Cleveland Clinic and other hospitals have been hit financially by Valeant price increases on heart drugs Isuprel and Nitropress.""There would be an inherent conflict of interest if a specialty pharmacy is owned by someone making the drug,"" Knoer said. ""There could be pressure on the pharmacy to start patients on the drug, or continue patients on it, or not stop them"" as warranted.While concerns over Valeant's ties to its specialty pharmacies hit rival stocks on Wednesday, both Allergan Plc  and Endo International Plc were quick to say their businesses did not operate in the same manner.Allergan said about 3 percent of its U.S. sales of branded drugs are distributed through specialty pharmacies, most of which are specialty products that require careful handling.Endo said it uses specialty pharmacies mainly for branded products that need to be administered by doctors, and that drugs distributed through this channel represent about 3 percent of the company's projected total revenue for 2015. It said any specialty pharmacies that it works with are fully independent of the company.

397,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Merck & Co's approved Keytruda lung cancer treatment provided superior overall survival to chemotherapy in a late-stage study of patients with advanced disease whose tumors produce a protein called PD-L1 associated with increased risk of the disease.The U.S. drugmaker on Monday said patients taking the approved 2 milligram dosage of Keytruda and those taking an experimental 10 milligram dose had longer overall survival compared with those taking docetaxel, a standard treatment for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Keytruda thereby met its main goal of the study.Patients whose tumors had especially high levels of PD-L1 also went longer without a progression of disease than those taking docetaxel, Merck said. Those whose tumors expressed PD-L1, but not at high levels, did not show such a statistically  significant benefit in progression-free survival. Safety of Keytruda was consistent with what had been seen in previous trials among lung cancer patients, Merck said in a release that included only summary ""topline"" information from the results.More detailed data from the study will be provided soon, Merck said, adding that it will ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this year to add the new data to the drug's package insert label.   U.S. regulators in October approved Keytruda on an accelerated basis for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors produce PD-L1. The approval was contingent on the company providing more detailed data in the future on Keytruda's safety and effectiveness.Keytruda and a similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient's own immune system to recognize and therefore attack the cancer.

404,"   By Natalie Grover and Samantha Kareen Nair  Merck & Co's drug to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants used in surgery is safe and effective enough to warrant approval, an independent panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. The drug, which goes by the chemical name of sugammadex, has repeatedly been rejected by the FDA due to concerns about potentially dangerous allergic reactions, even though it is approved in more than 75 countries.The company acquired the drug when it bought U.S. drugmaker Schering Plough, which developed sugammadex, in 2009. Merck shares were down 1 percent on Friday, after the company said in a separate statement on Thursday that it had received a civil investigation demand from a U.S. Attorney's Office in Pennsylvania over the pricing of its asthma medicine, Dulera.Independent advisers to the FDA said in a meeting on Friday that they were satisfied with the potential hypersensitivity and cardiac risk associated with the drug when it was used in a monitored setting.  Panelists underscored the fact that existing agents carried similar risks.A majority of the voters suggested additional studies to evaluate risks in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and obese, pediatric and pregnant patients.Sugammadex, an injectable drug, is sold in over 50 countries. More than 12 million doses of the drug have been sold as of April 22 since it was first approved in 2008 in Europe.  FDA staff had noted on Wednesday that hypersensitivity related to the drug appeared to increase with higher doses, but not with repeated exposure. (1.usa.gov/1kzg2PA)Brokerage Cowen & Co estimates that sugammadex, if approved in the United States, could generate annual sales of $550 million in the country by 2020.  This will make the drug, sold overseas under the brand name Bridion, a moderate-sized product for Merck. The FDA usually follows the panel's recommendations, but is not obligated to do so.

406,"  (Adds details, background; updates shares)By Natalie Grover and Samantha Kareen NairNov 6 Merck & Co's drug to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants used in surgery is safe and effective enough to warrant approval, an independent panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said.The drug, which goes by the chemical name of sugammadex, has repeatedly been rejected by the FDA due to concerns about potentially dangerous allergic reactions, even though it is approved in more than 75 countries.The company acquired the drug when it bought U.S. drugmaker Schering Plough, which developed sugammadex, in 2009.Merck shares were down 1 percent on Friday, after the company said in a separate statement on Thursday that it had received a civil investigation demand from a U.S. Attorney's Office in Pennsylvania over the pricing of its asthma medicine, Dulera. Independent advisers to the FDA said in a meeting on Friday that they were satisfied with the potential hypersensitivity and cardiac risk associated with the drug when it was used in a monitored setting.Panelists underscored the fact that existing agents carried similar risks. A majority of the voters suggested additional studies to evaluate risks in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and obese, pediatric and pregnant patients.Sugammadex, an injectable drug, is sold in over 50 countries. More than 12 million doses of the drug have been sold as of April 22 since it was first approved in 2008 in Europe.FDA staff had noted on Wednesday that hypersensitivity related to the drug appeared to increase with higher doses, but not with repeated exposure. (1.usa.gov/1kzg2PA) Brokerage Cowen & Co estimates that sugammadex, if approved in the United States, could generate annual sales of $550 million in the country by 2020.This will make the drug, sold overseas under the brand name Bridion, a moderate-sized product for Merck.The FDA usually follows the panel's recommendations, but is not obligated to do so.

But the company in 2004 recalled Vioxx from the market after a colon-polyp prevention study showed it more than doubled the risk of heart attacks or stroke after 18 months of use.After thousands of former users of Vioxx sued Merck, claiming they had been harmed by the drug, Merck in 2008 settled most remaining product-liability lawsuits for $4.85 billion. But other litigation continued, including a multi-district class action lawsuit pending against Merck in New Jersey federal court, which alleged Merck kept investors in the dark about negative data from earlier company-sponsored trials of the medicine. Merck on Friday said it had agreed to settle that lawsuit by paying $830 million to investors who bought Merck stock between May 21, 1999 and October 29, 2004, plus pay an additional amount for attorneys' fees.The company's cash payment for the settlement and fees will be about $680 million, after reimbursement from insurance policies, Merck said, and the company will record a charge for that amount in the fourth quarter of 2015.

435,"   By Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland | DAVOS/LONDON  DAVOS/LONDON The Gavi global alliance for vaccines and immunization group signed a $5 million advance purchase commitment on Wednesday to buy a vaccine being developed by Merck to protect against future outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus.Gavi said the agreement would help the U.S. drugmaker take the experimental Ebola vaccine through late-stage clinical trials to licensing and then through pre-qualification by the World Health Organization (WHO).If approved, Merck's so-called VSV-ZEBOV live attenuated Ebola Zaire vaccine would become one of the world's first licensed Ebola shots and Gavi would be able to start buying it to create a stockpile for future outbreaks, it said in a statement issued at the World Economic Forum in Davos.A vast epidemic of Ebola which swept through three countries in West Africa last year killed more than 11,300 people and infected more than 28,600. ""The suffering caused by the Ebola crisis was a wake-up call to many in the global health community,"" said Gavi's chief executive Seth Berkley.""New threats require smart solutions and our innovative financing agreement with Merck will ensure that we are ahead of the curve for future Ebola outbreaks.""The deal was agreed on the understanding that the vaccine will be submitted for a license by the end of 2017. Speaking to Reuters in Davos, Berkley said the advance commitment should give a positive signal to drugmakers developing products that may not have an immediate market""It's critical that we give confidence to companies that when they make this type of effort, there is somebody to buy it,"" he said.As part of the agreement, Merck will ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available from May 2016 to be used in expanded use clinical trials as well as for emergency use as needed while development work on the shot continues. Until the West Africa Ebola epidemic, which swiftly became the largest in history, previous outbreaks of the disease have infected far smaller numbers, usually fewer than 1,000 people. Initial results from a clinical trial in Guinea of the vaccine, which tested it on some 4,000 people who had been in close contact with a confirmed Ebola case, showed complete protection after 10 days.Merck says it has already submitted an application through WHO's Emergency Use Assessment and Listing (EUAL) procedure which, if approved, would allow for the vaccine to be used if there is another Ebola emergency before it is licensed.Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain's Wellcome Trust global health charity which co-funded clinical trials of the Merck shot, said the ""remarkable results"" from those trials, as well as promising progress of other vaccine candidates, were ""among the few positive outcomes to emerge from the epidemic"". The WHO announced last week that no new Ebola cases had been reported in the three worst affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the preceding 42 days. Yet shortly after the WHO announcement - which included a warning that sporadic flare-ups could occur - Sierra Leone reported an Ebola-related death.Farrar said such instances show how an Ebola vaccine could yet be useful in this outbreak, even in its final stages.""As we saw with the new confirmed case just last week, the Ebola epidemic is likely to have a long tail and it's possible that several more isolated cases will emerge in the coming weeks and months,"" he said in a statement.""This vaccine...could still play an important role in containing any additional flare ups of this outbreak, as well as being available to help prevent future epidemics.""

That is a positive thing,"" Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier told Reuters in Davos on Friday.""In particular, some of the early-stage companies are struggling to get the next round of financing as people start to be a little less willing to pay for the promise of growth, so that gives us opportunities.""Frazier said he was looking for small and medium-sized  ""bolt-on"" deals to bring in new drugs, although such transactions could still be sizeable.""At our size, I would say a $10 billion or $20 billion deal would qualify as a bolt-on,"" he said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting. With a strong balance sheet, Merck has plenty of room for maneuver when it comes to capital allocation, leading some analysts to speculate it might also step up share repurchases.Frazier said finding value-creating acquisitions of external science ranked as his ""number two"" priority, coming behind funding for ongoing research but ahead of returning cash to shareholders.Last year, Merck did a record number of deals, though most were on the small side. Its last major deal was an agreement to buy antibiotics specialist Cubist for more than $8 billion in December 2014. Merck is not alone in chasing promising acquisitions. The wider healthcare sector saw its biggest deal-making streak ever in 2015, with global transactions totaling $673 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.The downturn in biotech stocks has been driven in part by fears among investors of a political backlash against high drug prices. Frazier said much of the anger surrounding the issue had been sparked by ""a few bad actors"" exploiting market failures to extract excessive profits. But he acknowledged there were also wider concerns about the affordability of medicines.""Right now we are in the middle of a presidential election season and the rhetoric level is pretty high,"" he said.""But I do think people in Congress hear from their constituents at home about the challenges they have with paying for their drugs and so I think there will be pressure to do something.""

439,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Thursday positioned itself as a potential earnings pacesetter in 2016, with a forecast of up to 19 percent growth that eclipses profit gains expected by most other large drugmakers.Bolstered by blistering sales of its Opdivo immuno-oncology drug and its Eliquis blood clot preventer, Bristol-Myers  expects earnings this year of $2.30 to $2.40 per share. It earned $2.01 per share last year.In contrast, Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) on Thursday predicted relatively flat 2016 earnings following strong gains last year, when sales of new cancer and diabetes drugs offset sharp declines in older medicines.Swiss rivals Roche Holding AG ROG.VX and Novartis AG NOVN.VX have also predicted flat 2016 earnings, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) expects growth of 3.6 percent to 6.2 percent, driven by sales of newer medicines.Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) have not yet provided 2016 earnings expectations, but Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expects them next week to forecast growth of 4.2 percent and 8 percent, respectively.Bristol-Myers, whose $17 billion in annual sales are far below its industry peers, has downsized in recent years by selling off its diabetes drugs and cutting costs. ""They've made courageous decisions to streamline expenses, and their reduced revenue base will also fuel earnings growth,"" said Guggenheim Partners analyst Tony Butler.Ashtyn Evans, an analyst with Edward Jones, said she expects Opdivo eventually to generate annual sales of more than $8 billion.Half of Bristol-Myers' revenue will likely come from Opdivo and other cancer drugs by 2020, Evans said, allowing the company to generate average annual earnings growth in the 20 percent range for the next three to five years. ""Bristol is a lot different than it was just a few years ago,"" Evans said, citing its razor focus on potentially lucrative immuno-oncology drugs, while also developing cardiovascular and anti-inflammation medicines.Sales of Eliquis, which Bristol-Myers markets with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), more than doubled to $602 million in the quarter.The pill was approved in 2012 to prevent blood clots among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Growing numbers of doctors are prescribing it as a safer and more-effective alternative to longstanding oral therapy warfarin. Bristol's better-than-expected quarterly earnings were also due to soaring sales of Opdivo, a new treatment for melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer that is also being tested against other cancers. Sales of the injectable medicine, which was approved in late 2014 and works by taking the brakes off the immune system, jumped to $475 million.    The Princeton, New Jersey-based company said on Thursday it had halted a large trial of Opdivo after a monitoring committee concluded that head and neck cancer patients taking the drug survived longer than those taking standard chemotherapy.Analysts said Opdivo could pick up $1 billion in eventual sales for head and neck cancer, if it is approved for that indication. Earlier on Thursday, Roche spooked investors by forecasting stagnant 2016 earnings. Analysts cited concern that growth could slow for Roche's three big cancer treatments: Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin.Novartis on Wednesday also forecast flat 2016 results, amid generic competition for its Gleevec leukemia drug and disappointing sales of new heart failure medicine, Entresto.

440,"   By Deena Beasley and Caroline Humer  Jan 29 U.S. pharmacy benefit managers expect the launch of Merck & Co Inc's new hepatitis C pill to improve their leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers.The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved Merck's Zepatier for treatment of patients infected with the most common form of the liver-destroying virus, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4.The list price for the new drug is $54,600 for a 12-week regimen - compared with $94,500 for Gilead Sciences Inc's  Harvoni. A multi-pill regimen, Viekira Pak, from AbbVie Inc has a list price near $83,000.AbbVie in late 2014 secured an exclusive contract with Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of U.S.  prescription drug plans, which forced Gilead to discount its own contract prices with a range of other payers. Merck said it priced Zepatier in line with net prices for competing drugs. ""We look forward to working with Merck,"" Express Scripts said in an emailed statement on Friday. ""Having multiple, clinically effective options allows us to again leverage competition and make medicine more affordable for our clients while ensuring appropriate patient access.""No changes have been made as yet to Express Scripts' preferred formulary, but Harvoni will be added to its Medicare formulary on March 1. CVS Health Corp, the No. 2 drug benefit manager, which now gives preferred status to Gilead's hepatitis C drugs, said in an email that it is ""employing a strategic assessment of the therapy landscape and engaging with drugmakers to evaluate options.""Shares of Gilead were down 5 percent at $83.00 in Friday Nasdaq trading - their lowest since June 2014. Merck shares were up 2 percent at $50.35 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts estimate that Gilead, with $14 billion in hepatitis C drug sales for the first nine months of 2015, controls about 93 percent of the U.S. market, compared with AbbVie's 7 percent.""Given Merck's interest in participating in such a large market, we model and fully expect increased price competition and we also view Merck's list price as a rational way to stay out of the drug pricing spotlight,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note.UBS has forecast that Merck will get 8 percent of the U.S.  genotype 1 market this year, rising to 15 percent in 2019.Both Zepatier and Viekira Pak require periodic liver function tests. In addition, Harvoni remains the only eight-week treatment option for genotype 1 patients.

443,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) on Wednesday issued a cautious 2016 outlook and reported disappointing fourth-quarter sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment and its Remicade arthritis drug, sending its shares down nearly 3 percent.    Sales of Januvia and a related drug called Janumet, the company's biggest franchise, fell 12 percent to $1.45 billion. Merck said wholesalers had stocked up in the prior quarter, and the products face growing competition from other oral diabetes treatments.But Adam Schechter, the company's head of global human health, said Januvia sales should increase this year, excluding the effects of a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of revenue from overseas. Januvia sales did not suffer after recent data showed Eli Lilly & Co's (LLY.N) rival Jardiance drug sharply reduced deaths among diabetics at risk of heart attack, Schechter said.Sales of Remicade, which is facing competition outside the United States from cheaper biosimilars, dropped 29 percent to $396 million. In a conference call with analysts, Schechter said the drug's market share was shrinking, and the trend would accelerate.   ""Our initial read on the earnings and guidance reaffirms our neutral stance on (Merck) as pressure on key products such as Januvia and Remicade will likely limit near-term growth,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said.Merck is counting on Keytruda, a recently approved treatment for melanoma and lung cancer, to boost its earnings for years to come. The medicine, which takes the brakes off the immune system, is competing with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (BMY.N) similar Opdivo treatment, which is picking up sales faster.    Keytruda sales rose to $214 million in the fourth quarter, about half Opdivo's $475 million in revenue in that period.     Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker behind Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), forecast full-year earnings of $3.60 to $3.75 per share, excluding special items. The analysts' average estimate was $3.72, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Merck said it expected 2016 revenue of $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion. Wall Street had forecast $40.25 billion.     Fourth-quarter revenue fell 3 percent to $10.22 billion, below analysts' expectations of $10.35 billion.

Merck has demanded more than $2 billion in damages and a royalty of 10 percent of Gilead's sales going forward. The jury must now decide exactly how much Gilead owes.

A bench trial on Wednesday will pit Gilead's Fish & Richardson attorneys against Merck's lawyers from Williams & Connolly, on Gilead's claim that Merck has ""unclean hands"" because it used Gilead's technology in its own patent applications and so should be precluded from enforcing its patents. Merck says the jury has already found that its patents are valid, foreclosing any unclean hands defense.

A collective action under the Equal Pay Act requires potential class members to opt in, unlike a traditional class action in which class members must opt out.

It would still require final approval later in the case for class members to win damages.

However, Shipp ruled that the four former sales representatives who brought the lawsuit had already made a ""modest factual showing"" of how Merck's policies affected them and other employees similarly.""We're glad that women across the country are going to have an opportunity to join this case,"" said Russell Kornblith, an attorney for the plaintiffs.""We remain confident that this case lacks merit,"" Merck said in a statement emailed by spokeswoman Lainie Keller. ""The company will continue to vigorously defend itself, and remains fully committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all employees.""

""Merck's acts are even more egregious because the main perpetrator of its misconduct was its attorney,"" she said.In a statement, Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said Gilead's allegations against the patents are without merit and the company would appeal.

Harvoni, for instance, lists at $1,125 per pill before discounts and $94,000 for a 12-week regimen.The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.

486,"  Merck & Co's experimental drug to treat the most common cause of hospital-associated infectious diarrhea warrants approval, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday.The panel voted 10-5, with one abstention, that the drug, bezlotoxumab, was effective in preventing a recurrence of infection with Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile, a germ that causes inflammation of the colon and potentially fatal diarrhea.The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does.The panel's vote follows an internal review by FDA staff which found an apparent decrease in recurrence of C. difficile but expressed concern as to whether the drug could hurt the cure rate of the initial C. difficile episode.Panelists who voted in favor of the drug acknowledged the FDA's concerns but said they were persuaded there was a need for new targeted therapies and this one seems effective. ""We haven't had a new drug for C. difficile in our armamentarium for some time,"" Dr. Joanna Schaenman, assistant professor of medicine at UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, said.Spores from C. difficile bacteria cling to surfaces and can spread easily in hospitals and nursing homes. The germ infected nearly 500,000 people in 2011 and killed 15,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control.C. difficile is typically treated with antibiotics. But these kill good bacteria in the gut, setting up a vicious cycle in which low levels of good bacteria make it more difficult for the body to fend off the bad C. difficile germ.  Bezlotoxumab is designed to neutralize C. difficile toxin B, suppressing symptoms long enough for the body's natural flora to replenish and preventing the need for additional cycles of antibiotics.Still, not all panelists were convinced, saying the drug had been tested on too few people to be sure it was really helping achieve a sustained cure, and they worry the drug could even impede a cure. Dr. Lindsey Baden, director of clinical research at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the panel's acting chair, said the drug was promising but so far, ""the level of proof is not there yet.""The FDA is due to make its decision by July 23.

489,"  Advanced lung cancer patients who took Merck & Co Inc's Keytruda immuno-oncology medicine in a large trial and were previously untreated went longer without their disease worsening and showed a survival advantage over those given standard chemotherapy, the drugmaker said on Thursday.An independent data monitoring board recommended that the late-stage trial be stopped due to the favorable results, Merck said, thereby allowing patients who were taking chemotherapy to switch over to the company's treatment.Keytruda, which takes the brakes off the immune system by blocking a protein called PD-1, is already approved for patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy for advanced non-small lung cancer.Patients enrolled in the trial had tumors with high levels of PD-L1, a related protein whose presence may help identify which patients are most likely to respond to Keytruda and similar drugs called checkpoint inhibitors.    Merck hopes the new data will allow its injectable drug, which has a list price of about $150,000 a year, to be used earlier as a treatment for the most common form of lung cancer.Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's approved rival Opdivo is also being tested as a so-called first line treatment for NSCLC, with data expected later this year. Opdivo's studies have enrolled patients regardless of their PD-L1 levels, helping assure its wider use and greater sales than Keytruda.John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, on Thursday forecast that Keytruda will generate annual sales of $7 billion by 2021. But he predicted Keytruda will have only 25 to 30 percent of the first-line NSCLC market, while Opdivo commands a 65 to 70 percent market share.

529,"   By Ransdell Pierson  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said its blockbuster Opdivo immunotherapy failed to slow progression of symptoms in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, a major setback expected to benefit Merck & Co's rival medicine.Shares of Bristol-Myers fell almost 16 percent to $63.54 on Friday after the company announced failure of the late-stage trial. Shares of Merck gained 8.7 percent to $62.89. ""This is the worst-case scenario"" for Opdivo and Bristol-Myers, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. ""There appears to be no silver lining.""Opdivo had been considered the clear leader in a costly new class of medicines called checkpoint inhibitors that work by taking the brakes off the immune system. Its second-quarter sales of $840 million were more than double those of Merck's Keytruda. Opdivo won approval in March 2015 for treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had previously failed to benefit from chemotherapy. Six months later, Keytruda received approval for a similar patient population. Meanwhile, both companies raced to complete large trials to see if their drugs, which each cost about $150,000 a year, would also benefit patients who had never previously been treated for the most common form of lung cancer. The trials compared the drugs against chemotherapy. ""Obviously the results of this trial are disappointing,"" Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio said in an interview, saying that the data suggests there is no role in the foreseeable future for Opdivo as a standalone medicine for previously untreated lung cancer.Patients in the Opdivo trial had tumors with low levels of PD-L1, a protein whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors. Those in the successful Merck trial, by contrast, were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1 and represented a smaller percentage of the lung cancer population.Caforio said the best hope now for Opdivo in front-line treatment of lung cancer is combination therapy. The company is conducting a late-stage study with more than 2,000 patients in which Opdivo will be combined with Bristol-Myers' other approved immunotherapy, Yervoy. The data is expected by early 2018. ""That study will provide the definitive answer of the role of combination immunotherapy in the front-line lung cancer setting,"" he said.Data in June from a large clinical study showed Keytruda was effective in newly treated patients, not only in delaying progression of lung cancer symptoms but also in prolonging survival. The trial was stopped so that all patients could receive Keytruda.The data spurred hopes that U.S. regulators would soon expand approved use of the Merck drug. Complete data for the study has not yet been released.  Now that Bristol-Myers' drug has failed in that effort, Merck's medicine could have a better chance to catch up with Opdivo's far larger sales. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Opdivo, Keytruda and similar drugs in development had been expected to capture peak annual combined sales of $10 billion to $15 billion from lung cancer, with Bristol-Myers winning the lion's share.""Today's news very much helps level the playing field and is a major boost for Merck,"" Anderson said in a research note.Opdivo and Keytruda are also approved to treat advanced melanoma and are being studied against a wide range of other types of cancer.

531,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shares hit a record high on Friday, breaching for the first time the 55 pounds a share level offered by Pfizer (PFE.N) in 2014 during the U.S. group's abortive $100 billion attempt to buy the drugmaker.The British firm's stock has been on a roll recently, helped by a falling pound and speculation that Switzerland's Novartis (NOVN.S) might be next to launch a bid. However, the shares were lifted to a high of 55.05 pounds by the misfortunes of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N).The failure of Bristol's immunotherapy drug Opdivo to slow disease progression in previously untreated patients with lung cancer as hoped was seen by investors as good news for rivals Merck & Co (MRK.N) and AstraZeneca. Analysts at Leerink, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank said the negative result with Opdivo increased the potential market opportunity for AstraZeneca's keenly watched combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab.Crucial clinical trial results with durvalumab, both on its own and in combination with tremelimumab, are due next year. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes AstraZeneca can become a major player in cancer drugs that bolster the immune system. And its ability to carve out billions of dollars in potential sales hinges not only on the effectiveness of its own products but on the competitive profile of rivals. Cancer is currently the hottest area of research across the drugs industry and some analysts believe this could make AstraZeneca a takeover target once again, with speculation turning last week to Novartis as a bidder.

The smaller animal health unit could also slightly increase margins, Bayer said.In consumer health, previously boosted by the acquisition of brands from Merck & Co (MRK.N), it now sees sales adjusted for currency swings growing by between 4 and 5 percent by the end of 2018 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 25 percent, up from 24 percent in 2015.Bayer has ""underestimated the country risk from Emerging Markets volatility"", the company said in presentation slides. It also cited ""stronger business disruption than anticipated during the integration of Merck Consumer Care and Dihon in China"", referring to a Chinese non-prescription drugs unit it acquired in 2014.""2018 EBITDA guidance for Pharma and Animal Health may ... offer some upside against consensus, though the consumer margin guidance may disappoint slightly,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors.

The trials will evaluate the potential for the combination to improve on the current standard-of-care to treat melanoma and cancers of the kidney, colorectal system, bladder and the most common form of lung cancer.Opdivo is already approved to treat advanced melanoma and lung cancer, and is being studied for other cancers.

551,"   By Ben Hirschler | COPENHAGEN  COPENHAGEN Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy.As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker.And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone.Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment.""Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment,"" Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented.An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become ""a new standard of care"".   The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected.Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1.Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy.Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard ""from today"". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO.COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study. Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low.In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent.Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response.Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old.Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumors. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market.Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen.The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO.These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for ""all comers"" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

554,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot  New data is likely to prompt doctors to abandon Bristol-Myers Squibb's immunotherapy Opdivo in favor of Merck & Co's rival Keytruda in a large segment of the lucrative lung cancer market, analysts said on Monday.    The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol's shares plunging 10 percent.    The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study. Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them.Opdivo had been considered the leader among the new class of medicines. It generated $840 million of sales in the second quarter, more than double those of Keytruda.The view of the rival drugs began to change in August, with the surprise announcement by Bristol-Myers that Opdivo had failed to best older chemotherapies in the Phase III trial.Details of the trial unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen only heightened those   concerns. Patients on Opdivo went 4.2 months before their disease worsened versus 5.9 months for those on chemo, although the difference was not deemed statistically significant.""This data represented a worst-case scenario for Opdivo,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.  The Opdivo trial enrolled patients regardless of their tumor's level of PD-L1 expression, a protein targeted by the drug whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from treatment with the new medicines.Meanwhile, researchers reported that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression in previously untreated patients, and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy.Patients in the Merck trial were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1, a narrower segment of the lung cancer population than those in the Bristol-Myers study. ""Merck will completely 'own' the segment of first-line lung cancer patients who have high PD-L1 expression levels, and Bristol Myers will capture nothing really,"" Anderson said.Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, but analysts said they expect current off-label prescribing of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer to dry up now.In addition, competition in second-line lung cancer is soon expected to intensify with the anticipated approval of Roche's immunotherapy Tecentriq, which is now approved to treat bladder cancer. Both Keytruda and Tecentriq are given every three weeks, while Opdivo is administered every two weeks, which is seen as a convenience disadvantage.   ""The nearly inexplicable failure of (Opdivo) at every level of PD-L1 expression ... puts Merck in the driver's seat in first-line lung cancer for at least the next 12-18 months,"" said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez.Calling the Keytruda data ""stunning,” Fernandez said, ""We fully expect Merck to retain a significant place at the table long term.""   Bristol shares, which had already lost one quarter of their value since the initial trial data was disclosed in August, fell 10 percent $49.85, while Merck shares were up 1.7 percent at $63.84 after earlier rising more than 3 percent to a near 15-year high.Opdivo is also approved for advanced melanoma, kidney cancer and a type of Hodgkin lymphoma, while Keytruda is also approved for advanced melanoma, plus head and neck cancer.

563,"   By John Miller | ZURICH  ZURICH Roche said on Thursday strong sales of new medicines like cancer immunotherapy drug Tecentriq would help to sustain the company's growth as patents on older drugs start to expire.Chief Executive Severin Schwan is betting he can stay ahead of the sales erosion with new medicines that include five launched in 2016 alone.""That is an unprecedented number of launches of new medicines in a short period of time,"" Schwan said on a conference call after Roche reported third-quarter sales figures. ""Our product pipeline is developing very well.""The Swiss drugmaker's three established cancer blockbusters Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, which account for annual sales of nearly 20 billion Swiss francs ($21 billion), all face biosimilar competition by the end of the decade.But so far this year, Tecentriq has won approval for bladder and lung cancer, Alecensa for lung cancer, Cotellic for skin cancer and Venclaxta for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Roche's multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus is slated for U.S. approval before the year is over. Tecentriq has brought in 77 million Swiss francs ($78 million) since its U.S. approval in May for bladder cancer. That revenue is due to accelerate after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week gave the a green light for the drug to be used against lung cancer. Analysts are counting on it, too, as revenue growth from broad-based cancer drug Avastin, Rituxan for blood cancer, and breast cancer therapy Herceptin begins to slow.All three missed analyst expectations in the third quarter, and Avastin in particular, which fell 3 percent in the third quarter, led by a decline in the United States.  Overall, quarterly sales at the world's biggest maker of cancer drugs rose 3 percent to 12.48 billion francs, missing the average estimate of 12.68 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.""The momentum seems weakening in the haematology and breast cancer franchises in the U.S. and Japanese territories,"" Bruno Bulic, an analyst at Baader Helvea, said. ""We see the entry of Tecentriq coming timely."" He has a ""buy"" recommendation on Roche's shares.They fell 0.2 percent by 0930 GMT, in line with the decline of the European health care sector index. Schwan still expected Roche's 2016 sales to grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate at constant exchange rates, with core earnings rising faster than sales. The company also confirmed its full-year outlook.He declined to comment on Novartis's efforts to sell its $14 billion stake in Roche, saying any disposal was a matter for his cross-town rival to resolve. Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez has said he may sell the stake without demanding a premium.($1 = 0.9889 Swiss francs) (Editing by Michael Shields and Jane Merriman)",2016-10-20,MRK,"Thu Oct 20, 2016 | 10:53am EDT",UPDATE 2-Roche bets on new cancer drugs to offset patent expiries,http://www.reuters.com//article/roche-results-idUSL8N1CQ0PV?type=companyNews

569,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON GlaxoSmithKline has filed its shingles vaccine Shingrix for U.S. regulatory approval, the drugmaker said on Monday, bringing the potential $1 billion-a-year seller a step closer to market.Shingrix is viewed by analysts as among the British company's most promising experimental products, since it has shown greater protection among older recipients than Merck & Co's rival shot Zostavax.GSK itself highlighted Shingrix as one of its top near-term pipeline hopes last November, during its first research and development day in more than a decade.The company, which will see Emma Walmsley take over as chief executive in 2017, is seeking to revitalise a drug portfolio hit by falling sales of best-selling inhaled lung treatment Advair.In clinical trials, GSK's vaccine remained 90 percent effective in people over age 70, even four years after injections. Zostavax efficacy, by contrast, varies between 18 and 70 percent, and it declines noticeably in older people. People who are 70 years or older are often most at risk from shingles, a painful, itchy rash that results from the reactivation of latent chickenpox virus.The impressive trial results should put Shingrix in a strong competitive position, analysts believe, even though it requires two doses, against just one for Zostavax, and it is also linked to more injection site reactions. Analysts, on average, predict that worldwide sales of Shingrix will reach 856 million pounds ($1.05 billion) in 2021, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.Sales of Zostavax, the only shingles vaccine on the market at present, totalled $749 million in 2015.GSK's vaccine contains a component from U.S. biotech firm Agenus, which is entitled to royalties on future sales.  GSK said it planned to file Shingrix for European and Canadian approval before the end of this year, with Japan following in 2017.($1 = 0.8191 pounds) (Editing by Susan Fenton and Jason Neely)",2016-10-24,MRK,"Mon Oct 24, 2016 | 3:16am EDT",UPDATE 1-GSK files potential $1 bln shingles vaccine for U.S. approval,http://www.reuters.com//article/gsk-shingles-idUSL8N1CU0T7?type=companyNews

573,"  Oct 25 - Merck & Co Inc reported a 19.6 percent rise in quarterly net profit, driven primarily by higher demand for its new cancer drug Keytruda.Net income attributable rose to $2.18 billion, or 78 cents per share, for the third quarter from $1.83 billion, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $10.54 billion from $10.07 billion. Merck is betting on Keytruda to boost earnings as demand wanes for its diabetes franchise, Januvia and a related combination medicine called Janumet, and Remicade arthritis drug. The company said on Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Keytruda for use in certain previously untreated lung cancer patients, making it the only approved first-line treatment.

575,"  Oct 24 Merck & Co Inc on Monday said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its immunotherapy Keytruda for use in certain previously untreated lung cancer patients, making it the only approved first-line treatment.The drug has been approved for treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with high-levels of a protein known for suppressing the immune system called PD-L1.Keytruda works by taking the brakes off the immune system by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1. The drug has already been approved for patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy for advanced non-small lung cancer. Monday's announcement gives Merck the only approved first-line treatment for lung cancer, one of the biggest markets for cancer drugs. Rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's drug Opdivo failed a late-stage trial for the same indication. The approval was based on data from a late-stage study which showed Keytruda achieved superior progression-free and overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of the protein, Merck said. Doctors are currently allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses but FDA's approval of Keytruda could greatly increase the number of patients taking the drug.Shares of Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker fell 0.7 percent in aftermarket trade. Up to Monday's close, the stock had gained more than 15 percent of its value year to date.

577,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 27 (Fitch) (This is a correction of a release issued Oct. 27,  2016. It clarifies that Merck's existing ratings were not affirmed as was stated  in the original release.)  Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to Merck & Co., Inc.'s (MRK/Merck) euro  notes offering. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this press  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The company's 'A' rating reflects the following: --Recently introduced therapies, an advancing pipeline and manageable patent  expiries should support intermediate- to long-term growth.  --Fitch believes that Merck will pursue targeted acquisitions as opposed to  large transformative ones. An improving pipeline and narrowing strategic focus  reduces the need to do big deals.  --Fitch expects Merck will continue favor share repurchases to deleveraging,  with the possibility of further debt-funded stock buybacks. --Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate solid FCF during the forecast period  supported by improving margins and moderate revenue growth. New Products/ Growth Opportunities: Products approved during the last three  years should help to drive intermediate- to long-term, top-line growth for  Merck. Most importantly, Keytruda (skin and lung cancer) is gaining traction in  the market, supported by an ongoing stream of clinical data, but facing  competition from a Bristol-Myers product and potentially similar drugs that may  receive approval during the next few years. Merck is also evaluating Keytruda's  safety and efficacy in other cancers and in combination with other oncolytics.  Bridion (post-surgical recovery), Belsomra (insomnia), Grastek (allergies) and  Rawitek (allergies) are unique-acting therapies, which should provide these two  drugs competitive positions. Zontivitiy (cardiovascular) and Zepatier (hepatitis  C) have entered increasingly crowded segments but should be able to gain some  share from both newer and older treatments. Expanding Late-Stage Pipeline: Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its  late-stage pipeline with new molecular entities (NMEs) to treat cancers,  bacterial and viral infections, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, central  nervous afflictions, osteoporosis, and other diseases. While the majority of  these projects are internally developed, Merck has partnered with other  innovator firms to take advantage of technological advancements that were  discovered externally. The landscape for drug development is expanding,  particularly as developers learn more about how genetics influence the  development, prevention and treatment of disease. As such, Fitch believes that  it is responsible and strategically advantageous for firms to look externally as  well as internally regarding new drug development. Patent Exposure Manageable: The company has and will continue to face some  significant patent expiries during the next year, but Fitch views the risk as  manageable with roughly 18% of total firm sales are at risk. In addition,  Remicade, which accounts for about 4.2% of total firm sales, is a biologic that  has experienced less rapid sales losses to generic competition compared to  traditional small-molecule pharmaceuticals. Vytorin and Zetia, however, are  small molecules and account for roughly 10% of total revenues. Fitch expects  these two products will lose significant sales shortly after their patents  expire, as is typically the case for small-molecule drugs. Solid Free Cash Flow Expected: Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $5.7  billion - $5.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) during 2016. Improving margins  driven by an improving sales mix and strong cost control should more than offset  expected soft near-term, top-line growth. Fitch expects FCF to incrementally  increase during the multi-year forecast period. Targeted Acquisition Most Likely: Fitch looks for Merck to pursue mainly  targeted acquisitions in the intermediate term. The company has improved its  operational and financial prospects through successfully gaining regulatory  approvals on late-stage pipeline projects and has continued to back fill its  pipeline with new and advancing projects. An improved growth and profitability  profile decreases the need for the company to execute large strategic business  combinations. Share Repurchases to Continue: Fitch assumes continued shareholder friendly  actions during the near term, some of which the company may fund with debt.  Merck has occasionally funded its share repurchases with debt. During 2015, the  company purchased a net $3.7 billion of its common stock, compared to $6.1  billion during the prior LTM period. The repurchases were executed under a $15  billion program authorized in May 2013 as well as an additional $10 billion  authorized in March 2015. As of June 30, 2016, the 2013 allotment was fully  utilized, with $6.9 billion remaining on the $10 billion extension. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Merck's 'A' rating include  the following: --Incrementally increasing revenue during the forecast period, driven by newer  products, largely offset in the near term by foreign exchange headwinds and  select product patent expirations.  --EBITDA operating margin improvement driven by a focus on costs and an  improving sales mix.  --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of roughly $5.9 billion during 2016. --Targeted acquisitions prioritized over strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued significant share repurchases. --Leverage to range between 1.7x - 1.9x during the next two years. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Improving operations including new product development that support long-term  positive revenue growth and margin stability/increases; --An operational profile that would consistently generate significantly positive  FCF; --Cash deployment strategy that maintains gross debt leverage below 1.7x,  including managing through operational stress such as patent expiries. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF, possibly driven by  patent expiries not being offset by new product development; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Persistent leverage above 2.2x. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch looks for Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through  strong FCF generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM  ending June 30, 2016 was $4.7 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had  approximately $11.8 billion in cash/short-term investments (U.S.: 10% - 20% of  total balances/OUS: 80% - 90% of total balances) and full availability on its $6  billion revolver, maturing in August 2019.  Manageable Debt Maturities: As of June 30, 2016, the company had $24.1 billion  in debt outstanding, with $234 million maturing in 2016, $317 million in 2017,  $3 billion in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2019. Fitch expects near- to mid-term  maturities will be satisfied primarily through refinancing in the public debt  markets.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Merck's 'A' rating include  the following: --Incrementally increasing revenue during the forecast period, driven by newer  products, largely offset in the near term by foreign exchange headwinds and  select product patent expirations.  --EBITDA operating margin improvement driven by a focus on costs and an  improving sales mix.  --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of roughly $5.9 billion during 2016. --Targeted acquisitions prioritized over strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued significant share repurchases. --Leverage to range between 1.7x - 1.9x during the next two years. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Improving operations including new product development that support long-term  positive revenue growth and margin stability/increases; --An operational profile that would consistently generate significantly positive  FCF; --Cash deployment strategy that maintains gross debt leverage below 1.7x,  including managing through operational stress such as patent expiries. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF, possibly driven by  patent expiries not being offset by new product development; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Persistent leverage above 2.2x. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch looks for Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through  strong FCF generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM  ending June 30, 2016 was $4.7 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had  approximately $11.8 billion in cash/short-term investments (U.S.: 10% - 20% of  total balances/OUS: 80% - 90% of total balances) and full availability on its $6  billion revolver, maturing in August 2019.  Manageable Debt Maturities: As of June 30, 2016, the company had $24.1 billion  in debt outstanding, with $234 million maturing in 2016, $317 million in 2017,  $3 billion in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2019. Fitch expects near- to mid-term  maturities will be satisfied primarily through refinancing in the public debt  markets. FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Merck & Co., Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured credit facility at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

579,"   By Deena Beasley  Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs.The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs.U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges by the end of the year in their subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. (bloom.bg/2e6cZjF)A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.In their latest letter to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Sanders, an independent, and Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin, and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem.They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago.Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an emailed statement that ""Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently.""Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices ""independently"" and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes.Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. ""The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive,"" the pharmaceutical company said.Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan's generics business, fell 9.5 percent.""We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion,"" A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note.   Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis.A spokesman from Teva said the company ""is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas.""Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015.In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases.Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals' decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection.Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year. Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year.The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

587,"  LONDON Britain's healthcare cost-effectiveness watchdog NICE has recommended use of Merck's immunotherapy drug Keytruda in certain lung cancer patients, after the U.S. drugmaker cut the price further for the state-run health service.Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective treatment in melanoma but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) had initially blocked its use in lung cancer.""If companies work with us to price drugs reasonably and manage any uncertainties in the evidence base, we can continue to recommend patients have routine access to the treatments they need,"" Carole Longson, director of the NICE centre for health technology evaluation, said in a statement on Friday. Keytruda has proved highly effective in fighting non-small cell lung cancer in patients with high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. The average cost of a course of treatment in Britain is around 29,000 pounds ($36,500) at the full list price but the National Health Service will pay less after getting a confidential discount.
