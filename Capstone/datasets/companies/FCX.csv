0,"  * Freeport, Newmont may emerge unscathed from Jan. 12 export ban* Worsening economic climate forces government's hand* Policymakers wary of job losses, civil unrest ahead of electionsBy Michael Taylor and Kanupriya KapoorJAKARTA, Jan 10 Indonesia's mineral ore export ban, an ambitious policy aimed at getting more money for its resources, will hit domestic miners who have already begun shedding jobs and leave foreign firms unscathed.The mineral ban is an attempt to transform Southeast Asia's biggest economy from being simply a supplier of raw materials into a producer of finished goods, boosting government coffers.The new rules, one of the biggest policy moves by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in nearly a decade in office, force firms to commit to invest millions on processing minerals if they want to ship their goods out.""The problem with this policy is that the smaller miners have no capacity or money to invest in smelters,"" said Sofjan Wanandi, head of the Indonesian Employers Association (APINDO).""We gave input to the government that those that haven't been able to give that (smelter) guarantee will have a hard time if there is a total ban but ... we can't protect the small miners for too long.""The damage is already being felt. Almost 30,000 mine workers have been laid off as more than 100 junior miners halt operations, according to the Indonesian Mineral Entrepreneurs Association. The government has been scrambling in recent months to water down the law, initially introduced in 2009, on fears it will widen a large current account deficit and add to the falling  rupiah's woes. Some miners, betting on a backdown on the policy, have done little to boost their infrastructure ahead of the ban, raising the spectre of a big decline in export revenues.Indonesia is the world's top exporter of nickel ore, refined tin and thermal coal, and a major producer of copper, iron ore and bauxite. Its mineral wealth accounts for about 5 percent of total exports. Mining contributes around 12 percent to its GDP.Yudhoyono's administration has backed several policies aimed at generating greater profits and creating more jobs from natural resources with some success in tin, cocoa and palm oil.After weeks of wrangling between officials, legislators and mining companies, last-minute government proposals will allow U.S. giants Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining Corp to continue shipping copper concentrate.Nickel ore and bauxite remain banned, hurting shipments from smaller miners like state-owned PT Aneka Tambang, unlisted PT Harita Prima Abadi Mineral and Singapore's Ibris Nickel Pte Ltd. The government argues that copper undergoes at least some processing into copper concentrate before it is exported, while nickel and bauxite ores are completely unprocessed, shipped out as earth dug up and dumped into barges.But it is these smaller, low-cost operations that are locally run and employ thousands of workers.The planned revised ban will cut government revenue by as much as $820 million this year, the finance minister said on Friday.Mining industry figures in Indonesia have long criticised the time given to develop downstream industries and build smelters, citing the lack of power and infrastructure in remote areas where mines are often located.Ample global smelting capacity, coupled with weak metal prices, have also been given as reasons why new smelters would not be economically viable. ""NATIONALIST FERVOUR"" For the government to force miners to stop work would also  result in large job losses - both at mines and their supporting industries - stoking political and civil tensions in some of the more volatile provinces.""This policy will result in mass layoffs for workers in the mining sector,"" said Subiyanto, general secretary for All-Indonesia Workers Union, speaking at a 1,000-strong protest outside the mines ministry on Thursday. ""We asked that it be revised.""We agree in principle but ... the government has done nothing to prepare the infrastructure (for smelters) since the law was proposed.""Seen as an example of a creeping resource nationalism in Indonesia, the government's last-minute scrambling highlights a perceived dithering by Yudhoyono, who will step down after elections later this year.Parliamentarians blocked an attempt by the government in December to amend the law, prompting the president to pursue the last-minute regulation. Lawmakers argued that, in the long run, the completion of new smelter projects would create jobs.""Everybody is expecting that nationalistic fervour will reach a fever pitch with the elections so nobody will pull back on this until the elections are over - if ever,"" said Hans Lukiman, a commissioner at privately-held Indonesian nickel, iron ore and coal miner Ascend.",2014-01-10,FCX,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 4:36am EST",Indonesia's export ban bullet to miss foreign miners as local players hit,http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-mining-ban-idUSL3N0KI2LZ20140110?type=companyNews
1,"   By Kanupriya Kapoor and Yayat Supriatna | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Jan 12 Indonesia banned all mineral ore exports, as expected, on Sunday, but will likely allow U.S. mining giants Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold and Newmont Mining Corp to continue to ship billions of dollars worth of copper overseas.The Southeast Asian nation is the world's biggest exporter of nickel ore, refined tin and thermal coal and home to the fifth largest copper mine and top gold mine.The ban aims to boost Indonesia's long-term return from its mineral wealth by forcing miners to process their ores domestically. But officials fear a short-term cut in foreign revenue could widen the current account deficit, which has undermined investor confidence and battered the rupiah.""Starting at midnight on Jan. 12, 2014, raw ore definitely cannot be exported,"" Energy and Mines Minister Jero Wacik told reporters shortly after a marathon meeting with the president and cabinet ministers.However, in one of his biggest economic policy decisions since taking office nearly 10 years ago, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono passed a last-minute regulation that will likely ease the ban's impact for major mining companies like Freeport and Newmont. Details of the regulations were to be released later.""Not only Freeport and Newmont, but we have 66 companies that have said they will build smelters ... these (firms) will get a chance to export processed minerals,"" Wacik said.""The energy ministry will later give more details on the levels of concentrate allowed.""Most of the companies expected to feel the impact of the ban are small domestic miners, numbering in the the hundreds, that cannot afford to invest the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to build a smelter.Mineral shipments totalled $10.4 billion in 2012, or around 5 percent of Indonesia's total exports, according to the World Bank. HALTING SHIPMENTS The uncertainty over the ban has forced Indonesia's top copper producer, Freeport, to halt exports until the government provides clarity on which minerals can be shipped, a union official told Reuters.""There will be no concentrate exports from Freeport Indonesia in Papua as long as there is no government policy providing certainty on concentrate exports,"" said union official Virgo Solossa, adding that the firm has not made a shipment from its port since Dec. 15.Company spokeswoman Daisy Primayanti said Freeport continued to provide copper to its local smelter for use domestically. Freeport, the country's dominant copper produce with 73 percent market share, last month warned an unrevised ban would cut output at its Grasberg mine by 60 percent and lead to layoffs of half of its 15,000 Indonesian employees.Under the proposed regulation that was being reviewed by the president in the run-up to the deadline, Freeport, Newmont Mining Corp and other miners would still be allowed to export copper, manganese, lead, zinc and iron ore concentrate until 2017.But nickel ore and bauxite exports worth more than $2 billion annually would still be banned, while coal and tin shipments would not be affected.However, it was not clear whether the final regulation had been revised. ""In our discussion (about the ban), our considerations were first about the workforce, which shouldn't face mass layoffs,"" Energy and Mines Minister Wacik said.""Second was about the local economy, so it doesn't face any burden from the new regulations. Then, domestic companies should be allowed to continue operating.""More than 100 mining companies have been forced to reduce or shutdown operations due to the uncertainty surrounding the mineral export ban.Along with Freeport, Indonesian miner Perusahaan Perseroan Aneka Tambang (Antam) also stopped nickel ore exports a few days ago, the firm's corporate secretary Tri Hartono said.A major economic impact could make the ban a hot political issue in this year's legislative and presidential elections, especially if it sparks a wave of layoffs in the world's fourth most populous country.Thousands of mine workers have already been laid off ahead of the ban, sparking protests in Jakarta.""We call on all mining workers to prepare to go on the streets and swarm the presidential palace if the government goes ahead with the implementation of the ban,"" said Juan Forti Silalahi of the National Mine Workers Union in a statement earlier on Saturday.Police have been stationed at ports and around mines to secure those places in case of public disturbances, said national police spokesman, Boy Rafli Amar.",2014-01-11,FCX,"Sat Jan 11, 2014 | 1:29pm EST","Indonesia bans mineral ore exports, but may allow Freeport shipments",http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-minerals-idUSL3N0KL06L20140111?type=companyNews

4,"  * Freeport will minimise operational costs with layoffs - union* Freeport seeking clarification on new export rules from government* Antam under review for possible downgrade by Moody's and S&PBy Michael Taylor and Yayat SupriatnaJAKARTA, Jan 14 U.S. miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold will be forced to lay off workers from the world's fifth-biggest copper mine in Indonesia to offset an unexpected increase in export taxes, a union official said on Tuesday.President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono rushed through a last-minute regulation on Saturday giving copper miners Freeport and Newmont Mining Corp a reprieve from a controversial mineral export ban, but imposed an escalating tax to limit the amount of mineral concentrate exports over the next few years. Freeport has halted copper concentrate exports from its port in Papua and is seeking more clarity on the new policy. It also needs a new export permit to resume shipments.Under the regulation, the tax for copper concentrate exports has been raised to 25 percent from 20 percent, and will gradually go up to a maximum 60 percent by the end of 2016. ""With the export tax at 25 percent, layoffs are inevitable,"" Papua-based Freeport union official Virgo Solossa told Reuters on Tuesday. ""Freeport Indonesia will certainly minimise operation costs with lay offs. We still don't know how many workers will be laid off by Freeport.""When asked to confirm the possible layoffs, Freeport Indonesia CEO Rozik Soetjipto told Reuters that ""so far we have no such plan"". The company employs about 24,000 workers, including contractors and staff, in Indonesia.The country's second-largest copper producer, Newmont, was continuing to run mining operations at its Batu Hijau mine as usual, while the firm waited for official notification from the government, a spokesman said on Sunday. Newmont did not comment on its copper exports. Indonesia introduced the controversial ban on Sunday on a range of raw mineral ores in order to force companies to build processing plants on its soil.The higher export taxes diminished the president's last-minute relief to the major miners.Although the government has yet to publish all the regulations clarifying the export rule changes, mining and finance ministry officials said concentrate with a minimum of 15 percent copper content will be allowed to be exported despite the ban. The Freeport website says that concentrates produced in Indonesia ""generally contain 27-30 percent copper"".Rating agencies Moody's and S&P said state-controlled nickel miner PT Aneka Tambang (Antam) was under review for a possible downgrade due to the ban. The export halt is expected to cost Antam an estimated $300 million in revenue this year, as unprocessed nickel ore shipments represent around 30 percent of its revenue.",2014-01-14,FCX,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 5:33am EST","Freeport Indonesia union says layoffs ""inevitable"" due to export tax",http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-minerals-freeport-idUSL3N0KO2H820140114?type=companyNews

Freeport declined to comment, but a company spokeswoman said before the ban took effect on Sunday that legal action was seen as a last resort.The new rules hike to 25 percent a tax for copper concentrate exports, from 20 percent, and levy the tax on Freeport and Newmont for the first time. The tax will rise to 60 percent by the end of 2016, before exports of concentrate are banned from 2017.As a result, Freeport could pay around $5 billion more in taxes over the next three years, according to Reuters calculations based on the company's production forecasts and assuming copper prices of $3.50 a pound, and estimates by two industry sources.CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS  Indonesia's tough new policies aim to force miners to process mineral ores in the country, as part of plans to transform Southeast Asia's biggest economy into a producer of finished goods, from being simply a supplier of raw materials.That would increase its foreign revenue and narrow the current account deficit, which has undermined investor confidence and battered the rupiah currency.Under their current contracts, Freeport and Newmont are exempt from paying export taxes or any other government charges not included in their agreements. The two firms pay corporate income taxes of 35 percent plus royalties and other fees.""The proposed export tax would be a brand new tax - on top of all the others we are obligated to pay - not accounted for in the contract of work we signed with the government,"" said Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara.""The contract explicitly sets the types and levels of taxes and rate we are required to pay, thereby contractually assuring predictability and stability.""

7,"  By Allison Martell and Nicole MordantJan 22 Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc  said on Wednesday it would ""defend its rights"" in Indonesia against a new export tax but was confident of resolving its dispute with the government without going to international arbitration.Freeport, the world's biggest publicly traded copper company, said the new regulations conflicted with a contract it signed with the government of Indonesia in 1991, which stated it would not be subject to any new taxes, duties or fees.The company said that due to delays in getting government approval for 2014 exports it would defer production of some 40 million pounds of copper and 80,000 ounces of gold per month until the issue was resolved.It made no mention of declaring force majeure to free itself from obligations to deliver concentrate from its massive Grasberg mine in Indonesia, although it did say it was in ""active communications"" with customers.Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said he did not want to speculate on next steps because he is confident Freeport will reach an agreement with the government.""We have a strong desire not to go to international arbitration,"" he said. ""The much more attractive course of action would be ... to find a mutually agreeable resolution to it with the government.""Adkerson was speaking on a call with analysts and investors to discuss Freeport's fourth-quarter results. Earnings at the U.S.-based miner, which also has large oil and gas operations, fell from a year ago on weaker metals prices.Freeport's Grasberg gold and copper complex, located in Indonesia's Papua province, is one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits. In 2012, Freeport's Indonesian operations contributed 23 percent of its group pre-tax income. SEEKING CLARITY Morningstar analyst Daniel Rohr said that over the years Freeport, which has been active in Indonesia since the 1970s, had always managed to resolve disputes there more or less amicably.""Each side gives a little bit. I expect that's going to be the case here,"" Rohr said.The Indonesian government on Jan. 11 gave Freeport and fellow miner Newmont Mining Corp a reprieve from a controversial mineral ore export ban, but then surprised the U.S.-based majors by imposing an export tax. Freeport had previously paid no export duties on concentrate shipments. As a result of the new tax, Freeport could pay around $5 billion more in taxes over the next three years, according to Reuters calculations.Indonesia's new policies are meant to force miners to process more material in country and narrow a current account deficit that has battered Indonesia's currency.Under their current contracts, Freeport and Newmont pay corporate income taxes of 35 percent plus royalties and other fees.The new export tax, starting off at 25 percent, is set to rise to 60 percent by the end of 2016 before exports of concentrate are banned from 2017.Under a joint venture agreement, Rio Tinto   gets a 40 percent share of the output from Grasberg above certain levels until 2021, and 40 percent of all production after 2021. PRICE SLIDE HURTS Shares in Freeport fell 2.6 percent to $34.34 on Wednesday afternoon, alongside other major mining companies.Earlier, the company reported a drop in fourth-quarter earnings following a decline in copper and gold prices. Net income fell to $707 million, or 68 cents a share, from $743 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding unrealized losses on oil and gas derivatives and other charges in the fourth quarter, earnings would have been 90 cents a share.RBC Dominion Securities analyst Fraser Phillips said in a note to clients the adjusted earnings topped his expectations, partly because of better-than-expected mining costs, and sales of gold, oil and gas.""Results were pretty good. Production figures were in line with what they said. Costs, particularly on the mining side, were pretty great,"" Rohr said.Freeport said it expects to sell about 4.4 billion pounds of copper, 1.7 million ounces of gold and 60.7 million barrels of oil equivalents in 2014. The forecasts assume Indonesian operations running at normal levels.Revenue rose to $5.89 billion from $4.51 billion, boosted by the company's recent oil and gas acquisitions.",2014-01-22,FCX,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 2:53pm EST",UPDATE 3-Freeport confident of resolving Indonesia export impasse,http://www.reuters.com//article/freeport-results-idUSL2N0KW0L020140122?type=companyNews

10,"  * Indosmelt says smelter margins are very small, calls for govt help* Says its copper smelter due to start construction next month* Indosmelt has conditional purchase agreements with Freeport, NewmontBy Michael Taylor and Wilda AsmariniJAKARTA, Feb 4 Indonesia's government must provide tax holidays and other financial incentives to convince companies to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to build copper smelters amid weak global prices, said the head of smelting firm PT Indosmelt.President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono last month imposed new mining policies, including a controversial mineral ore export ban and progressive export taxes, aimed at forcing miners to build smelters and process their raw materials in Indonesia. The policies have forced U.S. miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining Corp, which together produce 97 percent of Indonesia's copper, to halt all exports. The two firms have yet to commit to building smelters, saying it was not economically viable to make such large investments.""The margins for smelters are small, very small,"" Natsir Mansyur, president director of privately owned and unlisted PT Indosmelt told Reuters. ""There must be incentives from the government. To build (a smelter), this business should be protected by the government.""In mid-2012, government officials said they planned to offer financial incentives to help firms build smelters to comply with the new mining regulations, although the details have yet to be announced and talks are still ongoing. Indosmelt is planning to start next month construction of a 700,000-tonnes capacity copper smelter, with production due to start in 2017 or 2018. Mansyur did not say whether PT Indosmelt was receiving any government incentives.A consortium of local and foreign banks would finance 70 percent of the $1.5 billion needed for PT Indosmelt's South Sulawesi copper smelter, said Mansyur, who is also an official at the influential Indonesia Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Copper smelters process copper concentrates to make blister or anode, which is then refined into cathode. Besides PT Indosmelt, other firms due to start construction of copper smelters include PT Nusantara Smelting and PT Global Investindo.Southeast Asia's largest economy currently has only one copper smelter, PT Smelting in Gresik, East Java, and receives its concentrate supplies from both Freeport and Newmont.Indosmelt has reached ""conditional sale and purchase agreements"" to also receive copper concentrate supplies from the U.S.-based miners, the miners' representatives said.To make a copper smelter economically viable in Indonesia, benchmark copper prices must trade above $6,000 a tonne, said Mansyur. ""With current LME copper price at about $6,000-$7,000, we can get a profit,"" he said. ""At least a minimum price of $6,200 to break even.""Goldman Sachs last month forecast global copper prices would rebound from a four-year slump by 2016 and average around $7,500 a tonne in 2017, a year before Indosmelt's project begins operation. The three-month copper price on the London Metal Exchange traded at around $7,030 a tonne on Tuesday.

11,"   By Michael Taylor and Wilda Asmarini | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Indonesian policies to force miners to process raw materials at home are misfiring, as disputes over the new rules disrupt plans to invest nearly $4 billion in copper smelters to cater for miners such as Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold.President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono imposed a controversial mining law on January 12, but the rules have left the mining sector in turmoil. As well as a ban on unprocessed ore shipments, a last-minute export tax on concentrates was also brought in.The tax ratchets up sharply before an outright export ban from 2017 and Freeport and Newmont Mining Corp, which produce 97 percent of Indonesia's copper, have halted all exports and are locked in talks with the government because they say the tax breaches their contracts.This has deepened uncertainty on plans to construct three copper smelters, since the firms building them say they need firm supply guarantees from Freeport and Newmont to put in place financing so they can proceed. Miners may have to slash output if there is not enough refining capacity once the export ban takes effect in 2017.The impasse shows how a policy aimed at supporting higher value economic activity has not only stopped mineral exports but risks undermining the type of investment it was supposed to promote.""There is going to be another train wreck because there isn't enough time to get approvals and build smelters before the new 2017 deadline,"" said Julian Hill, a Jakarta-based mining advisor at Deloitte Konsultan Indonesia. ""The mining ministry is beginning to realize that they have created one hell of a mess and are looking for ways out of it.""Before the ban, Indonesia was the world's biggest exporter of nickel ore. It is also a major supplier of refined tin, thermal coal and copper.If no new smelters are built by 2017, Freeport and Newmont face curbs on their operations since Indonesia's lone copper smelter, PT Smelting, only has a concentrate capacity of about 660,000 tonnes.

12,"  * Export tax could be eliminated for firms building smelters* The move is a potential victory for Freeport, Newmont* Minister: Freeport to resume copper exports in near futureBy Wilda Asmarini and Yayat SupriatnaJAKARTA, Feb 24 Indonesia will ease a controversial tax on mineral concentrate exports for firms that build smelters in the country, in the first rollback of new rules that have caused its mining industry to grind to a halt.The move is a potential victory for U.S. mining giants Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining Corp . A senior government official said Freeport would resume exports of copper concentrate in the ""near future"".Around $500 million a month in ore and concentrate exports have stopped since President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in January imposed mining rules, which included the progressive tax and a mineral ore export ban, to force companies to build smelters and process raw materials in Indonesia.""The export tax can be changed. For those who have seriously committed to building smelters, we will ease it,"" said Sukhyar, director general of coal and minerals for the mines ministry.""The export tax can be lowered or maybe eliminated to zero percent."" By contrast, Indonesian government officials have said over the last few weeks that Jakarta would not back down from the export tax or any of the mining regulations passed last month.Before the ban, Indonesia was the world's biggest exporter of nickel ore. It is also a major supplier of refined tin, thermal coal and copper.Freeport and Newmont have refused to pay the progressive export tax, which rises from 25 percent this year to up to 60 percent by the second half of 2016, saying it breaches their contracts.High-level executives from the two companies, which together produce virtually all of Indonesia's copper, have been involved in talks with the government for weeks over the tax and the building of smelters. BREAKTHROUGH The first major breakthrough seemed to have been reached on Monday in a meeting between Freeport Indonesia Chief Executive Rozik Sutjipto and Industry Minister M.S. Hidayat in Jakarta.Hidayat said Freeport was seeking permission to resume concentrate exports while it works to build a smelter within three years.""Freeport, in principle, understands the regulation and will obey it,"" Hidayat told reporters after the meeting. ""Freeport will also export concentrate in the near future.""Freeport declined to comment on the expected resumption of its exports. Hidayat did not mention Newmont in his comments.Freeport's Sutjipto confirmed to reporters on Monday that the company would build a copper smelter in Indonesia.Industry experts said the government's turnaround was to be expected since the intention of the new regulations was not to halt concentrate exports.""I wouldn't say this has come to a surprise to us. What has come to a surprise is that it took so long to get here,"" said Gayle Berry, base metals analyst at Barclays.Freeport and Newmont have until March 7 to sign agreements detailing the volume of copper concentrate they will supply to companies that are building smelters in Indonesia - PT Indosmelt, PT Nusantara Smelting and PT Aneka Tambang (Antam) .Earlier this month, Freeport and Antam agreed to study the possibility of building a $2.2 billion, 300,000 tonne smelter to process copper.Sutjipto said the feasibility study on the smelter with Antam will be completed in April.",2014-02-24,FCX,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 6:28am EST","UPDATE 2-Indonesia to ease export tax, 1st rollback of mining rules",http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-minerals-idUSL3N0LT1V620140224?type=companyNews

This compares with around $105-$110 per tonne and 10.5-11 cents per pound early this month.Global miners or trading houses pay TC/RCs to smelters to convert concentrate into refined metal, with the charges deducted from the sale price, based on London Metal Exchange copper prices. Charges typically fall when concentrate supply tightens.The global market for refined copper is expected to be steeped in surplus this year, fed by a huge expansion of mine supply. But delays or curbs to mine shipments or could exacerbate a shortage of refined metal that has stressed global markets outside China, helping to underpin copper prices.""When this talk started, before the ban, which was implemented on Jan. 12, everybody knew that they (producers) could hold off for a quarter or up to four months,"" one physical trader said.""Smelters overbought to compensate.

Of this amount the target includes export sales of 403,036 tonnes compared to realised export sales of 236,932 tonnes in 2013.Southeast Asia's largest economy is pushing to increase added value to the minerals it produces and introduced tough new rules this year that force miners to refine metals domestically, including an escalating tax on exports.Freeport and Newmont have halted copper concentrate shipments since January, refusing to pay the export tax that they say breaches their contracts.Indonesia is keen for the two firms to resume exports because of the potential loss in their contributions to state revenue. Both companies gained certification as registered exporters this week, bringing them closer to this goal. ""This has to be quick,"" Sukhyar told Reuters on Thursday, referring to the final steps the government needed to take for the two companies to begin exporting again after the January stoppage.""Their concentrate needs to be shipped out. It's a pity if it's not,"" he said adding that exports could restart in April.Freeport's total contributions to Indonesia in the form of taxes, royalties and dividends since 1992 had reached $15.2 billion last year, with approximately $500 million in 2013 alone, the company noted in an emailed statement received on Friday.Freeport also said that while no dividends were paid in 2013 because of low commodity prices, a resumption of exports would mean an increase in these contributions as well as taxes and royalties.Newmont share prices have slumped nearly 30 percent since September, partly because of uncertainty in Indonesia.Copper prices and are recovering from a 3-1/2 year low of $6,321 a tonne hit earlier this month.

""Antam's main focus is the development of the ferronickel smelter expansion in Pomala and East Halmahera ferronickel  project,"" Miraza said, referring to two of the firm's nickel projects hit by the ban on ore shipments.""It (needs) three years,"" mineral enterprise director Dede Suhendra said, referring to the development of the Antam-Freeport project, though he added the timeframe could be cut.Other Indonesian copper smelter projects aiming to process concentrate from Freeport and fellow miner Newmont Mining Corp  were expected to take up to 5 years to build. Concentrates are an intermediate product between ore and metal, enriched with minerals as a result of processing.The pre-feasibility study for the copper project is expected to be complete by the end of this month, Miraza said. A delay in the Antam copper project could also hamper this month's expected resumption of concentrate exports by Freeport and Newmont after they stopped in January, because of the new rules.Indonesia is using the project, which would process concentrate from the two U.S firms, to gauge Freeport's commitment to the domestic processing rules, with an offer to adjust the export tax once the project gets underway.""If it's not ready (by 2017) their concentrate will be withheld,"" coal and minerals director general Sukhyar told reporters, reiterating that the concentrate shipment ban would kick off as planned.Freeport targets to sell 2,118,525 tonnes of concentrate from its Grasberg mine in Indonesia this year.

Encana shares were up C$1.14 to C$25.70 by early afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange after earlier touching C$26.08.The acquisition is Suttles' first major purchase since the former BP Plc executive arrived at the Calgary-based Encana last June with a mandate to reshape a company that had endured a series of strategic missteps that had it relying on natural gas from wide flung operations throughout North America.Suttles has begun selling off surplus properties, shedding its stake in Wyoming's Jonah gas field in March for $1.8 billion and late last month selling east Texas gas lands for $530 million.Encana said the Eagle Ford assets offer a large contiguous land position in the core of the play, fitting well with Encana's technical expertise in developing resource plays. Canaccord Genuity analyst Phil Skolnick said he views the transaction as positive for Encana, as the deal will boost cash flows for the company.The deal will give Encana 45,500 net acres in Karnes, Wilson and Atascosa counties in south Texas. The properties produced the equivalent of about 53,000 barrels of oil per day in the first quarter, the company said.The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter. FREEPORT DEBT REDUCTION Freeport said it expects net proceeds of about $2.5 billion, roughly half of which would be used to repay debt and the rest for investment in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The proceeds would get the copper and gold miner more than halfway to its stated goal of monetizing about $4 billion of its energy assets.Freeport's debt levels spiked last year when it bought energy companies Plains Exploration & Production Co and McMoRan Exploration Co for $9 billion. At March 31, 2014, its consolidated debt was $20.9 billion.""This transaction represents an important step in our ongoing debt reduction plan while providing additional capital to enhance our portfolio of assets with superior margins and growth characteristics,"" said Freeport's CEO James Moffett in a statement.Freeport shares were up 19 cents to $34.03 on the New York Stock Exchange.

39,"   By Fergus Jensen and Nina Kusuma | JAKARTA  JAKARTA May 30 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc's CEO will be in Indonesia next week for talks to resolve the U.S. miner's impasse with the government over exports from its giant Grasberg copper and gold mine that have halted since January.A Freeport spokeswoman declined to provide details on Chief Executive Richard Adkerson's visit.Indonesia levied in January an escalating tax on copper concentrate exports as part of efforts to force miners to build smelters and processing industries in Southeast Asia's largest economy to move up the value chain.However, Arizona-based Freeport and Colorado-based Newmont Mining Corp, accounting for 97 percent of the country's copper output, say the rules conflict with their mining contracts that exempt them from new taxes and duties.Newly appointed chief economic minister Chairul Tanjung said on Wednesday the issues would be resolved next week with the Freeport management in Jakarta and that exports could restart soon. The government says its minerals policies are a success, with a spike in nickel prices and 66 smelter projects in the pipeline.The controversial mineral policy and halt to mineral exports have political ramifications for the next leaders of Southeast Asia's largest economy as it approaches elections in July. Disputes and confusion over the rules have halted about $500 million worth of monthly mineral ore and concentrate exports, causing concerns it is widening the country's already large current account deficit.Earlier, Freeport said production at the world's fifth-largest copper mine had been slashed by around 60 percent and that a force majeure could be announced if the dispute drags on.Rapidly reaching its stockpile capacity, Newmont warned earlier this month it may start ramping down production and laying off workers from its Batu Hijau mine from June. Newmont's spokesman in Jakarta declined on Friday to comment on whether this would go ahead as planned.Freeport and Newmont are currently in talks with Indonesia's state-owned PT Aneka Tambang (Antam) to build a $2.2 billion copper smelter, but plans for the project are yet to be finalized.Both Freeport and Newmont had agreed to pay deposits worth a total of $140 million to the government to guarantee their commitment to the smelter, Coal and Minerals Director General Sukhyar said this week.The government has set new 2014 copper concentrate export volumes of 600,000 tonnes for Freeport and 250,000 tonnes for Newmont, worth around $1.5 billion, Sukhyar said, roughly half the government's previous target.

Indonesia's chief economics minister and billionaire businessman, Chairul Tanjung, is spearheading a new government push aimed at brokering a deal with foreign miners to restart copper concentrate exports that halted five months ago.Both Freeport and fellow U.S.-based copper and gold miner Newmont have previously argued they should be exempt from the tax, which kicks in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017. They say their current contracts prohibit any extra taxes.The export tax is part of a government drive to force miners to build smelters and processing plants in Southeast Asia's largest economy, but a lack of progress in resolving the stalemate last week led to Newmont declaring force majeure.

The company, which hopes to significantly reduce its debt by the end of 2016, agreed in May to sell $3.1 billion worth of oil assets to Encana Corp.Toronto-based Magris was interested in the Glencore Xstrata's Las Bambas copper mine in Peru last year, Reuters reported at the time, but the mine ultimately went to a Chinese consortium for $6 billion. Candelaria and the nearby Ojos del Salado mine together produced 87 million pounds of copper in the first quarter, about 9 percent of total copper production at Freeport's mines. Freeport owns 80 percent of Candelaria, and affiliates of Japan's Sumitomo Corp hold the balance.Freeport spokesman Eric Kinneberg said the company does not comment on rumors.

Billionaire businessman Tanjung has spearheaded a new government drive to resolve both the export and contract issues.The draft MoU still needed to be approved by both the cabinet and outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, said Deputy Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Susilo Siswoutomo. If the draft MoU is approved by the president, although it will be a further step towards resuming copper concentrate exports, there is no indication that it will satisfy the Arizona-based miner.Freeport Indonesia could not be reached for comment on Monday, and government officials were unable to give a date for when the cabinet would next meet. Government officials have previously said Freeport can only renew their 2021 deal in 2019 at the earliest, but it now seems likely that the miner will be offered a different type of contract when its current deal ends.There was renewed hope that the export spat would be resolved last month after the government finalised a new export tax draft regulation, but with a presidential election this week, progress appears to have stalled.In addition to a contract extension, the renegotiations, which began more than a year ago, include changes to Freeport's mining and exploration area, divestment, royalty payments and plans to build a domestic smelter.Freeport, along with fellow copper miner Newmont Mining Corp , halted copper concentrate exports in January when the government introduced the surprise tax, which the two U.S. firms say violates their mining contracts.

Freeport, which runs one of the world's biggest copper mines, has been in talks with the government to resolve a six-month dispute that has halted concentrate exports after Indonesia introduced new export rules on Jan. 12.Industry Minister Mohamad Hidayat said that the MoU was due to be discussed at an Indonesian cabinet meeting this week, and finalized within two weeks.After Freeport pays a smelter construction bond of $115 million, the finance ministry will then sign a lower export tax regulation to allow exports to resume within a month, he added.Legal experts, however, said MoUs are normally not legally binding and although a step forward, hurdles still remained before exports could be resumed. Progress on a deal could also be hindered by Wednesday's presidential election. Incumbent Susilo Bambang Yudhoyuno is unable to contest after serving two terms and the winner of an expected tight contest will not take office until October.""The purpose of the MoU is simply to publicly record the progress made to date,"" said Jakarta-based mining law expert Bill Sullivan, foreign counsel at Christian Teo Purwono & Partners.Under the draft MoU, government officials say Freeport has agreed to divest 30 percent of its Indonesian unit, pay a royalty of 4 percent for copper sales and 3.75 percent for gold sales - up from 1 percent previously - and agreed to build a smelter and pay the government a repayable bond. The export rules introduced in January would have forced Freeport to pay an export tax of 25 percent, rising to 60 percent in the second half of 2016.The rules are part of a government drive to force miners to build smelters and processing plants in Indonesia.Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Jero Wacik said on Tuesday the government would also invite Newmont Mining Corp  to discuss a negotiation process over the export rules.Newmont, the other major copper miner in Indonesia, has taken a more aggressive stance in talks and earlier this month filed for international arbitration, drawing a rebuke from the government.Newmont could not be reached for comment.(Additional reporting by Wilda Asmarini; Writing by Michael Taylor; Editing by Richard Pullin)",2014-07-08,FCX,"Tue Jul 8, 2014 | 3:52am EDT","Freeport says draft MoU agreed but not signed, no export timeframe",http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-freeport-idUSL4N0PJ1BF20140708?type=companyNews
50,"   By Michael Taylor and Allison Martell | JAKARTA/TORONTO, July 8  JAKARTA/TORONTO, July 8 Six months into a dispute with Indonesia's government that has halted copper exports, two U.S. mining giants are using very different tactics in a bid to resume shipments - behind the scenes talks or raising the stakes with an arbitration claim.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc and Newmont Mining Corp account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper production, exporting tens of thousands of tonnes of concentrate a month before a row over a new export tax halted shipments.As the latest bid to broker a deal runs up against Indonesia's presidential election, Freeport is pushing on with government-led talks, with chief executive Richard Adkerson in Jakarta again last week.Newmont, however, has filed for international arbitration, pushing to uphold the letter of the law on its contract but drawing a rebuke from the government which has questioned its ""good will"" in talks.""Freeport is using the carrot and I guess Newmont is using the stick,"" said Chris Mancini, analyst at Gabelli Gold Fund. Gabelli Funds holds stakes in both companies.In an effort to push miners to build domestic smelters and processing plants, Indonesia introduced new mining export rules in January. These include an escalating export tax, which will hit 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017.Freeport and Newmont, which export about two-thirds of their output as concentrate, insist the new tax violates their contracts, and have questioned the economic viability of building a smelter to ready concentrate for refining.Despite a revived effort in recent weeks to secure a deal, industry officials say Wednesday's presidential election means the dispute is now unlikely to resolved until after a new president takes office in October.""A resumption in concentrate exports will not happen until the end of the year,"" said Syahrir Abubakar, executive director of Indonesian Mining Association.Copper prices have risen seven percent over the past three weeks, in part due to shrinking supply of refined metal as LME stocks have dropped to near-six year lows. HARD BALL, SOFT BALL Sitting atop one of the world's biggest and lowest cost copper and gold deposits and with a plan to mine until 2041, Freeport has a lot to lose if its relationship with the Indonesian government suffers irreparable damage.Indonesian copper production provides about 19 percent of the Arizona-based company's global revenue, and analysts say enormous exploration potential remains.Freeport has slashed output, but CEO Adkerson has spend a great deal of time in Indonesia and the miner has agreed to at least study the feasibility of a copper smelter project.""Freeport is well aware that if you make grandstanding statements, that only enrages and inflames the more extreme elements on the Indonesian side,"" said Adrian Day, chief executive of Maryland-based Adrian Day Asset Management.On Tuesday, Freeport said it had agreed a draft memorandum with the government on contract renegotiations, although hurdles remain before any deal is reached. Colorado-based Newmont has taken a much harder line.Less than two weeks after the January export rules were introduced, Newmont said it was considering legal action and by June it had declared force majeure and placed most of the 8,000 employees at its Batu Hijau mine on leave.Piling on more pressure, Newmont last week filed for international arbitration against the Indonesian government, a move that some observers see as a dangerous gambit in a country where open confrontation is often frowned upon.Indonesia's chief economics minister Chairul Tanjung on Monday urged Newmont to withdraw its arbitration claim or face a law suit from the government.""If I was Newmont, I'd be very concerned that this might back-fire on them,"" said Jakarta-based mining law expert Bill Sullivan, foreign counsel at Christian Teo Purwono & Partners.""Many people would say that, if you start arbitration against Indonesia, it is really an exit strategy,"" he said. The move may partly reflect Newmont's smaller operations, which analysts say could not justify a stand-alone smelter.Newmont's Indonesian operations accounted for about 3 percent of group revenues in 2013 and the miner is not in talks to extend its contract beyond 2030.It is set to reach richer grades of ore in coming years, but analysts expect it to gradually sell its interest in Batu Hijau before mining draws to a close in about 20 years time.CONTRACT EXTENSION For Freeport, the tax talks are also linked to an extension of its current contract, that is due to run out in 2021.While keen to invest the more than $15 billion needed to turn Grasberg into an underground mine after 2016, it needs the certainty of a contract extension to proceed.Indonesia's presidential campaigning has been dominated by nationalistic rhetoric from candidates Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo and Prabowo Subianto, and foreign miners are often seen as exploiting the country's natural resources.But the current account deficit is under pressure and both companies pay substantial taxes and fees - $1 billion from Freeport in 2012 - while mine closures would affect more than 30,000 workers.Newmont has already shuttered its mine, while Freeport may look to cut costs and try to break even at reduced capacity, sources said, but analysts says neither is likely to walk away.""These are both very important mines for Newmont and Freeport,"" said Gabelli's Mancini.

51,"  (Adds Newmont comment, background)July 23 Freeport-McMoRan Inc said on Wednesday it expects to ""imminently"" sign an agreement with Indonesia that would enable it to immediately resume copper concentrate exports which have been halted for more than six months.In a sign that the deadlock could be nearing an end, Newmont Mining Corp also said it was negotiating a memorandum of understanding that could restart stalled shipments.Arizona-based Freeport said on July 8 it had agreed on a draft memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government but had not signed it. At the time, it gave no time frame on when it would resume exports. Indonesia introduced a mineral ore export ban and a steep export tax in January.""It is a compromise to create a bridge for us so that we can return to normal operations,"" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said of the MoU on a call with analysts and investors after the miner reported second-quarter results that were little changed from a year-ago.Under the agreement, Freeport would pay a ""significantly reduced"" export duty in 2014, 2015 and 2016 but higher royalties on copper and gold sales. It would also pay a $115 million ""assurance bond"" against development of a smelter, Adkerson said.Freeport, which owns and operates the massive Grasberg mine, wants financial incentives from the government to build a new smelter. Indonesia imposed the new rules partly to spur construction of smelters in the country, but miners have said building new capacity does not make economic sense. Adkerson said the negotiations also involve agreeing on terms to extend Freeport's operations beyond 2021, when its current contract with the government expires.NEWMONT BACK IN TALKS  The two U.S. mining giants account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper production. While Freeport had engaged in behind-the-scenes talks, Newmont suspended operation at its Batu Hijau mine and filed for international arbitration, drawing a rebuke from the Indonesian government.""We hope to reach an agreement with the government of Indonesia on an MoU or memorandum of understanding, which we would expect would lead to issuance of an export permit,"" Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said on Wednesday.He did not give details on terms or when exports could resume. Officials from Newmont's Indonesian unit have been in ongoing meetings with the government, he added. Indonesia's new president said on Tuesday he planned to sit down with Freeport and other miners to resolve the row, which has halted $500 million of metal exports a month in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.Freeport has cut production in Indonesia, which weighed on results in the quarter ended June 30, but company-wide, copper, gold and molybdenum production rose.The year-earlier figures included only one month of results from Freeport's recently acquired oil and gas businesses, so that segment's revenue jumped to $1.24 billion from $372 million.Net income was $482 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with $482 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier.Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 51 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Freeport said it would continue to look for ways to reduce its debt, which could include asset sales or reducing or deferring capital spending. It ended the quarter with $20.3 billion of debt.

52,"   By Fergus Jensen | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Indonesia has offered mining companies a tax concession to end a six-month dispute that has reduced mineral exports by half a billion dollars a month, pushed up the global price of some metals and led to thousands of layoffs.The company with the biggest mining operations in the archipelago, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc, is set to become the first to take the deal and restart concentrate shipments from Grasberg, one of the world's largest copper mines. Freeport said on Wednesday that the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to resume exports was imminent. After a cabinet meeting on mining policy on Thursday, Indonesia's chief economics minister Chairul Tanjung told reporters that Freeport was close to receiving an export permit. If other miners follow suit, the deal will take some of the pressure off president elect Joko Widodo. Widodo was declared the winner of Indonesia's presidential elections this week and has said solving the dispute - which has sapped government mining revenues - would be one of his top priorities when he takes power in October.It was unclear if the decision to revise the export tax rules was deliberately timed to coincide with the result of Indonesia's most tightly-contested election.The second-largest copper miner in the country, Newmont Mining Corp, said on Wednesday that it, too, was negotiating an agreement to restart exports, but an Indonesian official denied any talks had taken place""There have been no MOU discussions with Newmont. None at all,"" Coal and Minerals director general Sukhyar said on Thursday. ""The government's position is we will face them in court.""The company has more work to do to rebuild its relationship with the government after angering authorities by suspending operation at its biggest Indonesian mine and filing for international arbitration in response to the move in January by Indonesia to raise export taxes on metal concentrates.""The government will take stern action toward Newmont,"" Tanjung quoted President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as saying on Thursday.    He said also that Yudhoyono referred to the firm as ""not valuing working on Indonesian soil, the birthplace of Indonesia's ancestors.""Newmont officials were not immediately available to respond to the comments.  Freeport and Newmont are Indonesia's top copper miners, and account for 97 percent of the nation's copper output.TAX BREAK FOR SMELTER BOND     Indonesia will cut the tax levied on mineral concentrate exports to less than 10 percent for miners that pay a bond as a guarantee they will build a smelter later, Fiscal Policy chief Andin Hadiyanto told Reuters on Thursday, adding that the new regulation was due to be issued in August.As construction of the smelter progresses, the export tax on concentrates would fall to zero, he added.The government will also charge extra royalties on mineral sales to at least partly offset any loss in revenue, officials said.  In January, Indonesia imposed an escalating tax policy, which penalized any company which had not made progress on building a smelter by slapping them with a 25 percent tax on copper concentrate exports or a 20 percent tax on lead, zinc, iron and manganese shipments. The tax was due to increase annually to 60 percent in 2017.The tax was intended to force miners to develop smelters and mineral processing facilities and part of a government push to derive bigger returns from Indonesia's mineral resources. But rather than pay it, most miners stopped exporting from Southeast Asia's biggest economy and one of the world's top mineral producers.The government also banned the export of unprocessed ore, and that ban will remain in place,FREEPORT'S AGREEMENT  As part of its deal, Freeport has agreed to pay more royalties, Hadiyanto said. Its royalties will rise to 4 percent on copper sales, Sukhyar said. It previously paid between 1.5 and 3.5 percent under an old deal, and the higher rate will bring it into line with royalties paid by other companies.The government is expected to grant Freeport an export permit within two weeks, Sukhyar said. The company is Indonesia's biggest taxpayer, and earlier said its contributions  would drop by $1.6 billion in 2014 as a result of declining output from the rule change in January. Under the agreement, Freeport said it would pay a ""significantly reduced"" export duty in 2014, 2015 and 2016 but higher royalties on copper and gold sales.

""We still have to load the ship, and this may take a few days."" Freeport shares were up 1.79 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.The company will now be subject to higher royalties, which will increase to 4 percent for copper and 3.75 percent for gold, up from 3.5 percent and 1 percent respectively, and the U.S.-based miner will also have to pay export duties on shipments until it builds a smelter in the Southeast Asian nation.In January, the government introduced a controversial escalating tax on metal concentrates that climbed to 60 percent by 2017. Under a revision of the tax, Freeport will pay a 7.5 percent duty on its copper concentrate exports, but that rate falls as it spends on its smelter, hitting zero once investment in the project exceeds 30 percent of total cost. The deal is expected to take some of the pressure off President-elect Joko Widodo, who has said resolving the dispute, which has sapped government mining revenues, would be one of his top priorities when he takes power in October.The export tax was meant to force miners to develop local mineral processing facilities, allowing the government to derive bigger returns from Indonesia's mineral resources. But rather than pay it, most miners stopped exporting from Southeast Asia's biggest economy, resulting in $1.3 billion in lost copper concentrate shipments. It also led Indonesia's second-biggest copper producer, Newmont Mining Corp, to file for international arbitration earlier this month over the new export rules it said were in breach of its contract.A spokesman for Newmont Mining Corp, which owns the Batu Hijau mine on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, said it is in talks with the government on a separate MoU that would allow it to resume operations at its massive copper mine.""We are encouraged by the news about Freeport, which we hope will pave the way for construction of a copper smelter and lead to an economically sustainable resolution of the export ban,"" Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said.Freeport currently smelts some 30 to 40 percent of its output from its Grasberg mine at a copper smelter in Gresik, East Java. The company has previously said it plans to work with Indonesia's state-owned miner Aneka Tambang (Antam) to build the country's second copper smelter.It is not clear whether that project will be ready before Indonesia's ban on concentrate exports begins in less than three years time.

As part of Friday's deal, the government reduced Freeport's copper concentrate export tax to 7.5 percent from 25 percent after the company agreed to pay a bond as a guarantee they will build a smelter later.The tax rate that Freeport is subject to is part of a new tax regime for mineral concentrate exporters approved on Friday by the finance ministry. ""The 7.5 percent rate is not automatic, and is connected to their spending on a (smelter) guarantee bond and a percentage from the cost of their investment,"" said Deputy Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro. The government forecasts Freeport, which is expected to soon receive an export permit by the trade ministry, to ship 756,000 tonnes of copper concentrate in the second half of the year, Sukhyar said.A dispute with mining companies triggered by the imposition in January of new regulations, which included the export tax and a ban on mineral ore exports, had cost $1.3 billion in lost shipments of copper concentrate. The mining regulations were intended to force miners to develop smelters and mineral processing facilities and part of a government push to derive bigger returns from Indonesia's mineral resources. But rather than pay it, most miners stopped exporting from Southeast Asia's biggest economy and one of the world's top mineral producers.The ban on the export of unprocessed ore remains in place.

A resumption of the exports has been anticipated by the copper market.Chinese smelters, the world's biggest importers of copper concentrate, buy up to half of their requirements in the spot market, and a postponement of purchases will force trading houses and other sellers to find alternative buyers. The sellers will also have to fork out more to the smelters in spot processing fees once Freeport's concentrates from Indonesia hit the market.Sellers of concentrate pay treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) to the smelters to convert the raw material into refined metal, with the charges deducted from the smelters' sale prices. The charges rise or fall in line with concentrate supply.""Freeport's resuming exports would have a big impact. TC/RCs could jump to $110/11 cents immediately after the Freeport restarting,"" said an executive at a state-backed copper smelter in China, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to talk to media.The executive said his firm was going to put purchase of spot concentrate on hold while waiting for Freeport's exports from Indonesia to resume. It was not immediately clear when the exports would restart. A trading manager at a large state-owned smelter also expects spot TC/RCs to rise to about $110 per tonne and 11 cents per pound shortly after Freeport's restarting. Those levels of the processing fees were last seen in March.ASIAN BUYING  Chinese smelters had already started reducing purchases of spot concentrate since late May, betting on Freeport resuming exports in the third quarter and on a rise in TC/RCs. But TC/RCs have continued to fall since then because of strong spot buying by other Asian smelters, traders and the smelter sources said.Sellers this week offered to pay TC/RCs of $84-$90 per tonne and 8.4-9 cents per pound for spot standard, clean copper concentrates to China, compared to around $100 and 10 cents in late May.The offers were also lower than the $95.5 and 9.55 cents paid by Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton  to at least one large Chinese smelter for term concentrate shipments in the second half of 2014.The trading manager at the large state-owned smelter said the firm was likely to buy two to three shipments of spot concentrate imports if TC/RCs rose to $100-$110 and 10-11 cents.China's copper concentrate imports CU-CNCONIMP surged 47 percent on-year to nearly 1 million tonnes in June, the third-highest monthly number ever.The jump in June imports was due to increased arrivals of term shipments, the smelter sources said.

Despite the dispute, Newmont still considered Indonesia a ""great place"" to be working in the long term, Goldberg said. He stressed Newmont would continue to try to resolve the dispute through talks with the government while also pursuing the arbitration, but said he had no plans to visit Indonesia while he was in the Asia-Pacific region over the next week.""Arbitration isn't necessarily the way I'd like to resolve this.

""At 1500 today, the loading will be finished ... we still don't know if we can ship today or tomorrow morning, but it is supposed to be today.""Rozik did not give an estimate for concentrate exports for the year, and a company spokeswoman was unavailable for comment on Thursday. Mining ministry and central bank officials forecast that Freeport will now export between 750,000-756,000 tonnes of copper concentrate in the second half of 2014, worth $1.5 billion.The export tax was part of moves to force all miners to develop local mineral processing facilities, which would bring bigger returns for the government from Indonesia's mineral resources.But mining industry executives in Indonesia have balked at the idea of developing downstream industries and building smelters, citing a lack of power and infrastructure in remote areas where mines are often located. The escalating tax on metal concentrates kicked in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017.Under a revision of the tax, Freeport will now pay a 7.5 percent duty on its copper concentrate exports, but that rate falls as it spends on its smelter, hitting zero once investment in the project exceeds 30 percent of total cost.Freeport currently smelts some 30 to 40 percent of its output from its Grasberg mine at a copper smelter in Gresik, East Java. The firm is now looking at potential smelter construction sites in Gresik and Papua, with land acquisition costs likely to be around $100 million, said Rozik, adding that he hoped that ground-breaking would take place this year.Freeport previously worked on a feasibility study for a copper smelter with Indonesia's Aneka Tambang (Antam), and Rozik said the state-owned miner may help with permit applications and construction.Talks with possible partners for financing the smelter project are ongoing, he added, with both Antam and Newmont Mining Corp involved in the discussions.Newmont, which runs the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine, has adopted a tougher approach to resolving the export tax dispute by filing for international arbitration.Indonesian Mining Association Executive Director Syahrir Abubakar urged Newmont on Thursday to withdraw its arbitration case.

72,"   By Kristen Hays | FREEPORT  FREEPORT Texas Aug 13 Independent refiner Phillips 66 said on Wednesday it is evaluating the export of super-light crude oil known as condensate, after two industry peers received U.S. government approval to ship it overseas after minimal processing.The company declined to say if it has sought formal permission to export condensate from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is tasked with interpreting exceptions to a decades-old ban on crude exports.""We're evaluating the process and seeking a better understanding,"" Chris Chandler, Phillips 66's head of natural gas liquids (NGLs) said. ""That process is still a little unclear to us.""He spoke before the groundbreaking for the construction of a 100,000 barrel per day (bpd) fractionation plant that strips NGLs from gas and a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) export facility that will require $3 billion in investments.The facility in Freeport, Texas will sit near the Gulf Coast and is close to the company's 247,000 bpd refinery in Sweeny, which has a link to Kinder Morgan's Crude and Condensate pipeline, a 300,000 bpd line that moves crude from the Eagle Ford fields to Houston. The terminal after start up in 2016 will provide 4.4 million barrels per month of export capacity for LPGs, which include butane and propane.Asked if the export facility could potentially export condensate that has been minimally processed, Chandler said: ""This Freeport facility has a lot of expansion possibilities. It's close to the Gulf of Mexico, three miles from open water. We have the capability of doing a lot more here than we do currently.""Chief Executive Greg Garland, while cautioning further plans are still being weighed, said the company could end up spending more on energy infrastructure on the Gulf Coast. ""We're thinking of $10 billion in projects right here on the Gulf Coast,"" he said.Demand is growing for new facilities to handle surging output of oil and gas from the U.S. shale boom. That output has prompted a rise in exports of refined products and led to calls for a loosening of the ban on crude exports, especially because local refiners have limited capacity to run lighter crudes coming out of shale fields.""In the not too distant future we need to export crude. We are long light sweet crude in Texas,"" Texas Railroad Commissioner Barry Smitherman, the state's top energy regulator, said.In June, Commerce told Pioneer Natural Resources and Enterprise Product Partners they could export stabilized condensate as a refined product without a special license, which is needed to export unprocessed domestic crude.U.S. law has long defined processed oil as having passed through distillation towers, key pieces of refinery equipment that turn crude oil into finished products.But the Commerce Department said equipment known as stabilizers, traditionally used to treat crude so it meets pipeline specifications, could also be used to comply with the refining regulation.

""He believed me, I believed him and we shook hands. Very simple.""Tanjung, one of Indonesia's richest businessmen, was appointed minister in May and made reaching a deal to get mining exports going again a priority to revive an economy suffering its sharpest slowdown since the global financial crisis.But a looming presidential election had made it even harder to reach a politically unpopular compromise with foreign miners.Aside from any chemistry between the two successful businessmen, the breakthrough came because Moffett had taken a more flexible approach, said Tanjung.The dispute with Freeport had centred on its refusal to pay an escalating mineral concentrate export tax and its bid to extend its mining contract. The meeting was only attended by a small number of Indonesian officials and Freeport, and according to Tanjung the solution was to focus on what the two could agree on to get exports restarted and set other issues aside for now.Freeport agreed to a $115 million downpayment for a smelter, to pay higher royalties and divest more of its Indonesian unit.Indonesia in return substantially cut the concentrate export tax for Freeport and other miners building smelters.Moffett is a likeable and larger-than-life Louisiana businessman, known for his Elvis impersonations during lighter moments, but also a shrewd deal maker.Starting his career as a wildcat prospector in Louisiana, Moffett founded McMoRan Oil & Gas Co with two of his partners in 1969 and put together the merger with Freeport 12 years later.With a 47-year history in Indonesia, Freeport's fortunes were transformed by the discovery of the Grasberg mine in Papua, one of the world's biggest deposits of gold and copper.Helped by Moffett's ties to late autocratic President Suharto, Freeport won the right in 1988 to mine Grasberg, which has been a lightning rod for grievances over its impact on the environment, security arrangements and revenue sharing.The recent talks did not touch on Freeport's controversial links to the Suharto family or environmental issues, said Sukhyar, director general for coal and minerals at the ministry, who played a role in the negotiations. HIGH STAKES In January, Indonesia introduced a mineral ore export ban and the escalating tax on metal concentrate shipments in a bid to force miners to process raw materials to lift their value.But the tough measures in some cases backfired as miners such as Freeport and Newmont Mining Corp said the rules breached their contracts and exports stopped.The stakes were high on both sides.The Grasberg complex in Papua provided around a fifth of Freeport's global revenue last year.In Indonesia, the company employs 24,000 including contractors, and is one of the country's largest tax payers.Freeport believed the new mining rules, particularly the  export tax, violated its contract. The company refused to pay the tax and invest in a copper smelter unless the government provided assurances it would be allowed to continue operating after its contract expires in 2021.Freeport wanted certainty to spend more than $15 billion to build what would be the world's biggest underground mine, while the government said it could not renegotiate until 2019, two years before the contract expired. Freeport Indonesia CEO Rozik Soetjipto said the breakthrough came when the new minister arrived with a business background.""He understood that it is impossible for a company to continue such huge investments if there are no legal guarantees for the long term continuation and fiscal certainty.""A trained dentist, Tanjung, 52, was ranked as Indonesia's fifth-richest man by Forbes with a net wealth of $4 billion.

""We are asking for their (Newmont's) certainty in working with Freeport.""We recognize that Freeport's smelter plan also accommodates concentrates from Newmont, so I've asked them to meet again to confirm this (plan)."" He did not elaborate.The tax is part of government moves to force miners to develop local mineral-processing facilities, which would bring bigger returns for Indonesia from its mineral resources. Mining industry executives in Indonesia have balked at the idea of developing downstream industries and building smelters, citing a lack of power and infrastructure in remote areas where mines are often located.Both Freeport and Newmont, which together account for 97 percent of Indonesia's copper output, had previously argued they should be exempt from the tax, which kicks in at 25 percent and rises to 60 percent in the second half of 2016, before a total concentrate export ban in 2017.But Freeport's Indonesian unit resumed exports earlier this month after being granted a much reduced tax rate on condition it builds a smelter, and after signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the government in July. Freeport has begun initial work on the construction of a domestic smelter and is looking at potential sites to build the $2.3 billion project. Freeport declined to comment on Wednesday but has previously stated that the project may also involve Newmont. Newmont could not be reached for immediate comment on Wednesday. Newmont said in a statement on Tuesday that multiple studies had shown it was not economically viable for it to build a smelter on its own.""The company has an MoU to participate in a process with PT Freeport Indonesia designed to lead toward the development of a smelter,"" the statement said. Newmont also has conditional concentrate supply agreements with two Indonesian companies that plan to build their own copper smelters in the country, it said.Government officials have previously stated that Newmont has already agreed to pay an export tax, without giving an exact figure, but that further talks were needed over the issue of an increase in royalties. The MoU talks between Newmont and the government are likely to be concluded next week, Yoesrawan Galang, chairman of the Newmont Indonesia workers' union, told Reuters, adding that production may return to full capacity by mid-October.Newmont's copper concentrate stocks are around 80,000 tonnes (1.1023 ton), Galang added.Before the new export rules, Newmont forecast total output of copper in concentrate would amount to 110,000 to 125,000 tonnes from its Indonesian mine this year.A trade ministry official said on Wednesday the ministry was yet to receive a recommendation from the mining ministry to enable issue of a concentrate export permit to Newmont.

He could not know how many staff were involved, but workers told Reuters around 500 took part in the demonstration.There were at least three deadly accidents at the Papua complex last year, including a tunnel collapse in May that killed 28 people. Freeport Indonesia spokeswoman Daisy Primayanti said management were holding a dialogue with the protesters to find a solution.Freeport only resumed Indonesian exports in early August after a seven-month tax dispute with the government halted shipments. In mid-August, the company said it had built up a 140,000-tonne stockpile and expected total copper concentrate production of 1.8 million tonnes this year, down from an earlier forecast of 2.2 million tonnes, with exports of about 700,000 tonnes.

87,"   By Nicole Mordant  Canada's Lundin Mining Corp (LUN.TO) will buy Freeport-McMoRan Inc's (FCX.N) 80 percent stake in the Candelaria copper mining operation in Chile for at least $1.8 billion, more than doubling its copper output. A potential sale had been rumored in the media for some time, but tax issues were said to have held up the deal.""They were looking for a big project and they wanted to get more copper,"" said Kerry Smith, an analyst at Haywood Securities in Toronto.With the mine already in production, there was ""a lot less risk to it,"" he said. The transaction is one of the biggest deals for a mining asset since Glencore Plc (GLEN.L) sold its Las Bambas copper asset in Peru to China's MMG Ltd (1208.HK) for $7 billion in a deal that closed in July.Mining mergers and acquisitions have slowed to a crawl in the past year amid with a downturn in metals prices. The transaction comes at a time when copper prices have fallen by a third since early 2011. The metal is currently one of the more divisive commodities among analysts, with opinions split over whether it will rally or lose ground during the rest of 2014. Candelaria is expected to produce 156,000 tonnes of copper, 97,000 ounces of gold and 1.9 million ounces of silver in 2014. In 2013, Lundin produced nearly 117,000 tonnes of copper, along with zinc, lead and nickel at its operations in Portugal, Sweden, Spain, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Finland and the United States.Lundin's purchase gives the diversified base metals mining company a foothold in the world's top copper-producing country. ""This transaction further enhances our company by providing increased operational and geographic diversification,"" said Paul Conibear, Lundin's president and chief executive.For Freeport, an Arizona-based copper and gold miner as well as an oil and gas producer, the sale is an opportunity to reduce its high debt levels, which total more than $20 billion. Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson said the company remained committed to Chile and to its other global copper assets.  Lundin is financing the cash acquisition in part by selling a stream of 68 percent of Candelaria's gold and silver production to Franco-Nevada Corp (FNV.TO) for an upfront payment of $648 million. In addition, Lundin has agreed to pay $200 million, calculated as 5 percent of net copper revenues in any year over the next five years during which the average realized copper price exceeds $4 per pound. Copper traded on Monday at $3.04 a pound.It is also raising $1 billion in new senior secured debt and about $600 million in equity financing in connection with the deal.The remaining 20 percent stake in Candelaria will continue to be held by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd (5713.T) and Sumitomo Corp (8053.T).

Copper traded on Monday at $3.04 a pound.It is also raising $1 billion in new senior secured debt and about $600 million in equity financing in connection with the deal.The remaining 20 percent stake in Candelaria will continue to be held by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd and Sumitomo Corp.

90,"  * Five people have died at the mine this year -union official* Safety at Grasberg is a priority, says Arizona-based miner* Freeport set to make safety presentation to govtBy Michael Taylor and Dennys KapaJAKARTA, Oct 8 Workers at Freeport-McMoRan Inc's  giant Indonesian copper mine are seeking face-to-face talks with local management following a fatal accident, and may plan a further mine blockade or strike action, a union official said.Hundreds of angry protestors blocked access for two days last week to the open-pit area of the Grasberg copper complex, where production has been halted following the death of four workers on Sept. 27. The open pit accounts for more than half of the mine's output.Fresh protests, blockades or strike action could be triggered if workers' safety concerns and other demands were ignored, said Albar Sabang, a senior official at a Freeport union, potentially hindering copper exports.""Production is important but safety is number one,"" Sabang told Reuters, adding that protesting workers had demanded a meeting on Oct. 11-12 with Freeport Indonesia CEO Rozik Soetjipto. ""If the demands are not met they will plan to do another protest,"" he said.The Indonesian government is investigating the accident, which involved a collision between a light vehicle carrying nine people and a haul truck, and has laid out a number of required work changes for open-pit mining to resume. Freeport has not responded to requests for comment, but the Arizona-based firm said in statements last week that it would work closely with the government accident investigation team and that safety at Grasberg is a priority.A tunnel collapse last year killed 28 workers at the mine in one of the country's worst mining disasters. Union officials say five people have now died at the mine this year following an earlier fatality.The Grasberg complex sits inside the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" and faces regular earthquakes, as well as torrential rainfall that can trigger landslides down steep slopes. The mine's position on top of a mountain means workers also have to cope with altitude sickness and poor visibility due to thick mist. IMPROVEMENTS DEMANDED A video on YouTube that purports to show the latest incident, shows a heavy duty hauling truck drive over a four-wheel drive vehicle at a bend in the road at the mine site.As a worker standing between the two vehicles runs to avoid the haulage truck, the four-wheel drive vehicle is crushed.The video could not be independently verified by Reuters. Workers at last week's protest complained that the company's management has put production ahead of worker safety.""I've only had one training session, which was at the beginning before I started working here,"" a worker who drives trucks similar to the one involved in the accident told Reuters. The worker declined to be named.At a news conference late on Tuesday, mines ministry officials said changes needed at the mine before open-pit activities could resume included retraining haulage truck drivers, more safety meetings, greater use of mobile communications, guidelines to increase traffic safety and maintaining mining facilities when production has stopped.Freeport officials are expected to outline planned safety changes at a meeting with the mine ministry on Thursday.""All our demands have a deadline so that the company will take them seriously,"" said Bambang Susigit, a senior mines ministry official.Freeport, one of the biggest tax payers in Southeast Asia's largest economy, only recently resolved a tax spat with the government that halted exports for months and frayed relations.Rio Tinto has a joint venture with Freeport for a 40 per cent share of Grasberg's production above specific levels until 2021, and 40 per cent of all production after 2021.

Sabang's union has about 9,100 members.""The purpose of the strike is of course to stop production so there will be pressure for the Freeport Indonesia management to answer to our demands,"" Sabang told Reuters by text message. Freeport, which employs around 24,000 workers, declined to comment on Monday. About three-quarters of the workforce belong to a union.Relations between Freeport and the unions have been strained in recent years following a three-month strike in late 2011 as well as a series of minor disputes.In addition to the four workers killed in the collision involving a truck last month, 28 people were killed after a tunnel collapsed in May last year. Indonesia's mine ministry investigated the Sept. 27 accident and asked the company to introduce changes to safety procedures and policies before allowing open-pit mining to resume.Three weeks ago, the Freeport Indonesia union warned of fresh protests, blockades or strike action if workers' safety concerns and other demands were ignored.A union letter detailing the planned strike was sent on Oct. 23 to Freeport's local CEO, Rozik Soetjipto, the chief executive and chairman of the Arizona-based firm and various government officials. Under normal conditions, the Grasberg open pit produces around 140,000 tonnes of copper ore per day and the underground mine about 80,000 tonnes.Although the copper market is broadly expected to be in surplus next year, one trader said, an extended strike could tighten regional concentrate supply, with the market not far from balanced at the moment. Freeport's concentrate is low in impurities.Freeport, one of the biggest tax payers in Southeast Asia's largest economy, only recently resolved a tax dispute with the government that halted exports for months and frayed relations.Should the Freeport strike go ahead as planned, it may be the first big test for Indonesia's newly appointed energy and mineral resources minister, Sudirman Said.(Additional reporting by Michael Taylor; Editing by Alan Raybould)",2014-10-27,FCX,"Mon Oct 27, 2014 | 5:29am EDT",UPDATE 1-Freeport Indonesia union plans one-month strike at copper mine,http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-freeport-unions-idUSL4N0SM2NV20141027?type=companyNews

The copper flowed inside and around the west side of the smelter building, part of the mining operation some 90 miles east of Phoenix. The accident set some infrastructure on fire.The smelter has capacity to produce 180,000 tonnes per year, about 14 percent of annual U.S. output. North American annual consumption of copper, used to make electrical wire and tubing, is about 2.3 million tonnes. The closure did not have an immediate impact on premiums CU-PREM, which are under pressure. U.S. demand remains relatively sluggish with the construction industry recovering slowly, and consumption is also slowing in China, the world's top end user.For now, Freeport may be able to make up for any shortfall from a relatively short shutdown, traders said. Its other smelter, Atlantic Copper, is in Spain. Still, the accident comes as traders report that Rio Tinto's  Kennecott copper plant in Utah, the country's No. 2 smelter, is operating at below capacity due to lower ore grades from its nearby mine.Freeport expects to sell about 1.8 million tonnes of copper this year, it said in a recent earnings report.The concentrate processed at Miami is almost exclusively sourced from Freeport's copper mines in Arizona and New Mexico, the spokesman said.

Freeport is considering sending concentrates to other smelters while repairs are underway. The company's other smelter, Atlantic Copper, is in Spain.A prolonged shutdown would raise concerns about supplies in the U.S. market of refined copper as Rio Tinto's   big smelter in Utah struggles with low ore grades. The shutdown comes at a critical time for the industry as companies that use copper to make wire and plumbing hammer out terms of next year's supply contracts.

104,"  * Agree 2015 TC/RC at $107/T, 10.7 cents/lb - sources* 2015 TC/RC in line with expectations, but lower than spot   (Adds quote, details)By Polly YamHONG KONG, Dec 10 U.S. miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc has agreed to pay 16.3 percent more in annual processing charges to large Chinese copper smelters in 2015, with the 10-year high fee likely to set the benchmark for China.The increase in charges is a clear signal that even miners accept copper will swing into surplus next year after five years of deficit. Expectations of swelling supply have hung over copper prices, which have fallen about 12 percent this year.Higher charges usually spur smelters to boost production, which would ease supply constraints in China and the rest of the world if smelters also ramp up exports. China's top integrated copper producer, Jiangxi Copper Company Ltd , and other large Chinese smelters have agreed with Freeport to term treatment and refining charges (TC/RC) of $107 per tonne and 10.7 cents per pound for copper concentrate shipments in 2015, three sources who have direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.That is up from $92 per tonne and 9.2 cents per pound for term shipments in 2014, which were 31 percent higher than for shipments in 2013.The 2015 charges, the highest since 2005, are for clean, standard copper concentrates to China. Freeport, which runs the world's second-biggest copper mine in Indonesia, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the charges.The agreed TC/RC were in line with the expected $100-$110 and 10-11 cents but lower than $110-$120 and 11-12 cents in the spot market in Asia this month.Miners pay TC/RCs to smelters to convert concentrate into refined metal, with charges deducted from the smelters' purchase prices. As the supply of concentrate increases, the demand for smelting capacity and the charges also rise, translating into higher profits for smelters.

105,"  HONG KONG Dec 10 Jiangxi Copper Company Ltd   and U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan  have agreed to term treatment and refining charges (TC/RC) of $107 per tonne and 10.7 cents per pound for copper concentrate shipments to the Chinese metal producer in 2015, two sources said on Wednesday.That is up 16.3 percent from $92 per tonne and 9.2 cents per pound for term shipments in 2014, seen AS the benchmark for Chinese smelters' imports of the raw material concentrate this year. Miners pay TC/RCs to smelters to convert concentrate into refined metal, with charges deducted from the smelters' purchase prices. The charges typically rise when supply increases as demand for smelting capacity to process concentrates climbs.

Freeport, the largest U.S. miner by market value and revenue, resumed processing copper concentrate at the site on Dec 7, said Eric Kinneberg.The company temporarily shut the smelter around Nov 13 after a fire broke out as molten copper breached a processing vessel and flowed onto the ground. There were no injuries. The smelter, part of the company's mining operations some 90 miles east of Phoenix, has capacity to produce 180,000 tonnes per year, about 14 percent of annual U.S. output. North American annual consumption of copper, used to make electrical wire and tubing, is about 2.3 million tonnes.Shares of Freeport were down 4 percent on Thursday, mirroring broad declines for mining stocks, closing at $22.98 on New York.

108,"   By Andy Home | LONDON  LONDON The bears are ascendant in the copper market. On the London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month metal has this month hit its lowest level since June 2010. Never mind that LME stocks are still low and tightly controlled by a dominant long position-holder. Never mind that the front part of the LME curve remains correspondingly tight with the cash-to-threes period still in backwardation to the tune of $60.50 per tonne as of Wednesday's valuations. The bears are betting all that will change as a surge in mine production travels down the supply chain to tilt the refined market into surplus. It was supposed to happen this year, but it didn't. Next year, though, the bears argue, will be different. It's a view apparently borne out by the terms of the copper concentrates supply deal between Freeport McMoRan and Chinese smelters. What looks set to be the ""benchmark"" for 2015 includes a treatment charge of $107 per tonne and a refining charge of 10.7 cents per lb. These charges, deducted from the copper price for the cost of converting raw material into metal, are the highest seen since the middle of 2005. The inference is that after years of famine the time of copper feast has finally arrived. But then that's what everyone thought this time last year. Could supply disappoint again next year? There are already plenty of warning signs that copper has lost none of its perennial ability to spring surprises on the unwary. <Graphic on ""benchmark"" annual concentrate treatment charges: link.reuters.com/wam63w>OLD PROBLEMS The first wall of new copper supply actually came in 2013, when mine production grew by 8 percent, according to the International Copper Study Group (ICSG). It was the fastest growth rate in many, many years.However, rather than rolling into 2014, that supply surge has faltered. At its October meeting the ICSG slashed its 2014 forecast growth figure from 4.7 percent to just 2.6 percent. That reflected major disruptions such as the temporary ban on concentrate exports from Indonesia, where production slumped by 20 percent in the first eight months of the year. Such disruptions had been a defining characteristic of the copper market up to 2013, a year when just about everything went right at the world's biggest copper mines.  That year, however, is looking increasingly like an outlier, because copper supply is showing every sign of reverting to its previous problematic norm. Analysts are already taking the red ink to their 2015 supply forecasts as key producers cut their guidance and unexpected outages accumulate. Rio Tinto, for example, has forecast a drop in output to 500,000-535,000 tonnes from a targeted 615,000 tonnes this year, mainly due to remediation work at its Kennecott Utah mine, which experienced a major landslide last year. BHP Billiton, meanwhile, has warned that grades will fall by 24 percent at its Escondida mine in Chile in its financial year running from July 2015 through June 2016. The company has been a bit coy with exact figures, saying it hopes to mitigate the grade hit with increased efficiencies. Moreover, the decline in grade will be temporary with production in 2015-2016 representing a low point for the next 10 years. But Escondida, remember, is the world's largest single mine and its period of low-grading will directly impact availability over the second half of next year. Freeport's Grasberg mine in Indonesia is still operating at just 80 percent of capacity. The flow of concentrate exports was resumed in August but a return to normal service has been hampered by worker protests following a fatal accident in October.Indeed, industrial unrest in the copper sector appears to be making a comeback after several years of relative calm. The Antamina mine in Peru is experiencing its second walk-out in the space of a month. Also making an unwelcome return for miners are unexpected hits such as a fire at the Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia, where this year's guidance had already been cut due to development delays, and a loss of power at Nevsun's Bisha mine in Eritrea.Analysts have got used to making an allowance for such disruption in their supply forecasts. The ICSG for one is still predicting 7.3-percent growth for 2015 after ""adjusting using historical disruption factors"". But it's still disconcerting that some of that disruption allowance is being filled even before the new year has actually started. NEW PROBLEMS Such is the stuff of copper markets past. But there is also a new factor in play, complicating the interaction between mined and refined production. Many of the new mines currently coming on stream are producing concentrates with high levels of impurities. Arsenic is a particularly problematic by-product given Chinese smelters face strict import restrictions on high-arsenic material. Codelco's Ministro Hales mine is the problem poster child of this new generation of ""dirty"" concentrates producers. The Chilean state-run company has been buying in ""clean"" concentrates for blending at a facility in Taiwan operated by concentrates trader Ocean Partners.Others are either doing the same or selling material to third-party traders for blending. The requirement to blend material before it can be sent to smelters has injected a totally new level of complexity into the copper supply chain. It is why that 2013 mine surge failed to translate into refined metal surge. Much of the extra supply simply went into building up stocks through the raw material supply chain, whether at blending operations or at smelters themselves. Whether the resulting ""bottle-neck"" was a one-off or will be a continuing feature of the copper supply picture is a hotly-disputed topic among analysts right now. At the very least it will complicate an already non-linear flow-through from mine availability to refined metal availability.ELUSIVE SURPLUS? It would still be a brave analyst to forecast anything other than concentrates surplus and resulting refined metal surplus next year. But the figures are already being whittled lower. And as they are, the expected cushion against further disruption grows thinner. Of course there are other factors in the bearish mix pressuring the copper price lower, not least concern about slowing growth in China, the world's engine-room of copper consumption. But supply surge is the drum-beat to which the bears are marching. It's now up to the miners to deliver that surge and all the recent evidence suggests it's not going to be as straightforward as many assume. Surplus has been a curiously elusive thing in the copper market over the last couple of years and it might not be the racing certainty that many expect for next year either.

119,"  * Copper down 12 percent, iron loses 5 percent on the year* Metals price move makes Rio more expensive for Glencore* Anglo, Antofagasta, Kaz, also hard hit by copper slumpBy Silvia AntonioliLONDON, Jan 14 A sudden plunge in the price of copper pulled the shares of global miner Glencore to their lowest level on record on Wednesday and risks frustrating any intention to make a fresh move on larger rival Rio Tinto.Copper prices slid to their lowest in 5-1/2 years after a downward revision to global growth forecasts by the World Bank and shares in Glencore lost as much as 12 percent to 236.20 pence on Wednesday.. Glencore, among the large diversified miners, has the largest exposure to copper.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  BREAKINGVIEWS-Copper collapse accurately indicates globalpain^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>If sustained, the steeper fall in copper prices compared with that of iron ore so far this year, might derail any potential move by Glencore to take over Australian miner Rio Tinto , which is heavily exposed to iron ore. After Glencore's first takeover approach was rebuffed by Rio last summer, the market was widely expecting Swiss-based Glencore to make another attempt this year.The steeper fall last year in prices of iron compared with base metals made Rio a more affordable target for Glencore.That has been partially reversed this year. Copper has lost almost 12 percent of its value, while iron ore has lost less than 5 percent""The fall in copper prices makes it much harder for Glencore to take over Rio as the share exchange ratio is not in their favour,"" said London-based analyst Paul Gait at Bernstein Research. ""The issue is that Glencore's commodity mix hasn't played in its favour in the last few weeks and Rio is looking more expensive as a consequence.""Gait however, like many other analysts, thought fundamentals for copper looked much better that those of iron ore and expected this situation to be short-lived.Glencore's stock, first listed in London in 2011, was the worst loser among the blue-chip FTSE-100 companies on Wednesday, indicated down 11.5 percent at 238.05 pence at 1345 GMT.The second biggest loser was Anglo American, with the second-largest exposure to copper among the diversified miners. Its shares were down 10 percent at 10.31 pounds.Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton , with smaller exposure to copper, were down 6 and 8 percent, respectively.Other stocks battered by the steep fall in copper prices were pure copper miners such as Kaz Minerals, a relatively high-cost producer in Kazakhstan which lost more than 22 percent, Chile's Antofagasta down more than 6 percent and First Quantum, down more than 7 percent.

122,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Freeport-McMoRan Inc agreed on Thursday to pay $137.5 million to resolve a lawsuit claiming executives and directors had conflicts of interest that caused the natural resources company to overpay significantly for two oil and gas companies in 2013.The accord resolves shareholder derivative litigation over Freeport's purchases of Plains Exploration & Production Co and McMoRan Exploration Co for roughly $9 billion.Shareholders led by a group of pension funds and union-owned Amalgamated Bank will receive settlement funds, net of unspecified legal fees and other costs, as a special dividend.Freeport also agreed to take steps to ensure director independence, including appointing a lead independent director, and limit ""golden parachutes"" to departing executives in future acquisitions.A Delaware Chancery Court judge will consider approval of the settlement at a March 16 hearing.In a regulatory filing, Freeport said its insurers will cover $115 million of the payout under its director and officer liability policies, with the remainder funded by the Phoenix-based company.

125,"   By Reynolds Holding and Kevin Allison | NEW YORK/CHICAGO  NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - F reeport-McMoRan's M&A tab isn't fully settled yet. The company did agree to write a $138 million check to shareholders to resolve a lawsuit over two conflict-riddled acquisitions. That should turn up the heat on James ""Jim Bob"" Moffett, chairman of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, whose cross-holdings factored in the case. Better governance would enhance the big payout.The $19 billion U.S. miner agreed in 2012 to shell out some $9 billion for McMoRan Exploration and Plains Exploration & Production. Investors cried foul, in part because Moffett presided over Freeport's board while also serving as chief executive and co-chairman of McMoRan Exploration, alongside Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson. Moffett also owned stakes in both companies while Plains boss James Flores was a member of McMoRan's board.Aggrieved shareholders secured a deal on Thursday that will provide them a special dividend. That's unusual, because such cases are technically filed on behalf of the company against the board, and investors typically end up with nothing. What's more, M&A lawsuits generally yield very little in the way of shareholder compensation.Even in this case, Freeport says insurance will cover the cost of the settlement. While company officials deny any wrongdoing, the sum involved is among the highest ever in a so-called derivative lawsuit, and is bound to spur similar claims against other companies.Freeport's own shareholders could even be empowered to seek more still from the board. Since 2012, the company has added four new independent directors and sharply cut compensation for its top three executives. It also agreed to limit golden parachutes and take additional steps to ensure director independence as part of the settlement. Freeport nevertheless operates under a questionable governance structure: Moffett, Adkerson and Flores preside as a triumvirate known as The Office of the Chairman. The arrangement suggests the technical separation of the chairman and CEO roles is just a fig leaf. And the conflicts underscored by the lawsuit make it tough for Freeport to argue it deserves to be a governance exception. A strong push to make that point would be a good use of newfound shareholder clout.

On Wednesday it was dragged to its lowest since mid-2009 at $5,353.25, the biggest one-day percentage drop in more than three years.Copper found support from news that the Chinese State Grid plans to boost investment by 24 percent this year, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.""The aggressive targets announced reinforce our expectation of strong copper (and aluminium) demand growth from the Chinese power sector,"" Citi analyst Ivan Szpakowski said in a note.""Chinese copper demand should outperform overall economic growth in 2015 and help drive higher copper prices from Q1 lows.""The metals complex also received support from news that China's central bank will increase its relending quota by 50 billion yuan ($8 billion) this year.""Infrastructure projects have been fast-tracked in China and there are other positive comments coming out of there as well, which has helped (lift copper).

""Our expectation is the board is going to take steps to preserve our liquidity as we go forward,"" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said on a conference call.But he added: ""We all want to keep the dividend and we're going to work hard to try to do it.""Earlier Freeport, which has copper mines in the Americas, Africa and Indonesia and oil and gas assets in the United States, reported a bigger-than-expected fall in fourth-quarter earnings. Its shares fell 5 percent. Freeport has been trying to reduce its debt, which ballooned in 2013 after it acquired two oil and gas companies and stood at $19 billion at end-December. It had previously set a debt target of $12 billion by the end of 2016.Adkerson said that ""under these commodity prices those targets are unrealistic"" although debt reduction remained a priority. Sales of non-core assets have also been on the table as a way to cut debt. Adkerson's list of core assets - defined as those with significant undeveloped resources - did not include its two New Mexico copper mines, Chino and Tyrone, which he described as ""older"" on the conference call.Phoenix-based Freeport also said it is in talks to raise $900 million of capex for its Holstein and Heidelberg deepwater oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico through joint ventures with investors who would take equity stakes in the projects. Overall, Freeport pegged 2015 capital expenditure at about $6 billion, down about $1.2 billion from 2014, mainly due to a 34 percent cut in oil and gas spending.  It booked net charges of $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, related chiefly to goodwill impairment on its oil and gas assets, leading to a net loss of $2.85 billion, or $2.75 per share. Excluding one-time items, fourth-quarter earnings were 25 cents a share, below the 35 cents a share that analysts were expecting.

136,"  NEW YORK Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said on Tuesday he expects relatively tight supplies due to mine delays, falling ore grades and spending cuts to support copper prices even as the market remains in oversupply this year.In a conference call with analysts following the release of fourth-quarter earnings, he said the relentless sell-off in crude oil has dragged the copper market into its biggest rout in years, rather than a deterioration in the supply and demand outlook.The fundamentals of its business remains ""relatively strong"", he said.

But he added: ""We all want to keep the dividend and we're going to work hard to try to do it.""Earlier Freeport, which has copper mines in the Americas, Africa and Indonesia and oil and gas assets in the United States, reported a bigger-than-expected fall in fourth-quarter earnings. Its shares fell 5 percent.Freeport has been trying to reduce its debt, which ballooned in 2013 after it acquired two oil and gas companies and stood at $19 billion at end-December. It had previously set a debt target of $12 billion by the end of 2016. Adkerson said that ""under these commodity prices those targets are unrealistic"" although debt reduction remained a priority.Sales of non-core assets have also been on the table as a way to cut debt. Adkerson's list of core assets - defined as those with significant undeveloped resources - did not include its two New Mexico copper mines, Chino and Tyrone, which he described as ""older"" on the conference call. Phoenix-based Freeport also said it is in talks to raise $900 million of capex for its Holstein and Heidelberg deepwater oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico through joint ventures with investors who would take equity stakes in the projects.Overall, Freeport pegged 2015 capital expenditure at about $6 billion, down about $1.2 billion from 2014, mainly due to a 34 percent cut in oil and gas spending.It booked net charges of $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, related chiefly to goodwill impairment on its oil and gas assets, leading to a net loss of $2.85 billion, or $2.75 per share.Excluding one-time items, fourth-quarter earnings were 25 cents a share, below the 35 cents a share that analysts were expecting.

It hit a 5-1/2-year low of $5,339.50 a tonne on Monday.The U.S. central bank is expected to signal it remains on track to begin raising interest rates later this year.Fed policymakers will likely restate their ""patient"" approach to raising rates, while also voicing faith that the economy will continue to pick up.The dollar was steady, easing off earlier highs, before the Fed statement. A weak dollar makes commodities priced in the currency cheaper for holders of other currencies.""If the Fed does emphasise the word ""patience"" then it could take some more wind out of the dollar rally which is a positive sign for copper,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Ava Trade. ""(However)... we do believe that today's event may have no firecrackers and perhaps copper will continue its trend towards the downside as supply dominates over demand.""Highlighting high levels of supplies, copper stocks in LME warehouses rose by 6,450 tonnes to 244,675 tonnes, their highest level in more than nine months.

144,"  JAKARTA Feb 16 Indonesia has dropped its demand that Freeport-McMoran Inc build a $1.5 billion copper smelter in Papua province, saying a regionally owned enterprise would take on the project instead, website Detik.com reported, quoting the mining minister.The ministry in December said Arizona-based Freeport, which runs the world's fifth-largest copper mine in Indonesia, should agree to build the Papua smelter in five years if it wanted a mining contract extension beyond 2021.The latest decision could ease pressure on Freeport, which has already agreed to a $2.3-billion expansion by 2017 of its copper smelting facility in East Java, currently the only one in the country.The government has been pushing the company to comply with rules that force miners to process and refine minerals domestically.""If Freeport is burdened in two locations it would be uneconomical,"" Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Sudirman Said said on Sunday, according to the Detik website.A regionally owned enterprise would build the Papua smelter and could team up with other investors on the project, the ministry said in a document obtained by Reuters. An investor from China has already approached the Papua administration, Detik's report cited Said as saying, without providing details.""A smelter on its own is not economical so we are building an (industrial) zone to make it more attractive,"" Said said. A ministry spokesman was not immediately available to confirm the comments.The 650-hectare industrial zone in Papua's Mimika area is not far from Freeport's concentrate pipeline and already has a port and eletrical infrastructure, according to the document.The zone will also include a cement packaging plant, a liquefied petroleum gas filling plant, a fertilizer plant and a petrochemicals plant. ""This is a win-win solution,"" Said said, adding that Freeport would be contractually required to supply copper concentrate to the Papua smelter.""Whoever is tasked to build the smelter in Papua, Freeport Indonesia will form a business-to-business contract with them to supply concentrate,"" Freeport Indonesia CEO Maroef Sjamsuddin said in the document.Freeport is expected to produce 2 million tonnes of copper concentrate from its Indonesian operations in 2015, up from 1.4 million tonnes in 2014.Indonesia aims to develop 4.5 million tonnes of copper concentrate processing capacity nationally, Said said, up from 1.2 million tonnes at present.

""What they request is compensation (more payment) from management because they had worked, while others who joined the union didn't work at the previous demonstration but still got paid. So they request for fairness,"" Bambang Susigit said in a text message to Reuters.It is not known whether production at the mine has been hurt, but Susigit added that workers had been hindered from accessing Grasberg. Any disruption to copper supplies could support benchmark metal prices that have dropped more than 8 percent so far this year. ""There are more than 300 people,"" Susigit said about the protest. ""Access to workers to the site is closed. There is now negotiations to allow site and mill maintenance workers to pass through the protest.""Freeport Indonesia, which employs around 24,000 workers and is expected to produce 43 percent more copper concentrate this year at 2 million tonnes, could not be reached for a comment on Tuesday. On Monday, company spokeswoman Daisy Primayanti said they had received a report of an employee demonstration ""resulting in a disruption of mine road access at the area of Mile 74"", adding that talks were being conducted to find the reasons.""The current security condition in our operation area remains under control,"" she told Reuters in an email.Albar Sabang, a senior Freeport union official, told Reuters on Monday that the protest had not been arranged by unions so the reasons behind it were not known.Relations between Freeport and the workers' unions have been strained in recent years.

169,"  (Recasts with possible oil and gas IPO, adds executive comment from conference call, growth outlook for oil and gas business)By Susan TaylorTORONTO, April 23 Freeport-McMoRan Inc  is mulling a public offering of its oil and gas business to help kick-start production growth for its energy business, along with joint ventures or asset sales, the diversified miner said on Thursday.Despite a $2.4 billion writedown of its oil and gas properties in the first-quarter, contributing to a $2.5 billion net loss, Freeport said the outlook is promising due to strong drilling results, a deep exploration inventory, and low costs.The Phoenix-based company said it would keep a majority stake in any spin-off, which could occur this autumn, if it proves the cheapest, most beneficial form of capital. Weighted by a $20.3 billion debt load, Freeport has been studying several options to secure capital but found joint venture and private equity ""very expensive"", Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said.""We're exploring the external option of the IPO - to accelerate that (oil and gas) business so it comes self-funding faster,"" he said on a conference call.With no additional funding, Freeport expects oil and gas production to grow from about 143,000 barrels a day in 2015 to 173,000 in 2017. With capital, 2017 output could reach 217,000 barrels per day, it said. Freeport's debt, up from $19 billion at the end of December, ballooned with its 2013 acquisition of two oil and natural gas producers, as it diversified its business beyond copper, gold and molybdenum mining.Earlier this year, Freeport slashed its dividend by 84 percent, abandoned plans to reduce debt to $12 billion by the end of 2016 and said it was in talks to raise $900 million for oil projects through joint ventures. Calling 2015 a ""bridge year"", before spending slows and commodity production picks up, Freeport boosted its full-year capital spending on oil and gas operations by $500 million to $2.8 million and maintained a $2.5 billion budget for mining projects.Full-year sales of copper are seen at 4.2 billion pounds, down from 4.3 billion pounds. Gold sales are seen at 1.3 million ounces, molybdenum at 95 million pounds, and oil at 52.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, down from 55.5 million barrels due to a production delay at Lucius and maintenance at Deepwater.Excluding one-time charges, Freeport reported a loss of 6 cents a share.

Both slid to six-year lows earlier, slashing $1.8 billion in market value from Freeport and C$600 million ($460 million) from Teck. Freeport said Thursday its debt rose 3 percent in the June quarter.""With a debt load of $20.9 billion and a market cap of $15.7 billion, it's out of line,"" said Maison Placements Canada Chief Executive John Ing.Freeport's stock slide reflects ""the lack of any plan to really de-lever the balance sheet in any significant way,"" said  BB&T Capital Markets analyst Garrett Nelson.  On Monday, shares of Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), the most levered North American gold producer, plunged 16 percent when bullion fell to five-year lows. The most significant change for the gold sector over the past four years is climbing debt levels at North American producers, RBC Capital Markets analyst Stephen Walker said in a note.Large gold producers hold $19 billion in debt, he estimated, equal to 61 percent of their combined market value. Despite Teck's better-than-expected quarterly profits, investors worry about the Canadian miner's C$2.9 billion contribution to the Fort Hills oil sands project and a possible writedown of its coal assets due to weak prices, Haywood Securities analyst Kerry Smith said.There are also concerns that Teck's credit rating could fall below investment grade.On Thursday, copper dropped to new two-week lows of $5,267.50 a tonne and gold hit new five-year lows of $1,086 an ounce.

That exceeded its market value of $15.7 billion.The slide in its stock is due to ""the lack of any plan to really de-lever the balance sheet in any significant way,"" said  Garrett Nelson, analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. ""The companies that are more highly levered have underperformed and should continue to underperform,"" he said.Despite a better-than-expected quarterly profit by Teck, investors worried about the Canadian-based diversified miner's hefty capital commitments on the Fort Hills oil sands project and a possible writedown of its coal assets, Haywood Securities analyst Kerry Smith said. In 2015 Teck's share of cash spending on Fort Hills, which is owned by two other partners, is around C$850 million ($653.59 million).Commodity prices, including copper, coal and gold have continued to slide in recent weeks. Copper fell to new two-week lows on Thursday of $5,267.50 a tonne, or $2.39 a pound.

182,"  TORONTO/JAKARTA Shares of diversified miner and energy producer Freeport-McMoRan sank for a second session on Friday, as uncertainty around Indonesian mining contracts added to worries about spending plans, high debt and falling commodity prices.The Phoenix, Arizona-based company has assured analysts it fully expects the Indonesian government to issue a six-month export renewal on Saturday, when the current permit expires.According to the Indonesian government, however, the firm still needs to show its commitment to building a second copper smelting facility by setting aside an estimated $80 million into an escrow account.""They haven't completed the terms,"" Coal and Minerals director general Bambang Gatot told reporters late on Friday, adding that his next meeting with executives is on Monday. It was not immediately clear if Freeport's exports would be stopped.""It depends what happens in the field,"" Gatot said. ""The port may still allow them.""Questions also remain surrounding its longer-term contract.Freeport's stock tumbled 10 percent to $12.27 on New York on Friday, after a 9 percent drop Thursday, as several analysts cut price targets.Over the past two days, Freeport's market capitalization has shed some $2.9 billion, dropping to $12.75 billion on Friday afternoon from $15.66 billion at the close Wednesday. Freeport, whose chairman is currently in Indonesia for talks with the government, is also negotiating terms of a contract or license that could extend to 2041. Contract certainty is crucial, Freeport said, because it will spend $15 billion on an underground expansion at its massive Grasberg copper and gold mine, and must commit to a new smelter, estimated at $2 billion-$2.5 billion.""Right now, more than 75 percent of our reserves are going to be produced after 2021,"" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said on a conference call Thursday.  A current contract of work expires in 2021, but by law in Indonesia they cannot extend this contract until 2019 at the soonest.Freeport is looking to raise funds as it eyes a $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion investment to boost energy production.Analysts worry there may be a weak appetite for a planned initial public offering of up to 20 percent of Freeport's oil and gas business this autumn. All options are on the table, said Freeport, which will consider asset sales, but does not favor an equity raise. ""None of us want to issue equity at these levels,"" Adkerson said.

185,"   By Nicole Mordant  Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) may cut output at its small North American copper and molybdenum mines to help it reduce costs, analysts said on Tuesday after the miner and oil producer announced a cost and spending review amid weak commodity prices.Freeport, the biggest U.S.-listed copper miner, said it is reviewing its mining and oil and gas businesses for significant additional cuts in capital spending and operating costs because of weak prices for copper, molybdenum, oil and gold.Shares in Arizona-based Freeport leapt on the announcement, and were last up 9.4 percent at $12.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost half its value this year on concerns about Freeport's heavy debt load and a slide in copper prices to six-year lows. Copper was last bid at $5,305 a tonne, or $2.41 a pound.  Freeport may reduce production at some of its North American operations as it did in 2008-2009 to cut costs, Morningstar analyst Daniel Rohr said. ""There are some smaller mines that would probably struggle at, say, $2.30 copper,"" he said. Molybdenum is produced as a by-product at some of the copper mines.Freeport does not give data for costs at individual mines. The net cash cost for producing a pound of copper was $1.74 at its suite of North American mines in the three months to the end of June. The net cash cost for a pound of copper was 81 cents at the company's Indonesian operations, $1.07 at its Tenke mine in Africa and $1.90 in its South American operations.  Freeport aims to complete this review ""promptly"" and report back on its plans in the third quarter. Company spokesman Eric Kinneberg declined to comment further.Output cuts are going to be the ""general theme in most commodity markets over the next year,"" said Ed Meir, metals analyst at INTL FCStone. Although the cost and spending reductions are a step in the right direction, investors are likely to continue to focus on Freeport's heavy $20.9 billion debt load, Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina said in a note to clients. LaFemina said the real solution for Freeport would be to issue equity.

186,"  (Recasts with analyst comments, cost data, background)By Nicole MordantJuly 28 Freeport-McMoRan Inc may cut output at its small North American copper and molybdenum mines to help it reduce costs, analysts said on Tuesday after the miner and oil producer announced a cost and spending review amid weak commodity prices.Freeport, the biggest U.S.-listed copper miner, said it is reviewing its mining and oil and gas businesses for significant additional cuts in capital spending and operating costs because of weak prices for copper, molybdenum, oil and gold.Shares in Arizona-based Freeport leapt on the announcement, and were last up 9.4 percent at $12.44 on the New York Stock Exchange.The stock has lost half its value this year on concerns about Freeport's heavy debt load and a slide in copper prices to six-year lows. Copper was last bid at $5,305 a tonne, or $2.41 a pound. Freeport may reduce production at some of its North American operations as it did in 2008-2009 to cut costs, Morningstar analyst Daniel Rohr said.""There are some smaller mines that would probably struggle at, say, $2.30 copper,"" he said. Molybdenum is produced as a by-product at some of the copper mines.Freeport does not give data for costs at individual mines. The net cash cost for producing a pound of copper was $1.74 at its suite of North American mines in the three months to the end of June. The net cash cost for a pound of copper was 81 cents at the company's Indonesian operations, $1.07 at its Tenke mine in Africa and $1.90 in its South American operations.Freeport aims to complete this review ""promptly"" and report back on its plans in the third quarter. Company spokesman Eric Kinneberg declined to comment further. Output cuts are going to be the ""general theme in most commodity markets over the next year,"" said Ed Meir, metals analyst at INTL FCStone.Although the cost and spending reductions are a step in the right direction, investors are likely to continue to focus on Freeport's heavy $20.9 billion debt load, Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina said in a note to clients.LaFemina said the real solution for Freeport would be to issue equity. He noted that the window of opportunity for a previously announced initial offering of a minority stake in its oil and gas business may have closed.""A dilutive equity issuance would probably be a positive for the Freeport stock price as it would shift the market's focus back from balance sheet to P&L (profit and loss) statement,"" he said.

Gresik has been closed due to a technical problem since June 19.It was unclear on Friday whether production at Grasberg was running at full capacity, although Solossa said that the U.S. mining giant sent a letter to employees on Aug. 20 asking for greater efficiency and emphasizing the need for cost-saving.

206,"  * Freeport Indonesia cuts 2015 copper sales by 25 mln pounds* Grasberg exports already hurt by new rules, smelter closure* Govt to push ahead with changes to contract renewal   (Adds copper price, additional comments/details)By Michael TaylorJAKARTA, Sept 10 Freeport-McMoRan has revised down its 2015 forecast for copper concentrate sales from its Indonesian unit by 3 percent, an official at the U.S. mining giant said, after milling operations were hurt by the El Nino dry weather pattern.Freeport, which runs one of the world's largest copper mines in Papua in eastern Indonesia, said a lack of water supply would cut its 2015 sales by 25 million pounds from an earlier sales estimate of 860 million pounds for the year. ""During the third quarter, milling operations have been impacted by a reduction in process water available under current El Nino conditions,"" company spokesman Eric Kinneberg said in an email late on Wednesday.Indonesia is expected to face moderate El Nino conditions from July to November, affecting provinces from Sumatra to eastern Indonesia, although the weather pattern could strengthen from September to December.An intensifying El Nino is also impacting Ok Tedi Mining Ltd's Papua New Guinea copper mine, which a company executive said earlier this month is likely to stay shuttered until the first quarter of 2016. The past month has also seen a stream of output cuts at copper mines in response to prices mired at six-year lows.Any lengthy disruptions to supplies could support benchmark copper prices that have fallen around 15 percent so far this year and currently trade at about $5,340 a tonne.""It helps protect the downside, but if we see a deceleration in China, it won't stop prices going down to the $4,500 range,"" said Dominic Schnider of UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong, referring to Freeport. Exports from Freeport Indonesia's Grasberg mine complex in remote Papua have already been hindered this quarter by new payment rules for buyers and the closure of the company's domestic smelter.Freeport Indonesia usually produces about 220,000 tonnes of copper ore per day, which is then converted to copper concentrate. Kinneberg declined to provide daily output details for the mine.Union officials said last week that Freeport sent a letter to employees on Aug. 20 asking for greater efficiency and emphasizing the need for cost-saving.On Thursday, Indonesia's energy and mines minister said the government plans to push ahead with changes that would allow miners to seek an earlier renewal of expiring mining contracts.Freeport has for years been seeking contract certainty before investing the more than $15 billion needed to turn its Indonesia asset into the world's biggest underground mine after 2016.

Freeport, the biggest listed U.S. copper producer, said it is looking at separating its oil and gas business from its mining operations - potentially unraveling an expensive oil and gas acquisition made in 2013 that has proved unpopular with shareholders.Splitting the Phoenix-based company could be done through a spin-off of the oil and gas business to shareholders, Freeport said. It repeated that it was also considering joint ventures or an initial public offering for the business.Freeport's shares rose 4.1 percent to $11.65 in New York.Splitting up the company ""is definitely what shareholders want,"" said Adrian Day, chief executive of Maryland-based Adrian Day Asset Management, which owns shares in Freeport.""As a copper company it is a world-leading copper company. It is definitely not a world-leading oil and gas company. They should focus on what they are doing best,"" Day said.Freeport's energy unit includes assets in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, onshore and offshore assets in California and in the Haynesville natural gas shale formation, along with other natural gas assets in Louisiana. Icahn, who owned 8.8 percent of Freeport as of Sept. 22, revealed his stake in the company in August and took aim at its spending, capital structure and executive compensation.The company said it has cut the size of its board from sixteen to nine members, with five of those departing joining a board focused on the oil and gas unit.The separation of the oil and gas segment would leave Freeport with mainly copper and gold mining assets. Roughly 60 percent of Freeport's $21 billion of revenue in 2014 came from copper, with about 20 percent from oil. Freeport's big foray into oil and gas came in 2013 with the acquisitions of Plains Exploration and McMoRan Exploration for $9 billion - moves that were big contributors to the company's heavy debt load of $20.9 billion. Since the purchase, oil prices [LCOc1] have slid some 50 percent.  The acquisition also raised eyebrows because McMoRan's largest individual shareholder and chief executive, James Moffett, was also the chairman of Freeport.Freeport agreed in January to pay $137.5 million to resolve a shareholder lawsuit alleging the acquisitions were overpriced and tainted.Finding partners for its oil and gas assets in today's weak energy market could be tough.

219,"   By Susan Taylor | TORONTO  TORONTO U.S. energy and mining company Freeport-McMoRan Inc said on Thursday it has been assured by the government of Indonesia that the mining contract for its giant Grasberg copper and gold mine will be extended beyond 2021.The pledge was seen as a promising development for Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport, which is under pressure from billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn and slumping commodity prices.The development is modestly positive because it indicates the two sides are holding constructive talks, said Clarksons Platou Securities analyst Jeremy Sussman, who added that details on terms would be needed to better assess the arrangement.Shares were up 1.7 percent to $13.24, after climbing more than 10 percent on Wednesday, when Freeport said two Icahn appointees were added to its board of directors.Freeport declined to provide details on the current terms of its contract, spending plans or the expected timing of a formal deal with the government. Freeport, the biggest listed U.S. copper producer, said the Indonesian government is working on economic stimulus measures, including revisions to mining regulations.Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources said in a letter to Freeport that the government would not ""unreasonably withhold or delay approval"" the contract extension. The company can submit its proposal for Grasberg, one of the world's biggest copper mines, after regulatory amendments governing coal and mineral resources are completed. Freeport must commit to continuing its $18 billion investment in the country when the contract extension is approved, said the letter from Minister Sudirman Said.   Freeport, which has been trying for years to obtain a contract extension, plans to transition Grasberg from open pit  to underground mining in late 2017. Production is expected to ramp up over several years to process approximately 240,000 tonnes of ore daily.  Rio Tinto has a joint venture with Freeport for a 40 per cent share of Grasberg's production above specific levels until 2021, then 40 per cent of all production after 2021.    The promise of an extension reflects Freeport's previous agreement to higher royalties, domestic processing and divestment, the company said in a statement.

Freeport declined to provide details on the current terms of its contract, spending plans or the expected timing of a formal deal with the government.Freeport, the biggest listed U.S. copper producer, said the Indonesian government is working on economic stimulus measures, including revisions to mining regulations.

Freeport, which has been trying for years to obtain a contract extension, plans to transition Grasberg from open pit  to underground mining in late 2017. Production is expected to ramp up over several years to process approximately 240,000 tonnes of ore daily.Rio Tinto has a joint venture with Freeport for a 40 per cent share of Grasberg's production above specific levels until 2021, then 40 per cent of all production after 2021.The promise of an extension reflects Freeport's previous agreement to higher royalties, domestic processing and divestment, the company said in a statement.The government currently has a 9.4 percent stake in Freeport's Indonesian unit and the company must propose a plan to increase that stake by Oct. 14.

231,"  JAKARTA Dec 3 The head of the Freeport McMoRan Inc's Indonesian unit, a former deputy at the state intelligence agency, told a parliament ethics probe he secretly recorded a meeting with the house speaker discussing the U.S. miner's divestment obligations to the government.Freeport, operator of the giant Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia's Papua province, is a key source of resource revenue for the country, and the issue of its operations and contract is politically sensitive.Speaker Setya Novanto, a member of the Golkar Party, is at the centre of a controversy related to efforts by the copper mining giant to comply with Indonesia's divestment rules and gain an extension to its contract.Golkar, the party that longtime president Suharto used as his political and elections vehicle, supported President Joko Widodo's opponent in the country's 2014 presidential election. Freeport Indonesia CEO Maroef Sjamsoeddin told the ethics council he met speaker Novanto along with businessman Reza Chalid at their request to discuss business at a Jakarta hotel in May and June.""I took the initiative to record it ... because I was by myself and there was two of (them). I needed this to be accountable to guard my mandate to this company,"" Sjamsoeddin said on Thursday, adding that he'd used his phone to record his last meeting with the pair. Novanto and Chalid attempted to convince Maroef they were acting on behalf of the president and vice president to acquire a 20 percent stake in the company and interests in its Papua operations, and would help facilitate contract extension negotiations, Sjamsoeddin said.""The parliament speaker and his friend Reza told me they wanted a 20 percent stake and also asked for a hydroelectric power project,"" he said. The pair said they were working with chief security minister Luhut Pandjaitan and also wanted to be involved in a planned smelter project, Sjamsoeddin added. Reza Chalid, Setya Novanto and Luhut Pandjaitan did not answer calls or respond immediately to requests for comment on the matter.While the government has said the controversy will not affect Freeport's divestment, if Novanto loses his powerful post as speaker it could alter the balance of power in parliament, potentially benefiting Widodo who has not held majority control over the legislature since he took office in late 2014.Sjamsoeddin also said the attorney general's office was investigating the case and had requested his phone and the recordings as evidence.

Molybdenum output will be reduced by another 14 million pounds. This brings total annual reductions to 350 million pounds of copper and 34 million pounds of molybdenum. The moves come a day after global mining group Anglo American Plc said it would slash 85,000 jobs and sell 60 percent of its assets while also suspending its dividend as it tries to cope with weak commodity prices.Freeport's actions are ""a necessary evil in the current environment"", Cowen and Co analyst Anthony Rizzuto said in a note to clients. Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport - under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn who bought an 8.5 percent stake in the miner in August - also said it was looking at the potential sale of minority interests in certain mining assets to provide funds to reduce debt.The company, whose operations include the massive Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, the Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru and seven copper mines in North America, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on which assets could be up for sale. While declining to speculate on which assets could be on the block, Clarksons Platou Securities analyst Jeremy Sussman said there is still appetite among the world's biggest miners for expanding their copper operations.""Most of the larger companies prefer large, low-cost, Tier 1, maybe Tier 2 assets in safer jurisdictions.

237,"   By Mike Stone  Dec 23 Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the U.S. miner that was targeted by activist investor Carl Icahn earlier this year, is planning to run an auction process for its oil and gas assets in early 2016, according to people familiar with the matter.The process would be the company's first concrete move to end its ill-fated foray into oil and gas after it said in October it would explore strategic options for the assets, including a spinoff, joint venture or public offering.Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport-McMoRan's board has retained investment bank Lazard Ltd to advise on possible sale of the company's entire oil and gas interests, which could be worth more than $3 billion, the people said this week.The sale process may not result in any deal, the people said. It will, however, help Freeport-McMoRan with valuing the assets, so it can decide which strategic alternative offers the most value, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Freeport-McMoRan and Lazard declined to comment.Freeport's big bet on oil and gas came in 2013 with the acquisitions of Plains Exploration and McMoRan Exploration for $19 billion, including debt. The moves were big contributors to the company's heavy debt load. Since these acquisitions, oil prices have roughly halved. Freeport-McMoRan's energy division includes assets in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, onshore and offshore assets in California and in the Haynesville natural gas shale formation, along with other natural gas assets in Louisiana.Shedding the oil and gas business would leave Freeport-McMoRan with mainly copper and gold mining assets. Roughly 60 percent of Freeport's $21 billion of revenue in 2014 came from copper, with about 20 percent from oil. The company's operations include the massive Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, the Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru and seven copper mines in North America.Freeport-McMoRan agreed in October to add two new directors to its board as part of a deal with Icahn, who had taken aim at the company's spending, capital structure and executive compensation.Earlier this month, Freeport-McMoRan suspended its annual dividend and made deeper cuts in capital spending and copper production to deal with a downturn in commodities prices that has entered its fifth year.

239,"  Shares of copper miner and oil producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc fell by as much as 20 percent on Monday, hammered by the twin blows of a slump in copper prices to six-year lows and weaker oil prices. Ratings agency Fitch also downgraded Freeport's rating on Friday night, citing its expectations for a prolonged slump in commodity prices and the company's high debt levels.Shares of Freeport, the biggest listed U.S. copper producer, fell as low as $4.31 in New York in morning trade, its weakest level since December 2000. It was last trading at $4.43, down 18.1 percent. Shares of other copper miners, including First Quantum Minerals, and oil producers were also weaker but Freeport's outsized debt levels makes it a riskier investment and hence its stock fall was deeper. First Quantum's shares were down 10 percent.  Freeport's ""enterprise value could be down the exact same amount (as other copper mines) but because they have so much debt on their books it gets magnified on the equity side,"" said Morningstar analyst Daniel Rohr.At 16.5 times, Freeport has one of the highest net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization(EBITDA) ratios of any of the world's miners, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Fitch downgraded Freeport's issuer default rating to ""BBB-"" from ""BBB"".Copper prices plummeted to their lowest in 6-1/2 years on Monday as large losses in Chinese equity markets reinforced tarnished prospects for growth and demand in the world's biggest consumer of industrial metals.

243,"  (Adds comment from Freeport head office spokesman, background on stock price)JAKARTA Jan 18 The chief executive of Freeport McMoRan Inc's Indonesian unit, Maroef Sjamsuddin, has resigned for ""personal reasons"", a company spokesman said on Monday, less than a month after the chairman of the U.S. mining giant stepped down.Freeport, which operates one of the world's largest copper and gold mines in Indonesia's far-eastern Papua region, is a key source of resource revenue for the country, and the issue of its operations and contract to operate are politically sensitive.Sjamsuddin's resignation, after only a year in the job, follows an inquiry into the Indonesian parliamentary speaker that he spearheaded, which saw the speaker forced to resign amid corruption allegations in December. The matter is still being investigated by the attorney general's office.Freeport has started a process to replace Sjamsuddin, Eric Kinneberg, a spokesman at Freeport's head office in Arizona, said in an email. He did not elaborate on why Sjamsuddin had quit other than to say it was for personal reasons. Freeport's stock has fallen 36 percent this month hammered by falling prices for copper and oil, which the company also produces. The New York Stock Exchange, where Freeport's stock is listed, was closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.Sjamsuddin, a retired Air Vice Marshal of the Indonesian Air Force and deputy chief of the National Intelligence Agency (BIN), was picked by former Freeport Chairman James Moffett to head the Indonesian unit in January 2015, despite his apparent lack of experience in mining. At the time, Sjamsuddin said he would enhance cooperation with the government and other stakeholders to support the company's long-term plan to operate mines in Papua.Freeport is negotiating with the government for an extension of its Grasberg contract, which is due to expire in 2021. The company, looking to invest $18 billion to transition Grasberg from open pit to underground mining in 2017, wants to finalize an extension before it signs off on the expansion. The Indonesian government is looking to increase its ownership of Freeport Indonesia, recently valued by the company at $16.2 billion, to 20 percent from a current 9.36 percent.According to Said Didu, a special staff to the energy minister, Sjamsuddin had worked well with the government.""I don't know exactly how the process will go from here. That will depend on his replacement,"" Didu said, noting that he didn't know who had been appointed to replace Sjamsuddin.Freeport chairman Moffett stepped down on Dec. 28 after three decades in charge.

245,"  * SOE minister says $1.7 bln price tag too expensive* Freeport faces difficult journey to extend mining contract* Talks enters new chapter after resignations of key negotiators   (New throughout)By Cindy Silviana and Michael TaylorJAKARTA, Jan 19 Freeport McMoRan Inc is asking the government to pay too much for a stake in its Indonesian unit, a key cabinet minister said on Tuesday, dealing a potential blow to already fragile talks over the firm's future in the mineral-rich nation.Freeport's long-held desire to continue mining in Indonesia beyond 2021 has been beset by controversy, including cabinet infighting, resignations and a major political scandal that led to the resignation of the parliamentary speaker.The U.S. mining giant wants to invest $18 billion to expand its operations at one of the world's largest copper mines in Papua, but is seeking government assurances first that it will get a contract extension. ""The last couple of months have been a total disaster for Freeport,"" said a source with direct knowledge of the situation who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.""I'm very negative about the outlook for Freeport's contract renegotiations.""As a first step to contract extension talks, Freeport must divest 10.46 percent stake in its Indonesian unit to increase the government's share to a total of 20 percent.After months of delays, the company valued the stake at $1.7 billion. ""What is definite is that $1.7 (billion) is too expensive,"" State-owned Enterprises (SOE) Minister Rini Soemarno told reporters. It was not clear if that was an official government rejection, or the minister's personal opinion.""We are still interested. SOE companies should have big mines, because these mines belong to Indonesia.""Soemarno has said that one of two Indonesian government-owned companies, miner Aneka Tambang or aluminium producer PT Inalum, should buy the Freeport stake. It was not clear if Freeport will need to revise its price, or if the government will propose one.Talks between the two sides are also entering uncharted territory following the resignation of key company negotiators.Freeport's Jakarta-friendly co-founder James ""Jim Bob"" Moffett resigned as the company's chairman last month, after the miner added two new directors under pressure from billionaire investor Carl Icahn.Although Moffett will still advise Freeport on its Indonesia operations, he was increasingly seen as a relic of the past sources said, and his departure is also now seen as a blow to the contract talks.Any further delays in contract talks, now widely expected, could lead to a gradual reduction in copper output as open-pit mining depletes. That could help support global copper benchmark prices, but at the same time dent government revenues in Southeast Asia's largest economy.(Additional reporting by Nicholas Owen; Writing by Randy Fabi, editing by David Evans)",2016-01-19,FCX,"Tue Jan 19, 2016 | 8:30am EST",UPDATE 1-Indonesian minister rejects Freeport price in a setback to talks,http://www.reuters.com//article/indonesia-freeport-idUSL3N15346D?type=companyNews

247,"   By Wilda Asmarini and Michael Taylor | JAKARTA  JAKARTA Jan 20 Indonesia will reach a decision on whether to accept Freeport McMoRan Inc's $1.7 billion divestment price for its unit in the country by the end of the first quarter, a mines ministry official said on Wednesday.Under agreements reached in 2014, the U.S. mining giant must sell the government a greater share of the Grasberg copper and gold mine in Papua and invest in domestic processing to win an extension of its contract beyond 2021.Earlier this week, State-owned Enterprises Minister Rini Soemarno said Freeport was asking the government to pay too much for an additional 10.46 percent stake.A team of official from different ministries will be formed to evaluate Freeport's offer and negotiate with the company, Bambang Gatot, the mines ministry's director general of coal and minerals told a parliamentary committee, with a final verdict due in March.""If the government will buy it, it should consult with parliament first,"" said Gatot, adding that the stake could go to the central or regional governments, a state-owned enterprise or a private company. RBC Capital Markets analyst Fraser Phillips in a recent note valued Freeport's current 90.64 percent Grasberg stake at $8.2 billion, with the asset's full valuation at $9 billion. Other analysts may have different valuations.The divestment price is based on the right to mine beyond 2021 and future investment needed, Clementino Lamury, director and executive vice-president at Freeport Indonesia told the committee.Freeport, whose current contract ends in 2021, wants to invest $18 billion to expand its operations, including underground mining, at one of the world's largest copper mines, but is seeking government assurances first that it will get an extension. Consulting parliament on the divestment offer could potentially slow the process further.Freeport's local CEO Maroef Sjamsoeddin resigned for personal reasons on Monday, just weeks after the company became entangled in an alleged extortion scandal that upset powerful figures inside and outside the government. Sjamsoeddin said he had secretly recorded a meeting with the parliament speaker, with his handling of the situation coming under criticism from both government and industry officials.The scandal came at a delicate time, with both sides working together towards a deal.Freeport's Jakarta-friendly co-founder James ""Jim Bob"" Moffett also resigned as the company's chairman last month, and his departure is seen as a blow to contract talks.""Moffett is a great negotiator,"" said a source with close connections to the Phoenix, Arizona-based company. ""People feel much more comfortable dealing with him.""Delays resolving the issue could lead to a gradual reduction in copper output as open-pit mining depletes and could be supportive for copper prices and hurt Indonesian government revenues.

""This money is the remaining amount they should have spent on their smelter so far,"" Coal and Minerals Director General Bambang Gatot told reporters on Friday, adding that his team had not heard back from Freeport on the requirement.A Freeport Indonesia spokesman told Reuters the company was still in discussions with the government on the matter. According to Gatot, the smelter project, estimated to be worth up to $2.5 billion, is now 14 percent complete.Energy Minister Sudirman Said said on Wednesday the new smelter should be 60 percent complete by now.

It would also buoy global prices of the metal that have slipped 6 percent so far this year on worries over a glut.The U.S. firm's six-month export permit for its Indonesian unit is due to expire on Thursday, said Didi Sumedi, an official at the trade ministry, correcting a statement earlier this week that said the deadline was Tuesday.""Certain officials with the ministry of energy and mines have suggested that we should continue to pay an export duty and that we should make a sizeable escrow deposit to support the smelter development,"" Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson said on a call following the announcement of its Q4 financial results. ""These points are inconsistent with the arrangements that we had worked with the government in mid-2014.""Those agreements said Freeport must sell the government a greater share of the Grasberg copper and gold mine and invest in domestic processing to win an extension of its contract beyond 2021.Adkerson said discussions with the government were ongoing, and he was confident a new export license would be issued. Jakarta wants the $530-million deposit as a guarantee that the Phoenix, Arizona-based company will complete construction of another local smelter. The amount would add to an estimated $80 million that Freeport set aside in July to obtain its current export permit.

262,"   By Euan Rocha | TORONTO  TORONTO The Canadian arm of mining giant BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) has signed a letter of intent to help fund exploration at Aston Bay Holdings Ltd's (BAY.V) Storm copper project, Aston Bay said on Thursday. Under terms of the preliminary deal, BHP could earn a 75 percent interest in Storm, located in Canada's far north territory of Nunavut, if it spends a minimum of C$40 million on exploration over the next few years. Vancouver-based Aston Bay, a small exploration company, will have no required exploration expenses for four years from the date a definitive agreement is signed. The two sides expect to finalize a deal in the second quarter, said Aston Bay. A definitive deal would be a huge boost for Aston Bay, which like many of its small peers has seen its share price pummeled amid the rout in commodity prices. The price of copper CMCU3 continues to languish around levels not seen since the tail end of the financial crisis in 2009. Such earn-in agreements allow mining majors to secure stakes in promising early-stage projects for relatively limited up-front risk. They were fairly common when metal prices soared through much of the last decade, but have become rare in the last few years for both base metal and precious metal assets.The latest move by BHP comes close on the heels of similar moves by rival Rio Tinto (RIO.L)(RIO.AX), which recently inked similar deals involving the copper assets of two Canadian juniors. The developments indicate the majors are beginning to be concerned about their long-term copper project pipeline as supply-demand fundamentals in the commodity remain fairly tight despite the slide in the price of copper.    In November, Avala Resources Ltd AVZ.V announced an earn-in agreement with Rio on its Lenovac project, located in Serbia, coming days after Rio signed a similar deal with Reservoir Minerals Inc RMC.V on its Timok Magmatic Complex in Serbia.    Both assets are located near the promising Cukaru Peki deposit in Serbia, part of a joint venture Reservoir has with Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N). That deposit has shown promising results, leading to heightened interest in the region.

There's a bit of profit taking, closing out these long positions ahead of the weekend and the Chinese new year,"" said analyst Kash Kamal at broker Sucden Financial.Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange  closed down 1.2 percent at $4,630 a tonne, erasing similar gains in the previous session when prices hit the highest since Jan. 4 at $4,720 a tonne.Copper has rebounded 7 percent since hitting 6-1/2-year lows in mid-January.Also weighing on prices ahead of the holiday was a surge in weekly inventories of copper, zinc and lead in Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) warehouses. Copper stocks jumped 29,317 tonnes, or 13.8 percent, zinc stocks rose 6.6 percent, while lead stocks more than doubled, reversing the fall from the prior week.Copper and other base metals, however, are likely to bounce back when the Chinese return from holidays, said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at Commerzbank.Friday was the last trading session on ShFE before the holidays. It will resume on Monday Feb. 15.""I wouldn't be surprised to see this recovery to continue going forward. The fundamental data will support the recovery because we're likely to have problems on the production side and on the other hand, demand seems to be a much better shape than many feared.""Given price-related cutbacks and shutdowns announced in the past six months, consultancy CRU anticipates a loss of 610,000 tonnes of contained copper from mine production this year. LME zinc, the best performer on the exchange so far this year, shed 2.2 percent to finish at $1,677 a tonne, but still gained over 3 percent during the week.Aluminium fell 2.3 percent to end at $1,500, lead  gave up 1.8 percent to close at $1,770, nickel  tumbled 4.4 percent to $8,160 while tin bucked the weaker trend and added 1 percent to reach $15,150.PRICES Three month LME copperMost active ShFE copper Three month LME aluminiumMost active ShFE aluminiumThree month LME zincMost active ShFE zincThree month LME leadMost active ShFE leadThree month LME nickelMost active ShFE nickelThree month LME tinMost active ShFE tin               (Additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne; Editing by David Clarke and Mark Potter)",2016-02-05,FCX,"Fri Feb 5, 2016 | 12:15pm EST",METALS--Copper slides after U.S. jobs data pushes up dollar,http://www.reuters.com//article/global-metals-idUSL8N15K3AO?type=companyNews

An extended halt in Freeport's exports would be a blow to its profits and deny the Indonesian government desperately needed revenue from one of its biggest taxpayers. A stoppage would also buoy global copper prices that fell around 25 percent last year and hit six-year lows in mid-January.""I am optimistic all of this will be finalised next week,"" an official with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.""Our focus is how can exports resume.""

The spokesman declined to comment further.A 2014 rule requires Freeport to invest further in domestic processing as a prerequisite for obtaining its export permits. However, construction of Freeport's second smelter has not begun yet, the government official said.""We are pushing so that this can be accelerated,"" the official said.The government is working to ensure that Freeport's operations run smoothly, but also that the company follows prevailing laws, amid a ""slight difference of interpretation of regulations,"" the official said.

""The scarcity of quality assets in the copper business is attracting significant interest from potential purchasers who share our longer term positive view of the marketplace,"" he said on a conference call. While the Phoenix, Arizona-based company expressed confidence in selling mining assets it also revealed a plan to cut about a quarter of workers in its oil and gas business after failing to sell that unit.  It said it would record a charge of about $40 million in the second quarter related to the job cuts and other restructuring costs.Shares in Freeport, which were weaker earlier in the day after it reported a deep quarterly loss, were last flat at $11.27. The company, which is under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to cut costs and debt, said its total debt rose to $20.8 billion at the end of March from $20.4 billion on Dec. 31. ""Our company is over-leveraged,"" Adkerson said. ""This kind of debt is a killer."" Freeport said in February that it was open to selling any of its copper assets at the right price to help it slash debt by between $5 billion and $10 billion. Earlier on Tuesday, Freeport said its net loss nearly doubled to $4.18 billion, or $3.35 per share, compared with a loss of $2.47 billion, or $2.38 per share, a year earlier.After adjusting for charges of $4 billion, mainly related to it reducing the value of its oil assets, Freeport reported a loss of $197 million or 16 cents a share - in line with analysts' expectations of 17 cents a share.Revenue fell 15.1 percent to $3.53 billion.

283,"   By Nicole Mordant  Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) expects to have agreed $3 billion worth of asset sales by mid-year, its chief executive said on Tuesday, as the U.S. miner and oil producer tries to whittle down a nearly $21 billion debt pile he described as ""a killer.""Freeport, which is the world's biggest listed copper producer, has already entered into agreements this year to sell $1.4 billion worth of assets, leaving another $1.6 billion's worth to transact by end-June. Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said Freeport was in ""advanced discussions"" on a number of its copper assets, but declined to name them. Freeport owns a number of world-class copper assets, including the Grasberg mine in Indonesia and the Cerro Verde mine in Peru.  ""The scarcity of quality assets in the copper business is attracting significant interest from potential purchasers who share our longer term positive view of the marketplace,"" he said on a conference call. While the Phoenix, Arizona-based company expressed confidence in selling mining assets it also revealed a plan to cut about a quarter of workers in its oil and gas business after failing to sell that unit.  It said it would record a charge of about $40 million in the second quarter related to the job cuts and other restructuring costs.Shares in Freeport, which were weaker earlier in the day after it reported a deep quarterly loss, were last flat at $11.27. The company, which is under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to cut costs and debt, said its total debt rose to $20.8 billion at the end of March from $20.4 billion on Dec. 31. ""Our company is over-leveraged,"" Adkerson said. ""This kind of debt is a killer."" Freeport said in February that it was open to selling any of its copper assets at the right price to help it slash debt by between $5 billion and $10 billion. Earlier on Tuesday, Freeport said its net loss nearly doubled to $4.18 billion, or $3.35 per share, compared with a loss of $2.47 billion, or $2.38 per share, a year earlier.After adjusting for charges of $4 billion, mainly related to it reducing the value of its oil assets, Freeport reported a loss of $197 million or 16 cents a share - in line with analysts' expectations of 17 cents a share.Revenue fell 15.1 percent to $3.53 billion.

290,"   By Anet Josline Pinto and Denny Thomas  Freeport-McMoRan Inc has agreed to sell its majority stake in the Tenke copper project in the Democratic Republic of Congo to China Molybdenum Co Ltd (CMOC) for $2.65 billion in cash, reducing the U.S. miner's debt and handing the Chinese company one of the world's prized copper assets.The deal is a vote of confidence in copper, which many consider a bright spot among base metals. It is also the biggest copper deal since Glencore sold its Las Bambas mine in Peru for $6 billion in 2014.The China Moly acquisition, its second in as many weeks, comes days after Rio Tinto approved a $5.3 billion underground expansion of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia..Even though copper prices are languishing near seven-year lows due to a supply glut, the recent corporate activity is a sign some investors are willing to call a bottom on the commodities cycle and expect a copper deficit ahead.The deal is ""further evidence of what China sees as a fair long-term copper price, which is north of where current levels are trading,” said Paul Gait, senior research analyst at Bernstein Investment Research in London.Freeport, like other big miners, has been selling assets to cut debt, while China has been snapping up commodity assets around the world to feed its massive economy. The deal takes China's announced outbound M&A tally to about $100 billion in 2016, nearing last year's record $104 billion. It is China Moly's largest outbound deal to date. Freeport shares fell 8 percent to $10.80 in New York, in line with other big miners as copper hit its lowest in nearly a month. DEBT PILE  Shareholders have put many companies on notice, piling on pressure to sell assets to repair their balance sheets. Including this deal, Freeport, which has debt of nearly $21 billion, has sold about $4 billion worth of assets this year. The Phoenix, Arizona-based miner needed to sell $3 billion of assets by mid-year to keep its debt unsecured. ""It is a good price for the asset and it significantly improves their liquidity and their balance sheet,"" Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina said.The deal follows Freeport's sale in February of a 13 percent stake in its Morenci copper mine in Arizona to Sumitomo Metal Mining for $1 billion. Tenke Fungurume, in the southern Congolese copper belt, is one of the world's largest copper deposits. Producing since 2009, it is 56 percent owned by Freeport, with a 24 percent stake held by Lundin Mining and a 20 percent stake by Gecamines, Congo's state mining firm.Toronto-based Lundin has a right of first offer on any change of control transaction over Tenke. The offer is open for 90 days once the company receives notice, which it hasn't yet, spokesman John Miniotis said in an email. ""Lundin will carefully evaluate all options for its stake in Tenke and will update the market in due course,"" he said.  The mine is one of Freeport's prize assets, along with Morenci, Cerro Verde in Peru and Grasberg in Indonesia, but it had deferred development and expansion plans due to sluggish copper prices.Freeport also slashed planned capital spending at Tenke for 2016 by 50 percent, alongside initiatives to reduce administrative costs.  China relies heavily on imported copper for its smelters and Chinese companies have been looking to buy overseas mines.CMOC, one of China's largest producers of molybdenum, agreed last month to pay $1.5 billion to buy Anglo American Plc's niobium and phosphates business in Brazil. The company told the Financial Times last week it had more than $4 billion to pursue acquisitions, betting that the commodities cycle had bottomed.Freeport said it would receive another $60 million from China Moly if the average copper price exceeds $3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price exceeds $20 per pound between 2018 and 2019.The U.S. miner agreed to sell its 70 percent stake in TF Holdings Ltd, a Bermuda holding company that indirectly owns an 80 percent interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining SA.

The company told the Financial Times last week it had more than $4 billion to pursue acquisitions, betting that the commodities cycle had bottomed.Freeport said it would receive another $60 million from China Moly if the average copper price exceeds $3.50 per pound and $60 million if the average cobalt price exceeds $20 per pound between 2018 and 2019.The U.S. miner agreed to sell its 70 percent stake in TF Holdings Ltd, a Bermuda holding company that indirectly owns an 80 percent interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining SA. Freeport also said it agreed to negotiate exclusively with China Moly for the sale of its interests in Freeport Cobalt, including the Kokkola Cobalt Refinery in Finland and the Kisanfu Exploration project in the DRC.Citigroup advised China Moly on the deal, according to sources familiar with the matter.

""There won't be a major change for at least 12 to 18 months,"" the adviser told Reuters. ""That's what (the delegation) came to do -- reassure the Congolese authorities and the personnel who work (at Tenke) that nothing is going to change in the short term.""CMOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment but the handover period was confirmed by a Freeport spokesman. ""We will continue to provide support and will operate (Tenke) for a period of time; up to one year after the transaction closes,"" he said.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, he added.

316,"   By Michael Flaherty  After years of support for companies that hand board seats to activists to avoid a bruising public fight, some of the world's largest institutional investors are pushing back.     BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest asset manager, and Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway's $872 billion sovereign wealth fund are among the major funds resisting, encouraging companies to consult them before responding to an activist.These investors argue that in certain cases, giving board seats to frustrated shareholders with a shorter-term investment horizon could jeopardize the company's long-term performance.Activist investors, which Thomson Reuters data show launched a record 511 campaigns last year, are usually hedge funds that buy up a minority stake in a company they believe is undervalued, and push publicly for changes to boost the stock. The most recent example of pushback against activist settlements involves U.S. retailer Chico's FAS (CHS.N) and Barington Capital, which sought to leverage its 1.6 percent stake to capture two board seats, including one for its founder. The $100 million hedge fund ended its campaign on Friday, after realizing it could not win over enough institutional investor support for its nominees, according to people familiar with the matter.In another case, BlackRock told the management team of Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) that it was unhappy with its truce with billionaire investor Carl Icahn, which gave board seats to two of his young employees, the people familiar with the matter said.    The resistance is putting more pressure on activist hedge fund managers, who are struggling through volatile markets after years of index-beating performance.""Some (institutional investors) feel that board seats should not be a bargaining chip, as this practice distorts the board's election process,"" said Ernst & Young in a summary of its survey of 50 large shareholders in March. Board positions give activists the most influence, which is why they launch proxy fights to have directors voted in by shareholders at annual meetings.  To avoid that distraction, companies offer activists one or several board seats rather than take the battle all the way to a vote.Since 2015, activists have secured 198 board seats at companies with market values above $500 million, according to data from Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N), with most of those seats gained through settlements. That is 30 percent more than the prior two full years combined. Zach Oleksiuk, head of BlackRock's Americas corporate governance team, said companies should seek to periodically refresh their boards.""That said, we remain skeptical of directors that are overly focused on a single issue or represent a subset of shareholders,"" Oleksiuk told Reuters.Norway's sovereign wealth fund declined to comment, but people familiar with its strategy said the fund has been voicing its concerns that quick settlements with activists could jeopardize long term strategy. BOARD INFLUENCE As of June 15 of this year, companies have settled with activists 56 times in the United States, according to financial data firm FactSet. While it remains a historically high number, it marks a 10 percent drop from the same period of 2015. In another sign that companies are getting tougher, there were 92 proxy fights so far this year, according to last month's report by proxy firm Alliance Advisors, on pace to become the highest number since 2009. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/29B6lQ2)Activists still prefer settlements over proxy fights and most multi-billion hedge funds are able to strike deals with companies. ""It takes away the cost and wasted time,"" Starboard Value CEO Jeffrey Smith told the Milken Institute Global Conference in May. Smith joined the board of Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) earlier this year following a settlement with the Internet company. J C Penney Company Inc's (JCP.N) relationship with Pershing Square serves as an example of what can happen when a company adopts an activist's strategy that lacks support from the broader shareholder base.      Pershing's founder, William Ackman, joined the retailer's board in 2011 as part of a settlement and played a major role in orchestrating a turnaround plan that ultimately failed as sales plunged by 25 percent the following year. Within the past year, however, activists' presence on company boards is coming under heavier scrutiny.According to people familiar with the matter, Chico's new CEO, Shelley Broader, discussed her strategy with the company's largest shareholders shortly after she took over the post in December. She spoke again with some of them after Barington arrived, at which point they signaled their support for a fight with the hedge fund, the people said.    A Chico's spokeswoman declined to comment.    In the case of Freeport, lack of board experience of Icahn's two young lieutenants who represented him was the reason BlackRock did not support the miner's agreement with the investor, people familiar with the matter said.      Freeport and BlackRock declined to comment about the matter.

319,"   By Nicole Mordant  Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N), the world's biggest publicly listed copper miner, put its high-profile asset sales plan on the rear burner on Tuesday, and instead unveiled a $1.5 billion share issue to help it cut debt.Freeport's chief executive said he was confident the company could reduce its $18.8 billion of net debt to between $13.2 billion and $10.5 billion by the end of 2017 on the back of already executed asset sales and excess cash it expects to earn from higher mined volumes and metals prices.As a result, Freeport, which also produces oil and other metals including gold and molybdenum, could hold on to core assets, such as the Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru. At the start of 2016, Freeport said any of its assets might be sold.""I feel we've turned corner, we can see the way forward without further asset sales, without further equity sales,"" CEO Richard Adkerson said on a conference call after Freeport reported a slightly bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. However, he said Freeport was still open to considering ""all strategic moves"" that could generate value for shareholders, ""whether that means selling assets, selling the company,"" he said. Freeport's stock, which was down more than 7 percent at the open on news of the dilutive share issue, retraced its losses after the call. It closed 2.4 percent higher at $12.68. Like other miners, Freeport has been hit hard in recent years by a downturn in prices for commodities, including copper, gold and oil, at a time when its debt had soared on the back of acquisitions.  But gold and oil prices have risen this year, and Adkerson said he expects copper prices to recover as well.Phoenix-based Freeport has entered into agreements to sell more than $4 billion worth of assets this year.Adkerson also said Freeport has assurances from the Indonesian government that it will receive the copper export permit it requires by Aug. 8. It reduced its 2016 copper output forecast from its Grasberg mine in Indonesia to 1.3 billion pounds from 1.4 billion due to varying ore grades.

320,"   By Nicole Mordant  Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N), the world's biggest publicly listed copper miner, put its high-profile asset sales plan on the rear burner on Tuesday, and instead unveiled a $1.5 billion share issue to help it cut debt.Freeport's chief executive said he was confident the company could reduce its $18.8 billion of net debt to between $13.2 billion and $10.5 billion by the end of 2017 on the back of already executed asset sales and excess cash it expects to earn from higher mined volumes and metals prices.As a result, Freeport, which also produces oil and other metals including gold and molybdenum, could hold on to core assets, such as the Cerro Verde copper mine in Peru. At the start of 2016, Freeport said any of its assets might be sold.""I feel we've turned corner, we can see the way forward without further asset sales, without further equity sales,"" CEO Richard Adkerson said on a conference call after Freeport reported a slightly bigger-than-expected quarterly loss. However, he said Freeport was still open to considering ""all strategic moves"" that could generate value for shareholders, ""whether that means selling assets, selling the company,"" he said. Freeport's stock, which was down more than 7 percent at the open on news of the dilutive share issue, retraced its losses after the call. It closed 2.4 percent higher at $12.68. Like other miners, Freeport has been hit hard in recent years by a downturn in prices for commodities, including copper, gold and oil, at a time when its debt had soared on the back of acquisitions.  But gold and oil prices have risen this year, and Adkerson said he expects copper prices to recover as well.Phoenix-based Freeport has entered into agreements to sell more than $4 billion worth of assets this year.Adkerson also said Freeport has assurances from the Indonesian government that it will receive the copper export permit it requires by Aug. 8. It reduced its 2016 copper output forecast from its Grasberg mine in Indonesia to 1.3 billion pounds from 1.4 billion due to varying ore grades. Earlier on Tuesday, Freeport posted a narrower quarterly net loss of $479 million in the three months to June 30, down from $1.85 billion a year earlier.Excluding items, it lost 2 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of a 1-cent-per-share loss.

340,"  Activist investor Carl Icahn, the third-largest shareholder in Freeport McMoran Inc (FCX.N), said on Tuesday he endorsed the U.S. miner's efforts to reduce debt and explore strategic alternatives.Icahn's comments come a day after Freeport said it would sell its deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas assets to Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) for $2 billion in a bid to reduce its debt.The billionaire investor, who owns a 7.8 percent stake in Freeport and has two representatives on the board, said last year the company was undervalued and needed to address several corporate governance and capital issues.""Yesterday's announcement demonstrates the Company is making good on its stated goal of deleveraging and is on track to cut its net debt by half, from year end 2015 through the end of next year, at current copper prices,"" Icahn said in a statement on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2cUlDOa)Freeport, like other miners, has been hit hard in recent years by a downturn in prices for commodities, including copper, gold and oil, even as it racked up debt due to acquisitions. The sale to Anadarko follows failed attempts by Freeport to sell all or part of its oil and gas business. In May, Freeport withdrew plans to launch an initial public offering for the business.Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in July that Freeport was still open to considering ""all strategic moves"" including selling assets or the entire company. However, the company had then put its asset sales plan on the rear burner, and instead unveiled a $1.5 billion share issue to help cut debt.Anderson also said he was confident the company could reduce its $18.8 billion of net debt to between $13.2 billion and $10.5 billion by the end of 2017.

341,"   By Susan Taylor | TORONTO, Sept 15  TORONTO, Sept 15 Canadian base metals miner Lundin Mining Corp has won a two week extension until Sept. 29 to bid on Freeport-McMoRan Inc's stake in the Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt mine, Lundin said in a statement on Thursday.Lundin, previously granted an extension to Sept. 15, said it continues to review, with legal and financial advisors, its ownership in the Democratic Republic of Congo mine, one of the world's largest copper deposits.The Toronto-based company would not comment on why it needs more time, but director of business valuations and investor relations Mark Turner repeated that Lundin has credible interest from multiple parties on a number of scenarios. Lundin, which primarily produces copper, nickel and zinc, has a 24 percent share of Tenke, while Freeport holds 56 percent and Congo's state miner Gecamines has the remaining 20 percent.Phoenix-based Freeport, which has been selling assets to cut its large debt load, agreed in May to sell its Tenke stake to China Molybdenum (CMOC) for $2.65 billion. Under a 'right of first offer', Lundin can supplant any bids for the mine by matching them. It can also decide to sell its stake or do nothing and allow the China Moly deal to proceed. Lundin, which has hired Bank of Montreal to help it consider options, told Reuters in June that it was weighing interest from multiple parties.RBC analyst Fraser Phillips said Lundin is most likely to maintain its 24-percent interest, with China Moly operating the mine. The next likely scenario is that Lundin sells its stake, but with a lower valuation than Freeport, which held a controlling interest, he wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.The transaction size makes a counter-bid unlikely, some analysts say. Lundin, whose shares rose 2 percent to C$5.08 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday morning, has a market capitalization of about C$3.59 billion ($2.72 billion).

347,"  (Adds analysts view of transaction value, debt reduction target, total asset sale value)By Susan TaylorTORONTO Oct 14 Freeport-McMoRan said on Friday it will sell onshore California oil and gas assets to Sentinel Peak Resources California for up to $742 million, part of a push by the world's biggest listed copper miner to reduce its multi-billion dollar debt.Hard hit in recent years by slumping commodity prices, Phoenix-based Freeport is under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, its third-largest shareholder, to reduce net debt of $18.8 billion and boost valuation.Under the transaction with private energy company Sentinel Peak, Freeport said it will receive $592 million in cash at closing and $50 million every year from 2018 to 2020 if the price per barrel of Brent crude oil averages $70 or more. Sentinel also assumes $100 million in future abandonment costs for the properties. Several analysts said that Freeport fetched a reasonable price for the assets, which were likely challenging to sell due to a small pool of potential buyers in the high-cost, heavily-regulated California market.Net cash from the deal with Sentinel, which is backed by private equity firm Quantum Energy Partners, will help repay debt, said Freeport.Adding only the $592 million cash payment, the Sentinel deal lifts the value of Freeport's 2016 asset sales to $6.62 billion, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Fraser Phillips in a note to clients. That puts Freeport on track to reach its debt reduction target of $5 billion to $10 billion, he wrote. Last month, Freeport announced the $2 billion sale of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas assets to Anadarko Petroleum.That followed failed attempts to sell all or part of the oil and gas business, and withdrawal of a planned initial public offering. Freeport debt ballooned with two ill-timed acquisitions of oil and natural gas producers in 2013, as it diversified beyond copper, gold and molybdenum mining.In May, Freeport agreed to sell its prized majority stake in the Tenke copper mine to China Molybdenum for $2.65 billion in cash.After the Sentinel and Anadarko deals close, Freeport will still own productive onshore assets in South Louisiana and the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico, and offshore assets in California and Central Wyoming.Last quarter, these produced an average 8.6 thousand barrels of oil and natural gas liquids and 78 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.

Freeport denies that Gecamines has such a right. Contrary to the Freeport announcement, which came as a surprise to Gecamines, Lundin had ""ample communications with them months ago,"" Lundin CEO Paul Conibear said.As a minority shareholder in Tenke, Lundin's sale of its stake is also ""not the big event,"" he said in an interview.The closing of the Freeport sale has been held up for months while Lundin, which had a right of first offer on Freeport's stake, weighed its options. With the sale of its stake, Lundin has now waived that right. ""We anticipate that the sale to CMOC will be completed before the end of 2016,"" Freeport spokesman Eric Kinneberg said in an email.The Lundin sale is expected to close in the first half of 2017. Conibear said Lundin, which also mines zinc and nickel, plans to use the proceeds from the sale to expand production at its Neves-Corvo zinc mine in Portugal and for a small expansion at its Swedish zinc and copper mine.The Toronto-based miner was also keen to start paying shareholders a dividend and would make a decision on doing so soon.Acquisitions are on the back burner as the company focuses on existing assets, Conibear said.""The cupboard's bare right now. It's the first time in five years that we haven't actively been studying or negotiating an asset,"" he said.Lundin's shares were up 0.79 percent at C$6.40 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Copper on the London Metal Exchange has risen nearly 20 percent in 2016, recovering after a three-year decline, amid signs of economic strength in top consumer China.The industrial metal widened price gains after Republican Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election stoked hopes of increased infrastructure spending in the world's biggest economy. The recent rally was primarily driven by financial investors including speculators and hedge funds, Targhetta said.""There have also been good signs of faster growth in consumption in China over the past few months. There are better expectations about China growth now than six months ago,"" he said.Copper prices may strengthen over the next two to three years on solid demand in China, India and other Asian nations, said Targhetta.""I think the so-called supercycle has never ended and will continue for number of decades.""

369,"  * Copper gains on speculative buys* Inventories down 30 pct from 2016 peak   (Adds closing prices)By Zandi ShabalalaLONDON, Nov 17 Copper rose on Thursday in volatile trade on speculative flows and against the backdrop of falling inventories for the metal used in construction and power.Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange closed 1.2 percent higher at $5,495.50 per tonne after touching its highest since June 2015 at $6,025.50 per tonne on Nov. 11.Copper is down about 8 percent from last week's peak in a rally prompted by expectations of higher U.S. infrastructure spending following Republican Donald Trump's election victory.Inventories on Thursday rose 2,275 tonnes to 257,875 tonnes, according to LME data, but are down 32 percent from a 2016 peak in September.""The copper market is a bit confused right now, we had been expecting a proper correction but trading has been very volatile,"" ETF Securities commodities strategist Nitesh Shah said, adding that there could speculative buys.Another trader said it was ""clear the usual dynamics of the market are not at play"" given that a stronger dollar usually led to softer commodity prices.But Shah said although he expected a moderate rise in prices, the metal was expensive at current levels.""I've been saying all year that copper prices should rise alongside other metals if you look at the supply deficit, but for this price reaction to happen over a few days is too much too fast,"" Shah said. Anglo American said it suspended its Los Bronces copper mine in Chile after protesters seized installations on Wednesday. The mine produced 402,000 tonnes of copper last year.Executives at some of the world's major copper producers and traders said on Wednesday the global copper market will be oversupplied for at least two years, casting doubt on the chances of a prolonged rally.Elsewhere, zinc was down 0.4 percent to $2,514 per tonne in official trading rings. The metal, used mainly in galvanising steel, hit its highest level since January 2010 on Tuesday.Aluminum ended 0.5 percent lower at $1,685 per tonne. Lead slipped 0.4 percent to $2,169.50 per tonne.Tin rose the most among the metals, up 1.6 percent to $20,200 per tonne. It fell to its lowest since Oct. 21 on Wednesday.
