5,"  (Adds details from conference call, COO comments, background; updates shares)By Devika  Krishna KumarApril 24 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world's second-largest cruise operator, said its quarterly profit fell by two-thirds as costs rose and passengers spent less onboard.Shares of the company, whose cruise lines include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruise, fell as much as 3.2 percent in early trading.The company shortened or canceled six cruises during January-March, typically the strongest season for cruise operators.Voyage disruptions hurt yields, which include ticket sales and spending on board, by about 0.5 percent in the first quarter ended March 31.Royal Caribbean said its cruise operations were hurt by several mishaps in the first quarter.The company and its larger rival Carnival Corp faced disruptions when a collision between Kirby Inland Marine oil barge and a cargo ship in March spilled residual fuel oil in the Gulf of Galveston, shutting the Houston Ship Channel.The cruise industry has just started recovering from negative publicity after a series of headline-grabbing mishaps, including virus outbreaks and engine fires, over the past two years.Carnival, the world's No. 1 cruise operator, forecast a full-year profit below analysts' estimates in March as it cuts prices and spends more on advertising. Royal Caribbean has also been struggling to boost sales in the Caribbean, its biggest market.""While we were seeing strong bookings for the Caribbean with recent booking volumes trending well above last year's levels, the environment remains very promotional,"" Chief Financial Officer Jason Liberty said on a post-earnings conference call.Royal Caribbean said it expected pricing in the Caribbean to remain under pressure this year.""We needed to introduce more promotions (in the Caribbean) in March and April to close the occupancy gap,"" Chief Operating Officer Adam Goldstein told Reuters.Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, rose 1.3 percent on a constant-currency basis in a quarter in which cruise liners usually offer their best deals. SMOOTH SAILING AHEAD Royal Caribbean said it expected smoother sailing in the coming quarters as bookings were seen rising and demand for its Chinese and European cruises was expected to stay strong.The company said it expected double-digit percentage rise in yields in its Europe and Asia Pacific cruises this year.Europe cruises account for 22 percent of the company's capacity, while Asia Pacific sailings make for 12 percent.

8,"   By Zachary Fagenson | MIAMI  MIAMI Retired English soccer captain David Beckham lobbied Miami lawmakers on Wednesday to approve his proposed 25,000-seat soccer stadium on the city's prized bayfront real estate.Beckham, wearing a tailored dark suit, went door-to-door in Miami-Dade lawmakers’ offices in downtown Miami throughout the morning and afternoon, meeting with commissioners and posing for pictures.Beckham's plan for a futuristic, waterfront stadium near the port of Miami to house a new Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise has run into resistance from a group led by Royal Caribbean Cruises, which argues that it would interfere with cruise and cargo operations.An alternative proposal offered by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez this week would locate the stadium on another nearby downtown waterfront site, currently a boatslip, sandwiched between an art museum and the Miami Heat basketball arena.“If they want to have a piece of property there ... they would have to bear the cost of filling the slip in,” Gimenez said, pegging the cost between $12 million and $18 million. Gimenez said the land could be worth as much as $50 million.""It's another option it gives us another location which has come out of the blue,"" Beckham told reporters outside county hall on Wednesday.""It's gone from having one great possible location to two. We’re very happy."" Beckham said he never expected a ""smooth ride"" getting stadium approval. ""Investors and I will be putting up a quarter of a billion dollars ... we don't want to bring worries,"" he said.Beckham along with his partners Simon Fuller, creator of American Idol, and Bolivian-born billionaire Marcelo Claure, founder of Miami-based Brightstar Corp, say they will pay the county tax and rent. The group plans to privately finance the $250 million stadium construction. Beckham has yet to reveal who his investors are.The mayor's alternative plan has already drawn the ire of several critics, including former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz and a handful of former city commissioners who said the space should become parks and plazas for the tens of thousands of downtown Miami residents now living in the city’s high rises that once sat empty following the city and nation’s real estate collapse.“Miami has become one of the world’s leading urban centers, fulfilling its long awaited destiny ... let us not purge this gift by building a stadium where it does not belong,” Diaz wrote in a widely circulated Wednesday email.

9,"  OSLO May 9 Royal Caribbean, the world's second-largest cruise operator, has ordered its fourth Oasis-class vessel, the world's biggest cruise ship, increasing its capital spending plans by $1.8 billion.South Korea's STX, which has built two of the 225,300 tonne vessels for Royal Caribbean and is working on a third, will build the new ship as well, the firm said in a statement on Friday.With 16 decks and more than 2,700 passenger rooms, Oasis-class vessels can accommodate 6,300 passengers and almost 2,400 crew. The firm did not disclose the vessel's price but analysts estimate that its previous Oasis-class ships cost around $1.4 billion each. Royal Caribbean also said it now sees capital expenditure of $6.8 billion through 2018, up from an earlier guidance for $5 billion through 2017. Royal Caribbean last month raised its earnings guidance on a strong rise in bookings, in a signal that the global cruise industry is slowly recovering from several lean years. The vessel will be built by STX France, 66.6 percent-owned by STX and 33.3 percent by the French state.The first two Oasis-class ships were built in Turku, Finland while the third vessel, two tonnes bigger than its sisters, is being built in Saint-Nazaire, France.

Beckham, who starred with Manchester United, England and Real Madrid, also played with Los Angeles Galaxy in MLS for five years until the end of 2012. Beckham's group has agreed to finance a $250 million stadium with seating for 20,000 and to pay rent for the land.The proposal still has to be vetted by city and county commissioners and undergo public hearings before being put to a referendum later this year. Beckham’s initial preferred site for the stadium, an undeveloped plot of land on the port of Miami, was resisted by  Royal Caribbean Cruises and others who argued the stadium could interfere with cruise and cargo operations.Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado told reporters after Monday's meeting that the new proposal involved filling in a large boat slip creating extra park land by the bay, including a public walkway between the stadium and the water. ""I liked it because we are gaining more park land and we will make money,"" Regalado said.

Royal Caribbean, the world's second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is more focused in the Caribbean, which accounts for nearly half of its total capacity.The company has also been focusing on markets outside the Caribbean, particularly on its Asian cruises, as demand in that region has been increasing steadily.Royal Caribbean was seeing the fastest growth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in China, where more than 95 percent of the cruises were booked for the year, Chief Financial Officer Jason Liberty said on a conference call.Net yield, which includes ticket sales and onboard spending, rose 4.2 percent on a constant currency basis in the second quarter ended June 30. Growth in net yield was driven by fewer discounts on last-minute bookings, the company said.An improvement in pricing is expected to help the company in the next two quarters, Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said.Lower fuel costs also helped the company beat the average profit estimate for the second straight quarter. Fuel costs accounted for 9.8 percent of total revenue in the second quarter ended June 30, down from 12.2 percent a year earlier.Crude oil prices have slumped more than 40 percent since June last year, reducing fuel costs for cruise operators and airlines.Royal Caribbean, which owns Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises, raised its profit forecast for the year to $4.65-$4.75 per share from $4.45-$4.65.Analysts on average were expecting $4.61 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income rose 34 percent to $185 million, or 84 cents per share, in the second quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of 73 cents.Total revenue rose 4 percent to $2.06 billion, in line with estimates.The company's shares were up more than 8 percent at $89.58 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

Shares of rivals Carnival Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd also declined on the news.The operator of lines such as Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises said the launch of new marketing campaigns for core brands would also hurt its profit margins. The company has not seen any material impact from the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean, Royal Caribbean International Chief Executive Michael Bayley said on a conference call.The mosquito-borne Zika virus has been linked to brain damage in thousands of babies in Brazil, discouraging travel to affected regions.Royal Caribbean has previously said it had no plans to cut down on routes to South American countries. The company has not detailed any other actions in response to the outbreak.Royal Caribbean forecast adjusted earnings of about 30 cents per share for the first quarter, below the average analyst estimate of 46 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's full-year profit forecast of $5.90-$6.10 per share was also below analysts' expectations of $6.27.The average value of the dollar against a basket of currencies was 11.7 percent higher in the fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier quarter.Royal Caribbean said net revenue per available berth, or net yields, rose 4.9 percent on a constant-currency basis in the fourth quarter, helped by strong demand in a rebounding Caribbean market and new cruises in China in the winter. ""Overall, we are seeing strong yield trends in (the first quarter), driven by a significant year-over-year improvement in Caribbean pricing and the addition of the winter China season,"" Chief Financial Officer Jason Liberty said.Royal Caribbean said it expected net yields to rise about 4 percent on a constant-currency basis in the current quarter and 0.5 percent including currency fluctuations.Revenue rose 4.4 percent to $1.90 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, but missed the average analyst estimate of $1.96 billion.Net income surged 88 percent to $206.8 million, or 94 cents per share, beating analysts' expectations of 92 cents per share.Royal Caribbean shares were down 15.5 percent at $71.43 in noon trading.(Reporting by Abhijith G in Bengaluru; Editing by Don Sebastian, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Kirti Pandey)",2016-02-02,RCL,"Tue Feb 2, 2016 | 11:47am EST","UPDATE 2-Royal Caribbean forecasts profit below estimates, shares drop",http://www.reuters.com//article/royal-carib-crus-results-idUSL3N15H4H4?type=companyNews

51,"  (Corrects eighth paragraph to make clear that only one of the two lawsuits seeks class-action status, and identifies that lawsuit in tenth paragraph)By Jonathan StempelFeb 25 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd faces at least two lawsuits by passengers accusing the company of negligently endangering their lives by letting its Anthem of the Seas cruise ship sail into a fierce Atlantic storm this month.The lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court in Miami claim that Royal Caribbean knew, or should have known, that a coastal storm carrying hurricane-force winds had been forecast before the ship set sail from Cape Liberty, New Jersey on Feb. 6 for a scheduled seven-night cruise to the Bahamas.Nonetheless, Royal Caribbean chose to sail the ship into the storm, motivated by a desire to profit at the expense of the safety of roughly 4,500 passengers and 1,600 crew, the lawsuits said.Cynthia Martinez, a Royal Caribbean spokeswoman, said the Miami-based company does not discuss pending litigation, and has taken steps to minimize the risk of another similar incident. Royal Caribbean has said the storm was more severe than expected.Passengers hunkered in their rooms as the Anthem of the Seas encountered high winds and 30-foot waves off the North Carolina coast, a day after its departure. Royal Caribbean later turned the ship around, and it returned to New Jersey on Feb. 10. The company offered passengers full refunds, and discounts on a future cruise.One of the lawsuits seeks class-action status for passengers, and both lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.The first lawsuit was filed on Feb. 18 by Bruce Simpson, a Delaware resident who claimed to suffer a concussion and other injuries after being thrown 18 feet into a door when the ship pitched violently. The second lawsuit, the proposed class action, was filed on Thursday by Frank DeLuca, of Cinnaminson, New Jersey, who suffered back injuries during the voyage, and whose wife has suffered from panic attacks and sleeplessness, their lawyer Michael Winkleman said.""Royal Caribbean showed an absolute lack of respect for the lives of its passengers,"" Winkleman said in a phone interview. A refund and a future cruise credit is insulting for what the passengers went through.""Simpson's lawyer was not immediately available for comment.The cases are Simpson v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, No. 16-20595; and DeLuca v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd in the same court, No. 16-20689.

68,"   By Abhijith Ganapavaram  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) said it was confident of meeting its profit forecast for 2017, buoyed by strong bookings, indicating that the No. 2 U.S. cruise operator had tided over what has been a turbulent year for the cruise industry.Royal Caribbean's bookings for next year were up both in terms of pricing and volume, giving ""added confidence"" that the company could double its adjusted profit to $6.78 per share in 2017 from $3.39 in 2014, Chief Executive Richard Fain said.Fain's comments come after a tough year for the cruise industry, which has been hit by a strong dollar and the Brexit vote, while contending with geopolitical events in Europe and the Zika virus scare that deterred travelers.Analysts have also been concerned about pricing pressures in the Caribbean, the biggest market for cruise operators and one that had been plagued by overcapacity until the past few quarters.However, Royal Caribbean appeared to brush aside these concerns, saying it would deploy more ships in the Caribbean next year, while slimming its Mediterranean operations where the migrant crisis and a spate of attacks have hit the industry. Royal Caribbean's confidence in its forecast sent the company's shares up nearly 10 percent – on course for their best day in five years – and also lifted the shares of rivals Carnival Corp (CCL.N) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH.O).However, it was not all smooth sailing for Royal Caribbean in the latest third quarter. The company's revenue rose 1.6 percent to $2.56 billion, the slowest in six quarters and just under analysts estimates of $2.58 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.But, its adjusted profit of $3.20 per share beat analysts average estimate by 10 cents due to higher demand for its pricier North American cruises and as consumers spent more on beverages and WiFi on board.A 2 percent decline in net cruise costs, excluding fuel, also helped prop up the company's profit in the quarter. Royal Caribbean's net income tripled to $693.3 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $228.8 million a year earlier, which included a $399.3 million non-cash charge.Net revenue yields, which take into account spending per available berth, rose 0.4 percent.

72,"  U.S cruise operators Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday they had got approval from Cuban authorities to begin operations to the country.Norwegian Cruise Line said its first ship would set sail to Havana from Miami on March 7 next year, while Royal Caribbean did not specify a date.The approval comes nearly seven months after Carnival Corp's Adonia, a small ship carrying 700 passengers, reached  the Cuban capital after getting an approval. The Adonia was the first U.S.-owned ship to sail to Cuba from the United States since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. Cuba said in April it would lift a ban on Cuban-born citizens entering and leaving the country in commercial vessels, paving the way for cruise operators to begin offering itineraries from the United States.
