5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings will assign an 'A' rating to  Kimberly-Clark Corporation's (Kimberly) two senior unsecured notes issuances  comprised of a floating rate note due May 2016 and a fixed rate note due May  2019.  The amounts and interest rates will be determined later today. The 2016 notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. Net proceeds will be used  for general corporate purposes.  The notes will be issued under a global indenture dated March 1, 1988 as further  supplemented. The indenture contains limitations on liens and sale/leaseback  transactions; however, there are no financial covenants in the indenture.  Similar to notes issued after 2006 there is a Change of Control Triggering  Event. The trigger is upon the occurrence of both a Change of Control (any  person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of shares or a substantial  disposition of property, for example) and a rating downgrade to below investment  grade from each of the three rating agencies. In this event, unless the company  has exercised its right to redeem the notes, Kimberly-Clark will be required to  make an offer to purchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate  principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Scale in Stable Sector:  Kimberly's scale, with over $21 billion in revenues, leading market shares in  tissue-based personal care products, as well as strong liquidity, are key  underpinnings to the rating. The company's high financial flexibility is derived  from its ability to consistently generate approximately $3 billion in operating  cash flow annually. The $3 billion level provides a good cushion for  discretionary activities after supporting capex and dividends in the $2.3  billion range.  Commitment to Rating Profile: Kimberly's management is mindful of the company's corporate ratings.  Discretionary activities such as share repurchases have been scaled back when  cash flows experience pressure or if fill-in acquisitions are required.   Moderate Leverage Expected: Kimberly's leverage could increase modestly after the planned spin-off of the  company's healthcare segment EBITDA later this year.  Halyard Health, Inc.  (Halyard) will be the name of the new company resulting from the proposed  spin-off.  Halyard filed its Form10-12B on May 6, 2014 reporting 2013 revenues  of almost $1.7 billion and EBITDA in the $290 million range.  If the spin had  concluded at the beginning of last year, Kimberly's leverage at the end of 2013  would still have been comfortable at nearly 1.6x and within the historical range  of 2x or less.  Pro forma leverage at 2013's year-end with the new $600 million  issuance would have modestly ticked up to the 1.7x range.  Nonetheless, the  modest potential increase is within Fitch's expectation of sub-2x leverage  through the medium term.   Intermittent Input Cost Pressures: Commodities used in the manufacturing  process, such as resin, pulp, and energy, experience periods of price volatility  which pressure margins. Ongoing cost saving programs, pricing in some markets,  and a more benign commodity environment in 2013 have led to sequential  improvement in EBIT margins to 16% this year from 13.7% in 2011. Commodity  inflation is expected to be muted in 2014 and should be offset by ongoing cost  savings. Additionally, exits from low-margin product lines in Europe and the  Halyard spin-off (whose 17% EBITDA margins are lower than Kimberly's 20%  average), all bode well for modest margin improvement.  Sizeable Liquidity: At March 31, 2014, Kimberly had $2.7 billion in liquidity  with almost $1.2 billion in cash on hand and a $1.5 billion unutilized revolver  maturing in October 2016. Long-term debt maturities through the remainder of  this year, in 2015, and 2016 is moderate at $700 million or less annually.   Kimberly has $700 million due this year comprised of a $200 million dealer  re-marketable security and a $506 million 5.417% redeemable preferred security.   The dealer re-marketable security has a final re-marketing date in December 2016  and is likely to be refinanced at the end of this year.  For remaining  maturities, the company has the flexibility to use cash on hand or refinance as  debt becomes due. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to an upgrade  include: The company has the flexibility to manage its credit metrics at stronger levels  given stable cash flows. Committing to leverage near 1x would supporting upward  migration. However, the company appears comfortable with its current ratings and  thus an upgrade does not appear likely.  Future developments that may potentially lead to a negative rating action  include: A change in financial strategy to operate with leverage above 2x, most likely  through a transformative acquisition, would be a negative driver. Such an event  would be assessed upon its occurrence.  Further, any impairment in the company's  ability to consistently generate operating cash flow in the $3 billion range  would be of concern. These could be caused by meaningful market share losses or  prolonged and significant increases in major commodities concurrent with an  inability to fully pass on price increases. Fitch currently rates Kimberly as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --$2 billion commercial paper (CP) program 'F1'; --$200 million dealer remarketable securities 'A'/'F1'; --$1.5 billion revolving credit facility 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures 'A'.  Fitch also rates Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.'s CP 'F1'.  CP issued by this  wholly-owned subsidiary is fully guaranteed by Kimberly.

Analysts say the company has been losing market share in its North America diaper business to larger rival Procter & Gamble Co, which makes Pampers.""The category has been very competitive and they're yet to come up with something to solve that problem,"" Lieberman said.North American sales in the company's personal care business, which includes Huggies and Kotex female hygiene products, fell 1 percent.High input costs and a stronger dollar have also been eating into Kimberly-Clark's operating profit. Kimberly-Clark, which had about 57,000 employees as of Dec. 31 including about 16,000 health care employees, said on Tuesday it expects the restructuring to cost $130 to $160 million after-tax and save $120 to $140 million before tax.""I would guess that the bulk of these headcount reductions are also going to be in developed markets, just simply knowing that the healthcare business was a more U.S.-focused business...,"" Lieberman said.The company said it expects $85 to $105 million of the after-tax charges to occur in the fourth quarter.Kimberly-Clark, whose healthcare business will be spun off on Oct. 31, cut its full-year profit forecast to $5.93-$6.03 per share from $6.00-$6.15 per share. Analysts on average had expected it to earn $6.07 per share for the full year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said it expects net sales to be hurt by stronger dollar for the year.The healthcare business, Kimberly-Clark's smallest, sells surgical and infection-prevention products for operating rooms and medical devices. Demand for protective gear is on the rise since the first U.S. patient was diagnosed with Ebola.The company said third-quarter sales increased to $5.44 billion from $5.26 billion a year earlier, and net income attributable to the company rose to $562 million, or $1.50 per share, from $546 million, or $1.42 per share.Excluding items, the company earned $1.61 per share.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.54 per share on revenue of $5.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of the company were up 2 percent at $110.14 on the New York Stock Exchange.

17,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar  Jan 23 Kimberly-Clark Corp is set to increase advertising and promotional spending for its diapers and launch new products in an escalating war with bigger rival Procter and Gamble Co in North America.Industry analysts say moms are either going upscale and choosing Pampers or going down-market with Luvs, both P&G brands, leaving Kimberly-Clark's mid-tier Huggies Snug & Dry line without a real identity.To compete better, Kimberly-Clark said on Friday it would cut prices and ""improve"" its Snug & Dry line starting this quarter, without giving details.Huggies is the core of Kimberly-Clark's baby care products business, which generates about $7 billion in annual sales. Pampers, P&G's largest brand, alone has sales of over $10 billion.""The consumer is shifting downward in price and they (Kimberly-Clark) don't have a lower-priced product,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj told Reuters. Dibadj said the company could play either end of the price spectrum: introduce a lower-priced brand or ""a product that is of such high quality that people are willing to pay more for it.""P&G and Kimberly-Clark control about 80 percent of the U.S diaper market, but the Kleenex maker is losing share, according to Euromonitor International data. Huggies' U.S. market share dropped to 8.50 percent in 2013 from 10.2 percent in 2008.Indeed, weakening sales of Huggies and other core products in North America is expected to lead to fall in sales in 2015, Kimberly-Clark said on Friday. Its shares fell 6 percent. To claw back market shares, Kimberly-Clark plans to launch new products this year and spend more on advertising them.Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman estimates the company could cough up about $500 million for these initiatives. Kimberly-Clark spent about $3.71 billion on marketing and research in fiscal 2014. P&G spent nearly triple, $9.73 billion, just on advertising in 2013.Lieberman said Luvs sells at a roughly 20 percent discount to Huggies Snug & Dry, with the magnitude of the discount varying with promotional activity.For example, the lowest-priced Huggies Snug & Dry 44-pack for a size 1 newborn baby costs $8.97, while P&G's 48-pack Luvs for the same size sells for $6.99, according to Wal-Mart Stores Inc's website.Luvs has been promoted for almost every week this year at one of P&G's main retail customers, Kimberly-Clark Chief Executive Thomas Falk said.""I think Luvs has picked up 2 share points so far this year.""

23,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Kimberly-Clark  Corporation's (KMB) ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --$2 billion commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1'; --$200 million dealer remarketable securities at 'A'/'F1'; --$2 billion revolving credit facility at 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately $6.5 billion of senior unsecured  notes, remarketable securities, debentures and commercial paper outstandings are  affected by this action. The revolver is unutilized. Previously, KMB's  commercial paper (CP) was issued by its fully guaranteed subsidiary,  Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.  This has been discontinued with CP issuances  through the parent, KMB. Total consolidated debt of almost $7 billion  encompasses the $6.5 billion mentioned above and certain unrated facilities such  as IRB's and local subsidiary debt. KEY ASSUMPTIONS: Net revenue declines at the upper end of the company's public guidance of 3% to  6% which includes KMB being able to obtain additional pricing to cover  depreciating currencies as an offset to the anticipated 8% to 9% currency  translation drag. However, price increases are likely to result in at least  short term volume declines as growth slows in economies such as Russia. The  Procter & Gamble Company experienced a slight decline in developing market  volume as it priced to offset foreign exchange devaluation across several  countries. Even in developed markets consumers have generally responded to price  increases with volume declines as pantries are drawn down. Attaining KMB's  public guidance for a 2%-3% increase in volumes is likely to be pressured. EBITDA margins tick modestly below last year's 20.8% with less sales than  expected over fixed costs. Based on Fitch's expectations for crude at $50/bbl in  2015 and $60/bbl in 2016, if currencies stabilize around current levels there is  likely to be larger deflation that could further firm margins. However, Fitch  has not factored the scenario into projections in order to be conservative. The company has very strong financial flexibility and will continue to manage to  strong credit protection measures within the current rating category KEY RATING DRIVERS Scale, Leadership in Stable Sector:  KMB's scale, with over $19 billion in revenues, leading market shares in  tissue-based personal care products, as well as strong liquidity, are key  underpinnings to the rating. The firm is a global hygiene company with  approximately 50% of net sales and 65% of operating profit (before Corporate &  Other expenses) generated in North America. Its principal products such as  Huggies diapers, Depends for adult incontinence and Andrex toilet paper occupy  leading positions in most markets. Euromonitor International cited that the  company's diaper/pant was the second leading brand in the U.S. with a 39% share  in 2013. Commitment to Rating Profile: KMB's management is mindful of the company's corporate ratings and publicly  states its commitment to operating within the 'A' category. Historically  discretionary activities such as share repurchases have been scaled back when  cash flows experience pressure or if fill-in acquisitions are required. The last  instance was in 2009 when the company suspended share repurchases and increased  the contribution to its pension plan by $716 million partially close the large  funding gap that developed after the financial crisis of 2008.  Modest Leverage Cushion: The company's leverage increased moderately to 1.7x from 1.5x as anticipated  after Halyard's cash flows were removed after the spin-off. If margins or  operating cash flow are weaker than expected, Fitch expects the company to scale  back some of its discretionary activities or reduce debt to maintain leverage at  or below 2x. KMB operates with leverage below 2x and should continue in this  fashion. As long as the company maintains its current business momentum which  includes solid levels of brand support and innovation, the company could add  nearly $1 billion in pro forma debt at Dec. 31, 2014 with minimal rating  implications Intermittent Input Cost Pressures:  Commodities used in the manufacturing process, such as resin, pulp, and energy,  experience periods of price volatility that can pressure margins. The near term  commodity outlook is benign and likely to be modestly deflationary given the  rapid decline in oil prices. However, longer-term, oil and other input costs  will generally remain volatile and may resume their general upward march. KMB  has addressed increased costs through ongoing and intermittent restructuring  programs, pricing in some markets, and exiting low margin regions and product  lines. The company has a long and successful track record of containing costs  and has had solid organic growth rates in the 3% to 5% range. As a result, there  have been sequential improvements in EBITDA margins to 20.8% in 2014 from 18.9%  in 2011. A focus on costs and organic growth should moderate or limit the  negative impact of future input cost spikes.  Sizeable Liquidity, Financial Flexibility:  At Dec. 31, 2014, Kimberly had very comfortable liquidity of $2.8 billion with  almost $800 million in cash on hand and a $2 billion unutilized revolver  maturing in June 2019. Most of the company's cash is normally held in  international markets and may not all be available to reduce debt balances.  Long-term debt maturities in the next two years are moderate at less than $600  million and are likely to be refinanced in order to maintain the current capital  structure and leverage in the 1.5x to 2x range. In 2015, the $200 million dealer  remarketable security, the $300 million 4.875% notes, and a $37 million IRB  mature.  The company's strong financial flexibility stems from its ability to  consistently generate approximately $3 billion in operating cash flow annually.  Operating cash flow is likely to fall below the 3 year average of $3 billion to  $2.5 to $3 billion in 2015 with pressure on margins and profits from a strong  U.S. dollar but should revert to historical levels in 2016 and thereafter.  Dividends and capex have a $2.3 billion run-rate and are the basics needed to  re-invest in the company and meet shareholder expectations. Fitch notes that KMB  has generated at least $2.3 billion in operating cash flow since 2002. FFO  Interest coverage has likewise been healthy in the 10x range. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to an upgrade  include: The company has the flexibility to manage its credit metrics at stronger levels  given stable cash flows. Committing to operating with leverage below 1.5x would  support upward migration. However, the company appears comfortable with its  current ratings and thus an upgrade does not appear likely. Future developments that may potentially lead to a negative rating action  include: A change in financial strategy to operate with leverage above 2x, most likely  through a large debt financed share repurchase program or a transformative  acquisition, would be a negative driver. Such an event would be assessed upon  its occurrence. Further, any impairment in the company's ability to consistently  generate operating cash flow in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range would be of  concern. These situations arise due to meaningful market share losses or  prolonged and significant increases in major commodities concurrent with an  inability to fully pass on price increases.

24,"  (Adds new exchange rate, paragraph 5)By Brian Ellsworth and Corina PonsCARACAS Feb 13 Venezuelans puzzled over the impact of a complicated currency devaluation and fretted that dire product shortages in the OPEC nation's recession-hit economy would not go away.President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government this week launched a 70 percent devaluation via a new ""free floating"" currency system known as Simadi, the third of three-tier exchange controls created by his predecessor Hugo Chavez.""They're doing this because they don't have any money,"" said a man who gave his name only as Felix, and who said he was 83.""This is not going to solve the problem,"" said Felix as he stood in a senior citizens' line with about 50 other people to buy rice and coffee at a Caracas supermarket. ""We're going to keep waiting in line to buy anything we need.""The Simadi system on Friday posted an exchange rate of 174 bolivars per dollar, but state officials insist most of the country's foreign exchange will be sold at two preferential rates: 6.3 for essential goods such as food staples, and 12 for other sectors.The country's central bank administers dollars at those two rates, but importers complain that allocations are limited, often delayed and require overwhelming paperwork.Dollars on the black market fetch 190 bolivars. The two preferential exchange rates of 6.3 and 12 can help keep prices down for food and medicine, but businesses consistently struggle to obtain dollars at the rate, which means they cannot bring in raw materials or machine parts.As a result, there are shortages of basic consumption goods ranging from chicken to laundry detergent, leading to occasional scuffles for scarce products.The scarcities and lines have contributed to a dip in Maduro's approval rating - to 22 percent according to one pollster - and give opponents hope of wresting control of parliament from the ruling Socialist Party in a vote later this year.Maduro says the country is a victim of an ""economic war,"" and argues that Venezuelans today are generally better off and better fed than they were before Chavez took office in 1999. IMPACT ON CORPORATE ACCOUNTS The devaluation is likely to ripple across the balance sheets of foreign corporations with significant exposure to Venezuela, ranging from household products maker Kimberly-Clark Corp to oil services company Schlumberger NV.Venezuelan bonds were up on Friday after the release of the exchange rate, as devaluations tend to reduce the cost of imports and free up more hard currency to pay debt.The benchmark Global 2027 was up 0.603 point to a price of 41.570 and a yield of 24.261 percent. Economists believe the benefits of devaluing are muted because the new Simadi system will receive only a fraction of the dollars that the government sells, with the vast majority being sold at preferential rates.Essentially, those who cannot obtain dollars at the other two rates will try to get the Simadi rate.""We remain skeptical about the impact this three-tiered FX system will have on an already stagflationary economy,"" wrote UBS economists in a research note. ""We believe that Simadi will, at most, remain a rather marginal FX allocation system.""Venezuela's bonds are trading at distressed levels on concerns that the rout in oil prices could prompt a default, and on average pay 26 percentage points more than comparable U.S. Treasury bills. Maduro dismisses default talk as ill-intentioned rumor mongering.Unlike previous devaluations, when Venezuelans crowded electronics shops to pick up appliances before prices rose, lines were scant on Friday because low inventories have left shelves largely bare.""The last televisions we sold arrived in November and were gone the same day,"" said a salesman at one popular electronics shop, who asked not to be named. ""If they come at the black market rate, I think people would buy them no matter the price.""Other Venezuelans worried that inflation, already the worst in the Americas at an officially estimated 64 percent last year, would spike even further. ""Everything's going to carry on being tough,"" said a 38-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Josefina, in a Caracas shopping line of about 100 people.Opposition leaders complained that Maduro had disguised the devaluation, which came via an Excel sheet on the central bank's website, and sought to distract Venezuelans by simultaneously denouncing a coup plot in the air force.

25,"  (Adds details, background, shares)Feb 23 Kimberly-Clark Corp is transferring responsibility for payment of U.S. pensions to two insurers, a move it said would cut its projected benefit obligation by about $2.5 billion but result in a charge of $800 million in the second quarter.The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers joins companies including Timken Co and TRW Automotive Holdings Corp unit TRW in transferring its pension obligations to insurers as a way to reduce risk.Insurance premiums have been rising, largely because of low interest rates, while retirees are living longer, creating a larger burden on companies' pension pots. Kimberly-Clark said on Monday it would buy group annuity contracts to transfer obligations for about 21,000 retirees to Prudential Insurance Co of America and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co (MassMutual). The company said last month it expected net sales to shrink in 2015 due to the strong dollar and weak demand for its core products in North America.On Monday, Kimberly-Clark said it would make a $400-$475 million contribution to its U.S. pension plan to support the transfer, in addition to $100 million it had planned to contribute in 2015. Prudential and MassMutual will share benefit payments equally, while Prudential will be sole provider of administrative services starting June 1.Kimberly-Clark's shares were down slightly at $110.83 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Net selling prices in the company's personal care business, the company's biggest revenue contributor, rose 2 percent and sales volumes increased 4 percent in the first quarter ended March 31.Kimberly-Clark also benefited from cost savings of $10 million in the quarter due to a restructuring program started in 2014.A 5.9 percent drop in costs of goods sold helped the company offset a 4 percent drop in quarterly sales and boost its gross margin 140 basis points to 35.6 percent. However, Kimberly-Clark, which gets about half of its sales from outside North America, said it expects foreign currency to hurt 2015 sales by 9-10 percent in 2015.It had earlier expected an impact of 8-9 percent.A strong dollar reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars. The strong dollar wiped out 9 percent of Kimberly-Clark's in sales in the first quarter, but sales of $4.69 billion still topped analysts' average estimate of $4.61 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income attributable to Kimberly-Clark fell 13 percent to $468 million, or $1.27 per share.Excluding items, the company earned $1.42 per share, higher than analysts' average estimate of $1.33.The company said it spent $150 million in acquiring the remainder of its Israeli subsidiary and hence cut its 2015 share buyback program to $700-$900 million from $800 million to $1 billion.Up to Monday's close, Kimberly-Clark's stock had fallen more than 7 percent this year, while the S&P 500 index had climbed 2 percent.

30,"  (Adds Kimberly-Clark comment, background in paragraphs 4-7)SAO PAULO Oct 22 Hypermarcas SA, the largest Brazilian producer of personal care goods, is in advanced talks to sell a unit that manufactures diapers to Kimberly-Clark Corp, sharpening the company's focus on pharmaceuticals, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.The source, who declined to be identified because the negotiations are under way, did not give a price tag for the transaction. A deal will be announced in coming days, the source added. São Paulo-based Hypermarcas had hired Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Banco Bradesco BBI to find alternatives for the diaper unit, sources told Reuters recently. The alternatives included a potential spin-off, partnerships or might even involve an asset sale, according to a securities filing unveiled in early May.Hypermarcas had no immediate comment. Kimberly-Clark spokesman Bob Brand said the company does not comment on rumor or speculation. According to the source, Hypermarcas wanted to exit the diaper market because performance was hobbled by the lack of scale, brand recognition and the rising cost of imported materials for the product amid a sharp drop in Brazil's currency, the real. The diaper unit earned about 860 million reais in revenue last year, according to the filing. Hypermarcas is also the largest maker of over-the-counter medicines in Brazil.Apart from Kimberly-Clark, Hypermarcas had also offered the unit to a group of companies that included Chile's Empresas CMPC SA, Procter & Gamble Co and Svenska Cellulosa SCA AB. Initially Hypermarcas aimed to raise about 1.5 billion reais ($385 million) with the sale of the unit, which owns the Sapeka and Pompom brands.

31,"  (Adds comments from Indecopi at press conference)SANTIAGO/LIMA Dec 15 Peru's consumer regulator said Tuesday that it could sanction Kimberly-Clark Corp  with a fine of up to 12 percent of its earnings after competitor CMPC reported the two toilet paper companies fixed prices for years.The local subsidiaries of the two companies, which together control 88 percent of the toilet and tissue paper market in Peru, are under investigation for suspected price collusion in the South American country between 2005 and 2014, said regulator Indecopi.The case follows a similar one in neighboring Chile, where CMPC and a subsidiary of Swedish-owned SCA were found by antitrust authorities in October to have colluded for at least a decade in Chile's tissue paper market.CMPC, which is headquartered in Santiago and run by one of Chile's wealthiest families, escaped a fine in its home country because it admitting wrongdoing early on, although it has taken a hit to its reputation and the government has demanded that it come up with a ""compensation plan"" for consumers. Under Peru's anti-trust clemency program, CMPC's subsidiary Protisa can also avoid fines if it continues to collaborate with authorities, said Jesus Espinoza, secretary of Indecopi's defense of competition commission.""Protisa contributed information relevant to showing anti-competitive behavior,"" Espinoza said at a press conference.Kimberly-Clark cannot take refuge in the clemency program because it did not go to authorities first, Espinoza said. The fines could range from 8 to 12 percent of earnings, Espinoza said, adding that authorities would evaluate whether that should apply to global or local earnings at the end of the investigation.Some 13 officials or former employees of Kimberly-Clark also face possible sanctions, as well as four from CMPC, said Espinoza. The number could rise as the probe continues. Kimberly Clark Peru said in a statement that it ""will offer Indecopi absolute and total cooperation with the investigation"". It did not comment on the veracity of the allegations.CMPC, one of the region's largest forestry and paper firms, said it did not expect a significant financial impact from the Peruvian charges and ""energetically rejected the behaviors that are the cause of the charges"".Kimberly-Clark, which owns the brands Suave, Kleenex and Scott, controls about 33 percent of the local market. Protisa dominates about 55 percent, said Indecopi.Peru does not regulate market concentration and cannot revoke operating licenses because of collusion, Espinoza said.

Filed on Tuesday in a Manhattan federal court, the proposed class action is based largely on a 60 Minutes segment in May that reported Halyard's gowns did not consistently meet industry standards, with some sleeve seams failing in three out of four batches during government-commissioned tests.

It said it had been unable to obtain raw materials or hard currency and had been adversely affected by high inflation.""The combination of these factors makes it impossible to continue our business at this time,"" Kimberly-Clark said in a statement.

Kimberly-Clark in 2013 agreed to invest the equivalent of $37 million to boost toilet paper production, according to a state media report at the time, as part of efforts to ease an embarrassing shortage of the product.

40,"  CARACAS Venezuela's socialist government said on Monday it was taking over and re-activating a plant that U.S. personal care products maker Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) halted due to the nation's economic crisis.Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissues, said at the weekend it was halting its two-decade Venezuela operations as it was unable to obtain raw materials or hard currency and was struggling with high inflation. But Labor Minister Oswaldo Vera appeared at its plant, in the central provincial city of Maracay, on Monday surrounded by workers who he said were re-starting operations immediately.""Kimberly-Clark is going to continue producing, now in the hands of the workers,"" he told state TV. ""We've just turned on the first engine.""It was unclear how the plant would continue producing if there were insufficient raw materials. After U.S. cleaning products maker Clorox Co(CLX.N) pulled out of Venezuela in 2014, the government also announced workers would take over, but the products it made are hard to find.   Critics say nationalizations and takeovers during 17 years of socialist rule in Venezuela, under Hugo Chavez from 1999-2013 and now under President Nicolas Maduro, destroyed local production and cowed private business. In a statement on Monday after news of the takeover, Kimberly-Clark ratified its decision to suspend operations ""due to circumstances beyond its control"" and expressed concern for the safety of former employees in Venezuela. ""If the Venezuelan government takes control of Kimberly-Clark facilities and operations, it will be responsible for the well-being of the workers and the physical assets, equipment and machinery in the facilities going forward,"" it added.Despite having the world's largest oil reserves, the South American OPEC nation is suffering a severe crisis, with the economy shrinking since early 2014, inflation the highest in the world, and basic food and products increasingly scarce.

48,"   By Corina Pons and Eyanir Chinea | CARACAS  CARACAS Nov 15 Multinational companies are selling their Venezuelan operations at hefty discounts - or even giving them away - as they to seek to escape the OPEC nation's soaring inflation and chronic supply shortages.Six firms, including General Mills and oil producer Harvest Natural Resources, have sold operations for as little as half their assessed value on the companies' books, according to securities filings and interviews with a dozen people knowledgeable about the deals.One company, U.S. autoparts-maker Dana, last year sold its debt-laden Venezuela operations to a local buyer for no cash compensation. Two multinational corporations - Clorox  and Kimberly-Clark - chose instead to abandon their operations here.Sell-offs by foreign companies could further isolate Venezuela's economy, which is already reeling from low oil prices and an unraveling socialist system. The fire-sale trend will likely accelerate as the crisis continues to cripple the local operations of more multinational firms, according to two private-sector sources familiar with similar deals in the works.Firms acquiring such distressed operations, however, could reap huge gains if the country's economy improves.Corimon - a Caracas firm best known for production of paint - in May purchased the local operations of Bridgestone Corp, the world's largest tire-maker. Corimon will continue to produce tires under the Firestone brand.Carlos Gill, president of Corimon's holding company, declined to disclose the sale terms but called the timing of the purchase ""an opportune moment"" for his company.Bridgestone declined to comment.The sold-off operations, in some cases, were all but defunct before the deals because of chronic shortages of raw materials ranging from sugar to steel bars, as well as triple-digit inflation and difficulty exchanging a crashing local currency for dollars.""A company that isn't operating is a corpse, and the vultures start to circle it,"" said Juan Pablo Olalquiaga, president of Venezuelan industry association Conindustria.SOLD 'FOR NO CONSIDERATION' President Nicolas Maduro has blamed the country's woes on an ""economic war"" launched by U.S. business elites and encouraged by Washington politicians. Maduro has said companies are intentionally slowing production or hoarding goods to destabilize his government.The Venezuelan government's Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.For years, Venezuela operations generated major revenue for Fortune 500 companies because high oil prices allowed the government to sell subsidized dollars through its exchange control system, boosting companies' local buying power. But the 2014 oil price crash left Venezuela short of dollars because the country depends on oil for almost all its foreign exchange.More companies are deciding the country's challenges now outweigh any benefits. General Mills - owner of locally popular Diablitos Underwood deviled ham - reported in a filing earlier this year that it had taken a $38 million pre-tax loss on the sale of its local unit to an undisclosed third party. Negotiations dragged on for nine months as the economy tanked, forcing General Mills to steadily lower the price, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the talks. General Mills did not disclose the sale price and declined to comment to Reuters.Insurer Liberty Mutual said in statement last year that it was selling its local affiliate, Seguros Caracas, to a local entrepreneur, Humberto Gil. One source familiar with the deal described the arrangement as a ""gift.""Gil did not respond to requests for comment on the sale, which still needs approval from Venezuela's insurance regulator. Liberty Mutual did not respond to requests for comment.In 2014, Danish conglomerate The East Asiatic Company (EAC) sold its Venezuelan food business, Plumrose, to Liechtenstein-based Valartis Opportunities Fund. Neither company responded to requests for comment.U.S. auto parts firm Dana said in a 2015 filing that it had sold its local affiliate ""for no consideration"" to a Venezuelan firm called Manufacturing and Logistics Solutions.While auto sales soared during the oil-boom era of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, they dropped 80 percent in 2014 as Venezuela's economy ran into hard times.Dana sold the company for no payment, though it did secure an agreement that Dana would continue to supply raw materials and that the buyer would assume debts.""After 49 years here, Dana couldn't exactly walk away from the company,"" said Jose Hernandez, who was on the board of directors of Dana's local unit and stayed on after the sale. WRITING OFF VENEZUELA Some companies did decide to walk away, an unusual move.Despite mounting losses, companies rarely shut down businesses in Venezuela because they can face government accusations of economic sabotage or have managers imprisoned.But Cleaning supplies company Clorox and personal hygiene products manufacturer Kimberly-Clark shuttered their operations as their facilities nearly ground to a halt for lack of raw materials.Clorox, which left in 2014, said in a statement at the time that its Venezuela business was ""no longer viable."" Kimberly-Clark suspended operations this year, citing inability to obtain raw materials or hard currency.Both were taken over by the Venezuelan government and have resumed operations under state control. Jorge Arreaza, Vice President at the time, accused Clorox of setting an ""evil example"" by leaving. Labor Minister Oswaldo Vera said Kimberly Clark threw ""thousands of workers onto the street.""Both companies declined further comment on their Venezuela exit. Other companies are writing down the value of their Venezuela operations through an accounting mechanism known a deconsolidation, which could signal that more sell-offs are in the offing.The maneuver, already used by more than a dozen multinationals, involves a one-time write-off of the entire value of a company's subsidiaries. It is meant to avoid a constant trickle of balance-sheet losses caused by repeatedly slashing the worth of assets that are valued in Venezuelan currency.It also creates incentives for Venezuelan buyers to put in bids for local factories and other assets.Bridgestone, before selling its Venezuela operations to Corimon in May, deconsolidated its Venezuela operations in 2015 and reported an associated loss of $350 million.Ford Motor Co and Oreo-cookie manufacturer Mondelez International Inc are among those who have written off their assets because of severe operational difficulties.Ford told Reuters it remains ""hopeful that the government will resolve local issues, and we can then begin to support the Venezuelan people with additional production."" Mondelez said it would continue to manufacture products ""to the extent that we can locally fund operations and access necessary materials and labor.""GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION Last month's sale of the Venezuela operations of Harvest Natural Resources offered a rare opportunity for local investors to gain a foothold in the Venezuela oil industry, which is dominated by state-run firm PDVSA and large foreign energy companies.PDVSA has for years been delaying payment to business partners, including Houston-based Harvest. Struggling to make up those losses, Harvest in 2013 negotiated a $400 million asset sale with Petroandina Resources Corp, a unit of Argentina's Pluspetrol Resources Corp, according to a Harvest filing from March.Harvest Natural Resources said in an August filing that Venezuelan government blocked the deal. Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino told Reuters in 2015 the government rejected the sale because the buyers did not have sufficient financing capacity.Harvest declined to comment, but the company said in its filing that the deal's failure made clear that the government would not approve acquisitions by buyers based outside Venezuela.The company in October ended up successfully selling its operations to Delta Petroleum, which is owned by Venezuelan businessman Oswaldo Cisneros.Cisneros did not respond to requests for comment.Principally known as a telecom magnate, Cisneros is making his first forays in to the oil business this year - and got a considerably better deal that what Petroandina negotiated, according to Harvest filings. Cisneros acquired the assets for$143.2 million, including legal fees and settling of Harvest debts, or about a third of what Argentina's Pluspetrol had agreed to pay.
