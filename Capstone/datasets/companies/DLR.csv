2,"   By Liana B. Baker and Mike Stone  Digital Realty Trust Inc is working on a bid to acquire private equity-owned data center peer Telx Group Inc for more than $2 billion, in a deal that would diversify its business, according to people familiar with the matter. Digital Realty's move is the latest sign of consolidation in the data center sector, as U.S. businesses' burgeoning demand for data and video is fueling a revival in fiber optic services and data storage.Digital Realty, a San Francisco-based real estate investment trust that rents out space that companies use for data centers, is one of several U.S. and international bidders for Telx, the people said this week. The auction for Telx, which is owned by ABRY Partners LLC and Berkshire Partners LLC, is at its early stages, the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential. Telx, Digital Realty and Berkshire Partners declined to comment, while ABRY Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Privately-held data center companies have been selling to larger publicly traded rivals in recent months, with Digital Realty rival QTS Realty Trust Inc buying Carpathia Hosting, fiber network company Zayo Group Holdings Inc buying Latisys and CyrusOne purchasing Cervalis.The sale of Telx, however, would be the largest deal in the sector since Equinix said last month it would buy British peer TelecityGroup for 2.35 billion pounds ($3.6 billion).Digital Realty's primary business is wholesale colocation, where customers rent physical space from the company to run their own data centers.  Retail colocation, where customers lease cabinets, racks and cages from the data center operator, has become a growing business for Digital Realty, and buying Telx would help expand that business. Reuters first reported April 28 that Telx was exploring a sale. When asked on May 5 by an equities analyst about whether Telx would be a good fit for the company, Digital Realty's Chief Investment Officer Scott Peterson said May 5 that ""it's reasonable to assume that there's some compelling strategic rationale around that."" He did not comment on whether his company would bid for Telx.Based in New York, Telx owns 20 data centers, including three major ones in New York City. Its customers range from small businesses that only need half of a cabinet in data centers to global companies requiring a full-floor lease.  (Reporting by Liana B.

15,"   By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis  Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP is exploring a sale of Vantage Data Centers Management Co LLC that it hopes will value the U.S. company at well in excess of $1 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The sale process for Vantage comes amid a wave of similar deals being attempted as the sector consolidates, with real estate investment trusts and buyout firms lured by the stable cash flows some of these businesses promise.Silver Lake has hired investment banks Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) and DH Capital to run an auction for Vantage, the people said.While the sale process has attracted interest from both strategic and financial investors, Silver Lake may decide not to sell the company if the offers it receives are not satisfactory, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter was not public. Silver Lake declined to comment, while Vantage Data Centers, Royal Bank of Canada and DH Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Vantage Data Centers, based in Santa Clara, California, was formed in 2010 when Silver Lake acquired a data center campus formerly owned by Intel Corp (INTC.O). Vantage also operates a data center campus in Quincy, Washington.  U.S. businesses' burgeoning demand for data and video is fueling a revival in fiber optic services and data storage. Many technology companies have turned to vendors such as Vantage to host and maintain their servers in a bid to cut costs.Telecommunications firms such as Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N) have been seeking to sell their data center portfolios.  Private equity firms or companies that specialize in data centers, such as Equinix Inc (EQIX.O) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR.O, have been active buyers of assets.  (Reporting by Liana B.
