8,"   By Lehar Maan and Abhirup Roy | Sept 8  Sept 8 U.S. network gear makers are bracing for slower revenue growth in the second half of the year as telecom operators, their main customers, postpone spending until the dust settles on several big mergers.Telecom giants AT&T Inc and Sprint Corp are taking time to decide whether to upgrade existing wired networks or roll out 4G networks, forcing gear makers to cut expectations for what is usually the stronger half of their year.Ciena Corp and Finisar Corp last week joined their peers in forecasting a weak current quarter, citing delays on closing sales to customers in North America. Analysts say a slowdown could last two or three quarters.AT&T is set to buy DirecTV for $48.5 billion and Deutsche Telekom AG is seeking buyers for T-Mobile US Inc after the collapse of a sale to Sprint - which itself was bought last year by Japan's Softbank Corp.""When deals get done, when operators come together, typically the vendors experience a pause,"" said Simon Leopold, analyst at Raymond James. Most affected by the slowdown in orders will be those network gear makers with the greatest exposure to the telecoms business, such as Ciena, Juniper Networks Inc and JDS Uniphase Corp.Others, including F5 Networks Inc, have been spared the brunt of the slowdown in telecom spending as they get a large chunk of their revenue from enterprise customers, who are still spending to upgrade networks and guarding data from hackers. Shares of F5 Networks and Aruba Networks Inc, another company with greater exposure to enterprise customers, rose 11 percent and 21 percent respectively between the end of June and Friday's close.In contrast, shares of Juniper, Ciena and JDS Uniphase have fallen between 5 percent and 11 percent in the same period.At least 11 brokerages cut their price target on Juniper's stock after the company reported results in July, while at least 10 raised their target on F5 Networks after the company reported. Mergers between U.S. telecom companies were affecting spending decisions, which in turn could delay some of Ciena's projects, Chief Executive Gary Smith said on a post-earnings conference call last Thursday .U.S. network gear makers have grown accustomed to strong results in the final two quarters of the calendar year, riding high on a decade-long trend among telecom operators of spending big in the second half.The reverse will be true this year. Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie said telecom operators would spend about 45 percent of their budget in the second half versus 55 percent in a typical year.""The investor position is relatively cautious for the next couple of quarters,"" said UBS Equities analyst Amitabh Passi.

A source told Reuters Wednesday the Executive Board had proposed that the bank buys 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in bonds per month from March. * Equities rose on that report, with many U.S. stocks standing to benefit from accommodative programs in Europe, one of the United States' key trading partners.* ECB President Mario Draghi will speak to the media at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), and if the details of the plan are perceived as inadequate to return inflation to target, that could spur market losses, especially with the benchmark S&P 500 within 3 percent of its record closing high.* American Express Co late Wednesday reported revenue growth of 6.6 percent, though the credit card company also said it would cut more than 4,000 jobs this year as expenses and provisions for bad loans rose.  Shares dipped 1.7 percent to $86.20 in light premarket trading. * F5 Networks Inc slumped 15.4 percent to $106.50 in premarket trading after the network equipment maker reported revenue that missed expectations for the first time in eight quarters. It also forecast current-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates.* Shares of online auction site eBay Inc rose 3 percent before the opening bell, a day after it said it was exploring a sale or public offering of its enterprise unit, and announced an agreement with activist investor Carl Icahn that will give investors a greater say in its PayPal payments unit once it is spun off.* U.S. crude futures rose 1.6 percent to $48.56 per barrel, the third time the commodity has advanced more than 1.5 percent in the past four sessions. The recent trend could indicate that crude prices have found a floor after dropping by more than half since June. Despite the advance, oil remains mildly lower on the week, putting it on track for its 15th negative week out of the last 17. * Investors were looking ahead to jobless claims data due at 8:30 a.m., which is expected to show a drop by 16,000 to 300,000 in the latest week.Futures snapshot at 6:54 a.m.:* S&P 500 e-minis were up 4.5 points, or 0.22 percent, with 87,593 contracts changing hands.* Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 4.75 points, or 0.11 percent, in volume of 16,667 contracts.* Dow e-minis were up 42 points, or 0.24 percent, with 12,061 contracts changing hands.

29,"   By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis  F5 Networks Inc (FFIV.O), a U.S. computer networking company whose technology helps speed up data center traffic, has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) following  takeover approaches, people familiar with the matter said.The approaches come as F5 seeks to roll out products with new security features and revitalize its growth, as smaller rivals that take advantage of advances in cloud computing make the networking services market ever more competitive.F5 is working with Goldman Sachs to field expressions of interest in an acquisition and decide on its next steps, the people said this week, without identifying the parties that approached the company.F5 has attracted takeover interest in previous years, and there is no certainty that the latest approaches will lead to any deal, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. F5 and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. F5 shares ended trading on Tuesday in New York up 12.6 percent at $123.94 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $8.3 billion.Based in Seattle, Washington, F5 develops products aimed at boosting the security, performance and availability of data centers, applications and servers.F5 has been seeking to reassure investors over unexpected changes in its top management in recent months. At the end of last year, its newly appointed chief executive officer of six months, Manny Rivelo, resigned because of personal conduct matters. Rivelo was replaced by John McAdam, a longtime F5 executive and former CEO, who came out of retirement to take over as president and CEO while the company underwent a formal search for a new chief executive. That search is no longer underway and McAdam said at an investor conference in March that he was ""back for good.""  Reuters reported in 2010 that F5 Networks had previously attracted interest from companies that included IBM Corp (IBM.N), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Juniper Networks (JNPR.N).On its second-quarter earnings call, F5 said it was experiencing a decline in bookings because of softness in the financial and telecommunications carrier markets, which represent a major source of business for the company.
