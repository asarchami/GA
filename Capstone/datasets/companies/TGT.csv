0,"   By Dhanya Skariachan and Jim Finkle | NEW YORK/BOSTON  NEW YORK/BOSTON The data breach at Target Corp over the holiday shopping season was far bigger than initially thought, the U.S. company said on Friday, as state prosecutors announced a nationwide probe into the second-biggest retail cyber attack on record.Target said an investigation has found that the hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Previously, the No.3 U.S. retailer said the hackers stole data from 40 million credit and debit cards.The two sets of numbers likely contained some overlap, but the extent was not clear, according to Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder. She also noted that some of the victims did not shop at Target stores during the period of the breach between November 27 and December 15, and their personal information was stolen from a database.""I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this,"" Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said in the statement on Friday.Attorneys general from New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota said they were joining a nationwide probe into the security breach. A source familiar with the joint probe said more than 30 states were involved.""A breach of this magnitude is extremely disconcerting and we are participating in a multi-state investigation to discover the circumstances that led to this breach,"" said Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley.Security experts said the stolen payment card data could be used to fabricate false magnetic strip credit cards. And the personal information could be sold on underground exchanges for use in email ""phishing"" campaigns, aimed at persuading victims to hand over even more sensitive information, such as bank account numbers.""I think they still have no idea how big this is,"" said David Kennedy, a former U.S. Marine Corps cyber-intelligence analyst who runs his own consulting firm, TrustedSec LLC.Target lowered its fourth-quarter profit forecast, in part due to weaker-than-expected sales since reports of the cyber-attack emerged in mid-December. Target shares closed down just over 1 percent to $62.62, hovering near a year-low.The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 was at TJX Cos Inc, where more than 90 million credit cards were stolen over about 18 months.FRAUD REPORTS GROWING  Reports of fraudulent card charges have been growing since the Target breach was disclosed, said an executive at one major card issuer who asked not to be identified.The full magnitude of the damage will not likely be known until later in January, when customers receive and examine their monthly statements and call their banks, the executive said. He added that, in past cases, it has taken 30 to 45 days for the vast majority of bad charges to surface.Target and credit card issuers have said customers will have zero liability for the cost of any fraudulent charges.Harlan Loeb, global chairman of the crisis & risk management practice at Edelman, said Target should have been more proactive in communicating with its customers. He thinks Target will have a tougher task containing the situation than TJX did.""The game has changed so dramatically since 2007,"" Loeb said, citing ""the dramatic escalation of information channels and the sophistication of hackers"" since then.""The one thing that should be part of any crisis plan is the specter that you might have to be in communication with hundreds of thousands of customers instantly,"" Loeb said. ""There was an element of that missing"" in Target's case. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 40 percent of people who shopped at Target during the period of the data breach had not been notified about the incident. Thirty-one percent said they had been notified by Target and 28 percent said they had been notified by their bank or credit card company. The results represent 640 surveys conducted from January 2 to January 10 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.In the wake of the Target breach, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy introduced on Wednesday a new version of a 2005 bill that seeks to improve how companies protect consumer data from cyber thieves.It would set criminal penalties for intentional or willful concealing of a personal data breach that causes economic damage to consumers, and ensure that conspiring or attempting to commit computer fraud would face the same penalties as completed offenses.""This is a terrible situation and it's upsetting to see that the scope of this breach is larger than first thought,"" said Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, who is one of three Democrats currently signed on to Leahy's bill as co-sponsors.""Data breaches like this one, and past breaches such as at T.J. Maxx and Sony PlayStation, raise important questions about the responsibilities corporations have to protect consumer data and inform their customers when data have been compromised."" Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, is also co-sponsoring the bill.""Disclosures about Target's even broader breaches of customer information will rightly add alarm and anger. Now, more than ever, an FTC investigation is necessary - and should be publicly confirmed - so that consumers know their rights and interests are protected,"" Blumenthal said in a statement.The Federal Trade Commission privacy spokesman declined to comment, saying the agency does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.Data breach laws are more specific on the state level and the FTC can only bring lawsuits under the FTC Act against companies if they are deemed to not have protected the data properly.TOTAL COST UNKNOWN On Friday, Target cut its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings forecast for U.S. operations to between $1.20 and $1.30 per share from $1.50 to $1.60. The Minneapolis-based company also forecast a 2.5 percent decline in fourth-quarter same-store sales. It had forecast flat sales.Target expects full-year earnings per share to include charges related to the data breach, but said it could not estimate the costs.Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser described Target's holiday sales report card as ""dismal.""""We all knew it was going to be bad at Target, but it was the magnitude of decline that was unclear,"" he said.

2,"   By Beth Pinsker and Mitch Lipka | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The number of people affected by Target's data breach during the holiday season is now expected to be least 70 million, up from the company's original estimate of 40 million. That means many more people need to assess their credit and debit card security.Late last year, Target reported that thieves stole cardholder names, card numbers and three-digit security codes between November 27 and December 15, and that information could be used at any point to commit fraud. Now the retailer says additional personal information was stolen, including email addresses and phone numbers.""I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken, and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this,"" Target's chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, said in a statement.If you shopped at Target during that time period -- or at other times -- and are worried about your accounts, here are answers from experts on the most frequent questions:Q: How did the hackers get phone numbers, street and email addresses? Is this kind of data included in store transactions?A: Target is still investigating the incident, which is why the number of people affected and the scope of the breach keeps changing.The information stored on the magnetic stripe on a credit or debit card will not pass along a home address or email address from an in-store swipe. But other cards may share additional info, like a store-brand credit card that requires the user to provide that data at sign-up.If thieves have this information, it could also mean online purchases are affected, said Robert Siciliano, online security expert for Internet security company McAfee Inc. ""There is certainly more to this story,"" he says.Q: How do you know if your information is stolen?A: It's impossible to know if your data has been stolen and if it might be used for fraud, but it is a growing problem and consumers need to be on alert. The number of people notified after a data breach that they were victimized by fraud rose by 340 percent between 2010 and 2012, according to a recent report from Javelin Strategy & Research. Q: What should Target customers do?A: At a minimum, customers who shopped at Target during the affected period with a debit card should change their PIN, the personal identification number. You can also request a new debit card from the issuer.Credit card users can change passwords or ask for a new card, but that may be more trouble than it's worth and give a false sense of security because the new card is just as vulnerable.""It is going to quite a hassle to update all of your subscriptions and services attached to that card,"" said Yaron Samid, chief executive of BillGuard, a company that offers a free service monitoring credit and debit cards for unusual activity. ""The only way to protect yourself is to pay close attention to your credit card activity.""Target says it is offering one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to all Target customers who shopped at U.S. stores.Target customers have three months to enroll in the program. The company says it will announce additional details next week. Customers who have additional questions can call Target's hotline at 866-852-8680.Q: What should all consumers do?A: The first line of defense for all credit and debit card holders is to closely monitor your credit and debit card statements all the time, say security experts.If charges are not disputed, a thief will know the information is valid, allowing the card to be used again illegally, said Yaron Samid, chief executive of BillGuard, a company that offers a free service monitoring credit and debit cards for unusual activity. Fraudulent charges are often small in scope, because thieves know they are less likely to be noticed.If you dispute a charge on a credit card, the issuer will typically credit that amount back to you, and then investigate. With debit cards, which have fewer protections against fraud, the bank will decide to investigate, then decide when and if to credit the amount back to your account.The most aggressive action a consumer can take is to freeze their accounts, which restricts access to your credit report. That can stop account fraud cold when crooks apply for credit using your information, though lifting a credit freeze if you want to apply for a loan or a new credit card is a bit cumbersome. It involves a password-protected process and often carries a fee. It might take up to three days.Q: How are consumers at further risk than just their debit card and PINs being stolen?A: Any personal information stolen, like email addresses and phone numbers, could be used for other identity theft ""phishing"" attacks, where a criminal contacts a person looking for even more information and access to accounts.In the Target data breach, piggyback attacks could come from scammers pretending to be banks or credit card issuers, asking you for even more information, particularly your Social Security number, warns Siciliano.""The goal of the bad guy is always to get a credit card under your name -- to take one over or get a new one,"" said Siciliano.The good news is that in order to do that, a thief needs your Social Security number, and Social Security information was not passed along in this breach, Siciliano notes. The bad news is that thieves will work during a long period of time to bait you for sensitive information, luring you in with what they already have stolen, he adds.To combat this, he recommends identity theft protection for everyone, which his company sells. ""Without it, you're a sitting duck,"" Siciliano said.(Follow us @ReutersMoney or hereEditing by Lauren Young and Leslie Adler)",2014-01-10,TGT,"Fri Jan 10, 2014 | 4:38pm EST",Factbox: How to deal with Target's data breach,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-credit-theft-tips-idUSBREA0915320140110?type=companyNews

Maxx and Marshalls chains, where more than 90 million credit cards were stolen over about 18 months.On Friday, Neiman Marcus revealed it too had been the victim of a security breach. The high-end department store was informed by its credit-card processor in mid-December of possible unauthorized card activity that followed customer purchases at Neiman Marcus stores, spokeswoman Ginger Reeder said.A subsequent investigation turned up evidence on Jan. 1 of a ""criminal cybersecurity intrusion"" that may have compromised an unknown number of customers' cards, the company said.Neiman Marcus, owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and private equity firm Ares Management LLC, is still investigating and said it did not know at this time how many customers may have been affected. Nor was it immediately clear whether it was linked to the Target incident.FRAUD REPORTS GROWING Reports of fraudulent card charges have been growing since the Target breach was disclosed, said an executive at one major card issuer who asked not to be identified.The full magnitude of the damage will not likely be known until later in January, when customers receive and examine their monthly statements and call their banks, the executive said.

6,"   By Jim Finkle and Mark Hosenball | BOSTON/WASHINGTON  BOSTON/WASHINGTON Target Corp and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holiday shopping season last year, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed.Smaller breaches on at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Those breaches have yet to come to light. Also, similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year.The sources said that they involved retailers with outlets in malls, but declined to elaborate. They also said that while they suspect the perpetrators may be the same as those who launched the Target attack, they cannot be sure because they are still trying to find the culprits behind all of the security breaches.Law enforcement sources have said they suspect the ring leaders are from Eastern Europe, which is where most big cyber crime cases have been hatched over the past decade.Only one well-known retailer, Neiman Marcus, has said that they too have been victim of a cyber attack since Target's December 19 disclosure that some 40 million payment card numbers had been stolen in a cyber attack. On Friday, Target said the data breach was worse than initially thought.An investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Neiman Marcus said it was not sure if the breach was related to the Target incident.Most states have laws that require companies to contact customers when certain personal information is compromised. In many cases the task of notification falls on the credit card issuer.Merchants are required to report breaches of personal information including social security numbers. It was not immediately clear if that was the case with the retailers who were attacked around the same time as Target.The Secret Service and Department of Justice, which are investigating the Target breach, declined to comment on Saturday.SCRAPING MEMORY Target has not disclosed how the attackers managed to breach its network or siphon off some of its most sensitive data.The sources who spoke to Reuters about the breaches said that investigators believe the attackers used similar techniques and pieces of malicious software to steal data from Target and other retailers. One of the pieces of malware they used was something known as a RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, where it appears in plain text, the sources said.While the technology has been around for many years, its use has increased in recent years as retailers have improved their security, making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches.Visa Inc issued two alerts last year about a surge in cyber attacks on retailers that specifically warned about the threat from memory parsing malware.The alerts, published in April and August, provided retailers with technical details on how the attacks were launched and advice on thwarting them.A Visa spokeswoman declined comment on the reports, which did not identify specific victims.It was not clear whether Target's security team had implemented the measures that Visa had recommended to mitigate the risks of being attacked. Yet a law enforcement source familiar with the breach said that even if the retailer had implemented those steps, the efforts may not have succeeded in stopping the attack.That is because the attackers were more sophisticated than the ones in the previous attacks described in the Visa alerts, according to the source. The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.DELAYED DISCLOSURE Retailers are often reluctant to report breaches out of concern it could hurt their businesses. Target only acknowledged its 2013 attack after security blogger Brian Krebs reported the breach, prompting inquiries from journalists and investors.Neiman Marcus said an outside forensics firm discovered evidence on January 1 that indicated the retailer had been the victim of a cyber attack. It disclosed the breach nine days later, after another inquiry from Krebs, who was following up on reports about a surge in fraudulent charges traced to the retailer.Target and J.C. Penney Co Inc. waited more than two years to admit that they were victims in 2007 of notorious hacker Albert Gonzalez, who was accused of masterminding the theft and reselling of millions of credit cards and ATM numbers. During his trial the companies were represented by lawyers who did not identify their clients as Target and J.C Penney.Doug Johnson, vice president of risk management policy with the American Bankers Association, said banks and credit card firms like Visa are forbidden from naming merchants that have been breached, unless they disclose it themselves.""It is really frustrating to the bank and also the customer,"" Johnson said.One of the sources who told Reuters about the recent rash of attacks said the memory parsing malware cited in the Visa reports was among the tools that the hackers had used, but said they used other techniques as well.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the retailer is not commenting on the company's investigation of the breach.""This continues to be an active and ongoing investigation. It would be inappropriate to discuss details at this point.""Avivah Litan, a security analyst for Stamford, Connecticut -based Gartner information technology research firm, said she learned about a separate set of breaches, dating back no more than a few months before the November 28 Thanksgiving Day start of the holiday shopping season, from a forensics investigator. She declined to provide his name.""Target was not the only retailer who got hit, but they got hit the biggest,"" Litan said.Investigators believe that the early series of attacks on retailers staged before late November were mostly used as trial attacks to help the hackers perfect new techniques they then used against Target, stealing payment cards at unprecedented speed, Litan said.Chris Gray, director of Denver, Colorado -based Accuvant information security firm's risk and compliance practice, said that sophisticated cyber crime groups do that because they only have once chance to get it right before victims catch on.""You want to test it and make sure it works,"" Gray said. ""Then you push it out at the appropriate time and do as much damage as you can.""(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Grant McCool)",2014-01-12,TGT,"Sun Jan 12, 2014 | 4:26pm EST",Exclusive: More well-known U.S. retailers victims of cyber attacks - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-target-databreach-retailers-idUSBREA0B01720140112?type=companyNews

8,"   By Ross Kerber, Phil Wahba and Jim Finkle | BOSTON/NEW YORK  BOSTON/NEW YORK Target Corp began a major public relations effort on Monday to apologize to customers for an unprecedented cyber attack on its network, but the No. 3 U.S. retailer was vague in providing details about what it knew and when.The company has so far disclosed that the breach started in late November and lasted 19 days over the peak holiday shopping season, resulting in the theft of about 40 million credit card records and 70 million other records containing customer data.Target is trying to woo back customers after sales dropped off at the end of the holiday season. Its campaign included full-page newspaper advertisements on Monday apologizing for the attack and the first interview since the breach by chief executive Gregg Steinhafel.He told CNBC TV business network that Target wanted to lead the retail industry's move to adopt payment card technology that stores customer information on computer chips and requires users to type in personal identification numbers.On Sunday, a top executive with the National Retail Federation called for tougher security standards that could mean more spending for the industry, its banks and business partners following the breaches at Target and other retailers in the United States.Steinhafel said he was proud of the way Target employees had responded once the breach was confirmed, yet he provided few details about what had happened.Target disclosed on December 19 that it was victim to one of the biggest credit card breaches on record. It said it ran for 19 days in the busy holiday shopping season through December 15.""We're going to get to the bottom of this,"" Steinhafel told CNBC. ""We're not going to rest until we understand what happened and how that happened.""The company declined to say precisely when it first came to suspect its systems might have been compromised.In the CNBC interview, Steinhafel said the company ""confirmed"" that it had been victim of a breach on December 15, but he provided no account of what happened in preceding weeks. ""December 15. That was the day we confirmed that we had an issue,"" he said.Sources familiar with the investigation have previously told Reuters that Target learned about the attack only after receiving warnings from financial industry sources who reported seeing a surge in fraudulent credit card activity from accounts of customers who had shopped at the retailer.Another retailer, Neiman Marcus, disclosed on Friday that it was warned about a possible breach in mid-December and that an outside forensics firm confirmed a breach on January 1, saying it found evidence that some payment card data may have been compromised.Target and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holidays, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed.Smaller breaches at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place over the holiday season and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year.Stores and card processing companies have reported a steady stream of security breaches for years without a major backlash from consumers, such as those disclosed by TJX Cos in 2007 and by Heartland Payment Systems Inc in 2009. But the latest thefts could mark a watershed moment for security standards as calls grow for changes in the protection of consumer information.'CHIP-AND-PIN' CARDS One sign of the change is the new enthusiasm for ""Chip-and-PIN"" payment cards, which have computer chips built into them and require users to type in PINs.Mallory Duncan, general counsel of the National Retail Federation that represents Target, Wal-Mart and other stores, said on Sunday that the trade group encouraged its members to upgrade to the higher-security cards even though they cost more than old systems that store data on magnetic stripes.The breaches are ""unfortunate but we're not entirely surprised,"" Duncan said at his organization's annual convention in New York. ""The technology that exists in cards out there is 20th-century technology and we've got 21st-century hackers,"" he said.Duncan said the trade group had only made its backing for the higher-security cards public since the Target breach. Banks have quietly begun to offer the cards but mainly for customers to use while traveling. Big U.S. card networks led by Visa Inc will not require the higher security until next year at the earliest.It is not clear that ""Chip-and-PIN"" technology would have prevented the breaches at Target and elsewhere. At the very least they make stolen data harder to re-use, a reason the technology has caught on widely in Europe and Asia.They have met with much less enthusiasm in the United States, in part because losses to fraud - just 5 cents for every $100 spent via plastic - have been manageable for merchants and their banks. But rising fraud rates, and the risk of identity theft, could change the calculation.The new scrutiny began after Target disclosed its breach. Investigators believe hackers used malware that captured data on customers from the magnetic stripes on their payment cards.Duncan said no other members had told the NRF they had been breached.Executives of several other companies said over the weekend that they were not aware of breaches at their companies. The executives included representatives of Sears Holdings Corp, JCPenney Co, Macy's Inc and Gap Inc.Still, the breach was the talk of the retail conference with 29,000 attendees. Several speakers cited it in remarks and some tried to distance their companies from vulnerabilities.Stan Lippelman, vice president of marketing at Bass Pro Shops, a privately-held outdoor goods seller, said: ""We feel very comfortable with where we are at.

12,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings does not expect any rating  implications following Target's announcement that it expects lower earnings due  to the data breach and higher losses from its Canadian operations in the fourth  quarter.   Fitch believes the data breach is a manageable issue, although the disclosure  that additional personal data had been stolen - including names, mailing  addresses, phone numbers and email addresses - may further erode customer  confidence, suggesting that the negative sales impact from the data breach will  continue into fiscal 2014. Target is now guiding to a fourth-quarter comparable  store (comp) sales decline of 2.5%, compared with its previous guidance for a  flat comp, due to a sales drop-off following the disclosure of the data breach  on Dec. 19, 2013, and a reduction in operating income of roughly $300 million.  Fitch expects other costs such as fraud reimbursement, card reissuance costs and  litigation will be manageable in the context of the company's healthy ongoing  cash flow.   Fitch views the weaker performance of the Canadian business as an issue that  could constrain Target's results over the medium-term, as sales volumes build  more slowly than expected. The costs associated with clearing excess inventory  in Canada will likely be focused in the fourth quarter of 2013, with management  having increased its guidance for fourth quarter losses from the Canadian  business to more than $400 million, compared with expectations at the beginning  of 2013 that the business would generate positive EBIT in the quarter.  For the full year, operating losses from the Canadian business will likely  exceed $1 billion, a negative swing of more than $600 million from Fitch's prior  expectations. These losses together with the incremental losses from the data  breach will likely yield full-year 2013 EBITDA of $6.1 billion-$6.2 billion, or  15% below Fitch's original expectations for the year. This implies that adjusted  leverage will remain in the mid-2x range for the full year, rather than improve  to the low-2x range.  Looking ahead to 2014, Fitch expects overall top-line growth of 2% reflecting  flat comp store sales in the U.S. due to the ongoing impact of the data breach,  and a full year of sales from the Canadian stores. EBITDA margins are expected  to improve to the 9% range due to reduced losses from the Canadian business.   Further assuming flat debt levels, consolidated leverage could improve modestly  to around 2.4x.  Beyond 2014, assuming 2%-3% comparable store sales growth and steady margins in  the U.S., and improving profitability from the Canadian business, adjusted  leverage moves into the low-2x range. Target has refrained from repurchasing its  shares since the second quarter of 2013, and Fitch expects the company will  manage its share repurchases going forward in the context of maintaining  adjusted leverage in the low-2x range.       Rating Sensitivities: A positive rating action could be triggered by strong operating momentum in the  domestic business, a successful expansion into Canada, and a policy to maintain  leverage at or below 2.0x.  A negative rating action could be triggered by operating shortfalls and/or more  aggressive share repurchase activity that drove leverage to over 2.5x for an  extended period.   Fitch currently rates Target Corporation as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-';  --Senior unsecured debt 'A-'; --Bank credit facility 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.

16,"  By Mark Hosenball and Ros KrasnyWASHINGTON Jan 14 Two U.S. senators were seeking answers on Tuesday from the chief executive of Target Corp about the company's response to the hacking of credit and debit cards of millions of its customers during the holiday shopping season.""We ask that Target's information-security officials provide a briefing to committee staff regarding your company's investigation and latest findings,"" said John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Claire McCaskill, who heads a Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection.The Democratic senators' Jan. 10 letter to Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel was released on Tuesday, the latest in a growing chorus of calls by lawmakers and others for inquiries into the hacking of the No. 3 U.S. retailer.""We have received the chairmen's letter and are continuing to work with them and other elected officials to keep them informed and updated as our investigation continues,"" Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in an email to Reuters.Shortly afterwards, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sought a hearing on the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records containing customer information.Representative Elijah Cummings said the committee's focus  since October has been investigating the security of the federal government's health insurance website, HealthCare.gov, which has not been breached. He urged the committee chairman, Republican Darrell Issa, who made a fortune as head of a company that makes car alarms and other automotive security devices, to turn his attention to Target.""In addition to serving the interests of millions of American consumers affected by this breach, I believe the committee could learn from these witnesses about their failures, successes and best practices in order to better secure our federal information technology systems,"" Cummings wrote.An aide to Issa told Reuters the committee was likely to ""do some follow up"" on the Target issue.Target disclosed on Dec. 19 that it was a victim of one of the biggest credit card breaches on record, which it said lasted for 19 days in the busy holiday shopping season through Dec. 15. The company on Monday apologized for the breach.""It has been three weeks since the data breach was discovered, and new information continues to come out,"" Rockefeller and McCaskill wrote. ""We expect that your security experts have had time to fully examine the cause and impact of the breach and will be able to provide the Committee with detailed information.""The Target hacking shows the need for federal legislation on commercial data practices, the senators said. Democratic lawmakers sought a congressional hearing on Monday from the Financial Services Committee. Its Republican chairman, Jeb Hensarling, said his panel will continue to hold  hearings on the security of financial information and on how to protect personal consumer information.""Americans have a right to expect that the personal information they turn over to private companies and government agencies will be protected and kept secure from loss, unauthorized access or misuse,"" Hensarling said in a statement.Separately, an official with the House Energy and Commerce committee's majority Republicans said that one of its subcommittees has held numerous hearings on data breaches and that it was monitoring the Target situation but has taken no specific action.The National Association of Federal Credit Unions sent letters on Monday to congressional leaders, demanding action on data security.Although congressional hearings would allow for an airing of grievances and could bring Target officials to Washington for questioning about how the case has been handled, they would not necessarily result in any action or in legislation.Steinhafel told CNBC television on Monday: ""We're going to get to the bottom of this.

17,"   By Mitch Lipka  In the wake of a massive data breach that affected up to 100 million shoppers over the holidays, Target Corp has offered all of its customers - whether or not they were directly affected - a year of free credit monitoring. Is it an offer you should take?Here are some questions and answers about what this sort of protection does - and does not - do and what you should keep in mind if you do sign up.Q: What is Target offering?A: One year of free credit monitoring from the credit bureau Experian if you request an authorization code from Target and activate it by April 30.Q: What does that give me?A: In addition to getting a copy of a credit report from Experian, consumers will be notified when there are changes to their credit history. Such changes include applications for credit and any new accounts that are added.Every consumer is entitled to a free copy of their credit report once a year from each of the three major credit bureaus - Experian, Equifax and Transunion. The official website to get that free report is AnnualCreditReport.com. Some experts recommend getting one every four months so you have a greater opportunity to see any unwelcome activity sooner.If a consumer is a victim of identity theft they will also be provided with assistance from Experian to help resolve the tangle that typically follows. It can take a lot of effort and time to distance yourself from the fraud and clean up your credit history.The free service offered by Target does not provide a credit score, however. That is available for an additional fee. Q: What happens after one year?A: You would have to pay for the service for it to continue. It costs about $16 a month.Q: The offer from Target includes $1 million of identity theft insurance coverage. What protection does that offer?A: The insurance is very limited in scope, mainly covering incidental expenses, not monetary loss, notes Susan Grant, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America.While it includes coverage for lost wages from time spent repairing your damaged credit in the event of identity theft, that protection is capped at $1,000 a week for four weeks. The only instance in which you could be covered for an actual loss is if funds are electronically transferred from your account. Q: Will this service protect me from having my identity stolen or fraudulent charges on my cards?A: No. ""It's essentially a notification service,"" says John Breyault, vice president of the National Consumers League. It's still up to consumers to be vigilant about checking their accounts and to take action if there is any unauthorized activity.Consumers also need to be wary of scammers seeking to get even more information from them based on what they already have from the Target breach or other breaches, like e-mail addresses and phone numbers.Thieves are seeking your Social Security number - something Target has said was not revealed in this breach. If they can talk you out of that information, it is possible they can open credit lines in your name, says Tim Rohrbaugh, chief information security officer at Intersections Inc., an identity theft prevention company. Having credit monitoring won't protect you from this, but you will be alerted if it happens.""It doesn't give you license to discard common sense and start clicking on embedded links in e-mails and coughing up all sorts of personal information,"" says Robert Siciliano, a security expert for the online security company McAfee.Q: How do I sign up safely?A: Go directly to Target's website, which has a link (creditmonitoring.target.com) where customers can request an authorization code to activate the service. It could take up to five days to get a code, but at least initially the codes are coming within minutes. That e-mail explains how to sign up.Signing up will, ironically, require consumers to input more information - including their Social Security numbers. Beth Givens, executive director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, says the advocacy group recommends consumers get the protection but noted that in situations like this, many are reluctant to give out their Social Security number.""I hope that Experian's security is adequate, but how do any of us know for sure?,"" says Grant, of the Consumer Federation of America.Q: So, should I sign up?A: Consumer advocates and security experts say it can be helpful to sign up. But they caution: don't expect it to be a magic solution.(Follow us @ReutersMoney or here; Editing by Beth Pinsker and Dan Grebler)",2014-01-14,TGT,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 11:50am EST",What Target customers should know about identity theft protection,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-target-data-idtheftprotection-idUSBREA0D12M20140114?type=companyNews

19,"  By Ross KerberBOSTON Jan 13 A rash of data breaches at big U.S. retailers may accelerate spending on high-tech payment cards, a MasterCard Inc executive and other industry specialists said on Monday, as companies look to keep the faith of their customers.Retailers and their banks face a deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard of October 2015 to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes. The multibillion-dollar safety upgrade has many companies dragging their feet, and analysts estimated only 60 percent of U.S. sales terminals would meet the schedule.Now the loss of customer data reported at Target Corp, Neiman Marcus and other stores since December could move companies to the new standard more quickly, said Carolyn Balfany, head of U.S. product delivery for MasterCard in a telephone interview on Monday.The risks created by the breaches will clarify to companies the benefit of moving quickly to the new standard, she said. ""That's the clarity,"" she said.Among companies that could profit from a faster switch to chip-based cards are those that make equipment used to swipe them, such as the United States' VeriFone Systems Inc  and France's Ingenico.MasterCard, of Purchase, N.Y., is the second-largest payment network operator behind Visa of Foster City, California. Visa has not made executives available to be interviewed since Target first reported its breach on Dec. 19.A response gaining attention among security specialists has been the conversion of U.S. sales terminals to a card standard widely used in Europe and Asia, sometimes known as ""EMV"" after the initials of its creator companies Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Cards meeting the standard carry chips to make them harder to counterfeit, and to protect sensitive data with encryption. They can also require users to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, an extra layer of security compared to the signatures used by traditional credit cards.Although the new technology may not have prevented the data thefts from Target and elsewhere, it would make any stolen data harder to re-use and has cut fraud where it has been adopted.BANKS AND RETAILERS AT ODDS  In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company wanted to lead the retail industry's move to adopt the new cards. His remarks echoed those made by the general counsel of the National Retail Federation on Sunday. [ ID: nL2N0KN110 ]To date U.S. banks and retailers have been at odds over who should bear the costs of the upgrades, which could approach $10 billion in all. Retailers have made headway with a federal lawsuit that could help them reduce the fees that banks can charge to process transactions - fees the banks had counted on to pay for new technology. [ ID:nL2N0K004A ]The new enthusiasm from retailers like Target and the trade group after the breaches could mean they will install the equipment more quickly, said Roel Schouwenberg, a senior cyber security researcher for Kaspersky Lab. ""If EMV now receives a broad industry push then I don't see why we couldn't beat some of the set deadlines,"" he said. MEMORY DRIVES COSTS The cost of switching would have to cover new sales terminals and the issuing of new plastic to replace the roughly 1.1 billion credit, debit and prepaid cards now circulating in the United States.A traditional card costs about $1 to print, personalize and mail to a consumer, whereas the new cards can cost up to $10 each depending on the volume printed and the memory in their chips, estimated Javelin Strategy analyst Al Pascual.Still, the changes are coming. Large banks have begun to mail new chip cards to customers for traveling including Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co.. Big equipment makers like VeriFone and Ingenico have already wound down sales of their older magnetic-stripe-only card readers in the U.S.Thierry Denis, president of Ingenico's North American unit, said the breaches have focused attention on the retailers to upgrade their systems but that banks also need to issue the cards customers will need for the new card readers to catch on.

But people who have reviewed past data breaches believe Target's partners could face consumer lawsuits and fines that payment networks such as  Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc often levy after cyber security incidents.Target's partners ""have deep pockets and are intimately involved in certain aspects of how Target gets paid,"" said Jamie Pole, a cyber security consultant in Asheboro, North Carolina, who works for government agencies and the financial industry.Fines and settlement costs could reach into the millions of dollars for individual companies, he said, though much will depend on how the ultimate liability for the breach is determined.Boston attorney Cynthia Larose of Mintz Levin said Target would likely seek to add its partners as defendants to lawsuits already filed over the breach. ""These class-action lawsuits start to bring everyone in at some point,"" she said.After its systems were penetrated by hackers in the mid-2000s, retailer TJX Companies Inc agreed to pay up to $40.9 million to cover fraud costs in a settlement with Visa. Visa also issued penalties of $880,000 against Fifth Third Bancorp of Ohio, which processed transactions for TJX. Asked about the business relationships and possible costs, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation and pending suits.

Bank of America is due to release earnings on Wednesday morning.

POSRAM is an type of RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, where it appears in plain text.While the technology has been around for many years, its use has increased in recent years as retailers have improved their security, making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches.POSRAM succeeded in evading detection by anti-virus software when it infected the Windows-based point-of-sales terminals, according to the report.""This report was generated so that we could get it into the hands of commercial entities so that they had information they needed to protect themselves,"" iSIGHT Partners Senior Vice President Tiffany Jones told Reuters.The document was prepared by the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, the U.S. Secret Service, iSIGHT Partners and the Financial Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry security group.Alperovitch of CrowdStrike said that the report contained fewer technical details than an article published on Wednesday by security blogger Brian Krebs.",2014-01-16,TGT,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 6:00pm EST",UPDATE 2-U.S. govt warns merchants on methods used by Target hackers,http://www.reuters.com//article/target-databreach-warning-idUSL2N0KQ1Z120140116?type=companyNews

28,"  * Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings $1.25/share vs est. $1.26/share* Revenue up 5 pct at $8.55 bln* Says has fraud controls on accounts affected by Target breachBy Aman ShahJan 16 Credit card company American Express Co , which reported strong quarterly results on Thursday, said it had seen 'minimal exposure' to the data breach at Target Corp stores during the U.S. holiday shopping season.American Express said it had fraud controls in place on accounts affected in the theft, one of the biggest card breaches on record.About 40 million credit card records and 70 million other records containing data on Target's customers were stolen in the breach disclosed in December.""The closed-loop is a big advantage for us, especially in situations like this,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said on a post-earnings conference call, referring to the company's system of issuing its own cards in addition to processing transactions.Earlier in the day, American Express reported a two-fold jump in fourth-quarter profit as its affluent customers spent more in the U.S. holiday season and fewer users defaulted on payments.""We ended the year on a strong note, with card member spending up 8 percent despite mixed reports during the holiday shopping season,"" Chief Executive Ken Chenault said in a statement. Concerns over debit and credit card safety have increased after Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, disclosed the breach that lasted 19 days through Dec. 15.Cards on American Express's platform are seen as safer than those on Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc platforms due to the 'closed loop' system.STRONG RESULTS  American Express benefited from the holiday shopping season in the United States, with billed business in its core market growing 9 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the highest growth in six quarters.""Even though overall growth in consumer spending has been somewhat muted, the fact that American Express focuses on affluent consumers is helping it grow its billed business,"" said Janney Capital Markets analyst Sameer Gokhale.U.S. retail sales increased 3.8 percent in the 2013 holiday season, according to data released by the National Retail Federation on Tuesday.The same day, the U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales including automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants rose 1 percent from a year earlier in the October-December period. () American Express, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, said fewer customers defaulted on payments in the quarter, with worldwide net lending write-off rate falling to 1.6 percent from 2 percent, a year earlier.Delinquency rates at credit card companies usually rise in the fourth quarter as customers spend more during the holiday season and then find it difficult to repay loans.American Express's net profit rose to $1.31 billion, or $1.21 per share, in the quarter from $637 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding merchant litigation settlements reached last month, earnings were $1.25 per share.Total revenue, net of interest expense, increased 5 percent to $8.55 billion.Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $8.54 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.American Express shares gained about 55 percent in 2013, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Index, which rose 30 percent in the year.The stock closed at $87.78 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.",2014-01-17,TGT,"Thu Jan 16, 2014 | 7:26pm EST",UPDATE 2-American Express says exposure to Target breach 'minimal',http://www.reuters.com//article/americanexpress-results-idUSL3N0KQ4X820140117?type=companyNews
29,"  Jan 17 Hackers breached the computer networks of luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus as far back as July, an attack that was not fully contained until Sunday, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the investigation.Neiman Marcus said on Friday that hackers may have stolen customers' credit and debit card information, the second cyber attack on a retailer in recent weeks.Neiman Marcus had said it first learned in mid-December of suspicious activity that involved credit cards used at its stores.However, in a call with credit card companies on Monday, Neiman acknowledged that the attack had only been fully contained a day earlier, and that the time stamp on the first intrusion was in mid-July, the paper said. () Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Ginger Reeder declined to comment to Reuters on the New York Times report about the July hack attack.""We did not get our first alert that there might be something wrong until mid-December. We didn't find evidence until Jan. 1,"" Reeder told Reuters late on Thursday. Neiman Marcus did not say how many credit cards were affected but said that customer social security numbers and birth dates were not compromised.""Customers that shopped online do not appear at this time to have been impacted by the criminal cyber-security intrusion. Your PIN was never at risk because we do not use PIN pads in our stores,"" Chief Executive Karen Katz wrote in a letter to customers, a copy of which was posted on the company's website. Katz said the company has taken steps to contain the situation, including working with federal law enforcement, disabling the malware and enhancing security tools.The company is also assessing and reinforcing its related payment card systems, Katz said.The U.S. government on Thursday provided merchants with information gleaned from its confidential investigation into the massive data breach at Target Corp, in a move aimed at identifying and thwarting similar attacks that may be ongoing.",2014-01-17,TGT,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 12:20am EST",Neiman Marcus computers were hacked as far back as July - NYT,http://www.reuters.com//article/neimanarcus-databreach-idUSL3N0KR1N720140117?type=companyNews
30,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A data breach at Target Corp that exposed the credit card information of tens of millions of holiday shoppers was a major black eye for the retailer. In its wake, investors and analysts are circling companies that could benefit from a major upgrade in credit card technology.One of their favorites: Verifone Systems Inc, a $3.2 billion market cap company that is one of two major global manufacturers of point-of-sale terminals and mobile payments systems and could profit from any major upgrades of payment technology. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase and Jefferies & Co upgraded their outlook for the company in the last 10 days, helping send its shares price up about 25 percent since the Target breach was first reported on December 18.Yet for its shares to continue to rally, Verifone must prove to analysts and portfolio managers it has taken steps to right its own ship after several years of choppy performance.That question mark is a product of several years of poor acquisitions and a history of missing earnings estimates that left the company's shares down more than 20 percent for the year just before the Target breach become public - in a bullish year for stocks. It hangs over the company as a new wave of credit card technology looks poised to finally make inroads in the U.S. after being the standard in Europe for years.""Verifone has a tremendous and recently unappreciated position in the industry, yet it's kind of a messy place. The new management team looks great, but this is like waiting for Godot,"" said Jeffrey Bronchick, whose $56.3 million Cove Street Small Cap Value fund has one of the best performances in its category over the last three years, according to Morningstar data. In the Samuel Beckett play, two characters wait endlessly for Godot, who never shows up.Verifone declined to make executives available for this article.Bronchick said that he sold his position in the company during its recent rally in large part because, at approximately $29 a share, its stock price looks expensive. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, which is well above the approximately 16 times multiple of the broad market.""The stock is reflecting a seamless next two years and I think there's little likelihood of it,"" he said.TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE The bullish case for Verifone rests largely on expectations that the slow-to-change credit card industry is set to adopt new technology that could cut fraud in the United States. The country accounts for nearly half of global credit card fraud despite handling only 27 percent of all card volume, said Darrin Peller, an analyst at Barclays who covers the industry.Merchants, retailers and credit card issuers have long resisted upgrading to a card system, now ubiquitous in Europe, that stores information on chips embedded in the cards themselves. Rather than relying on the easily copied magnetic stripe on the back of cards, these cards, called EMV for Europay, Mastercard, Visa, create a new code for every transaction, making it difficult for hackers to duplicate. As an incentive to push card issuers to upgrade, Visa has warned that merchants' banks may start bearing the costs of fraud starting in October 2015 if the merchants don't upgrade.Some Verifone terminals were in use at Target locations, according to Peller, the Barclays analyst. That investigation continues and Peller said it was unclear whether they were involved in the data breach, but he did not expect Verifone to face liabilities in connection with the loss.Target said on January 10 it could not yet estimate the costs it would face in relation to the breach. The company did not respond to a request for comment or say what terminals it used. Verifone declined to comment for this article.The data breach at Target has created ""a growing sense of urgency"" among merchants to upgrade their point-of-sale terminals in order to read EMV cards, noted Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""For the first time, we get the feeling that the cost of conversion is being outweighed by the open-ended liability associated with making consumers whole when their accounts are compromised, and the potential damage to retailer's brands,"" Jeffrey noted.An implementation of the EMV system in the U.S. would push merchants into buying 15 million to 20 million credit card terminals, said Peller, the Barclays analyst. Those purchases - which Peller says large companies would split between Verifone and French company Ingenico, its main competitor - would likely help turn around Verifone's solutions services division. Revenues in that part of the business fell 20 percent, to slightly below $1.07 billion, in its fiscal year that ended in October.""Verifone could see around $100 million or more in incremental annual revenue for a few years from its existing U.S. installed base, with longer-term upside from market-share gains and services revenue over time,"" Peller noted in a report published in 2012. He said the estimate is still reasonable.NEW MANAGEMENT That upgrade process would likely help Verifone investors more than Ingenico shareholders largely because several years of poor management have depressed Verifone's stock price, said David Rudow, an analyst who works on the $968 million Thrivent Mid Cap fund.He sees new CEO Paul Galant, who came on board September 23 after heading up Citigroup's enterprise payments business, as more capable of steering the business than its previous management team, which Rudow said ignored product cycles and focused too much on next-generation mobile payment systems at the expense of the more profitable terminal business.""If you look at stock charts, Ingenico is a beautiful chart - straight up - and Verifone is the opposite,"" he said. Ingenico's shares rose 44 percent in 12 months to new all-time highs and are up 450 percent over the last five years. Despite their relative stock performance, Verifone and Ingenico have remarkably similar product lines and are the two largest providers in nearly all markets they compete in, he said. The idea that ""execution issues experienced by Verifone are eminently 'fixable'"" prompted Bradley Safalow, founder of Atlanta-based research firm PAA Advisors, to recommend a short position on Ingenico in November. He expects the company's share price, currently trading at nearly 66 euros, to fall to 35 euros as Verifone continues its turnaround.Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies, said Galant will likely take steps to standardize products across Verifone's global regions, allowing the company to cut by half the number of distinct products it offers and cut costs as well. Verifone said in December that it expects to earn up to $1.40 in net income per share in its 2014 fiscal year, a figure 10 percent below Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates of $1.56 per share.""This management team looks like it's trying to under-promise and over-deliver and is being very conservative in their guidance,"" said Joshua Schachter, whose $90.1 million Snow Capital Small Cap Value fund has been adding to its position in Verifone.VALUATION CONCERNS The Verifone rally following the Target breach has led some analysts to question if the company is becoming overvalued.""Before recommending the stock after the run it's already had, I would argue that you probably want to see a couple of more quarters of evidence that it can regain market share back and grow from here,"" said Peller, the Barclays analyst.The stock is currently trading at $28.98, slightly above the median target price of $28.50 among the 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters. That high price is leading some investors to wait for a pullback before buying back in.Among them: Bronchick, the Cove Street portfolio manager who recently sold his shares.""If this company was trading at $21 a share, I'd be pounding the table for it,"" he said.(Reporting by David Randall, editing by Linda Stern and Gunna Dickson)",2014-01-19,TGT,"Sun Jan 19, 2014 | 6:59pm EST","Analysis: After Target hack, Verifone smart card readers could shine",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-verifone-cards-idUSBREA0I07V20140119?type=companyNews

33,"   By Joyce Lee | SEOUL  SEOUL The theft of personal information from more than 100 million South Korean credit cards and accounts, reportedly including those of President Park Geun-hye and UN chief Ban Ki-moon, has ignited a storm of anger and litigation against credit firms.Worried Koreans on Tuesday packed into branches of one of the banks hit by the theft to ensure their money was safe, while lawyers said 130 people joined a class action suit against their credit card providers in what is expected to be the first of multiple litigations.""Of course I'm angry. Anyone might know when I pay my credit card bills, let alone my phone number and where I live. I might as well keep all my money in my closet,"" said one card user, Lee Young-hye, outside a bank branch.The biggest breach of personal privacy ever in South Korea has further highlighted the vulnerability of credit card information after tens of millions of U.S. cardholders' details were stolen from retailer Target Corp during the holiday shopping season.South Koreans on average have more than four credit cards, something that has contributed to one of the highest levels of personal debt relative to the size of the economy in the developed world.The data security breach affected around 15 million cardholders, according to official estimates, by far the largest in a series of such scams against financial firms in South Korea going back to 2011. Some previous attacks involved hackers believed to originate from North Korea, but this one seems to have been an inside job.Financial regulators said a contractor with the Korea Credit Bureau, a private firm that manages the credit information of millions of Koreans for financial services providers, simply loaded details of 105.8 million accounts held by KB Kookmin Card Co Ltd, Lotte Card Co Ltd and NH Nonghyup Card onto a portable hard drive.The technician was allegedly working on forgery-proofing credit cards when he committed the theft in February, June and December last year, according to regulator Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), citing the prosecutor's office leading the investigation. The man then sold the information to at least two people including a loan marketer and a broker, the FSS said. The contractor and at least one other person have been arrested.VICTIMS SUE, DEMAND ANSWERS The first class action lawsuit was filed against the three credit card companies late on Monday, a day after the FSS revealed the full scale of the theft, according to the law firm representing them.The victims are each claiming 110 million won ($103,400) in compensation. Lawyers said they expected more lawsuits to come, as internet chatrooms and social media seethed with complaints about the security failure. ""We are preparing additional lawsuits regarding the case and are receiving applications from victims,"" an official at the law firm leading the litigation said.Cho Yeon-haeng, president of Korea Finance Consumer Federation, a customer rights group, said: ""Proving actual damages will be very difficult, which means at best nominal compensation for emotional injury.""What is needed is stopping repercussions by re-issuing all the affected credit cards,"" he added.The stolen information included names, home addresses, and phone numbers, bank account numbers, credit card details, identification numbers, income, marriage and passport numbers. The FSS said credit card passwords were not stolen, although this was cold comfort to South Koreans for whom most credit card transactions simply require a card swipe and signature - without the need for a chip and pin process. Some outlets such as home shopping channels do not even need a signature.South Korean media reported that President Park and UN Secretary General Ban were among those whose information was stolen, although government officials and the card firms declined to comment.

42,"   By Jim Finkle and Mark Hosenball | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The FBI has warned U.S. retailers to prepare for more cyber attacks after discovering about 20 hacking cases in the past year that involved the same kind of malicious software used against Target Corp in the holiday shopping season.The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation distributed a confidential, three-page report to retail companies last week describing the risks posed by ""memory-parsing"" malware that infects point-of-sale (POS) systems, which include cash registers and credit-card swiping machines found in store checkout aisles.""We believe POS malware crime will continue to grow over the near term, despite law enforcement and security firms' actions to mitigate it,"" said the FBI report, seen by Reuters.""The accessibility of the malware on underground forums, the affordability of the software and the huge potential profits to be made from retail POS systems in the United States make this type of financially motivated cyber crime attractive to a wide range of actors,"" the FBI said.The report was dated January 17 and entitled ""Recent Cyber Intrusion Events Directed Toward Retail Firms."" A spokeswoman for the FBI confirmed the agency had issued the report as part of efforts to share information about threats with the private sector.Retail, credit card and bank industry executives have become increasingly concerned about the security of payment card networks after Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, last month disclosed one of the biggest retail cyber attacks in history.The attack ran undetected for 19 days during the busy holiday shopping season and resulted in the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records. The personal information of 70 million customers was also compromised.Luxury retail chain Neiman Marcus has said it too was the victim of a cyber attack, and sources have told Reuters that other retail chains have also been breached. Neiman Marcus said about 1.1 million customer cards were exposed by a data breach from July 16 to October 30 last year. In all these attacks, cyber criminals used memory-parsing software, also known as a ""RAM scraper."" When a customer swipes a credit or debit card, the POS terminal grabs the transaction data from the magnetic stripe and transfers it to the retailer's payment processing provider. While the data is encrypted during the process, RAM scrapers extract the information while it is in the computer's live memory, where it very briefly appears in plain text.RAM scraping technology has been around for a long time, but its use has increased in recent years. Developers of the malware have also enhanced its features to make it more difficult to be detected by anti-virus software deployed on POS systems running Windows software.MALWARE ON SALE UNDERGROUND The FBI said in its report that one variant of the malicious POS software, known as Alina, included an option that allowed remote upgrades, making it tougher for corporate security teams to identify and eradicate it. The report said at least one type of malware has been offered for sale for as much as $6,000 in a ""well-known"" underground forum.""The high dollar value gained from some of these compromises can encourage intruders to develop high sophistication methodologies, as well as incorporate mechanisms for the actors to remain undetected,"" the report said. Asked to comment on the FBI warning, the National Retail Federation industry trade group said retailers are alert to cyber risks.""Retailers have been and remain vigilant in their efforts to provide the highest level of security for their data systems in order to protect against malicious and criminal acts,"" NRF Vice President Tom Litchford said in a statement.""As the criminal investigation continues and more information becomes available, you can be sure that the retail industry will be responsive and engaged to ensure this particular cyber-attack does not happen again.""One cyber security consultant who has reviewed the FBI report, said the findings were troubling. ""Everybody we work with in the retail space is scared to death because they don't have a lot of defenses to prepare against these types of attacks,"" said the consultant, who is advising several retailers in current investigations.""This is not just based on anybody saying 'This is going to happen.' This is based on statistical data that the FBI is seeing,"" said the consultant, who was not authorized to publicly comment on the details of the report.Retailers need to move quickly to get better tools in their networks that can analyze traffic patterns on the fly and identify any unusual activity, said another expert in retail security, who has audited POS systems to find vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.The expert said it is more difficult for small-to-mid sized retailers to do this because they do not have as much money and expertise as major retailers.The FBI report said the bulk of the POS malware cases that the agency has investigated involve small-to-mid sized local or regional businesses, whose estimated losses each range from tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars.The United States Secret Service usually takes the lead in credit card breach investigations for the federal government, though the FBI sometimes opens its own cases or asked to assist. The Secret Service is leading the investigations into the breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus.A spokesman for the Secret Service declined to comment on the FBI report to retailers.(Reporting by Jim Finkle and Mark Hosenball; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Grant McCool)",2014-01-23,TGT,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 4:44pm EST",Exclusive: FBI warns retailers to expect more credit card breaches,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-target-databreach-fbi-idUSBREA0M1UF20140123?type=companyNews

Asked to comment on the FBI warning, the National Retail Federation industry trade group said retailers are alert to cyber risks.""Retailers have been and remain vigilant in their efforts to provide the highest level of security for their data systems in order to protect against malicious and criminal acts,"" NRF Vice President Tom Litchford said in a statement.""As the criminal investigation continues and more information becomes available, you can be sure that the retail industry will be responsive and engaged to ensure this particular cyber-attack does not happen again.""One cyber security consultant who has reviewed the FBI report, said the findings were troubling. ""Everybody we work with in the retail space is scared to death because they don't have a lot of defenses to prepare against these types of attacks,"" said the consultant, who is advising several retailers in current investigations.""This is not just based on anybody saying 'This is going to happen.' This is based on statistical data that the FBI is seeing,"" said the consultant, who was not authorized to publicly comment on the details of the report.Retailers need to move quickly to get better tools in their networks that can analyze traffic patterns on the fly and identify any unusual activity, said another expert in retail security, who has audited POS systems to find vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit.The expert said it is more difficult for small-to-mid sized retailers to do this because they do not have as much money and expertise as major retailers.The FBI report said the bulk of the POS malware cases that the agency has investigated involve small-to-mid sized local or regional businesses, whose estimated losses each range from tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars.The United States Secret Service usually takes the lead in credit card breach investigations for the federal government, though the FBI sometimes opens its own cases or asked to assist. The Secret Service is leading the investigations into the breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus.A spokesman for the Secret Service declined to comment on the FBI report to retailers.(Reporting by Jim Finkle and Mark Hosenball; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Grant McCool)",2014-01-24,TGT,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 7:53pm EST",Exclusive: FBI warns retailers to expect more credit card breaches,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-target-databreach-fbi-idUSBREA0M1UF20140124?type=companyNews

55,"  TORONTO Jan 29 Target Corp will add more stores in Canada this year, the retailer said on Wednesday, even thought its 2013 entry into the country proved costlier than expected and forced it to cut its full-year profit forecast.The discount department store operator said it will open nine new stores across Canada, adding to the 124 stores it opened last year.Target, which competes with retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc, had a tough 2013. U.S. shoppers remained cautious and its Canadian expansion became costlier than expected and took longer to pay off. Target offers a mix of household goods and trendy apparel and accessories. It opened its first Canadian stores in March 2013 to much fanfare, but it has since struggled to win over shoppers who were disappointed by the selection and pricing compared to its U.S. stores.The Minneapolis-based company faced the additional challenge of a massive data breach during the holiday shopping season which resulted in weaker-than-expected sales during the period. It said an investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses, in the second-biggest retail cyber attack on record. The company, which employs 361,000 people around the globe, also said last week it was cutting 475 jobs at its headquarters and other offices in Minnesota and will not fill 700 open positions worldwide.The retailer plans to open five stores in Ontario starting this spring and open one each in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec and Manitoba.",2014-01-29,TGT,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 11:04am EST",Target to expand further in Canada with nine new stores in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/target-canada-idUSL2N0L313G20140129?type=companyNews

""Is the impact of the Snowden affair slowing us down in our work to be more aggressive in the cybersecurity area?"" Mikulski asked.FBI Director James Comey said political uproar over surveillance and Snowden's leaks had complicated discussions about how to fight consumer data breaches.""There is the threat of fraud and theft because we've connected our lives to the Internet,"" Comey said. ""We need to make sure that the private sector knows the rules of the road and how we share that information with the government.""Some U.S. officials with responsibility for cybersecurity have complained privately that, while states have created a ""patchwork"" of local rules requiring businesses to report breaches of consumer data to authorities and the public, there are no similar federal requirements.Congress has been wrestling for years with proposals for  legislation on data security but has been unable to reach agreement. There is no national standard to govern how and when businesses that suffer consumer data breaches must advise their customers and federal agencies. HOLDER CONFIRMS PROBE Holder, testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said the Justice Department would seek the perpetrators of the Target breach as well as ""any individuals and groups who exploit that data via credit card fraud.""""While we generally do not discuss specific matters under investigation, I can confirm the department is investigating the breach involving the U.S. retailer, Target,"" Holder said.The Secret Service has taken the lead investigating the breaches at Target and other retailers, including Neiman Marcus  and Michaels Companies Inc, the largest U.S. arts and crafts retailer. Reuters reported on Jan. 23 that the FBI also warned U.S. retailers to prepare for more cyber attacks after discovering about 20 hacking cases over the past year that involved the same kind of malicious software used against Target during the holiday shopping season.CONGRESS PILES ON As lawmakers accelerated to gather information about the data breaches, Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, took a new tack, asking Target why the company had not yet reported its data breach to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.""Your failure thus far to provide this information to your investors does not seem consistent with the spirit or the letter of the SEC's financial disclosure rules,"" Rockefeller wrote in the three-page letter to Target's chief executive.Democratic members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday asked Neiman Marcus for documents relating to the upscale retailer's recent cybersecurity breach. Last week, the same lawmakers asked Target executives to provide an array of internal documents.On Thursday, members of the powerful House Oversight Committee, which has broad investigative jurisdiction, will hold a telephone briefing with Target representatives, during which detailed questions are expected to be asked about how and why the data breaches occurred.Target's Snyder did not provide details about upcoming meetings but reiterated that Target was ""continuing to work with elected officials to keep them informed and updated as our investigation continues.""At least three different congressional panels are slated to hold hearings, beginning next week.

Some 40 million credit and debt card records were stolen, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers.Among others due to speak to the panel on Tuesday is Michael Kingston, chief information officer with upscale retailer Neiman Marcus, which was also hit by a large data hack in recent weeks. Lawmakers are staging a series of hearings this week on aspects of the data breaches. On Monday, a top Secret Service agent joined a chorus urging lawmakers to do more to prevent the types of crimes that have come to light recently. Congress has wrestled for years with proposals for legislation on data security but has been unable to reach agreement.""All businesses - and their customers - are facing increasingly sophisticated threats from cyber criminals,"" said Mulligan. ""To prevent this from happening again, none of us can go it alone.""On Monday Target said it was speeding up a planned $100 million program to implement the use of chip-enabled smart cards to protect against cyber theft.",2014-02-04,TGT,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 10:15am EST","In Senate hearing, Target official to apologize for data breach",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-target-congress-idUSL2N0L90QP20140204?type=companyNews
62,"  WASHINGTON Target Corp, which suffered a massive data breach during the holiday shopping season, is speeding up a $100 million program to implement the use of chip-enabled smart cards to protect against cyber theft, a senior company executive said.In an opinion piece on Monday in the Hill newspaper on the eve of his much-awaited appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said the retailer's goal was to have the technology in place by early 2015, more than six months ahead of schedule.The adoption of such chip-enabled cards would be ""one step American businesses could now take that would dramatically improve the security of all credit and debit cards,"" Mulligan wrote.He said the United States had been slow to develop the technology, which was already in wide use in other parts of the world.The enhanced smart cards contain tiny microprocessor chips that encrypt personal data shared with sales terminals used by merchants. Stolen smart card numbers would be useless without the chip, Mulligan said. He noted that Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, had been working for years to adopt the technology.""Since the breach, we are accelerating our own $100 million investment to put chip-enabled technology in place. Our goal: implement this technology in our stores and on our proprietary REDcards by early 2015, more than six months ahead of our previous plan.""

66,"  By Dhanya Skariachan and Phil WahbaNEW YORK Feb 5 Target Corp's decision to speed up a $100 million program to adopt the use of chip-enabled smart cards is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to what retailers need to do to defend themselves against future cyber attacks, according to security experts and IT service providers.The pressure to boost security spending comes at a time when merchants are already spending millions to fend off online retailer Amazon.com and facing an October 2015 deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes.Target, the No. 3 U.S. retailer, said this week it hoped to finish upgrading its payment card network to the more secure ""chip and PIN"" standard by early 2015, some six months ahead of its previous plan.The system, already widely used in Europe and Asia, can accommodate cards carrying tiny microprocessors, which makes it harder for cyber crooks to use stolen data.U.S. retailers have been so focused on cutting costs and expanding their online presence in the past decade that they have not spent enough of their technology budgets on protecting customer data, security experts and IT service providers said.While retail spending on overall technology was expected to rise 4 percent annually between 2012 and 2017, U.S. stores spend only roughly 2 percent of their tech budgets on security, with the bulk going to improving their e-commerce, technology advisory firm IDC Retail Insights said.Unlike their peers in other industries, most retailers still focus on just meeting the basic standards set by the payment card industry rather than substantially beefing up safeguards against increasingly sophisticated attacks, security experts said. ""Retailers have to assume that they are constantly being targeted and actually constantly being penetrated,"" said Eddie Schwartz, a vice president at Verizon Enterprise Solutions, who urged retailers to take a more proactive approach.Pressure from Congress, consumer groups and the banking industry following recent theft of customer data at Target, Neiman Marcus and others may be the turning point to get the retail industry to spend more on security, experts said.For example, Dinesh Bajaj, the vice president of retail and logistics practice in Americas for Infosys Ltd, expects retailers to spend more in coming months on encrypting credit card data while storing it in multiple systems.IDC Retail Insights expects spending by retailers in 2014 specifically for security in the United States to be $720.3 million, an increase of 5.7 percent from last year in part because of the recent breaches. Total tech spending by retailers this year is expected to hit $36.34 billion.""It's clear that companies need to do a lot more, that they continue to make basic mistakes,"" Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said at a hearing on Tuesday looking into massive data breaches at Target and Neiman that affected millions of shoppers.

71,"  By Svea Herbst-BaylissFeb 14 Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby's to large retailers Target Corp and Walgreen CoGeneral Motors also became the flavor of the quarter with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly 14 percent, making for a rough start for new Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra.But on Friday, the automaker's stock rose 75 cents, or 2.13 percent, to $35.95.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings don't disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there's also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.  Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth quarter.SOTHEBY'S Activist investor Marcato Capital Management, run by Mick McGuire, boosted the firm's holdings of Sotheby's by 35 percent, having bought an additional 1,200,000 shares in the auction house to now own 4,562,991.Eric Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management also is a huge fan, buying an additional 265,000 shares, bringing his stake to 2.2 million shares.FACEBOOK Tiger Consumer Management got back into Facebook Inc after exiting it in the third quarter. The filing shows the fund owned 1,384,507 shares of the social media powerhouse at the end of the fourth quarter.Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors bought an additional 13.9 million class A shares, bringing its stake to 18.3 million class A shares.Scout Capital Management closed out of its position, selling 3 million shares. Scout Capital may be going on a junk food diet, as it liquidated its entire position in Whole Foods  and Starbucks but added 3.9 million shares in Yum! Brands Inc. The fund's owners said last month that they are splitting up and shutting down the $6.7 billion fund after 13 years. Returns were strong at 21 percent last year.GENERAL MOTORS Kyle Bass's Hayman Capital announced in early December that he established a position and that the 4,606,005 million shares he owned made up nearly one quarter of his portfolio.Bridger Capital trimmed its holdings in General Motors Co by selling 155,000 shares, but the fund still owns 1,695,000 shares, which ranks the stock as the fund's fourth largest position.Bronson Point Management, founded by former managers at SAC and Pequot, added to its holding of GM by buying another 400,000 shares, increasing its stake by 34 percent.

74,"   By Dhanya Skariachan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Several analysts expect Target Corp (TGT.N) to slash its share buybacks as the third-largest U.S. retailer copes with costs tied to the massive data breach that affected millions of customers.Target had originally planned to buy back up to $4 billion of shares this year, but analysts do not expect it to achieve that goal as it sets aside money to deal with the data breach and try not to borrow more so it can maintain its credit rating.When Target reports quarterly results on Wednesday it will mark the first time that it faces Wall Street since the breach, which led to the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with information such as addresses and phone numbers of shoppers compromised.The security breach ""could crimp their repurchase activity,"" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joe Feldman. ""That's definitely a concern of a lot of investors.""Target spokesman Eric Hausman said the company remains committed to share repurchases over time and ""will govern the pace of repurchases with the goal of maintaining our strong A credit rating,"" but did not comment further ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings release.Any move to curb repurchases could make the retailer's stock less attractive to investors over the near term.Fitch Ratings analyst Philip Zahn said he did not expect Target to be aggressive with share repurchases as the company would have to take on additional debt to do so and that could end up costing Target its current credit rating. The retailer already has lowered expectations for the fourth quarter, in part due to weaker-than-expected sales since reports of the cyber-attack emerged in mid-December. News of the breach has hurt its reputation and stock.Target has yet to tell investors how much it has spent on dealing with the fallout from the breach. Some analysts estimate the breach will cost Target $500 million to $1.1 billion.Target will likely incur costs tied to reissuing cards, bank settlements, credit monitoring, and enhancing security systems, but will not have to replace all cards or make large-spread hardware replacements, Wells Fargo's Matt Nemer noted.Feldman, like some other analysts, urged investors to abandon Target and invest in Dollar General (DG.N) and Dollar Tree (DLTR.O) instead, citing better growth prospects and the assessment that the cloud of uncertainty around Target is not going away soon. Analysts have cut Target profit estimates for the fiscal years ending January 2014 and January 2015 by about 12.2 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively, since December 18 - the day before the company confirmed the breach, Thomson Reuters Starmine data showed.Nemer, who has an ""outperform"" rating on Target, said the retailer's goal of $4 billion in repurchases in 2014 ""seems out of reach"" but he still believes the company has the capacity to fund about $2 billion in buybacks if breach-related costs are in the hundreds of millions and not higher.Last year, the company had set a goal of repurchasing up to $4 billion of its shares annually in 2014 and beyond. WINNING BACK CUSTOMER TRUST Target, whose consumer perception scores had dropped to their lowest level since 2007 after the breach, is also likely to face tough questions on how it plans to win back shoppers.The ""focus will likely be on Target's 2014 strategy to earn back guest trust and share of wallet,"" said Cowen analyst Faye Landes, who recently downgraded Target's stock.Some want to know if the breach had a lingering effect on sales and if the related costs will affect Target's plans for Canada and to test shipping directly from stores.""They have a lot of stuff to work on,"" said Stifel Nicolaus' David Schick, who picked Costco shares (COST.O) over Target.""Can they get Canada to turn? Can they become as powerful in ecommerce and omnichannel as they were in retail five or ten years ago? Can they re-emerge as a merchandising powerhouse?"" Schick said, while detailing Target's strategic issues.(Reporting By Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Bernard Orr)",2014-02-24,TGT,"Mon Feb 24, 2014 | 3:12pm EST",Data breach costs seen crimping Target's firepower for buybacks,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-target-buybacks-idUSBREA1N1PD20140224?type=companyNews

If the company does not comply, the committee's majority Republicans have the power to issue a subpoena forcing the company's compliance.The news came a day before the company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings and its leaders face Wall Street analysts for the first time since the breach.Several analysts expect Target to slash its share buybacks as it copes with costs tied to the breach, which some estimate will cost the company $500 million to $1.1 billion.The 19-day breach of Target's computer networks over the holiday shopping period resulted in the theft of an estimated 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with customer information, such as addresses and telephone numbers.In the letter dated Monday, the House committee also requested any documents generated between November 1 and December 19 referring to discussions about notifying others about the data breach, and any documents generated since December 12 in which any federal agency advised the company to avoid providing information to Congress. Congressional sources said that this is the first time the majority on the Republican-led committee had sent such a request to Target.The sources said the letter was prompted, at least in part, after committee officials felt dissatisfied with responses given by Isaac Reyes, an official with Target's government relations department, during a January 30 conference call about the data breach.The letter was signed by Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican who has garnered headlines for his fierce criticism of the Obama administration's performance on a wide range of issues.The committee has wide jurisdiction to investigate government and private business activity. In its letter, the panel hints that the retailer may not have been entirely forthcoming in its statements to the public and Congress about when it learned of the data breach.Investigators believe that the hackers managed to break into Target's payment network by first breaching a ""data connection"" between the U.S. retailer and a heating and ventilating systems contractor based near Pittsburgh.The committee's letter noted that in testimony before a Senate Judiciary Committee on February 4, John Mulligan, Target's chief financial officer, testified that the company had no knowledge that malware related to the data breach had been installed in its systems before receiving a notification from the U.S. Justice Department on December 12.The House oversight committee said that statement did not ""clarify"" when Target learned that it could have been the victim of a breach, since cybersecurity blog KrebsonSecurity reported that Target may have been warned earlier about a problem. In January, minority Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce committee also sent a letter to Target requesting documents.Congressional aides have said that Target responded to an earlier request for data issued by Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee but that response, which has not been made public, did not provide new insight.Asked why the Republican majority leaders on that committee did not push for the documents, Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska on February 5 said Target had been forthcoming during conversations with his staff and such pressure was unwarranted ""until they don't show that they are willing to give us data.""A Target spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Target shares, which have fallen about 15 percent since the data breaches were made public in December, were up 0.6 percent in afternoon trading at $56.51.(This version of the story corrects the deadline for documents in paragraph three to March 10 from March 1.)(Additional reporting by Alina Selyukh and Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Ros Krasny, Bill Trott and Amanda Kwan)",2014-02-25,TGT,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 4:30pm EST",House oversight panel seeks documents on Target breach,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-target-idUSBREA1O19720140225?type=companyNews

83,"   By Dhanya Skariachan and Jim Finkle | NEW YORK/BOSTON  NEW YORK/BOSTON Target Corp shares made strong gains after it reassured investors that customers were beginning to return to its U.S. stores, suggesting that the impact of a massive data breach may not be as severe as some had feared.The third-largest U.S. retailer said on Wednesday that customer traffic had started to improve this year after falling significantly at the end of the holidays when news of the cyber attack and theft of payment card data spooked shoppers.Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said on a conference call he expected first-quarter sales at its established U.S. stores to be flat to down 2 percent and so far in February, they have been running within that range and nearly flat to last year.Target shares, which had fallen 11 percent since news of the breach broke before Wednesday, were up 6.8 percent at $60.37, their highest level for almost six weeks.It was the first time the Minneapolis-based chain had faced Wall Street since the breach, which led to the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with information such as addresses and phone numbers of shoppers compromised.Earlier on Wednesday, Target warned that costs tied to the cyber attack could hurt its results in the first quarter and beyond.Still, its shares rose as its full-year outlook was better than some investors had expected. Mulligan said on the call that the outlook did not include potential additional costs related to the data breach.The retailer now sees 2014 buyback capacity at $1 billion to $2 billion as it sets aside money to cope with the breach and tries to stay away from borrowing more to preserve its credit rating. It had originally planned to buy back up to $4 billion of shares this year. Target reported a 46 percent drop in net profit in the crucial holiday quarter and reported $61 million in costs related to the breach, much of which was covered by insurance. It did not provide an estimate on future expenses related to the cyber attack, though it said they ""may have a material adverse effect"" on results of operations through the end of the current year and beyond.""It is going to take some time for this to heal,"" said Sean Naughton of Piper Jaffray, who estimates that transactions were down ""in the high single digits"" in the weeks after the breach was disclosed.Target said it sees first-quarter profit of 60 cents to 75 cents, excluding expenses related to the data breach and other items. Analysts expect the company to report quarterly profit of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year, Target sees earnings of $3.85 to $4.15 a share on that basis, compared with the analyst forecast of $4.15 per share.Naughton said that Target's reputation for having a top-rate shopping experience had been tarnished by the fact that many customers have either had to have payment cards replaced or find themselves checking their monthly statements more closely, giving them a negative association with the retailer. He noted that Target posted a 5.5 percent drop in transaction count during the quarter, the worst he had ever seen, even steeper than the 4.8 percent drop reported when the United States was in the midst of a financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008.Sales fell 3.8 percent to $21.52 billion in the fourth quarter, missing the already lowered estimate of $22.37 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, fell 2.5 percent.The data breach ""took the wind out of Target's sails - and unfortunately sales,"" said Sandy Skrovan, U.S. Research Director at Planet Retail.Net earnings fell to $520 million, or 81 cents a share in the three months that ended on Feb 1, from $961 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier. Excluding its losses in Canada and a host of items, it earned $1.30 a share. That was at the high end of its lowered forecast from January. The retailer had already lowered expectations for the fourth quarter. News of the breach has hurt its reputation and stock, and made many on Wall Street take down their profit and sales estimates on Target.THE BREACH EFFECT Target said of the $61 million in expenses related to the breach during the quarter, $44 million were offset by an insurance payment, bringing the impact to $17 million.Mark Rasch, a former cyber crimes prosecutor who worked on some of the biggest U.S. payment card breach cases, said that it was too early to estimate how big the bill would be, but it would certainly be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and could top $1 billion. ""We know it is going to be big. We just don't know how big,"" he said.Target has declined to discuss exactly what sorts of costs its cyber insurance will cover or identify its insurers.Insurers offer cyber policies that cover costs for items such as investigating breaches and repairing networks, compensating credit card issuers for fraudulent activity, fighting lawsuits and responding to regulatory probes.Target said breach-related expenses may include costs for reissuing cards, lawsuits, government probes and enforcement proceedings, legal expenses, investigative and consulting fees, and capital investments.(Reporting By Dhanya Skariachan in New York and Jim Finkle in Boston; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Rosalind Russell)",2014-02-26,TGT,"Wed Feb 26, 2014 | 1:52pm EST",Target shares recover after reassurance on data breach impact,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-target-results-idUSBREA1P0WC20140226?type=companyNews

Jacob, who comes from a sales background and has been CIO since 2008, will be replaced by an external hire, Target said in an email to Reuters on Wednesday.""It's a decision that should have been made by the CEO on Jan. 1, not through the resignation of an employee that overlooked critical weakness in the operating model,"" Belus Capital Advisors CEO Brian Sozzi said.The breach at Target was the second largest at a U.S. retailer, after the theft of more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc , operator of the T.J.

In the latest reported breach, beauty products retailer and distributor Sally Beauty Holdings Inc said on Wednesday its network had been hacked but no card or customer data appeared to have been stolen.Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company would elevate the role of chief information security officer as part of its plan to tighten its security. The company will also look externally to fill that position as well as the new position of chief compliance officer.Steinhafel said Target would be advised by security consultant Promontory Financial Group as it evaluates its technology, structure, processes and talent.""I believe this is definitely a measure in restoring faith and really showing that they are taking the breach seriously,"" Heather Bearfield, who runs the cybersecurity practice for accounting firm Marcum LLP, told Reuters.Target, the third-largest U.S. retailer, said last week customer traffic had started to improve this year after falling significantly toward the end of the holiday shopping season when news of the cyber attack spooked shoppers.Target shares were down 1.2 percent at $60.57 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",2014-03-05,TGT,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 1:38pm EST","UPDATE 2-Target announces technology overhaul, CIO departure",http://www.reuters.com//article/target-security-idUSL1N0M218D20140305?type=companyNews

101,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Target Corp and Trustwave Holdings Inc, which provides credit card security services, have been sued by two banks for ""monumental"" losses they say card issuers will face because of the retailer's holiday season data breach.In a complaint filed on Monday in Chicago federal court, Trustmark National Bank and Green Bank NA accused the defendants of failing to properly secure customer data, enabling the theft of about 40 million payment card records plus 70 million other records, including addresses and phone numbers.The banks said they lost money from alerting customers to the breach, reimbursing fraudulent charges and reissuing cards. These losses could increase, they said, if criminals ultimately use several million stolen cards as some analysts project.While the complaint seeks unspecified damages of at least $5 million, New York-based Trustmark and Houston-based Green Bank said losses could top $1 billion for card issuers they hope to represent in a class action, and $18 billion for banks and retailers combined.Target already faces dozen of lawsuits over the breach.

102,"  (Corrects headquarters to Minneapolis in paragraph 10)By Doina ChiacuWASHINGTON, March 25 Target Corp missed multiple opportunities to thwart the hackers responsible for the unprecedented holiday shopping season data breach, U.S. Senate staffers charged in a committee report released on Tuesday.There was no indication the No. 3 U.S. retailer responded to warnings that malware was being installed on Target's system. Other automated warnings the company ignored revealed how the attackers would carry data out of Target's network, according to the report.""This analysis suggests that Target missed a number of opportunities along the kill chain to stop the attackers and prevent the massive data breach,"" according to the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee report.The staff report, ""A 'Kill Chain' Analysis of the 2013 Target Data Breach,"" looked at previously reported information and used an analytical tool called an ""intrusion kill chain"" framework used widely by information security field. It was released on the eve of a committee hearing on how to protect personal consumer information from cyber attack. Witnesses will include John Mulligan, Target's executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Edith Ramirez, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder declined committee on the staff report, saying the company did not want to discuss the breach before Wednesday's testimony by Mulligan.The staff report said Target ""failed to respond to multiple automated warnings from the company's anti-intrusion software"" that 1) the attackers were installing malicious software and 2) they were planning escape routes for the information they planned to steal from the retailer's network. It also said Target gave access to its network to a third-party vendor that did not follow accepted information security practices.Target also did not isolate its most sensitive network assets, enabling the attackers to move from less sensitive areas to the places where Target stored consumer information. The Minneapolis-based company admitted this month that security software detected potentially malicious activity during last year's massive data breach, but its staff decided not to take immediate action.It also said that last year's massive security breach could have been more extensive than reported so far, leading to further losses at the company.The company has said so far that some 40 million payment card records were stolen along with 70 million other customer records during a cyber attack over the holiday shopping season.Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers, and credit card companies are pushing for better security.Target also faces dozens of potential class-action lawsuits and action from banks that could seek reimbursement for millions of dollars in losses due to fraud and the cost of card replacements.

108,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON, April 1  WASHINGTON, April 1 The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared poised to limit the scope of a federal criminal law that targets people who defraud banks.A ruling along those lines could prevent federal prosecutors from using the law to crack down on routine fraud, such as the use of altered checks to purchase merchandise.In the future, prosecutors might have to show the defendant intended to defraud a bank in order to win a conviction using the law. Cases of fraud that do not include intent to defraud could still be prosecuted under state laws or potentially via another federal law that imposes shorter sentences.The case will not affect the ability of prosecutors to use the law to go after direct schemes to defraud financial institutions. The nine justices heard a one-hour oral argument on Tuesday  in an appeal brought by Kevin Loughrin, who was convicted in Salt Lake City, Utah, of six counts of bank fraud for stealing checks he then altered so he could purchase merchandise at Target Corp stores.Loughrin told police he intended to buy items using the checks, then return them for cash refunds. He was charged with using altered checks totaling $1,184. During the argument a majority of the justices appeared to agree with Loughrin's lawyer that the federal government's interpretation of the law was too broad but it was unclear exactly what limits the court would set. The court's conservative members, in particular, are often concerned about expansive federal power at the expense of states.""This is a sweeping interpretation you're offering us,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy told Anthony Yang, assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General. Under the government's approach, federal prosecutors could pursue cases involving ""every fraudulent transaction in the economy, whenever a check is involved,"" Kennedy added.Between 2006 and 2010 the government sought to prosecute nearly 3,000 cases using the statute, according to court papers.In Loughrin's case, the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction in a March 2013 ruling. Loughrin did not appeal his related convictions for identity theft and possession of stolen mail.A decision is expected by the end of June. The case is Loughrin v. United States, U.S. Supreme Court, 13-316.

115,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO, April 22  SAN FRANCISCO, April 22 Hacking for espionage purposes is sharply increasing, with groups or national governments from Eastern Europe playing a growing role, according to one of the most comprehensive annual studies of computer intrusions.Spying intrusions traced back to any country in 2013 were blamed on residents of China and other East Asian nations 49 percent of the time, but Eastern European countries, especially Russian-speaking nations, were the suspected launching site for 21 percent of breaches, Verizon Communications Inc's said in its annual Data Breach Investigations Report.Those were by far the most active areas detected in the sampling, which drew more than half of its data from victims in the United States. About 25 percent of spying incidents could not be attributed to attackers from any country, according to the authors of the report.Though the overall number of spying incidents studied tripled to 511 from total in the 2013 Verizon report, most of that increase is due to the addition of new data sources. Even looking at just the same contributors as before, however, espionage cases grew, said Verizon investigator Bryan Sartin. Not all electronic spying was blamed on governments. Investigators from Verizon, Intel Corp's McAfee, Kaspersky Labs and other private companies and public agencies contributing data ascribed 11 percent of espionage attacks to organized criminals and 87 percent to governments.In some cases, the criminal gangs were probably looking to sell what they found to governments or competitors of the victims. ""We do see a slight merging between the classic organized criminal and the espionage crook,"" Sartin said, adding that he expected that trend to continue.If the rise of detected Eastern European spying comes as a surprise to those mainly familiar with accusations against China, a bigger surprise might be the study's findings about attacks on retailers. Though recent breaches at Target Corp and other retailers through their point-of-sale equipment have dominated the headlines and prompted congressional hearings in the past few months, fewer such intrusions have been reported to the Verizon team than in past years, even as the number of report contributors has multiplied.""The media frenzy makes quite a splash, but from a frequency standpoint, this largely remains a small-and-medium business issue,"" the study says.The report will be released to the public on Wednesday.

134,"  (Adds analyst quotes, details on discounting and interest expense, updates shares)By Siddharth CavaleMay 21 Target Corp reported a 16 percent drop in first-quarter profit but showed some signs of progress in its efforts to rebuild customer confidence in the wake of a massive theft of payment card data and a botched expansion into Canada.Target, which has fired both its chief executive and the head of its Canadian operation as it tries to regain its footing, reported a 0.3 percent drop in U.S. same-store sales on Wednesday. Analysts had expected a fall of 1.1 percent.Target shares were flat at midday, reflecting lingering concerns about the company's prospects as it resorts to discounts to win back customers and faces the daunting task of getting its business in Canada on track.""It could have been worse is the general refrain..."", said David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets. ""...It was not the disaster that was feared.""Target said traffic was ""dramatically better"" in the first quarter compared with late fourth-quarter trends. Even so, U.S. store traffic fell more than 2 percent in the quarter and total sales rose just 2.1 percent to $17.05 billion, only slightly better than analysts had expected.Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at investment firm Edward Jones, said he expected discounting - which hurt gross margins by more than a percentage point in the quarter - to continue until year-end when he expects traffic to start growing again.Traffic improved in February and March despite the harsh weather that other retailers have blamed for weak sales, interim Chief Executive John Mulligan said on a call with reporters. Mulligan, the company's chief financial officer, replaced Gregg Steinhafel, who was ousted earlier in May after a data breach during the holiday shopping season resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers.Steinhafel had also overseen Target's bungled push into Canada, where the company lost almost $1 billion last year after opening 124 stores in an unprecedented expansion that caused supply chain and other operational problems.Target fired the head of its Canada operations, Tony Fisher, on Tuesday and replaced him with company veteran Mark Schindele. ""We are not where we need to be (in Canada),"" Mulligan said.The company lowered its adjusted full-year profit forecast to $3.60-$3.90 per share from $3.85-$4.15 to account for increased discounting and investments in e-commerce.Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $3.98 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Target's net income fell 16 percent to $418 million in the quarter ended May 3 even after benefiting from a year-earlier comparison that included a huge debt retirement charge related to the sale of the company's credit card operations.Excluding items, the company earned 70 cents per share,  missing the average estimate by 1 cent.Target's shares were up 0.4 percent at $56.62 at midday.

135,"   By Allison Martell, Solarina Ho and Susan Taylor | TORONTO  TORONTO A pink Barbie-branded SUV that seats two toddlers offers a surprising glimpse into the myriad problems that jammed up Target Corp's (TGT.N) supply chain when it set up shop in Canada, and the challenge facing Target's new Canadian head.The toy was one of many products that piled up in bewildering volume at Target's new distribution centers as it opened 124 stores across Canada last year, said two former employees of the company's Canadian logistics contractor.Only a year ago, Target was touting its first store openings in Canada. Then Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel told investors he was pleased with how his workers and systems were handling the launch. But things were already going awry, said the sources, who worked at two of Target's three distribution hubs and spoke on condition of anonymity.Goods were coming into the warehouses faster than they were going out, in part because the barcodes on many items did not match what was in the computer system. As shipments stacked up, Target flew in dozens of red-shirted staff from the United States to shore up the operation, the sources said.This insiders' view, which has not been reported before, may partially explain why shoppers have been disappointed by empty shelves at some of Target's Canadian stores. It is a cautionary tale for other U.S. retailers who may be considering a big push into Canada.Target, which reported another big quarterly loss in its Canadian operation on Wednesday, has said little about what went wrong with its supply chain in Canada. But on Tuesday it fired Tony Fisher, the president of its operation there, and replaced him with Mark Schindele, a veteran U.S. executive with deep experience in managing supply chains.Target's launch into Canada, its first international venture, was code-named Project Bacon, an apparently playful reference to Canadian bacon sold in U.S. supermarkets. Instead of a slow province-by-province rollout, the retailer clinched a big real estate deal, locking itself into a rapid, coast-to-coast launch that later magnified supply chain problems.The company said in February it had ""dramatically reduced"" congestion in the supply chain but did not give details. Asked to comment on the sources' depiction of overflowing warehouses, Target said it did not discuss vendor relationships.""We have been very clear that we need to improve operations and our guest experience in Canada,"" spokeswoman Dustee Jenkins said in an emailed statement. She said Target was taking its challenges seriously and making changes.MISSING THE MARK Target does much of its own distribution in the United States, but it hired Eleven Points Logistics, a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based Genco, to run its three warehouses in Canada. Neither Eleven Points nor Genco responded to requests for comment.Located near the Quebec border, outside of Toronto and near Calgary, each warehouse covers some 1.5 million square feet, or about 26 American football fields.As goods arrived at the warehouses, workers found errors, 12 shirts per box when the computer system expected 24, for example, the two former Eleven Points employees said.It is not clear whether these errors were caused by Target's buyers entering bad data, vendors making mistakes, some glitch in Eleven Points' warehouse computer system or all three.The inconsistencies between goods and computer records caused a chain reaction of delays. Problem shipments needed to be unpacked and cataloged, a time-consuming process. They piled up instead of going out to stores, taking over large parts of the massive warehouses, on a scale the sources said they had never seen at previous jobs. Finding the source of this type of error can require a long and complex audit, said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consulting firm MWPVL International, who has analyzed and written about Target's supply chain.""The Target Canada story will go down in the history books as one of the great supply chain disasters of Canadian history,"" he said, pointing to the Canadian operation's $941 million loss before interest and taxes last year.While Eleven Points ran the warehouses, teams of workers and managers, sometimes 30 or more at a time, would arrive from Target's U.S. distribution centers to help resolve the choke points, the sources said.""They'd send a big sea of red shirts,"" said one source. But the U.S. workers were used to different computer systems and stocking procedures, limiting the amount they could help.Many of the products that made it through processing and into the warehouses did not seem to sell, like the Barbie SUVs. These goods, selected by Target's buyers, further clogged up the distribution system, the former Eleven Points employees said.BIG TARGET  Target decided early against gradual expansion in Canada, where competition for prime retail space is fierce. It concluded that the best way to get into key markets was to do a deal with either Sears Canada Inc. (SCC.TO) or Hudson Bay Co's (HBC.TO) ailing discount chain Zellers, according to a British Columbia Labour Relations Board decision that drew on testimony from the company.The company decided that a Zellers deal offered the quickest route to ""critical mass"".""It was a unique opportunity to get that big parcel of real estate,"" said Antony Karabus, president of Hilco Retail Consulting, who has worked with retailers on both sides of the border. ""In a sense, they were compelled to grow very fast.""That was a problem because Canadian supply chains are complicated. Goods have to travel huge distances, and tastes vary between regions.""How could you possibly stock 120 big stores with an assortment that probably need to vary meaningfully by region, and not make a ton of mistakes, operationally?"" Karabus said.Reporting first quarter earnings, Target said it was seeing ""early signs of improvement"" in Canada. It disclosed a $211 million loss before interest and taxes, on $393 million in sales. The operation's gross profit margin was 18.7 percent, compared with 29.5 percent in the United States.Target is not the first retailer to stumble in an international push.In 2012 home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) closed its big box stores in China after running into tough competition and misjudging local tastes. In 2006, Wal-Mart sold stores and exited South Korea, saying it would be difficult to reach the scale it required.New Target Canada president Schindele has his work cut out for him. More than a year in, some stores are still visibly under-stocked. At three Toronto stores that Reuters visited over the last week, there were still some empty shelves.

140,"  (Adds details on Gap Inc sales, economic background)By Jeffrey DastinJune 5 Average sales growth at 10 U.S. retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Rite Aid Corp, topped expectations in May for a second month in a row as shoppers headed to malls in droves around the Memorial Day weekend, according Thomson Reuters data.Sales at established stores on average rose 4.4 percent in May, higher than the 3.9 percent increase analysts had estimated, according to the Thomson Reuters' same-store sales index.The May increase followed a growth spurt in April, when same-store sales for the group rose 6.4 percent, buoyed by the release of pent-up demand after a harsh winter that had kept many consumers home. Most of the retail group, which excludes giants such as Walmart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Best Buy Co, exceeded or equaled sales growth in May 2013.""It's not just warm weather,"" said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. ""In comparison, temperatures were nearly identical to last year. Presumably [the change] is more fundamental.""Niemira said he expected sales activity to moderate in June after April and May's robust growth. The data is more evidence that the U.S. economy is picking up momentum after slowing during the winter, when weather was colder than usual in many parts of the country.Costco reported a 6 percent increase, stronger than the 4.8 percent that analysts had expected, and its shares rose more than 1 percent on Thursday.

141,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | June 5  June 5 Average sales growth at nine U.S. retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Rite Aid Corp, topped expectations in May for a second month in a row as shoppers headed to malls in droves around the Memorial Day weekend, according Thomson Reuters data.Sales at established stores on average rose 4.3 percent in May, higher than the 3.9 percent increase analysts had estimated, according to the Thomson Reuters' same-store sales index.The results exclude Gap Inc, one of the index's 10 components. It will release its May sales later Thursday. Gap was included in the 3.9 percent average estimate.The May increase followed a growth spurt in April, when same-store sales for the group rose 6.4 percent, buoyed by the release of pent-up demand after a harsh winter that had kept many consumers home. Most of the retail group, which excludes giants such as Walmart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Best Buy Co, exceeded or equaled sales growth in May 2013.""It's not just warm weather,"" said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. ""In comparison, temperatures were nearly identical to last year. Presumably [the change] is more fundamental."" Costco reported a 6 percent increase, stronger than the 4.8 percent that analysts had expected, and its shares rose nearly 1 percent in late morning trading.Drugstore operators Rite Aid and Walgreen Co  posted an average sales increase of 4.1 percent, slightly lower than analysts' estimates, but higher than the average 2.8 percent growth they had recorded in May 2013. While apparel retailers inched ahead of May forecasts, their sales growth slowed after strong April buying.L Brands Inc, which owns brands such as Victoria's Secret, managed a 3 percent comparable sales increase after 8 percent growth in April.Gap Inc faces the weakest May estimate at 0.2 percent, compared with 7 percent growth recorded last year. The company will release its results at 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) Thursday.

The appointment was evidence of Target's renewed focus on securing customer data to prevent a repeat of the data breach, Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said.""While the average customer may not recognize the managerial changes, they should expect to see enhanced transactional security in the future,"" Feldman said. The appointment comes a day before Target's shareholder meeting, at which proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended that shareholders vote against seven of the company's 10 directors, saying the board failed to manage risks that led to the data breach. Target was the victim of a cyber attack in December that resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. Since then, the company has announced plans to overhaul its information security practices and bolster its technology management team, including elevating the role of chief information security officer.

Maiorino, who previously worked with General Electric Co (GE.N), will report to Chief Information Officer Bob DeRodes, Target said.

146,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its long-term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) on Target Corporation (Target) at 'A-', and its short-term IDR at  'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Target had $14.1 billion of debt outstanding  as of May 3, 2014. A full rating list is shown below. Key Rating Drivers: The affirmation reflects Target's strong competitive position in the discount  retail sector and steady but recently softer performance from its U.S. business.  These factors are balanced against a difficult market entry into Canada leading  to sizable operating losses, with challenges ahead in turning the business  around. The rating further reflects Fitch's expectation that financial leverage  will moderate over the next year to around 2.3x times from 2.55x currently.  Sales were soft in Target's U.S. segment in 2013, reflecting the challenging  environment facing low- and middle-income consumers, exacerbated by the data  breach that was announced one week before Christmas. Target's U.S. comp store  sales were down 0.4% in 2013 and down 0.3% in the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14).  The EBIT margin narrowed from 7.8% to 7.0% during 2013 due primarily to lower  credit card income following the sale of the receivables portfolio to TD Bank in  March 2013, as well as investments made to support multichannel initiatives.   Fitch expects the challenging environment will likely continue to constrain  sales growth in the near term, with U.S. comp sales growing by 1%-2% for  full-year 2014, leading to modest domestic EBIT growth.  The significant shortfall in the performance of the Canadian business could  constrain Target's results over the medium term, as sales volumes are much lower  than initially expected. The costs associated with clearing excess inventory in  Canada were a major drag on Canada's earnings in 4Q'13 and into 1Q'14. The  Canadian business had EBITDA of negative $714 million in 2013, and Fitch expects  EBITDA losses will narrow by $250 million-$300 million in 2014.  However, generating positive EBITDA in Canada will be a significant challenge.  Assuming Canadian SG&A (net of depreciation and amortization of $300 million) of  $1 billion to $1.1 billion and a 30% gross margin rate, sales in Canada would  have to reach $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion, essentially double the LTM sales  level of $1.62 billion, to reach a breakeven EBITDA level.  Fitch views the data breach, which was announced on Dec. 19, 2013, as a  manageable issue. The negative sales impact from the data breach continued into  fiscal 2014, but is starting to abate. Fitch expects other costs such as fraud  reimbursement, card reissuance costs and litigation will be manageable in the  context of the company's healthy ongoing cash flow.   Free cash flow (FCF) post-dividends is projected at around $1 billion beginning  in 2014, supported by a reduction in capex to around $2.4 billion in 2014 from  $3.5 billion in 2013 due to the completion of the Canadian store build-out.  Target has guided to share repurchases of $1 billion-$2 billion in 2014, but has  not given any guidance as to the cash costs of resolving the data breach  liabilities. It is expected that the company will size its share repurchases  based on its operating performance and the level of the data breach costs, and  that debt levels will be flat for the year.   Adjusted leverage was 2.55x at May 2014 compared with 2.4x at end-2013 (Feb. 1,  2014).  Leverage is expected to improve to 2.3x at end-2014 on flat debt levels  and improved EBITDA to $6.6 billion versus $6.2 billion in 2013, and to drift  down to the 2.1x-2.2x range over the next few years, which is consistent with  the company's long-term target.   Rating Sensitivities: A positive rating action could be triggered by improved operating momentum in  the domestic business, a successful turnaround in Canada, and a policy to  maintain leverage at or below 2.0x.  A negative rating action could be triggered by operating shortfalls and/or more  aggressive share repurchase activity that drove leverage to over 2.5x for an  extended period.   Fitch affirms the following: Target Corporation --Long-term IDR at 'A-';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Bank credit facility at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

147,"  U.S. retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) increased yields on Tuesday to sell $2 billion of bonds in a two-part offering and plans to use part of the proceeds to buy back as much as $1 billion of debt. The company priced its five-year bonds to yield 2.348 percent on maturity, which is about 0.6 percentage point more than comparable U.S. Treasuries. Target priced its 10-year bonds to yield 3.553 percent, which is about 0.9 percentage points more than the standard rate. Target said it planned to use proceeds from the sale of bonds to buy back as much as $1 billion of existing debt from among $3.76 billion of certain notes and debentures maturing between 2028 and 2038. Target was the victim of a cyber attack in December that resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. Since then, the company has announced plans to overhaul its information security practices and bolster its technology management team. In May Target reported a 16 percent drop in first-quarter profit and lowered its adjusted full-year profit forecast to $3.60-$3.90 per share from $3.85-$4.15 to account for increased discounting and investments in e-commerce.

149,"   By Jennifer Chaussee | SACRAMENTO  SACRAMENTO California's top court on Monday unanimously ruled that large retailers are not required to provide automated external defibrillators (AEDs) inside their stores, deciding in favor of Target Corp in a wrongful death lawsuit brought after a shopper's sudden death.The Supreme Court in California dismissed the argument that the U.S. retailer fell under a state health code statute that requires gyms and other ""health studios"" to make available the life-saving machines.""We conclude that, under California law, Target's common law duty of care to its customers does not include a duty to acquire and make available an AED for use in a medical emergency,"" the six-judge panel wrote in an opinion on Monday.The court's decision was a defeat for the mother and brother of 49-year-old Mary Ann Verdugo, who died of a sudden heart attack while shopping with her at a Target store in 2008 Pico Rivera, California, a city near Los Angeles. The wrongful death lawsuit alleged the company violated a common law duty to provide first aid to the large volume of customers that frequent its California stores daily, noting that AEDs retail on its website for $1,200.""The inexpensive availability of AEDs and their ease of use with even minimal or no advance training have led to on-site CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and AED assistance to now be an expected part of first aid response,"" the Verdugo's complaint said.

""This is a complicated issue, but it boils down to a simple belief: Bringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create,"" said Mulligan.A number of national eateries, including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, Sonic Drive-In, Chili's Grill & Bar and Jack in the Box Inc have also asked patrons to keep their firearms at home. An advocacy group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America waged a social media campaign to boycott Target after photos circulated of members of open carry groups in Texas walking through stores with rifles and shotguns slung over their shoulders. ""Moms everywhere were horrified to see images of people carrying loaded assault rifles down the same aisles where we shop for diapers and toys,"" founder Shannon Watts said in a statement.Open Carry Tarrant County, a gun rights group behind campaigns that have drawn some of the most attention, said on Wednesday members will continue to exercise their right to carry weapons in public.""They just want to shut up the cry babies who support more victims for criminals. The Unarmed!,"" the group said on  Facebook posting.

157,"  * June exports -2.0 pct y/y; imports +8.4 pct y/y     * Japan logs record two full years of trade deficits     * Weak exports source of concern for policymakers     * Analysts doubt BOJ can meet inflation target   (Adds graphic link, Reuters poll, details)     By Tetsushi Kajimoto     TOKYO, July 24 Japan's exports unexpectedly fell in June for a second straight month, weighed down by a drop in shipments to Asia and the United States, signalling that weak external demand may require bolder measures from policymakers to sustain the country's economic recovery.     Exports fell 2.0 percent in June from a year earlier, compared with a 1.0 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll, data from the Ministry of Finance showed on Thursday.     That followed a 2.7 percent decline in the prior month, which was the first annual drop in 15 months.     Sluggish exports, a weak spot in the world's third-largest economy, have been a concern for policymakers who hoped that a recovery in external demand would help offset the pain from a sales tax hike in April.     Analysts say weak exports alone may not prompt the Bank of Japan to expand its massive quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policy, but if domestic demand fails to convincingly recover, it could raise expectations for additional monetary expansion.     Those expectations had subsided in recent weeks in the face of the BOJ's dogged confidence that it will meet its goal to push inflation to 2 percent by next year. The target is a core element in the government's ""Abenomics"" strategy to pull the long-moribund economy from two decades of deflation.     ""This raises more concern about how the economy will do after the sales tax hike and makes the government less likely to proceed with the next tax hike scheduled for next year,"" said Yasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.     ""Weak exports alone will not prompt the Bank of Japan to ease policy, but if consumer spending also weakened, then expectations for a policy change would increase.""     Exports to the United States, a key market, fell 2.2 percent in June from a year ago as more Japanese companies produce goods in other countries, such as Mexico, for U.S. consumers. Car shipments to the United States fell 6.8 percent.     Exports to China, another key market for Japan, rose 1.5 percent, but exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japan's total exports, fell 3.8 percent, hit by sluggish shipments of electronics parts.     Some respite for policymakers, though, came in the form of July's Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) which saw the new export orders return to growth for the first time in four months.                INFLATION TARGET IN DOUBT?     Despite the BOJ's rosy outlook on prices, economists doubt its inflation target will be met next year. Economists expect inflation to stay at 1.1 percent this fiscal year and next, according to a Reuters poll released earlier on Thursday.      Tepid exports would weigh on the economy and keep a lid on inflation, posing challenges for policymakers. The BOJ and the government, as well as private-sector analysts, trimmed their economic growth estimates for the current fiscal year, but they have kept their inflation projections intact.     Analysts expect Japan's consumer inflation to slow to around 1 percent in the coming months as the impact of a weak yen on import costs runs its course, although prices are likely to pick up later this year if a tight labour market pushes up wages.      Data due on Friday is likely to show the nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh foods, rose 1.3 percent year-on-year in June, when stripping out the effect of the sales tax hike.           TRADE DEFICIT     Japan's imports grew 8.4 percent in the year to June, matching the median estimate, due to hefty fuel imports, bringing the trade balance to a deficit of 822.2 billion yen ($8.10 billion), the MOF data showed, marking two full years of trade shortfalls, the longest run on record.     On a half-year basis, Japan logged a record trade deficit of 7.5984 trillion yen in the first half of 2014, the data showed.         BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said last week exports would increase eventually as overseas markets, mainly in advanced economies, recover, while Finance Minister Taro Aso has also blamed weakness in emerging market economies for Japan's lacklustre export performance.     Policymakers and analysts also cite the ongoing shift of Japanese factories  abroad as being partially responsible for prolonged weakness in exports.     Aggressive monetary stimulus by the BOJ helped weaken the yen by roughly 20 percent in 2013, boosting exporters' profits and share prices. However, the yen has moved sideways this year versus the dollar, limiting gains in export proceeds and sales.

165,"   By Solarina Ho and Susan Taylor | TORONTO  TORONTO Target Corp (TGT.N) is repairing the supply chain problems it holds largely responsible for last year's botched Canadian expansion and expects to show measurable progress on a turnaround by this fall, its top executive in Canada said on Tuesday.In its first international expansion, Minneapolis-based Target opened an unprecedented 124 stores and three distribution centers in Canada last year, losing nearly $1 billion as sales fell far short of expectations.Disappointed shoppers complained of higher prices than in U.S. stores, poor selection, and empty shelves, and distribution center workers told Reuters that poor planning led to supply chain problems that began long before the first store opened. ""With the benefit of hindsight, if we could do it all over again, we wouldn't have opened up that many stores, that many DCs (distribution centers), in that short a time frame. I know that much,"" Mark Schindele, Target Canada's new president, told Reuters.""We're now unwinding some of the decisions we made that were based on speed.""Some analysts say that Target, which was also hurt badly by a massive U.S. data breach late last year that involved 40 million payment card numbers, should cut its losses in Canada and either close poorly performing stores or pull out entirely.Schindele, a 15-year Target veteran who came to Canada in May, said the company is focused on improving all of its stores and would not answer questions about whether any closures are being considered.  SUPPLY CHAIN ""RESET""  The discount retailer is pushing a three-pronged turnaround plan that will focus on its supply chain, pricing, and merchandise selection.As a first step, all 130 stores are counting their inventory, to help ""reset"" an overwhelmed supply chain. Most stores have completed that work and are reporting significantly fuller shelves, Schindele said.He added that the rapid pace of Target's entry resulted in problems with the set-up of its all-new Canadian technology systems due to hastily made decisions.A key issue, distribution center staff had told Reuters, was that shipments of many products coming into warehouses did not match data in Target's computer system. That created a bottleneck as staff scrambled to reconcile differences.Schindele said that when the system was first set up, minimum order quantities were not aggregated at the vendor level, as is typically done, but by the distribution centers, which made tracking purchase orders difficult. ""If your data integrity isn't good, it's really hard to keep stores in stock,"" he said. With one year of operations under its belt, Target Canada now has sales data to help forecast demand and allocate products. Schindele said excess inventory problems have been   alleviated significantly since last year.The recovery plan, which reflects work with two different consultants, also includes retraining staff. Workers were initially pushing inventory through the system, rather than allowing the software to do its job, Schindele said.Technology will be reconfigured and stores will also see merchandise shipped more frequently.""We expect to see measurable progress this fall,"" Schindele said, but did not provide details. In response to customer complaints, the company said it is changing its price-match policy to add Canadian online retailers such as Amazon.ca and Walmart.ca, while allowing shoppers to use popular price matching apps.The cheap-chic retailer will add 30,000 new products and expand its line of exclusive products, including a partnership with Canadian celebrity interior designer Sarah Richardson to try to boost sales.Executives would not provide any Canadian sales or profit growth targets or say how much the repair plan will cost.Target cut its second-quarter profit estimate last week and said Canadian sales were softer than expected. The company is scheduled to report results on Aug. 20. New Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell officially starts work on Tuesday, but he was briefed by Schindele last week on the recovery plan and will tour Target stores when he visits Canada this week.(This story corrects spelling of name for interior designer Sarah Richardson) (Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson; and Peter Galloway)",2014-08-12,TGT,"Tue Aug 12, 2014 | 4:06pm EDT",Target says supply chain 'reset' will help fix Canada woes,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-target-canada-idUSKBN0GC1SW20140812?type=companyNews
166,"  (Changes source, adds CEO comment and details from statement)Aug 15 Supervalu Inc said it is investigating a potential data breach that could have affected some of its retail food stores, including some of its associated stand-alone liquor stores.Supervalu said the intrusion may have resulted in the theft of account numbers and other numerical information from payment cards used at some point-of-sale systems at the company's owned and franchised stores.The data breach appears to have taken place during the period of June 22 through July 17, said the retailer.""The intrusion was identified by our internal team, it was quickly contained, and we have had no evidence of any misuse of any customer data,"" Supervalu CEO, Sam Duncan, said in a statement early on Friday. Supervalu, which had 3,763 outlets as of April, said customers can safely use their credit and debit cards in its stores.The company also said it has notified federal law enforcement authorities and is cooperating in their efforts to investigate this intrusion. It has also notified the major payment card brands.Companies in the United States, particularly retailers, have been targeted by hackers for customer data on payment cards. U.S. retailer Target Corp is struggling to win back customers after it suffered a huge data breach last year that resulted in the theft of 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data such as email addresses and phone numbers.Michaels Stores Inc, the biggest U.S. arts and crafts retailer, said in May it also suffered a security breach that may have affected about 2.6 million payment cards. Reuters reported in January that smaller breaches on at least three other well-known retailers in the country took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target.Retailers are often reluctant to report breaches out of concern it could hurt their businesses. Target only acknowledged its 2013 attack after security blogger Brian Krebs reported the breach, prompting inquiries from journalists and investors.Most states have laws that require companies to contact customers when certain personal information is compromised. In many cases the task of notification falls on the credit card issuer.Merchants are required to report breaches of personal information including social security numbers.

176,"  Aug 20 Target Corp reported a 62 percent drop in second-quarter profit and cut its full-year earnings forecast as it resorts to price cuts to attract cash-strapped consumers and win over shoppers unnerved by a massive holiday-season data breach.Target, whose shares were down 2.5 percent at $57.75 in premarket trading on Wednesday, cut its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $3.10-$3.30 per share from $3.60-3.90.The company cut its earnings estimate for the second quarter earlier this month, saying a pullback in consumer spending had led to weak sales.The profit announced on Wednesday matched the company's estimate released on Aug. 5.Target also said then that the data breach, which resulted in the theft of at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data, had cost it a net $111 million so far after taking insurance into account. The company did not provide an updated figure on Wednesday.Sales at U.S. mass merchandisers such as Target and Wal-Mart Stores Inc have been hit as consumers struggling with stagnant wages and higher taxes reduce spending.On top of that, Target has also run up big losses in Canada where its ambitious expansion has stumbled due to supply chain issues and a backlash from consumers who had expected prices to be more in line with those in the United States. Target said its net profit fell to $234 million, or 37 cents per share, in the three months ended Aug. 2, from $611 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 78 cents per share.

177,"   By Kim Palmer | CLEVELAND  CLEVELAND Ohio's attorney general said on Tuesday he has assigned a prosecutor with experience in police-involved shootings to investigate the death of a man shot while holding a BB gun at a Dayton-area Walmart.But lawyers for the family of John Crawford III, who was shot and killed by Beavercreek police earlier this month, said his death was unjustified, demanded that all surveillance video of the shooting be released and called for the case to be turned over to federal authorities.Attorney General Mike DeWine told reporters that Mark Piepmeier of Hamilton County has been assigned as the special prosecutor for the case, which will go before a special grand jury on Sept. 22. ""What happened on August 5 is a true tragedy ..."" DeWine said. ""Mr. Piepmeier will do everything in his power to seek justice in this case.""Crawford's death came a few days before the Aug. 9 fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, which is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department and has focused national attention on the use of deadly force by police. Beavercreek police say they shot and killed Crawford because he was waving the BB gun and didn't drop it when commanded by police, according to local media accounts.Lawyers for the Crawford family and Crawford's father have viewed 5 to 6 minutes of surveillance video of the shooting. The lawyers said at a news conference on Tuesday that Crawford was talking on a cell phone and had picked up the gun off a shelf. ""He was doing nothing more, nothing less than just shopping,"" attorney Michael Wright said.Crawford's father, John Crawford Jr., told reporters he was concerned about the delay in the justice system dealing with the officers involved.Beavercreek police asked the attorney general to take over the Ohio investigation, and the local county prosecutor said a special prosecutor was needed. A representative for the Beavercreek police was not immediately available for comment.Piepmeier, who has been involved in investigating more than 100 officer-involved use of force cases, will begin the special grand jury proceedings on Sept. 22.

""At this point, I can confirm that we're looking into some unusual activity and we are working with our banking partners and law enforcement to investigate,"" Home Depot representative  Paula Drake wrote in an emailed statement to Reuters.""If we confirm that a breach has occurred, we will make sure customers are notified immediately.""The statement came after security website KrebsonSecurity first reported that multiple banks had seen evidence that Home Depot may be the source of stolen credit and debit cards put up for sale on underground markets. Brian Krebs, who runs the website, could not be immediately reached for comment. Krebs wrote on his website that his preliminary analysis indicated the problem could affect all of Home Depot's 2,200 stores in the United States. He said several banks he contacted believed the breach could extend back to April or May of this year.""If that is accurate - and if even a majority of Home Depot stores were compromised - this breach could be many times larger than Target,"" Krebs wrote.In the Target breach, which hit the retailer during the important year-end holiday shopping season, hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. The incident cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars and prompted numerous investigations by attorneys general and congressional hearings and inquiries. In May, the company ousted its CEO, Gregg Steinhafel, who has now been replaced by former Wal-Mart Stores Inc executive Brian Cornell.Numerous companies have come under the spotlight for potential breaches in recent months.In some situations, companies that conduct investigations into data breaches may not be able to come to a definitive conclusion. For instance, Sears Holdings Corp said in February that an investigation into a possible data breach did not reveal conclusive information.Retailers have been taking steps to better protect customer data.Wal-Mart Stores Inc said last week that 4,600 of its group stores were now using payment terminals capable of reading credit and debit cards that store information on computer chips. Such cards are more secure than conventional ones that store data on magnetic stripes. The bulk of those stores activated the terminals this year, spokesman Randy Hargrove said. The retailer plans to activate terminals in its remaining U.S. stores by the end of 2014.

""It is important to emphasize that no customers will be responsible for fraudulent charges to their accounts.""The breach was first reported by security website KrebsOnSecurity almost a week ago. It said the problem could extend back to April and affect all of Home Depot's 2,200 stores in the United States. No details were immediately available on how many customers were impacted. But Brian Krebs, who runs the security website, said last week the breach could be larger than Target's last year when hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data.Krebs reported on Monday that Home Depot's systems were hit by a variant of the same malware that compromised Target's systems last year.Target has spent $146 million to resolve data breach-related issues since the fourth quarter of 2013. Most of these expenses were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims, mainly by payment card networks. The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, which had more than 90 million credit cards stolen over about 18 months.Home Depot said it started investigating the data breach last Tuesday, but the investigation will look at data from April.

182,"  Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) has been sued over data breach by a customer, saying the company failed to properly safeguard customer data from hackers, a lawsuit filed in a Chicago federal court showed on Tuesday.The lawsuit comes a day after Home Depot confirmed that its payment security systems have been breached, potentially impacting its customers in stores across the United States and Canada. Illinois resident Kelsey O'Brien filed the lawsuit, seeking class-action status, compensatory and punitive damages and credit card monitoring services for a period of three years.O'Brien said he used his credit card at two Home Depot stores on May 19 and June 2 and had his personal financial information exposed.Home Depot had failed to comply with reasonable security standards at the expense and to the severe detriment of its own customers, the lawsuit said.Several stolen card details were placed for sale on an underground website notorious for offering stolen card data and were being used to change the PIN numbers, it said. ""We haven't seen the suit yet and right now we are focused on our customers and the investigation, so it would be premature to comment,"" Stephen Holmes, a Home Depot spokesman said.The retailer said there was no evidence that online customers were affected or debit personal identification numbers (PINs) were compromised, but experts fear the attack could rival Target Corp's (TGT.N) massive breach last year.Home Depot said customers who shopped at its stores as far back as April were exposed, suggesting the breach extended through the busy summer season. The company, which had said earlier it would roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores, has promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially impacted customers.The breach was first reported by security website KrebsOnSecurity last Tuesday. Krebs said on Sunday that Home Depot's systems were hit by a variant of the same malware that compromised Target’s systems last year.  Target's data breach weeks before Christmas led to theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with customer details.Two senators asked the federal government to investigate the Home Depot breach and five U.S. states launched a probe into the matter on Tuesday as fallout from last week's attack intensified. Home Depot runs 2,266 stores across the United States and Canada. The company's shares closed down about 2 percent at $88.93 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

183,"  (Recasts, adds details about costs of breach and likelihood of costs rising, comment from computer security experts, background)By Jim Finkle and Nandita BoseBOSTON/CHICAGO, Sept 18 Home Depot Inc  Thursday said some 56 million payment cards were likely compromised in a cyberattack at its stores, suggesting the hacking attack at the home improvement chain was larger than last year's unprecedented breach at Target Corp.Home Depot, in providing the first clues to how much the breach would cost, said that so far it has estimated costs of $62 million. But it indicated that costs could reach much higher.It will take months to determine the full scope of the fraud, which affected Home Depot stores in both the United States and Canada and ran from April to September.Retailer Target incurred costs of $148 million in its second fiscal quarter related to its breach. Target hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data.Home Depot said that criminals used unique, custom-built software that had not been seen in previous attacks and was designed to evade detection in its most complete account of what had happened since it first disclosed the breach on Sept. 8.The company said that the hackers' method of entry has been closed off, the malware eliminated from its network, and that it had rolled out ""enhanced encryption of payment data"" to all U.S. stores. ""We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges,"" Chief Executive Frank Blake said in a statement.Of the estimated cost so far of $62 million, which covers such items as credit monitoring, increased call center staffing, and legal and professional services, Home Depot said it believes that $27 million of the amount will be paid for by insurers.But the company said it has not yet estimated the impact of ""probable losses"" related to the possible need to reimburse banks for fraud and card replacement, as well as covering costs of lawsuits and government investigations. ""Those costs may have a material adverse effect on The Home Depot's financial results in the fourth quarter and/or future periods,"" the company said in its statement.Wesley McGrew, an expert of retail breaches who is an assistant research professor at the department of computer science at Mississippi State University, said that Home Depot is going to be expected to bear the costs related to fraud and payment card replacement.Banks typically seek to get retailers to cover those costs if there are any indications of shortcomings in their security.Criminals have frequently used software that evades detection, but retailers are expected to closely monitor their networks using tools that are designed to uncover signs of a crime in progress, McGrew said. ""It's hard to feel sorry for them when there are things they could have done to improve the security of these transactions,"" McGrew said.Hitesh Sheth, chief executive of Vectra Networks, a cybersecurity firm in San Jose, California, said Home Depot's breach exposes a weakness, noting that the company said hackers used unique, custom-built malware.That ""essentially means the technology they are using is only designed to detect malware that has already been used in a previous attack, and that is symptomatic of the retail industry,"" Sheth said.""Retailers need to upgrade to technology that is available and detects behavior of malware that is new because these attacks are not going to stop anytime soon.""For its fiscal year ending in February, Home Depot revised its earnings estimate to $4.54 per share from $4.52.

184,"  (Adds more details on Dwyer in paragraphs 15-16, Target pulling merchandise in paragraph 21)By Eric Kelsey and Mary MillikenSept 17 Another National Football League player was arrested on domestic violence allegations hours after two teams succumbed to public pressure and suspended players enmeshed in similar cases on Wednesday.The charges against Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer of aggravated assault in connection with two alleged incidents of domestic violence in late July come amid intensifying criticism from corporate sponsors and politicians toward America's top sports league.Earlier on Wednesday, Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson and Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy were both placed by their teams on the so-called ""exempt list,"" meaning they must take a leave of absence while the cases against them are resolved.In announcing their actions, officials of both the Vikings and the Panthers talked about the need ""to get this right.""The two teams' decisions suggest a new tack by owners toward the domestic violence scandal engulfing the 32-team NFL and its commissioner, Roger Goodell.A flurry of cases, most notably those of Peterson and Ray Rice, the former Baltimore Ravens star who has also been suspended indefinitely by the NFL, has raised questions about the league's integrity and Goodell's leadership.On Wednesday the level of criticism ratcheted up with the U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, speaking up, and moves by two big corporate sponsors - TD Ameritrade and Nike.Zygi Wilf, who co-owns the Vikings with his brother, Mark, said that they had ""made a mistake and we needed to get this right,"" after they had reactivated Peterson on Monday following his indictment last week on charges of beating his four-year-old son with a branch.For the Panthers, general manager Dave Gettleman said the team was disappointed in Hardy's behavior. ""We have to get this right. He has to get this right,"" Gettleman said.Hardy, who was convicted in July of domestic violence, has appealed the verdict. He has a trial date in November.Regarding Dwyer, the Phoenix Police Department said the incidents involved a 27-year-old woman and an 18-month-old child, but gave few details. In an email, Sergeant Trent Crump said Dwyer ""admitted to the incidents, however, denied any physical assaults."" Crump said the 25-year-old player was booked into Maricopa County Jail on one count of aggravated assault causing a fracture, one count of aggravated assault involving a minor, two counts of criminal damage, one count of preventing the use of a phone in an emergency, and assault.""Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities,"" the Cardinals said in a statement.The Cardinals said they became aware of the allegations on Wednesday afternoon when they were notified by Phoenix police and they said they are cooperating fully.Crump said the two incidents were reported to police by neighbors who said they heard fights, and that soon afterward the woman fled the state with her and Dwyer's child, citing safety concerns for herself.The victim reported her injuries to police on Sept. 11 and said she also received text messages from the player in which he threatened to kill himself, Crump said.The moves came a day after the NFL was chastised by one of its top sponsors, brewer Anheuser-Busch. But no sponsor has gone so far as to cut its multimillion-dollar ties with the NFL.Brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, which began a three-year affiliation with the NFL this month, on Wednesday said ""it was very much considering its future"" as a sponsor. ""We want to see (the NFL) learn from its mistakes and work quickly to improve a culture that values inclusion, safety and respect for its employees, their families and others,"" TD Ameritrade spokeswoman Kim Hillyer said in an email.Nike, known for its steadfast support for its athletes even in troubled times, said it had suspended its contract with Peterson, one of the league's most marketable players.Target Corp on Wednesday said it was removing Peterson merchandise from its retail stores and website in light of team's most recent actions and customer feedback, spokeswoman Molly Snyder said.POLITICIANS JOIN FRAY The 29-year-old Peterson, the Vikings' best player, has been accused of reckless or negligent injury to a child stemming from a whipping incident that allegedly left bruises and wounds on his son. The NFL called his suspension ""a good decision.""Goodell has the sole authority to place a player on the exempt list under what the league policy calls ""unusual circumstances.""The Vikings will continue to pay the running back his full $11.75 million salary for this season. Team general manager Rick Spielman declined to say whether Peterson would play again this season. If Peterson's case goes to trial it would likely begin in 2015.Mark Wilf said the franchise did not suspend Peterson in a bow to pressure from team sponsors. Minnesota-based hotel chain Radisson suspended a sponsorship deal with the Vikings on Monday.The team also came under withering criticism from Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, who said on Tuesday that Peterson was a ""public embarrassment"" to the team and state and should be suspended.Goodell and the league are struggling to make amends for his initial lenient punishment of Rice, who punched his then-fiancee, now his wife, in February, knocking her unconscious.Although Goodell has announced stricter penalties for domestic violence offenders, that has done little to stem the tidal wave of public criticism following the release of surveillance video last week that showed Rice's punch, which the league said it had never seen.On Wednesday in Washington, top U.S. House Democrat Pelosi said Congress could get involved because the league, which takes in $9 billion in annual revenue, has an anti-trust exemption.""I think Congress always has a role, but again if you're talking about anti-trust privileges and the rest of that, that certainly is a big issue and it cannot be done except by the Congress,"" Pelosi said at her weekly news conference in the Capitol, after being peppered with NFL questions.Goodell has since apologized for the handling of the Rice case. The Pro Bowl running back on Tuesday appealed his indefinite suspension, which came after the video's publication.With Rice, Peterson and Hardy all suspended, one player accused of domestic violence still remains eligible, San Francisco 49ers' Ray McDonald.Pelosi, an avid 49ers fan, said McDonald should not have taken the field last week.

185,"   By Brendan O'Brien  An Ohio grand jury on Wednesday decided not to press charges against two police officers who fatally shot a man while he held a pellet gun at a Dayton-area Walmart in August, prosecutors said. A special Green County grand jury voted not to indict two Beavercreek officers who shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, on Aug. 5 as he held a BB gun inside a local Walmart store, special prosecutor Mark Piepmeier told a news conference.  ""Based on the information the responding officers had and Mr. Crawford's failure to comply with the responding officers' orders, the officers did what they were trained to do to protect the public,"" the City of Beavercreek said in a statement. Crawford's death came a few days before the Aug. 9 fatal shooting by police in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, which is being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department and has focused national attention on the use of deadly force by police. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine appointed Piepmeier as a special prosecutor in the case to look into whether the shooting was justified.The nine-member grand jury decided against indicting the Beavercreek officers on murder, reckless homicide or negligent homicide charges after hearing testimony from 18 witnesses and listening to and viewing hours of audio and video recordings of the incident, Piepmeier said.   A surveillance video released on Wednesday, aired on local television, showed Crawford picked up a BB gun off a shelf and strolled through the store with it until police shot him. Michael Wright, an attorney representing Crawford's family, was not immediately available for comment.  Officials in Beavercreek have asked the FBI to review the case to see whether Crawford's civil rights were violated. Ohio Governor John Kasich and Attorney General DeWine called on the U.S. Justice Department to review the case.""This is a tragedy for the Crawford family and I share the concern of many in the community that this matter must be handled with the utmost seriousness and respect,"" Kasich said.

187,"  SAN FRANCISCO Oct 15 EBay Inc on Wednesday joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc in cutting its outlook for the all-important holiday season, suggesting that the fourth quarter may turn out to be weaker than some analysts predicted as recently as last week.The warnings from two of the retail industry's most influential players comes as investors re-assess the state of the global economy after weak data this week from the two largest countries, the United States and China.EBay and Wal-Mart blamed divergent factors such as food stamp reductions and unfavorable search-engine optimization for the lower outlooks.Both complained about the stronger dollar putting the skids on their forecasts, lowering the value of overseas sales once converted into the U.S. currency.But analysts say stagnant incomes are also prompting U.S. consumers to curtail spending.""EBay, especially on the marketplaces side, is actually suffering from company-specific setbacks,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said. ""But overall, if e-commerce was growing faster or as fast as it was last year or a couple years ago, it would have probably helped them hide that."" DOLLARS AND CENTS EBay's fourth-quarter outlook was undercut by the strength of the dollar against the British pound, the euro and the Australian dollar, which together account for 35 percent of eBay's volume.The stronger dollar alone forced eBay to cut its fourth-quarter revenue outlook by $120 million. Coupled with slower-than-expected growth in its marketplaces division, eBay was forced to lop off $300 million from its annual revenue forecast. ""As expected, (retail) sales have accelerated in the second half of the year, though economic signals remain mixed and consumers are still facing headwinds such as weak income growth,"" Moody's analyst Michael Zuccaro wrote on Wednesday.The more measured tone may spook investors as retailers such as Amazon.com Inc and Target release results over the next month. Investors and analysts had expressed high hopes for the holiday season as recently as last week.The National Retail Federation, in a press release entitled ""optimism shines,"" predicted strengthening consumer confidence would trigger a 4.1 percent spike in November-December retail sales, outpacing the 3.1 percent seen in the same period of 2013. But the group also warned that consumers remained uneasy about economic conditions, echoing concerns from other analysts including those at Moody's.Two-thirds of Americans are limiting how much they spend each month, according to a Bankrate.com report released this week. The top reason was stagnant incomes.eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe told Reuters he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the holiday season but declined to discuss the topic further.In a sign of its cautious view on the U.S. market, Wal-Mart said it would slow store openings in the next fiscal year.Wal-Mart, which recorded $473.1 billion in sales in its last fiscal year, said it now expects sales to rise 2-3 percent in the current year to Jan. 31, 2015. It had previously estimated growth at the low end of a 3-5 percent range.Lower gasoline prices had been expected to fuel higher retail sales this winter, especially at Wal-Mart and other chains that cater to low- to middle-income shoppers, analysts said.

188,"  WASHINGTON Nov 12 A senior Democratic lawmaker on Wednesday asked the chief executives of five companies, including Home Depot Inc, Target Corp and Kmart , to share more information about recent cyber attacks on their companies.U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he was concerned about the rising number of cyber intrusions and media reports that they originate from overseas.""The increased frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on both public and private entities highlights the need for greater collaboration to improve data security,"" Cummings wrote in the letter, which was distributed to journalists. ""Your company's knowledge, information and experience with this recent data breach will be helpful as Congress examines federal cybersecurity laws and any necessary improvements to protect sensitive consumer and government financial information.""A Home Depot spokesman said the company will continue to cooperate with lawmakers and others. He declined to provide details. Cummings' letter also went to Community Health Systems  and the parent company of US Investigations Services,  USIS, a firm that performs background checks on U.S. government employees. USIS was victim of a breach that compromised data of at least 25,000 workers, including some undercover investigators. Cyber attacks on retail outlets, such as Home Depot and Target, have affected tens of millions of American customers. Other widespread breaches include Michaels Stores Inc  and Neiman Marcus.Cummings sent a similar letter to the postmaster general on Monday after the U.S. Postal Service revealed it was the victim of a cyber attack that may have compromised the personal information of more than 800,000 employees, as well as data on customers who contacted its call center this year.

202,"  Brian Gregory coached at Dayton for eight seasons before leaving for Georgia Tech in 2011, so naturally there was emotion on both sides when the Flyers came to Atlanta and defeated the Yellow Jackets 82-72 last season. Those emotions figure to tug harder at Gregory on Tuesday when Dayton hosts Georgia Tech, marking Gregory’s first game at UD Arena since his eight years leading the Flyers. Both teams are hot: the Flyers have won six of seven while the Yellow Jackets are 5-1 in their past six contests.Dayton’s run has not come without internal trouble as leading rebounder Devon Scott and Jalen Robinson were dismissed from the team Wednesday. The Flyers did not miss either player in Saturday’s 78-62 victory over Boston, getting career-high 19-point performances from Kendall Pollard and Darrell Davis.

Mitchell averages 10.5 points and 7.3 rebounds, while Cox has six double-figure scoring games and Sampson averages 6.3 boards in only 20.8 minutes per game. Marcus Georges-Hunt is 4-of-22 from 3-point range after shooting 34.1 percent from beyond the arc last season, but is leading the Yellow Jackets in scoring at 11.7 points.ABOUT DAYTON (8-2): The Flyers come in after their best shooting game of the season, setting highs for field-goal percentage (52) and made 3-pointers (11). Senior guard Jordan Sibert has scored in double figures eight games in a row, leading the team in scoring at 14.4 points and getting a much help Saturday from Pollard (7-of-13 from the field) and Davis (5-of-5 from 3-point range). Dayton ranks third in the Atlantic 10 defensively, allowing 58.3 points per contest. TIP-INS 1. Georgia Tech has never beaten Dayton in three tries, losing in the 2009 Puerto Rico Tip-Off (coached by Gregory) and in 1977. 2.

According to a small study to be released on Tuesday by retail-intelligence firm StellaService, in-store pickup saved shoppers just 96 seconds on average compared with searching for items on their own. In a few cases, in-store pickup took longer.In-store pickup is one of many services being tested as retailers try to use their stores as mini-shipping hubs to get items to shoppers more quickly. It comes in response to competition from the No. 1 U.S. online retailer, Amazon.com Inc, which has streamlined its delivery service.The StellaService study, based on 44 visits to stores in the South run by 11 retailers, is one of the most comprehensive studies so far of the in-store pickup service. The results show that retailers have no uniform approach to the issue.  ""It's amazing just how much simpler the process would have been if someone had just put up a sign,"" said Ty McMahan, senior director of content for StellaService, adding that retailers are spending ""tens of millions of dollars"" on these initiatives.Shoppers spent an average of 5 minutes and 24 seconds in a store when trying to pick up their online orders.

209,"  (Recasts with announcement, reactions, Treasury comment on North Korea sanctions)By Roberta Rampton and Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Jan 13 President Barack Obama on Tuesday renewed a push to beef up U.S. cybersecurity laws after recent headline-grabbing hacking attacks against companies like Sony Pictures, Home Depot and Target.During a tour of a ""war room"" at the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity nerve center, Obama said the recent attacks have highlighted the threat faced by financial systems, power grids and healthcare systems that run on networks connected to the Internet.""We've got to stay ahead of those who would do us harm. The problem is that government and the private sector are still not always working as closely together as we should,"" Obama said.Congress has tried and failed for years to pass legislation to encourage companies to share data from attacks with the government, and each other, but grappled with liability issues raised by companies and privacy concerns from civil liberties groups.But Obama proposed legislation, due to be sent to Congress on Tuesday, that seeks a balance. It would offer liability protection to companies that provide information in near-real-time to the government, but require them to strip it of any personal data.Obama has elevated cybersecurity to the top of his 2015 agenda, seeing it as an area where cooperation is possible with the Republican-led Congress.He discussed the legislation on Tuesday with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and said they agreed cybersecurity needs to be addressed. The White House will also build momentum for the legislative move at a cybersecurity summit slated for Feb. 13 in Silicon Valley, at Stanford University.""Foreign governments, criminals and hackers probe America's computer networks every single day. We saw that again in the attack on Sony,"" Obama said.Obama has blamed the Sony hack on North Korea. A top Treasury Department sanctions official told lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday the agency was looking at more ways to cut the country off from international financial systems.On Monday, people claiming to be allied with Islamic State militants hacked social media accounts for the U.S. military command that oversees operations in the Middle East. The attack is still under investigation but did not seem to have affected classified information, Obama said.'THOUGHTFUL PROPOSAL' U.S. cyber officials and companies have for years urged Congress to codify how they can best exchange information to respond to hacking attacks. Obama proposed legislation in 2011 that fizzled in Congress. His revised plan seeks to address corporate concerns that companies get immunity against government and private lawsuits based on cyber threat-related data shared with federal authorities.Privacy advocates applauded the proposal to require companies to strip private information from the data they share, and cautiously welcomed a call for new privacy rules that will determine how federal agencies are allowed to use and store the data.""It is a thoughtful proposal but ... there are still many gaps that need to be filled,"" said Harley Geiger, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology.Privacy advocates remain concerned about the access that intelligence agencies may have to the information companies share with the Department of Homeland Security, following last year's disclosures about the scope of U.S. surveillance programs by former contractor Edward Snowden.Obama also proposed to give law enforcement agencies broader power to investigate and prosecute cybercrime, hoping to deter the sale of spyware and theft of personal data.His proposal would make selling stolen credit card information overseas a crime and would allow authorities to prosecute the sale of botnets, computer networks linked to cybercrime.He also wants to require companies to tell consumers within 30 days from the discovery of a data breach that their personal information has been compromised.

211,"   By Solarina Ho | TORONTO  TORONTO Target Corp (TGT.N) will exit the Canadian market after less than two years in a surprise retreat that will throw more than 17,000 employees out of work and trigger a $5.4 billion quarterly loss. Shares of the U.S. discount retailer, which was granted creditor protection for its money-losing Canadian subsidiary, at one point rose more than 4 percent on the move. The stock was up 2.2 percent at $75.94 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.The company announced on Thursday it is shutting all of its 133 Canadian stores and said it expects to report about $5.4 billion in pretax losses for its fourth quarter, which finishes at the end of January. Losses are mostly due to the writedown of the Canadian investment, along with exit costs and operating losses.Minneapolis-based Target, the No. 2 discount chain in the United States, has struggled in Canada since its March 2013 launch. It faced huge supply chain problems due to a myriad of problems at its warehouses, poor communication with headquarters and the use of inexperienced staff. That left stores poorly stocked and selection limited, disappointing shoppers who had eagerly anticipated its arrival in a market where the discount space was long dominated by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).Target had said in November it would review the future of the Canadian business after the holiday season. Stores checked by Reuters in Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa around Christmas showed only moderate traffic and Chief Executive Brian Cornell said he didn't see the ""step-change"" in performance required to justify staying the course.No matter how Target crunched the numbers it could not envision making profits until 2021, Cornell said. He told a conference call the company was ""facing a decision to devote billions of dollars of additional resources for the Canadian segment without the realistic prospect of an appropriate return.""The move surprised some analysts who had expected Target to close its weakest stores and try to fix the rest. Before Thursday's decision Target had sunk roughly $6 billion into the market, including around $2.5 billion in capital expenditure and $1.7 billion of losses to-date, Fitch Ratings said.  ""Anything you could have gotten wrong in the playbook, they got wrong,"" said Antony Karabus, CEO of retail consultant firm HRC Advisory.Target said exiting Canada would allow it to focus resources on the U.S. market, where it is recovering from a massive data breach during the holiday quarter of 2013. Target said comparable U.S. sales during the fourth quarter would likely rise 3 percent, up from its 2 percent forecast. It also raised its estimate for adjusted earnings per share in the quarter to $1.43 to $1.47, an upward revision of 6 cents.Expectations Canadian retailers would benefit from the pullout helped lift their shares, with Canadian Tire (CTCa.TO) up more than 5 percent at one point, and grocers Loblaw (L.TO) and Empire Co (EMPa.TO) both up about 2 percent. Wal-Mart is also seen as a beneficiary and could look to pick up some of the abandoned locations, analysts said. Target said it would look to grow in the United States by expanding its smaller format stores, including those in big cities.But the failure in Canada raises serious doubts about the retailer's long-term growth prospects, said Jim Danahy, director of the Centre for Retail Leadership at York University's Schulich School of Business in Toronto.""There isn't a bigger implosion and it needs to be really understood this is entirely their fault,"" Danahy said.Target had hired Eleven Points Logistics, a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based Genco, to run its Canadian warehouses. The company had also reached a long-term wholesale agreement with Empire Co's Sobeys to supply it with groceries in Canada. A spokesman for Sobeys said the loss of the account would not have a material impact on its results. Genco could not immediately be reached for comment.Former Target and Eleven Points employees had told Reuters about a laundry list of problems at the warehouses, stores, and headquarters, especially in the first year. They said a combination of new technology and systems, inexperienced hires and poor training all contributed to supply chain woes.Barcodes on many items did not match what was in the computer system, they said, causing massive warehouse logjams, while store backrooms were stacked from ""floor to rafters"", making it difficult to locate products to put on shelves.Target said stores would remain open during liquidation, and that with court approval it would pay all of its Canadian employees a minimum of 16 weeks of compensation.

212,"  Target Corp's exit from Canada means Chief Executive Brian Cornell will have to rely solely on the saturated U.S. market for growth, the success of which could hinge on a shift toward smaller and urban-based stores.Target announced plans on Thursday to close all of its 133 stores in Canada and put the local business in bankruptcy. With no other market outside the United States seen as a good fit for Target, the move effectively puts an end to its international ambitions, analysts said. The Minneapolis-based retailer said the move would free up funds to put toward bolstering its U.S. operations. Target operates 1,801 stores in the U.S., the bulk of which are large-format locations averaging 135,000 square feet. Cornell also told a conference call he planned to accelerate the expansion of its CityTarget locations, which are based in big cities and range from 80,000 to 160,000 square feet, and a convenience store-like format called Express.While Cornell did not disclose a numerical target for that expansion, some analysts said these smaller formats offered Target the largest potential growth, partly because they are targeting urban areas not yet exposed to Target stores. ""They could easily open in the range of 500 to 600 smaller format stores across the country,"" said Craig Johnson, head of retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. He said, however, that it could take a few years before Target ""got the formula right.""In focusing on smaller and urban-based stores, Target is taking a page out of the playbook of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The largest U.S. retailer is planning to open 180 to 200 Neighborhood Market stores this year, making the more compact format a key pillar of its growth plans. Target launched the first CityTarget in 2012 and currently has eight of the stores with plans to open one in Boston this year, its first on the East Coast. It has only one Express, a 20,000-square-foot store opened in Minneapolis last year.Given the focus on smaller stores, Fitch Ratings analyst Phil Zahn said he was expecting Target's square footage to grow by only about 1 percent annually for the foreseeable future.  ""You have to build a lot of the small stores to move the needle,"" Zahn said, adding that he was skeptical of the prospects for expansion outside the United States.""If they are trying to carve out a discounter niche it may not fit in Mexico or other emerging markets. So I have a feeling that is a ways down the road.""

Primark is controlled by Canada's Weston family, who also control grocer Loblaw Companies Ltd (L.TO).

216,"  (Adds details from conference call and link to graphic)By Solarina HoTORONTO Jan 15 Target Corp will exit the Canadian market after less than two years in a surprise retreat that will throw more than 17,000 employees out of work and trigger a $5.4 billion quarterly loss.Shares of the U.S. discount retailer, which was granted creditor protection for its money-losing Canadian subsidiary, at one point rose more than 4 percent on the move. The stock was up 2.2 percent at $75.94 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.The company announced on Thursday it is shutting all of its 133 Canadian stores and said it expects to report about $5.4 billion in pretax losses for its fourth quarter, which finishes at the end of January. Losses are mostly due to the writedown of the Canadian investment, along with exit costs and operating losses.Minneapolis-based Target, the No. 2 discount chain in the United States, has struggled in Canada since its March 2013 launch. It faced huge supply chain problems due to a myriad of problems at its warehouses, poor communication with headquarters and the use of inexperienced staff. That left stores poorly stocked and selection limited, disappointing shoppers who had eagerly anticipated its arrival in a market where the discount space was long dominated by Wal-Mart Stores Inc.Target had said in November it would review the future of the Canadian business after the holiday season. Stores checked by Reuters in Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa around Christmas showed only moderate traffic and Chief Executive Brian Cornell said he didn't see the ""step-change"" in performance required to justify staying the course.No matter how Target crunched the numbers it could not envision making profits until 2021, Cornell said. He told a conference call the company was ""facing a decision to devote billions of dollars of additional resources for the Canadian segment without the realistic prospect of an appropriate return."" The move surprised some analysts who had expected Target to close its weakest stores and try to fix the rest. Before Thursday's decision Target had sunk roughly $6 billion into the market, including around $2.5 billion in capital expenditure and $1.7 billion of losses to-date, Fitch Ratings said.""Anything you could have gotten wrong in the playbook, they got wrong,"" said Antony Karabus, CEO of retail consultant firm HRC Advisory.Target said exiting Canada would allow it to focus resources on the U.S. market, where it is recovering from a massive data breach during the holiday quarter of 2013. Target said comparable U.S. sales during the fourth quarter would likely rise 3 percent, up from its 2 percent forecast. It also raised its estimate for adjusted earnings per share in the quarter to $1.43 to $1.47, an upward revision of 6 cents. Expectations Canadian retailers would benefit from the pullout helped lift their shares, with Canadian Tire  up more than 5 percent at one point, and grocers Loblaw  and Empire Co both up about 2 percent. Wal-Mart is also seen as a beneficiary and could look to pick up some of the abandoned locations, analysts said.Target said it would look to grow in the United States by expanding its smaller format stores, including those in big cities.But the failure in Canada raises serious doubts about the retailer's long-term growth prospects, said Jim Danahy, director of the Centre for Retail Leadership at York University's Schulich School of Business in Toronto. ""There isn't a bigger implosion and it needs to be really understood this is entirely their fault,"" Danahy said.Target had hired Eleven Points Logistics, a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based Genco, to run its Canadian warehouses.The company had also reached a long-term wholesale agreement with Empire Co's Sobeys to supply it with groceries in Canada. A spokesman for Sobeys said the loss of the account would not have a material impact on its results. Genco could not immediately be reached for comment.Former Target and Eleven Points employees had told Reuters about a laundry list of problems at the warehouses, stores, and headquarters, especially in the first year. They said a combination of new technology and systems, inexperienced hires and poor training all contributed to supply chain woes.Barcodes on many items did not match what was in the computer system, they said, causing massive warehouse logjams, while store backrooms were stacked from ""floor to rafters"", making it difficult to locate products to put on shelves.Target said stores would remain open during liquidation, and that with court approval it would pay all of its Canadian employees a minimum of 16 weeks of compensation.

219,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) on Target Corporation (Target) at 'A-' and the Short-term IDR at 'F2'. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS As anticipated, Target announced today that it will be discontinuing its  Canadian operations. Cash costs associated with exiting the business are  expected to total $500-$600 million.  Target will also be taking a $5.4 billion charge during the fourth quarter. The  company's investment in the Canadian business included C$1.825 billion to  acquire the store leases, around $2.5 billion of capex and $1.7 billion of  EBITDA losses to-date, for a total investment of around $6 billion.  The disposition of this business is a credit positive as it will result in the  elimination of significant operating losses and lease obligations in Canada.  Carving out negative EBITDA of $635 million in the LTM period and capital leases  of more than $1 billion results in pro forma adjusted debt/EBITDAR of 2.2x  compared with reported leverage of 2.7x as of Nov. 1, 2014. Putting Canada behind them, management will be able to focus on the domestic  business where the challenge will be to return comparable store sales growth to  a sustainable 2%-3% and EBITDA margins to their historical level of 10%. Fitch  expects Target's near-term results will benefit from cycling against the data  breach that was announced one week before Christmas 2013 and from the impact of  lower gasoline prices. Fitch believes that under the direction of a new CEO Target will focus on  improving its merchandise offerings and cost structure, among other things.  Fitch will consider the sustainability of any operating improvements before  becoming more constructive on the rating. Target's U.S. segment has produced soft results over the past two years. U.S.  comp store sales were down 0.4% in 2013 and up 0.3% in the first nine months of  2014, reflecting the challenging environment facing low- and middle-income  consumers, exacerbated by the data breach. Comp sales trends have improved over  the course of 2014, with fourth quarter 2014 comps expected to be around 3% and  2015 comps expected to track in the low single digits. EBITDA from the U.S. segment declined to $6.8 billion, or 9.4% of sales in the  LTM period from $7 billion, or 9.8% of sales in 2013 due to an increase in  promotional activity. Fitch expects U.S. EBITDA will begin to recover in the  fourth quarter of 2014 as the company cycles the data breach and improve to $7.0  - $7.2 billion in 2015. Free cash flow (FCF) after dividends from the U.S. segment is projected to  approach $1.5 billion going forward, excluding Canada wind-down costs of  $500-$600 million. While management has refrained from repurchasing shares  during 2014, it is likely that the company will resume repurchasing shares over  the near term. Fitch expects the company will direct its free cash flow and some incremental  borrowings toward share repurchases as it manages adjusted leverage at current  levels. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors, individually or collectively, could lead to a positive  rating action: improved operating momentum in the domestic business, including  consistent comp sales growth of 2-3%, an improvement in EBITDA margin towards  its historical level of 10%, a FCF margin excluding Canada wind-down costs of 2%  (which would amount to $1.5 billion in FCF), and adjusted financial leverage of  2.0x - 2.25x. The following factors, individually or collectively, could lead to a negative  rating action: operating shortfalls and more aggressive share repurchase  activity that drove adjusted leverage above the mid-2x range for an extended  period. Fitch affirms Target's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Bank credit facility at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.

221,"   By Nathan Layne and Solarina Ho | NEW YORK/TORONTO  NEW YORK/TORONTO Target Corp (TGT.N) was scrambling for ways to fix its failing Canadian expansion and considering closing just the weakest locations, but a pre-holiday visit to several stores by CEO Brian Cornell helped seal the decision for a full retreat.Cornell spent the weekend before Christmas making solo visits to stores in Ontario and Quebec, Canada's most populous provinces, according to a Target source familiar with the U.S. discount retailer's decision to pull out of Canada.Though the recently appointed chief executive could see signs of operational improvements - notably, better stocked shelves - a key ingredient was missing.""There just weren't enough people in the stores,"" the source said. ""The weekend before Christmas our stores are usually packed. He wasn't seeing enough people. The stores he visited had never looked better, they were in stock, but there weren't enough people there.""Target said on Thursday it will exit the Canadian market after less than two years, closing 133 stores, throwing more than 17,000 employees out of work, and leaving billions in losses.A former Target employee in touch with vendors and existing staff at the Canadian headquarters said everyone was blind-sided by the decision, especially by the timing.   Target, which entered Canada hoping it would be profitable after the first year, had invested more than C$7 billion ($5.84 billion) in its Canadian expansion since the start of 2011, according to its Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) filing.  But it wildly overestimated how readily Canadians would embrace its arrival. A laundry list of missteps at all levels of the operation left shoppers disenchanted. The filing showed the company's struggle to lure shoppers resulted in losses of between $169 million and $329 million every quarter since it opened. Target is projecting a cumulative operating loss of more than C$2.5 billion pretax, more than triple what they originally expected.Target blamed its colossal failure on four key factors: its large-scale opening, supply chain problems, pricing and product assortment issues, and a lack of online presence. In the filing, Target said pace and large size of the expansion severely hampered its ability to respond quickly and effectively to problems.  The company had invested heavily in its supply chain operations, but a combination of data-entry and ordering errors, poor training, and confusion over differences between U.S. and Canadian systems resulted in empty shelves for key merchandise and over-stocking of other products. The Minneapolis-based retailer considered all options as it struggled to right the floundering Canadian rollout, adding resources and consulting extensively since last spring. It considered selling assets and consolidating distribution operations, but ""even under the most optimistic scenarios,"" Target said in the filing that it could not see a way to break-even in the next five years.On Wednesday, the Target board gathered for a regularly scheduled meeting, according the unnamed source. Members knew that they would be evaluating Canada's holiday performance, and that modeling was under way to determine what it would take to make the operation profitable. The source said executives had weighed several scenarios, including shutting dozens of poorly performing stores and trying to save the profitable ones.Instead, a full pullout was announced, and Target Canada filed for bankruptcy protection.On Friday, as retail analysts and the Canadian media tore into Target for mishandling the expansion, Cornell called an all-staff meeting at Target's Minneapolis headquarters to explain what had gone wrong.Taking to the podium in a massive meeting room emptied of furniture to accommodate hundreds of staffers, Cornell spoke for 15 minutes.Exiting Canada ""was the hardest business decision I've ever made,"" Cornell told the team, according to the source.

223,"  (Recasts first paragraph, adds spokeswoman comment on DeRodes departure)Feb 3 Target Corp on Tuesday named former Tesco PLC executive Mike McNamara as chief information officer to replace Bob DeRodes, who was hired in May to bolster the retailer's cybersecurity following a massive data breach in late 2013.When Target named DeRodes as CIO in April it had been looking for someone to fill that role on an interim basis, Target spokeswoman Katie Boylan said, noting he will stay on as an advisor for a short time before retiring. DeRodes declined to be interviewed, Boylan said.Former Tesco CIO McNamara, who had been with the company for 15 years, played a key role in modernizing the British supply chain and establishing it as one of the world's largest online grocers, Target said in a statement.

239,"  (Recasts lead, adds CEO comment, details, share price)March 3 U.S. retailer Target Corp, which has been battling back after a massive data breach and sluggish performance, on Tuesday said it will eliminate several thousand jobs, mainly from headquarters locations in the United States and India, as it aims to cut $2 billion in costs over two years.The cost-cutting forms a key plank of a revival plan outlined by Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell, who has sought to narrow the retailer's focus to a handful of product lines where Target believes it has an edge on quality and price while also investing to catch up with rivals online.Cornell said Target's management needs streamlining and he wants to change the corporate culture from one focused on process to one that meets the demand of customers. Target said it was revamping its merchandise, in part to attract both millenials and Hispanics, seen as important to driving future sales growth.""We know that to compete today speed and simplicity are critically important,"" Cornell told a meeting of analysts in New York. ""Executing on this plan will translate to growth.""Target said the job cuts would primarily come from corporate locations in the Minneapolis area and in India that collectively employ about 26,000 people, and not from its roughly 1,800 stores across the United States. Target also said it would invest $1 billion in technology and to upgrade its supply chain. It expects profit margin, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, to hold steady at between 9.5 percent to 10 percent over the next five years, from 9.5 percent last year.Target's shares closed up 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $78.00, after initially falling 2.2 percent after the company gave its outlook on Tuesday. Cornell, a former Wal-Mart Stores Inc and PepsiCo executive, has moved quickly since taking the helm in August in the wake of a massive breach of customer data in late 2013 that cost former CEO Gregg Steinhafel his job.His biggest decision to date, announced in January, was to pull out of the Canadian market, swallowing a $5.4 million loss.Cornel also halved the threshold on free shipping, undercutting Wal-Mart and others in the war for online customers, and is focusing investment on a handful of ""signature"" categories, including apparel, home goods and beauty products. On Tuesday Cornell outlined plans to improving Target's offering of organic and other food offerings to boost its grocery business, which accounts for one-fifth of overall sales. For the current fiscal year ending January 2016, the company said it expected adjusted earnings per share, which excludes data breach costs and other expenses, of between $4.45 and $4.65, compared with the $4.27 per share it earned last year and the market consensus for $4.51, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.It projected comparable sales growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this fiscal year and total sales growth of 2 to 3 percent.Some of the growth will come from smaller-sized stores. Of the 15 new stores Target plans to open this year, eight will be a convenience store format called Target Express, highlighting its push to capture demand in urban centers.The company also said it had the capacity to buy back up to $2 billion worth of its own shares this fiscal year, and looks to repurchase $3 billion annually from the following year and beyond.

On Tuesday Cornell outlined plans to improving Target's offering of organic and other food offerings to boost its grocery business, which accounts for one-fifth of overall sales. For the current fiscal year ending January 2016, the company said it expected adjusted earnings per share, which excludes data breach costs and other expenses, of between $4.45 and $4.65, compared with the $4.27 per share it earned last year and the market consensus for $4.51, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.It projected comparable sales growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this fiscal year and total sales growth of 2 to 3 percent.Some of the growth will come from smaller-sized stores. Of the 15 new stores Target plans to open this year, eight will be a convenience store format called Target Express, highlighting its push to capture demand in urban centers.The company also said it had the capacity to buy back up to $2 billion worth of its own shares this fiscal year, and looks to repurchase $3 billion annually from the following year and beyond.

246,"  DuPont (DD.N) on Tuesday rejected a push to let shareholders split their votes between company-backed directors and those nominated by activist investors in an escalating proxy battle with Nelson Peltz. Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP has been publicly critical of the company's performance and requested DuPont use a tool called a universal proxy, which has played a key role in company shake-ups. A traditional proxy uses white cards that contain the company-backed nominees or gold cards that list the shareholder nominees. The universal proxy allows shareholders to split their vote if they are not fully convinced of either party during a proxy battle.DuPont said a universal proxy could compromise access and accuracy and issuing the card to all 600,000 individual shareholders could be cumbersome. A date for the shareholder meeting has not been set. Last year it was April 23.        The universal card played a key role in billionaire activist investor William Ackman's loss to Target Corp (TGT.N) in 2009 and his successful shakeup of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd's (CP.TO) board a few years later.    Peltz's Trian said it was disappointed that DuPont chose to limit shareholder choice.DuPont said on Tuesday it had consulted with experts and believes the use of a traditional proxy card remains the most reliable and accurate process for electing directors. The industrial conglomerate said the use of a universal proxy card would also not allow holders to sign and return voting forms without marking a preference. Trian, which owns a 2.68 percent stake in DuPont, has urged shareholders to vote for Peltz and three other nominees to the company's board.DuPont has repeatedly snubbed Trian's demand and instead named two of its own nominees as directors in February. Trian, which had previously called for a break-up of DuPont, said in February it was ""open-minded"" about keeping the company together, but criticized it for failing to meet earnings and revenue targets.DuPont shares closed down marginally at $78.07 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

248,"  (Corrects job cuts at corporate locations to 16,000 from 26,000, in paragraph 5)March 3 U.S. retailer Target Corp, which has been battling back after a massive data breach and sluggish performance, on Tuesday said it will eliminate several thousand jobs, mainly from headquarters locations in the United States and India, as it aims to cut $2 billion in costs over two years.The cost-cutting forms a key plank of a revival plan outlined by Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell, who has sought to narrow the retailer's focus to a handful of product lines where Target believes it has an edge on quality and price while also investing to catch up with rivals online.Cornell said Target's management needs streamlining and he wants to change the corporate culture from one focused on process to one that meets the demand of customers. Target said it was revamping its merchandise, in part to attract both millenials and Hispanics, seen as important to driving future sales growth.""We know that to compete today speed and simplicity are critically important,"" Cornell told a meeting of analysts in New York. ""Executing on this plan will translate to growth.""Target said the job cuts would primarily come from corporate locations in the Minneapolis area and in India that collectively employ about 16,000 people, and not from its roughly 1,800 stores across the United States. Target also said it would invest $1 billion in technology and to upgrade its supply chain. It expects profit margin, as measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, to hold steady at between 9.5 percent to 10 percent over the next five years, from 9.5 percent last year.Target's shares closed up 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $78.00, after initially falling 2.2 percent after the company gave its outlook on Tuesday.

258,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Some labor groups looking to broaden their push for minimum wage hikes after success at big U.S. retailers including Target Corp, are preparing to take on drugstore chains.A source this week said Target will raise its minimum wage to $9 per hour in April, matching moves by rivals  Wal-Mart Stores Inc and TJX Cos.The retailers, which were targeted by labor advocates and their allies, are also facing tougher competition for employees as unemployment drops to its lowest level in more than six years.Labor activists said the wage hikes by big retailers will give them greater leverage with drugstore operators, who make up one of the fastest-growing and most profitable areas in retail.The United Food and Commercial Workers International (UFCW), a union which played a key role in pressuring Wal-Mart, said it will accelerate its efforts to organize Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc workers to demand better pay.Walgreens is the top U.S. drug retailer, followed by CVS Health Corp and Rite Aid Corp.""Given the current momentum, we expect a faster chance of success in hiking minimum wage within the retail space which includes drug chains, than say the fast food sector,"" said Marc Goumbri, a spokesman for the UFCW. Another labor group, The New York-New Jersey Joint Board of Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), is planning to start wage negotiations this summer with the management of Duane Reade, a local subsidiary of Walgreens.""What jumps out at me is that drugstores are not only  reporting strong profits but expanding at a rapid pace and making multi-billion dollar acquisitions,"" said the group's President Julie Kelly.""That puts them in a position to lead here and raise the wages they pay,"" said Kelly. The recent moves by large retailers raises the chances of success, she added.Kelly said her union has not decided on wage demands, although it broadly supports the $15 an hour ""living wage"" backed by labor groups nationwide. Twelve percent of Walgreens employees earn less than $9 an hour, with a typical cashier earning about $8.60 per hour, compared to $8.70 per hour at CVS Health Corp, according to compensation analytics firm Payscale.com, which usually collects pay data from a sample of a company's employees.Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin said the company meets or exceeds all wage ordinances and its pay scale varies as it seeks to remain competitive in local markets. He declined to comment on the prospect of wage hikes or the number of employees who earn less than $9.Payscale data showed 10 percent of CVS employees' hourly earnings and 16 percent of Rite Aid Corp workers' are below $9.CVS declined comment while Rite Aid did not respond to requests seeking comment. A BETTER SHOT AT SUCCESS Drugstores are a good target in part because of relatively high employee retention rates, which make organizing easier than in other sectors, including fast food, analysts say. Annual worker turnover at fast food chains is as high as 50-100 percent in some areas, they said.

259,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO, March 20  CHICAGO, March 20 Some labor groups looking to broaden their push for minimum wage hikes after success at big U.S. retailers including Target Corp, are preparing to take on drugstore chains.A source this week said Target will raise its minimum wage to $9 per hour in April, matching moves by rivals  Wal-Mart Stores Inc and TJX Cos.The retailers, which were targeted by labor advocates and their allies, are also facing tougher competition for employees as unemployment drops to its lowest level in more than six years.Labor activists said the wage hikes by big retailers will give them greater leverage with drugstore operators, who make up one of the fastest-growing and most profitable areas in retail.The United Food and Commercial Workers International (UFCW), a union which played a key role in pressuring Wal-Mart, said it will accelerate its efforts to organize Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc workers to demand better pay.Walgreens is the top U.S. drug retailer, followed by CVS Health Corp and Rite Aid Corp.""Given the current momentum, we expect a faster chance of success in hiking minimum wage within the retail space which includes drug chains, than say the fast food sector,"" said Marc Goumbri, a spokesman for the UFCW. Another labor group, The New York-New Jersey Joint Board of Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), is planning to start wage negotiations this summer with the management of Duane Reade, a local subsidiary of Walgreens.""What jumps out at me is that drugstores are not only  reporting strong profits but expanding at a rapid pace and making multi-billion dollar acquisitions,"" said the group's President Julie Kelly.""That puts them in a position to lead here and raise the wages they pay,"" said Kelly. The recent moves by large retailers raises the chances of success, she added.Kelly said her union has not decided on wage demands, although it broadly supports the $15 an hour ""living wage"" backed by labor groups nationwide. Twelve percent of Walgreens employees earn less than $9 an hour, with a typical cashier earning about $8.60 per hour, compared to $8.70 per hour at CVS Health Corp, according to compensation analytics firm Payscale.com, which usually collects pay data from a sample of a company's employees.Walgreens spokesman Michael Polzin said the company meets or exceeds all wage ordinances and its pay scale varies as it seeks to remain competitive in local markets. He declined to comment on the prospect of wage hikes or the number of employees who earn less than $9.Payscale data showed 10 percent of CVS employees' hourly earnings and 16 percent of Rite Aid Corp workers' are below $9.CVS declined comment while Rite Aid did not respond to requests seeking comment. A BETTER SHOT AT SUCCESS Drugstores are a good target in part because of relatively high employee retention rates, which make organizing easier than in other sectors, including fast food, analysts say. Annual worker turnover at fast food chains is as high as 50-100 percent in some areas, they said. Some analysts last year put the turnover at drugstore chains as low as 11 percent.With drugstores moving into 24 hour operations and employees demanding better benefits, the opportunity to organize the workforce has improved, said Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group and a lecturer at Cornell University.Flickinger said even regional drugstore operators like Fred's Pharmacy, part of discount retailer Fred's Inc, New York- and Vermont-based chain Kinney Drugs could see their workers organize and press for higher wages.

""I've learned never to say never, but the great thing is we don't need to do a big deal,"" he said. ""If something compelling comes up, we will certainly look at it, but we are not compelled to do it because there is a strategic gap in our franchise."" Masrani, who headed TD's U.S. banking operations before taking over as CEO in November, said that TD remains an ""organic growth type of institution,"" but would look for other opportunities in the U.S. market too.""Given the type of balance sheet we have in the U.S., we are also highly liquid and are always looking at opportunities that would fill out our balance sheet because we are rich in deposits but not as rich in loans,"" he said. As of Jan. 31, TD had $250 billion in assets in the U.S. and $204 billion in deposits, with a loan book of some $117 billion.Last month, TD extended its contract with discount retailer Target Corp, making it the exclusive issuer of Target co-branded and private label consumer credit cards to Target's U.S. customers until March 2025.

The end of a dispute that started on Feb. 2 sent the company's shares up as much as 8 percent to a 52-week high of $49.65 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.The company did not have to pay any monetary damages, just implement reforms, Elizabeth DeBold, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's office said.GNC was one of four retailers that halted sales of certain supplements after being subpoenaed by Schneiderman as DNA tests failed to detect plant materials that the companies claimed were a part of their supplements. Both internal and independent third-party tests had proved that GNC's ""products are safe, pure, properly labeled and in full compliance with all regulatory requirements"", the company said in a statement on Monday.GNC had said earlier that tests showed its products contained all herbal extracts listed on labels, and on Monday the company said it had restarted selling its Herbal Plus products.A study commissioned by the Attorney General to determine the presence or absence of the DNA of certain plants in some herbal supplements also found GNC's products were within prescribed FDA guidelines, Schneiderman's statement said. GNC will start DNA barcoding within 18 months to confirm the authenticity of all plants used as sources for its herbal supplements prior to processing, Schneiderman said.The company would test for allergen contamination pre and post production and had also agreed to prominently disclose in its stores and on its website if a supplement product was derived from whole herbs or extracts, Schneiderman said.Herbal Plus is part of GNC's vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements business, which accounts for almost 40 percent of its U.S. retail revenue.The investigation into the supplements sold by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp was ongoing, DeBold said.Walgreens was reviewing the matter and intends to continue cooperating with the Attorney General's office, spokesperson James Graham said.Wal-Mart and Target were not available for comment.

285,"   By Sinead Carew  Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers' earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers' wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage.Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors.""The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,"" said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska.So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years. Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations.The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent. RESULTS  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N). The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc (SPLS.O), Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27.Macys, Kohl's and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl's said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.  Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,"" Sue Lattmann, the company's chief financial officer told investors.HIGHER WAGES, HIGHER COSTS  Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker's Sudyka.During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.  Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that ""if labor has to be a little higher, but it's driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.""Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend.""Even if companies can't pass on the costs, it's a one-time hit and we can grow from there,"" Sudyka said.

If they accept the deal, they must drop further claims against Target as part of the settlement.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs had argued that the settlement with MasterCard, which is not a party to the lawsuit, was a ""sweetheart deal"" aimed at undercutting their claims for losses.Under the proposed agreement, announced in March, MasterCard-issuing banks have until May 20 to accept a percentage of the money from MasterCard. If they accept the deal, they must drop further claims against Target as part of the settlement. Banks that reject the deal would continue to pursue their own allegations against Target.Lawyers for the banks have estimated the total losses at more than $160 million, with approximately half for fraud and half for the cost of reissuing nearly nine million credit cards. In a statement, the lead plaintiffs' lawyers highlighted the judge's concerns and said they would urge banks to reject the deal.A Target spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said, ""We are pleased with the court's decision which we believe will allow us to resolve claims with participating MasterCard issuers and avoid protracted litigation with those issuers.""The judge's ruling said that MasterCard initially demanded $26 million before the two sides settled on $19 million.In 2013, Target said the breach during the holiday shopping season compromised at least 40 million credit cards and may have resulted in the theft of personal information from as many as 110 million people. Target is still negotiating with Visa Inc over losses from the breach.

289,"  (Adds Wal-Mart comment, background)May 8 Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Canadian unit said it would buy some store leases and other assets formerly held by the Canadian arm of Target Corp and renovate them for about C$350 million ($289 million).Wal-Mart said in February it planned to invest about C$340 million this year to boost its presence in Canada.The company said on Friday it would acquire a Target Canada distribution center, 12 store leases and an owned property for C$165 million. It expects to invest about C$185 million on their renovation.Organizations owed money by Target Canada controlled the sale, Alex Roberton, Wal-Mart Canada's director of corporate affairs, told Reuters. Target was not immediately available for comment.Wal-Mart, which plans to hire about 3,400 associates in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, said it expects to generate about 1,500 trade and construction jobs in Canada. Target, The No. 2 U.S. discount chain, exited Canada last month after struggling since its March 2013 launch there, resulting in 17,000 employees losing their jobs and triggering a $5.1 billion quarterly charge.Target Canada, which said it would close the last of its 133 retail stores on April 12, had said the real estate sales process was expected to be completed by June. The company had been winding down operations since Jan. 15 when it was granted creditor protection.Earlier this week, Retailer Canadian Tire Corp Ltd  said it would buy leases for 12 properties previously held by Target Canada for $17.7 million.Canadian retailers Metro Inc and Hudson's Bay Co  have also shown interest in leasing Target's properties.($1 = C$1.2095)   (Reporting By Manya Venkatesh and Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Joyjeet Das)",2015-05-08,TGT,"Fri May 8, 2015 | 7:53am EDT",UPDATE 2-Wal-Mart buys some former Target Canada stores,http://www.reuters.com//article/wal-mart-stores-canada-idUSL4N0XZ64020150508?type=companyNews

291,"   By Sinead Carew  Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers' earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers' wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage.Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors.""The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,"" said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska.So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc (BWLD.O) have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years. Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations.The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent. RESULTS  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N). The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc (SPLS.O), Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27.Macys, Kohl's and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl's said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.  Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,"" Sue Lattmann, the company's chief financial officer told investors.HIGHER WAGES, HIGHER COSTS  Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker's Sudyka.During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.  Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that ""if labor has to be a little higher, but it's driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.""Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend.""Even if companies can't pass on the costs, it's a one-time hit and we can grow from there,"" Sudyka said.

292,"  Retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) has informed top suppliers of packaged foods, such at Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, that it plans to put less money into promoting their products in favor of fresher, healthier foods, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said the Minneapolis-based department store chain informed several suppliers, including Kraft, General Mills Inc (GIS.N), Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N), Kellogg Co (K.N) and others of the plan earlier this year.That means canned soup, cornflakes, boxed macaroni and cheese and other packaged, processed foods will get less optimal shelf space and promotional signage in its grocery aisles in favor of items such as fancy sauces and oils and granola, the people told the journal.  The move is designed to reflect the changing tastes of Americans looking for healthier options, the report said. Target representatives could not immediately be reached for  comment.

293,"   By Nathan Layne  Target Corp (TGT.N) on Wednesday reported a larger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, citing robust online sales and strong demand for products at the center of its growth plan.The fourth-largest U.S. retailer raised the low end of its fiscal-year outlook and said it repurchased $562 million worth of its shares in the quarter.

Excluding restructuring costs and other items, earnings rose to $1.10 per share in the first quarter ended May 2 from 92 cents a year earlier. Analysts on average expected $1.03 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Target said sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.3 percent, matching the market consensus, according to Consensus Metrix. One-third of the growth came from online sales, which jumped 38 percent.Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell, who took the job in August, Target has been promoting a narrower set of products that include apparel, items for children and babies, and the health and wellness category. Mulligan said sales of those higher-margin ""signature categories"" were double the company average.Since Target pulled out of the Canadian market earlier this year, ""we are really seeing the benefit of being able to focus on our U.S. business,"" Mulligan said on a media call.           Target raised the low end of its full-year earnings outlook to $4.50 per share from $4.45 before special items while keeping the high end at $4.65.In March, Cornell announced plans to cut $2 billion in costs. The restructuring included eliminating several thousand corporate jobs, a revamp of grocery operations and investments in technology and the supply chain.       Including restructuring costs, Target said first-quarter net earnings from continuing operations rose 14 percent to $651 million. Sales increased 2.8 percent to $17.12 billion.

300,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Small U.S. food manufacturers once toiled for decades to develop a critical mass of fans for their products. Now, an increasing number of privately-held players are going from garage to grocery store in fewer than five years thanks to an erosion of barriers to entry within the food industry.The trend is visible everywhere from gluten-free and organic foods to more traditional fare, according to interviews with half a dozen startups, as well as retailers and industry consultants.Contract manufacturers have made it easier for small companies to produce goods inexpensively, while the reach of digital advertising allows them to target consumers without big marketing budgets, industry experts said. More mass-market retailers want niche brands that shoppers view as healthier to drive traffic in stores, particularly as they face rising competition from natural food and specialty chains like Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O). “It’s never been easier in the history of food for a new organic company to get their products on shelves,” said Arjan Stephens, executive vice president of sales and marketing at Nature’s Path Foods. The privately-held organic breakfast cereal brand was founded in 1985 and took nearly two decades to gain traction with mainstream retailers. In the ice cream business, for example, sales of some major U.S. brands have faltered. But one beneficiary is a little-known frozen dessert company called Arctic Zero. The fat-free, lactose-free and gluten-free product originated out of a soft serve machine in a Temecula, California garage. Arctic Zero hit the retail big leagues in 2013 when it gained coveted space in the freezers of Kroger Co (KR.N) just three years after launch. It is now also available at Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Whole Foods and on Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O).“Everyone has been looking for a ‘better for you’ alternative in ice cream,"" said Arctic Zero CEO Amit Pandhi. “There just hasn’t been any innovation until our brand came along."" Overall, small and midsize consumer goods companies have stolen $18 billion in U.S. sales, or 2 percentage points of share, away from large players since 2009, according to a March report by IRI and the Boston Consulting Group. In 2014 alone, they took 0.7 points of share from big manufacturers.Last year's U.S. sales of snack bars help illustrate the trend. According to Euromonitor International, giant food companies General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and Kellogg Co (K.N) had market share declines of 0.3 points and 1.9 points, respectively, compared with 2013. The privately-held Clif Bar & Co gained 1 percentage point during the period, and another small rival, Kind LLC, increased its share by 2.1 points.The pace of overall share gains is accelerating as small organic and natural food purveyors win more shelf space at mass-market stores.     “They’re able to really focus on a subset of consumers and subset of retailers, and win in those areas and use that as a platform to grow into mainstream areas,” said Dan Wald, a partner at Boston Consulting Group.     RISING COMPETITION  Talenti, a gelato maker that uses hormone-free milk and pure cane sugar, employed such a strategy shortly after beginning production in a 1,000 square foot factory in Dallas. In 2007, when gelato was still a new concept in U.S. supermarkets, the company approached natural food and specialty stores like Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (SFM.O), Whole Foods and Fairway Group Holdings Corp FWM.O. Once the frozen treat proved its success, Talenti pitched more mainstream chains like Publix Super Markets Inc and Kroger. “It was really an exercise in discipline and retail mapping,” said Talenti CEO Steve Gill. “The worst thing we could do was put it into a retail format that was not yet ready for it and have it fail.” Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) bought Talenti last year for an undisclosed sum.To be sure, getting on the shelves of a Target or Kroger isn’t easy, and competition for those spots is increasing.

Steve Hersh, co-founder of Utmost Brands Inc, started selling the company’s GuS Grown-Up Soda to retailers out of his Subaru in 2003. A year later, single bottles of GuS were lost among other options in the aisles of Stop & Shop Supermarket Company LLC, which eventually stopped offering the product. GuS contains less sugar than the average soda and is marketed to adults. Retailers are now catching on to its appeal and giving it prime placement. “Now you go to a Wegmans or Food Emporium, you’re going to see our four packs on a four-foot (wide) shelf, and you’re going to go, ‘oh, that’s a brand,’ rather than three little bottles in a sea of soda,” Hersh said. Finding the right distributor can also help small players build scale. Months after GuS launched, Hersh was contacted by Big Geyser, a major beverage distributor in New York that helped get the soda into Whole Foods and Fairway.  Food makers may still have to jump through hoops to satisfy retailers. One hurdle is the fees that major stores charge food makers to gain shelf space, which can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Retailers may waive such fees depending on the number of options in the category and the ability of a novel brand to draw shoppers. But they may also make companies change the packaging of the product, a potentially costly move. For instance, nutrition bar company Mediterra Inc received interest from Target Corp (TGT.N) to join a trial run of new brands in its stores. Target asked for the bars to be sold in a five pack that Mediterra didn’t offer. The company designed the new packs with the help of its contract manufacturer and produced them in about 45 days, said Paul Pruett, Mediterra’s CEO. The trial at Target concluded in April, and the product is no longer on the shelves. It did, though, raise the brand’s profile, and the bars will be sold in about 400 Kroger stores later this year, Pruett said. Small food makers do need to be aware of how demanding their often social-media savvy, health conscious consumers are, executives said. For example, Arctic Zero recently received requests to put a seal on the product to show it hasn’t been opened. Arctic Zero is discussing the move, which could cost a few hundred thousand dollars, with its contract manufacturers, CEO Pandhi said.    (Reporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Martin Howell)",2015-05-21,TGT,"Thu May 21, 2015 | 1:44am EDT","Small food makers on fast path to U.S. store shelves, threatening big producers",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-food-upstarts-insight-idUSKBN0O60FN20150521?type=companyNews
301,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 21 Small U.S. food manufacturers once toiled for decades to develop a critical mass of fans for their products. Now, an increasing number of privately-held players are going from garage to grocery store in fewer than five years thanks to an erosion of barriers to entry within the food industry.The trend is visible everywhere from gluten-free and organic foods to more traditional fare, according to interviews with half a dozen startups, as well as retailers and industry consultants.Contract manufacturers have made it easier for small companies to produce goods inexpensively, while the reach of digital advertising allows them to target consumers without big marketing budgets, industry experts said.More mass-market retailers want niche brands that shoppers view as healthier to drive traffic in stores, particularly as they face rising competition from natural food and specialty chains like Whole Foods Market Inc.""It's never been easier in the history of food for a new organic company to get their products on shelves,"" said Arjan Stephens, executive vice president of sales and marketing at Nature's Path Foods. The privately-held organic breakfast cereal brand was founded in 1985 and took nearly two decades to gain traction with mainstream retailers.In the ice cream business, for example, sales of some major U.S. brands have faltered. But one beneficiary is a little-known frozen dessert company called Arctic Zero.The fat-free, lactose-free and gluten-free product originated out of a soft serve machine in a Temecula, California garage. Arctic Zero hit the retail big leagues in 2013 when it gained coveted space in the freezers of Kroger Co just three years after launch. It is now also available at Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Whole Foods and on Amazon.com Inc..""Everyone has been looking for a 'better for you' alternative in ice cream,"" said Arctic Zero CEO Amit Pandhi. ""There just hasn't been any innovation until our brand came along.""Overall, small and midsize consumer goods companies have stolen $18 billion in U.S. sales, or 2 percentage points of share, away from large players since 2009, according to a March report by IRI and the Boston Consulting Group. In 2014 alone, they took 0.7 points of share from big manufacturers.Last year's U.S. sales of snack bars help illustrate the trend. According to Euromonitor International, giant food companies General Mills Inc and Kellogg Co had market share declines of 0.3 points and 1.9 points, respectively, compared with 2013. The privately-held Clif Bar & Co gained 1 percentage point during the period, and another small rival, Kind LLC, increased its share by 2.1 points. The pace of overall share gains is accelerating as small organic and natural food purveyors win more shelf space at mass-market stores.""They're able to really focus on a subset of consumers and subset of retailers, and win in those areas and use that as a platform to grow into mainstream areas,"" said Dan Wald, a partner at Boston Consulting Group.RISING COMPETITION Talenti, a gelato maker that uses hormone-free milk and pure cane sugar, employed such a strategy shortly after beginning production in a 1,000 square foot factory in Dallas. In 2007, when gelato was still a new concept in U.S. supermarkets, the company approached natural food and specialty stores like Sprouts Farmers Market Inc, Whole Foods and Fairway Group Holdings Corp. Once the frozen treat proved its success, Talenti pitched more mainstream chains like Publix Super Markets Inc and Kroger.""It was really an exercise in discipline and retail mapping,"" said Talenti CEO Steve Gill.

308,"  (Adds source comments explaining inadvertent publication)By Ramkumar Iyer and Nathan LayneJune 9 Target Corp took down a release from its website on Tuesday that said the company would raise its share buyback program by $5 billion and boost its quarterly dividend by 7.7 percent to 56 cents per share.A person familiar with the matter said the document was one of several prepared ahead of a board meeting scheduled for Tuesday evening and that it was published inadvertently. The board is due to discuss dividend and buyback policy and has not voted on a plan yet, the person said, describing the document as ""contingency planning"". The company in a statement said it had not officially released any information and did not comment further.Target pulled the statement after it was reported by news media. Reuters took a screenshot of the statement at 3:38 pm ET, shortly before it was taken down. The statement had said the quarterly dividend, raised from 52 cents per share, was supposed to be payable on Sept. 10. The current share buyback program of $5 billion was being expanded to $10 billion, it said. Target, the fourth-largest U.S. retailer, said last month it repurchased $562 million worth of its shares in its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 2. It had resumed buybacks after nearly two years.""We expect to have the capacity to increase our annual dividend - and repurchase billions of dollars of Target shares annually - while maintaining our current credit ratings,"" Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan had said in the statement.Target's shares were little changed at $79.12 in after-market trading on Tuesday.

Target also raised its quarterly dividend to 56 cents per share from 52 cents in the prior quarter.""Given our outlook for capital expenditures and the strong cash generation of our core business, we expect to have the capacity to increase our annual dividend and repurchase billions of dollars of Target shares annually while maintaining our current credit ratings,"" Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan said in a statement. The decision was made at a board meeting on Tuesday evening, ahead of its annual shareholders' meeting in San Francisco the following day.But the move had already been flagged to investors earlier on Tuesday when a release that detailed its buyback and dividend plans was mistakenly posted to its website during internal preparations for possible decisions out of the board meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.

310,"   By Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Target Corp's (TGT.N) sale of its in-store pharmacies to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) may encourage large supermarket chains with struggling pharmacies to look for professional drug store partners of their own.More than 1,660 Target pharmacies will become CVS units in the $1.9 billion deal, the first time a drugstore chain has expanded its pharmacy business within a third party retail store, pharmacy consultants and analysts said.Drug stores in recent years have focused on opening new stores, an effort which has slowed recently.Target pharmacies helped drive overall sales at the chain but lost money, as the government health care program known as Obamacare expanded ranks of insured and increased pressure on costs.""Grocery store chains must be taking the news today and thinking hard about it. Pharmacy is not really a core competence,"" said Todd Huseby, partner, AT Kearney said, citing Safeway and Albertsons as two companies that might consider it. Neither responded to a request for comment. Some supermarkets may have the scale and buying power to make their own pharmacies work, said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consulting firm McMillan Doolittle. They may see the store-in-store format as an opening for a competitor, he said.However, margins are eroding, said Adam Fein, president of advisory and research firm Pembroke Consulting.  ""The future of pharmacy is really about being a low cost buyer of generic drugs and capability to dispense specialty drugs and that is an area of challenge for several supermarket operators,"" he said.Supermarkets with pharmacies such as Kroger (KR.N), Safeway and Stop & Shop saw a 0.6 percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled, but a 0.17 percent decline in prescription market share in 2014 from a year earlier, data from Fein's blog Drug Channels showed.Last year, prescriptions filled at chain drugstores like CVS, Walgreens WBA.N, Rite Aid (RAD.N) rose 5.1 percent, with 1.41 percent growth in prescription market share, while mass merchant chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) increased market share by 0.32 percent. Wal-Mart's health and wellness business has been performing very well, and it sees no need to have pharmacies handled by another company, spokeswoman Sarah McKinney said.Drug store chains could look to stores-in-stores as a way to get ""immediate access to new markets at a much lower cost,"" than building their own stores, said Tom Charland, chief executive at consulting firm Merchant Medicine.

311,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Nathan Layne  Drugstore operator CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) will buy Target Corp's (TGT.N) pharmacies and clinics in a $1.9 billion deal that should help it bargain with drug makers for lower prices, while freeing Target from a costly business where it struggled to make a profit. CVS, the second-largest U.S. drugstore operator with 7,800 stores, said on Monday it will acquire Target's more than 1,660 pharmacies in 47 states with about $4 billion in annual sales. It will also acquire Target's nearly 80 clinics.The pharmacies will continue to be located within Target stores but carry the CVS brand. The move was the CVS' second large acquisition in as many months, coming on the heels of its $10.1 billion deal for healthcare services firm Omnicare Inc OCR.N in May.  The transaction will significantly expand the drugstore chain's retail presence and should bolster its bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies. ""The healthcare industry is evolving rapidly,"" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call. ""In this environment, success is all about effectively managing costs, quality and access.""  For Target, the deal divests a business that was ""modestly negative"" in terms of profits. While Target will lose revenue, its sales, general and administrative costs will drop by $1 billion. Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said the move fits with the company's focus on a handful of categories where it believes it can be most competitive including apparel, items for children and health and wellness-related goods.

It will also acquire Target's nearly 80 clinics.The pharmacies will continue to be located within Target stores but carry the CVS brand. The move was the CVS' second large acquisition in as many months, coming on the heels of its $10.1 billion deal for healthcare services firm Omnicare Inc in May.The transaction will significantly expand the drugstore chain's retail presence and should bolster its bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies.""The healthcare industry is evolving rapidly,"" CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call. ""In this environment, success is all about effectively managing costs, quality and access.""For Target, the deal divests a business that was ""modestly negative"" in terms of profits. While Target will lose revenue, its sales, general and administrative costs will drop by $1 billion.Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said the move fits with the company's focus on a handful of categories where it believes it can be most competitive including apparel, items for children and health and wellness-related goods. Target will continue to handle the sale of over-the-counter drugs. Cornell, who has been remaking the retailer's strategy since taking the helm in August, said the deal will allow it to focus resources on reviving its food business, for instance.He also said it should bring more customers into Target stores.

315,"   By Howard Schneider | MINNEAPOLIS  MINNEAPOLIS It is too early to tell how a recent round of tax hikes and a minimum wage increase will play out in Minnesota, a state where liberal and conservative forces have often swapped control and policies.But the state's experience may give pause to a crowded field of Republican presidential hopefuls who largely swear by tax cuts and small government as a recipe for prosperity. Judged by those standards this state on the Canadian border should be a train wreck in process. Instead, Democratic Governor Mark Dayton's Minnesota could become a touchstone in the national debate over how to bolster the middle class - an example of how solid growth and low unemployment can coexist with some of the highest income and corporate tax rates in the country.Born into family wealth but a left-leaning Democrat by temperament, Dayton said in an interview that, to him, one fix for income inequality was pretty obvious: take some from the better off and spread it around.""The wealthiest pay a smaller percentage of local tax than anyone, all the way down to the bottom,"" Dayton told Reuters. ""From a tax equity standpoint I felt an additional two percent on the wealthiest two percent was appropriate."" The $2 billion that the state raised by pushing its top income tax rate to 9.85 percent in 2013 helped wipe out a budget deficit and fund a tax cut for middle income families. The income tax imposed by most U.S. states on local residents comes on top of federal taxes, and the increase in Minnesota made its top tax rate the fourth highest in the country.(Graphic: the Minnesota formula: link.reuters.com/juj25w)A minimum wage rise approved in 2014 boosted pay for the working poor and linked future increases to inflation. When the tax hike generated a surplus, Dayton argued to spend the money on early childhood education rather than scale back the taxes - and persuaded a divided state legislature to go along.The 2016 presidential election is likely to be shaped by debate over just such policies, and whether they might be an answer to deepening income inequality and stagnant middle and lower class incomes.Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton has not laid out an economic plan yet and most potential Republican contenders oppose income redistribution and advocate tax and spending cuts. One of them, Scott Walker, governor of neighboring Wisconsin, has pushed through $2 billion in tax cuts, weakened unions and is now proposing more spending cuts in education and health. Yet so far, Wisconsin has lagged the nation and its neighbor in job creation and economic growth.Minnesota's jobless rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, well below the national average of 5.3 percent. It bounced back quick from the recession and companies, such as Amazon, have pressed ahead with expansions plans there. Analysts on the left have taken note.The 2016 race ""is going to be 'trickle down' versus 'middle out,'"" said David Madland, director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington with close ties to the Democratic party. ""Minnesota is a perfect example of the middle class economics story."" SOLID AND STEADY Politically, the state is known for its sharp contrasts, its choice of public officials ranging from the Midwestern social liberalism of former vice presidents Walter Mondale and Hubert Humphrey to Tea Party firebrand and former lawmaker Michele Bachmann.The state's economy, in contrast, has been steady and predictable, with a solid industrial base, a legacy agricultural sector, and a prominent group of companies headquartered there. That includes Target Corp., the national retailer built by Dayton's family. The unemployment rate since at least the mid-1970s typically runs two percentage points below the national average. Median family income, at almost $60,000, is more than 10 percent above the national level.The state has gone through growth spurts where it outperformed the country and spells where it has lagged. But high taxes have never proved a permanent drag. Still, the national trend in recent years has been in favor of tax cuts. Over the last decade states have cut income and corporate taxes twice as often as they hiked them, according to data from the National Association of State Budget Officers. Those, including California, that have recently hiked income taxes have typically put fixed expiry dates on the increase to make them politically palatable. At least in recent years, ""Minnesota has been the outlier,"" said Jared Walczak, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.Beth Kadoun, head of tax policy at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, said the jury on Dayton's policies was still out. ""I don't think we've seen the impact. We had a strong 2013. Look at 2014. Do we continue to outpace?"" Kadoun said. Minnesota's economy grew 1.4 percent last year, above the Midwest average, but below the 2.2 percent national rate. Wage growth remains weak despite low unemployment.The chamber and other business groups have opposed the tax hikes and continue to push back against parts of the governor's agenda, including the indexation of the minimum wage. But Dayton said his state's record at least proves that taxes don't necessarily destroy growth. In fact, tax cuts have backfired in Wisconsin and Kansas, where Republican governor Sam Brownback cut income taxes only to reverse course and raise other levies as a budget deficit ballooned. ""During this period where other states have been cutting taxes we have held our own and in the last couple of years have done better,"" Dayton said. ""It works for us.""

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)       WEEK AHEAD      The stragglers for the earnings season - Home Depot, Wal-Mart and a few others - will report results to close out the quarter next week, with expectations that retailers would see decent sales after recent revisions show better-than-expected activity in the second quarter. The markets will also continue to watch the Chinese yuan after its unexpected devaluation this week, with anticipation that the dollar will strengthen a bit more, boosting bond-market activity in what is otherwise expected to be a slower week.      Fed minutes are released on Wednesday and will be parsed for clues of an interest rate rise. The Changes in the July statement pointed to an improving economy and labor markets. Characterization of the debate in the minutes could indicate how firm opinions are about the state of the U.S., and how confident members are that inflation and employment will move towards the Fed's target levels. Investors will also look for the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 0.2 percent in July, a bit down from a rise of 0.3 percent in June. Housing data, including housing starts and building permits on Tuesday and existing home sales on Thursday will be in focus. The Conference Board releases its Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity on Thursday.      Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp release its results for the second quarter. Wal-Mart is expected to report better-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday, while Target is expected to miss estimates when it reports on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, TJX Cos Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The off-price retailer is expected to be helped by lower gas prices, wage growth, and higher traffic to its stores as more consumers hunt for bargains. A hike in the number and quality of brands in its stores and merchandise that reflects popular fashion trends is also expected to drive sales. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on industry trends and plans to expand in international markets.      Home Depot Inc, the world's No. 1 home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimate on Tuesday. Strong housing market data over the last few months is expected to have kept overall demand for home improvement goods steady. However, record rainfall in May and June in large parts of the United States is likely to have kept a lid on sales of products in the home exterior improvement categories, such as paint and gardening supplies. Lowe's Companies Inc, the second-largest U.S. home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimates on Wednesday.      Hardware and software maker Hewlett-Packard Co is expected to report third-quarter earnings slightly above analysts' average estimate on Thursday. HP has been cutting costs and focusing on higher-margin sales in the face of a strong dollar and weak enterprise demand for its services. The company is also in the processes of separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.      Salesforce.com Inc, the world's biggest maker of online sales software, is expected to report a second-quarter profit above analysts' average estimate. Salesforce has struggled to earn consistent profits despite strong revenue growth over the past few years, hurt by higher spending on hiring. The company reported a profit for the first time in seven quarters in May. On Thursday, the investors will look for improvement in margins in the quarter and merger-related comments.      Data storage equipment maker NetApp Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue on Wednesday slightly above average analysts' estimate. NetApp, which cut about 500 jobs in May, has been trying to boost growth by focusing on cloud-based products as businesses cut spending on high-end storage systems. The company appointed George Kurian as its new CEO in June to replace Tom Georgens. Investors would be looking for second-quarter forecast.      On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota speaks before the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Price Measurement Issues in a Low Inflation Environment"" conference, in Seoul, South Korea. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco releases the text of the speech Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams delivered before the Bank Indonesia-BIS Research Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia.      Apparel retailer Gap Inc is expected to report a second-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday. Out of fashion merchandise and a general lack of trendy products have led to a decline in sales at the company's flagship Gap brand, leading to heavy discounts. Shipment delays caused due to disruptions at the West Coast ports early this year and a strong dollar are also expected to hurt the company's results in the quarter. Investors will look for comments on recovery at the Gap brand and performance in the current quarter.      On Wednesday, teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The earnings beat is expected to be driven by trendy, fashionable merchandise, lower discounts, benefits from lower cotton prices and tight inventory controls. American Eagle is also benefiting from a new multi-channel distribution center that allows it to control inventories more efficiently by enabling it to supply to its brick-and-mortar as well as online stores. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on promotions and trends, and expectations for the back-to-school shopping season.      Agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co has been hurt by a strong dollar as well as weak demand for its farm and turf equipment, which make up about two-thirds of its annual revenue. Falling U.S. farm income and weak commodity prices have reduced spending on new equipment by farmers. In May, Deere forecast a fall in global sales for its farm equipment in 2015 and said it would close plants and cut jobs. When the company reports its third-quarter results on Friday, the investors will be looking for an update on the company's plans to shutter more factories to adjust to lower demand, as well as whether it is expected to take a hefty charge on a tractor recall announced earlier in August. They will also be looking for more information on a fire in a chemical warehouse in China last week that left some Deere workers critically injured.      Friday data is expected to show that Canada's June retail sales have increased a little, compared with the previous month's reading. It is likely to have risen 0.2 percent, compared with a rise of 1.0 percent in May. Canada's inflation data is also out on Friday. Country's annual inflation is likely to have advanced 1.4 percent in July, up from 1.0 percent in June. Statistics Canada releases June wholesale trade data on Thursday.      On Thursday, Mexico's statistics institute will release GDP data for the second quarter, after the central bank said it sees quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.3 percent for the period, slackening from the first quarter after weaker-than-expected exports and a slump in domestic oil output. The same day, data with show how economic activity fared in June, after slowing to a nine-month low in May. On Friday, retail sales data for June will show how domestic spending performed after rebounding by 0.2 percent in May.           MONDAY, AUGUST 17      U.S. homebuilder sentiment is expected to stay strong in August as the National Association of Home Builders's NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index is likely to show an increase to 61 from 60 in July, which was the highest since November 2005. (1000/1400) Also, the New York Federal Reserve releases its New York Fed's Empire State general business conditions index for August. (0830/1230)      Beauty products company Estee Lauder Co Inc has been seeing a revival in sales in North America, helped by product launches and acquisitions. However, Estee has to increase promotions in its flagship Clinique and Estee Lauder brands which have shown some weakness. The company's smaller brands such as Smashbox and Bobbi Brown have seen a rise in demand, helped by their extensive online presence. Even as sales in overseas markets like the UK and China grow by double digit percentages, a stronger dollar in the past few quarters has stripped their value. The company is expected to beat revenue and profit estimates for the fourth quarter. Investors will be keen on 2016 forecast, updates on acquisitions and the impact of the dollar.      Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales slightly above analysts' average estimates. The beat is expected to be driven by strong performance at the flagship Urban Outfitters brand, which accounts for a majority of sales, but margins are expected to be pressured by higher promotions at the Anthropologie brand, where sales growth has slowed in recent quarters. The company is also benefiting from investments in its fast-growing e-commerce and online division. Investors will look for commentary on sales recovery at the Anthropologie brand, promotions, and updates on performance for the back-to-school shopping season.      Data from Statistics Canada will show the holdings of Canadian securities by non-residents for June. Foreign investors sold C$5.45 billion in Canadian assets in May.

326,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Target Corp (TGT.N) forecast disappointing sales for this quarter and said it expected consumer demand to remain choppy, causing its shares to give up early gains.Earlier on Wednesday, the fourth-largest U.S. retailer reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, citing strong demand for clothing and other merchandise at the center of its growth plan. Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan said on a conference call with analysts that he expected sales at stores open at least a year to increase 1 percent to 2 percent this quarter, including digital sales growth of about 30 percent. Analysts called the comparable sales estimate conservative.    Target's same-store sales rose 2.4 percent in the second quarter ended on Aug. 1, which research firm Consensus Metrix said beat market expectations of 2.2 percent. A 30 percent rise in digital sales contributed 0.6 percentage points.Target also said it urgently needed to adjust inventory levels so that its shelves are sufficiently stocked.  In the year since Brian Cornell became chief executive officer, Target has been promoting a narrower set of ""signature"" products including apparel, baby products and wellness items including organic goods. Sales of those products increased three times faster than the company average during the second quarter ended on Aug. 1, Mulligan said.Under Cornell, Target has also reshuffled its management, exited its struggling Canadian operations and spent more on online sales. In March, Cornell announced a restructuring plan to eliminate several thousand corporate jobs and revamp grocery operations. It also included a $1 billion investment in technology in areas such as supply chain.For the fiscal year, Target said it expected earnings of $4.60 to $4.75 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average forecast $4.62, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.In May, the company had raised the lower end of its forecast by 5 cents a share to between $4.50 and $4.65.  Excluding restructuring charges and other special items, earnings rose to $1.22 per share from $1.01 a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.11, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S said.Net sales rose 2.8 percent to $17.4 billion, meeting Wall Street expectations.Target shares rose as much as 5.4 percent in the morning, but were down 1.1 percent at $79.45 by early afternoon.

""Given the breadth and complexity of the business, it will always be a challenge to be in stock on every item in every store... but our guests need us to be consistent in delivering everyday essentials,"" Mulligan said.Target's supply-chain problems have grown more acute as it has expanded its offering of consumable goods such as meat, fresh produce and dairy products, which in turn have brought customers back to their stores more frequently than in the past.Target's larger rival, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, has struggled to tackle the problem of running out of stock at its own stores for several years, despite having one of the largest and most sophisticated supply chain networks in the business. Analysts and industry consultants said that while Wal-Mart's problems revolve around insufficient employees to fill shelves, an issue the company is addressing, Target's issues stem from its reliance on external distributors.""Target tends to use outside wholesalers and outsources a large amount of distribution, typically on fast-moving consumables,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.Products such as groceries, fresh produce, meat, dairy are replenished up to a 100 times or more every year, and when an outside wholesaler short-ships, Target's stores suffer.

""They have had problems in the past with it and they probably rely on third-party wholesalers and distributors more than they need to,"" said Brian Yarbrough, retail analyst at Edward Jones.In an earnings conference call Target said its supply chain was built to serve an outdated model in which product flowed from vendors through distribution centers to stores.The company did not respond to subsequent requests for comment.Target also has tried to order less inventory than rivals, striving to turn over inventory quickly and reduce capital needs.

337,"  Sept 10 Apparel retailer Cherokee Global Brands  said Target Corp elected not to renew the license of the Cherokee brand in the United States, sending the company's shares tumbling 33 percent in extended trading.The current license will expire on Jan. 31, 2017, Cherokee said in a statement on Thursday. Target has been licensing the Cherokee brand for almost two decades.Cherokee earned $15.0 million in royalty revenue from Target for the Cherokee brand, excluding Canada sales and school uniforms category sales, in fiscal 2015, according to Cherokee's annual filing. The royalty revenue accounted for 43 percent of Cherokee's total revenue for the period, according to the filing. ""The termination of our license agreement with Target for Cherokee branded products would have a material adverse effect on our business,"" Cherokee had said in the filing. The company also reported a 3.2 percent decline in second-quarter sales, hurt by weak demand for Cherokee-branded products in the UK and Canada.Cherokee's shares plunged more than 33 percent to $16.03 in extended trading on Thursday.

338,"   By Joseph Ax  A U.S. judge on Tuesday certified a class action against Target Corp (TGT.N) brought by several banks over the retailer's massive data breach in 2013.U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul, Minnesota, said the banks could pursue their claims together over the breach, which compromised at least 40 million credit cards during the holiday season.In a statement, Charles Zimmerman, one of the lead lawyers representing the banks, said, ""This important ruling brings financial institutions one step closer to collectively holding Target accountable for its unprecedented data breach.""Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company was ""disappointed"" and would evaluate its next steps after reviewing the decision. The ruling, which makes a settlement with the banks more likely, comes four weeks after Target agreed to pay as much as $67 million to financial institutions that issue Visa Inc (V.N) cards, in a deal struck directly with the credit card network.Earlier this year, a proposed $19 million settlement with MasterCard Inc (MA.N) fell through when not enough banks accepted the agreement.It is not clear how many Visa card issuers accepted the terms of that deal by the deadline of Sept. 4. Snyder declined to comment on the number of institutions that have agreed to participate in the Visa deal but emphasized that the class action includes only those card issuers that have not settled their claims.Attorney Zimmerman has said the Visa deal, like the failed MasterCard settlement, does not fully reimburse banks for their losses and was negotiated without input from the plaintiffs. Carrie Hunt, the general counsel for the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, praised the judge's decision and said it ""constitutes one important avenue for recovery"" for credit unions affected by the breach.The Target breach was one in a series of high-profile data security failures to hit major retailers, including Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Staples Inc (SPLS.O).

Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The increase reflects earnings performance in the second quarter as well as the repurchase of shares and a more favorable tax rate, Chief Financial Officer Scott Schenkel said on a call. EBay added a net 8 million new active buyers in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with a year earlier.But while this was an increase of 5 percent, it was a far cry from the double-digit growth rates achieved until about two years ago.Ebay has had to work hard to win back user confidence after a security breach in May last year compromised the data of about 145 million customers. The company was also hurt by a change in Google's algorithm, which pushed its results lower in search rankings.EBay's net income fell to $539 million, or 45 cents per share, from $673 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier.However, excluding items the company earned 43 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 40 cents.Net revenue fell to $2.1 billion from $2.15 billion but was up about 5 percent after excluding changes in currency rates. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $2.09 billion.Gross merchandise volume fell 2 percent including the effect of currency but grew 6 percent on an forex-neutral basis.""We are not settling comfortably into a 5 percent or 6 percent growth rate.

358,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON  BOSTON Oct 30    Some big U.S. retailers are stepping up efforts to use personal identification numbers, or PINs, with new credit cards embedded with computer chips in a bid to prevent counterfeit card fraud.But they are being resisted by the banking industry, which sees no need to invest further in PIN technology, already used with debit cards, resulting in halting adoption and widespread confusion.A small band of retailers with the clout to call the shots on their branded credit cards is leading the charge. Target Corp  is moving ahead with a chip-and-PIN rollout, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc plans to do the same.But Wal-Mart faces obstacles because its credit card partner, Synchrony Financial, is not yet able to handle PINs on credit cards. Broadly, U.S. banks are unprepared or resisting the change.The impasse comes after many consumers got their hands on new credit cards embedded with so-called EMV chips in advance of an Oct. 1 deadline that required retailers to accept chip cards or be liable for fraud losses. EMV stands for EuroPay, MasterCard and Visa.But only about a third of merchants are actually using the chip technology, according to analyst estimates. The number may not pick up until early next year, if at all, because the retail industry typically halts upgrades during the crucial holiday shopping season.""PIN issuance will remain a niche,"" said Julie Conroy, credit-card analyst with Aite Group.Banks favor using chip cards verified by old-school signatures, even though chip-and-PIN usage has led to lower fraud over the decade they have been used in Europe and elsewhere.""The PIN is definitely a must,"" said Lance James, chief scientist with cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint. ""It's one extra step that provides true two-factor authentication.""But bankers say PINs provide little benefit beyond the advantage of using chips in combating the estimated $7 billion-plus in annual U.S. card fraud. EMV chips thwart criminals who use stolen data to create counterfeit cards, a category that Aite estimates accounts for 37 percent of that fraud. Banks say that PINs only provide additional fraud protection when criminals seek to use lost or stolen cards, a situation that Aite estimates accounts for only 14 percent of fraud.Banking groups say there are better approaches than PINs for verifying customers and have asked retailers to embrace tokenization and encryption to prevent theft of credit card numbers.""PIN is a static data element that would not have a meaningful impact on overall payments fraud,"" said Electronic Payments Coalition spokesman Sam Fabens.PINs are also expensive to implement. Gartner analyst Avivah Litan estimates that banks would have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in network improvements to support them.Most retailers have yet to begin using any form of chip technology on credit cards, instead relying on the magnetic strips that are still part of the new cards, even though it now puts them on the hook for fraud losses. But some are pushing recalcitrant banks, arguing that it is absurd to require them to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their point-of-sale terminals if they are not going to get the added security of chip-and-PIN technology.""If they really cared about security, it would be a no-brainer,"" to use PINs, said National Retail Federation General Counsel Mallory Duncan.CONFUSION REIGNS The issue has caused some confusion, even among experts. A Chase credit card representative this month wrongly tweeted that the firm would soon issue chip and PIN credit cards. A company spokeswoman later said the tweet was a mistake.The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation this month released a public service announcement incorrectly suggesting that all EMV credit cards use PINs, saying ""Consumers should use the PIN, instead of a signature, to verify the transaction."" The agency updated the announcement to remove the error.So far only one PIN credit card is available through a major U.S. retailer, a MasterCard that Target issues through Toronto Dominion Bank.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said her company recently began distributing PIN cards through a rollout that should be completed in the spring.""We believe that it is the most secure form of payment that is currently available,"" Snyder said.Even though demands for PIN cards are being made by groups representing large retailers, some big merchants say they have no plans to offer PINs.""Our approach is chip and signature,"" said Macy's Inc  spokesman Jim Sluzewski.JC Penney Co Inc said it has no plans to introduce PINs and has yet to begin processing any chip transactions.An industry executive said that some retailers have privately confided that they fear widespread PIN adoption could result in slower lines and lost sales from shoppers who forget PINs.""They don't want PINs because it clogs up transactions,"" said the executive who declined to be named because the discussions were private.

359,"   By Daniel Wiessner  Nov 5 Target Corp has lost another round in its attempt to prevent pharmacy workers at a New York City store forming what would be the first union in the retailer's 113-year history after a U.S. labor agency declined to review its objections to the plan.In a single-sentence ruling on Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board declined to review Target's claim that board lawyers erred in approving the creation of the union because the company is in the process of selling its pharmacy operations to CVS Health Corp.A group of employees at one of Target's stores in Brooklyn voted 7-2 in September to form the union, a local unit of United Food and Commercial Workers, after they won approval to have an election from an NLRB regional director in New York.

366,"  (New throughout, adds executive and analyst comments, updates share price)By Nathan LayneNov 17 Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported slightly stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday as it booked its fifth straight gain in U.S. same-store sales, sending its shares up more than 4 percent.However, the company also said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to grow more slowly during the current quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season, and that business would remain competitive.Wal-Mart's earnings have been under pressure from costs to boost entry-level wages and spruce up stores. Last month it warned that those costs would lead earnings to decline by as much as 12 percent next year, prompting many investors to dump the stock.The company has also said that those investments, while hitting profits, are also starting to translate into better customer service and helping to lift sales.""We are starting to get some good momentum,"" Greg Foran, chief executive of U.S. operations, said on a call with reporters. Net profit attributable to the world's largest retailer fell to $3.304 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the third quarter ended on Oct. 31 from $3.711 billion, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results included a boost of 4 cents a share from an adjustment of accounting for leases. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.5 percent, while customer traffic increased 1.7 percent. The company said food, apparel and home goods performed well, while its entertainment department struggled due in part to a lack of blockbuster products on the market to drive demand.Wal-Mart said inventory on a comparable store basis fell by 1.9 percent, a sharp contrast with Macy's and other retailers that warned of a build-up of stock in recent weeks.In a note to clients, Cowen & Co analyst Oliver Chen wrote that Wal-Mart's ""clean inventory position"" should somewhat limit promotional pressure among discounters during the holiday season. He also said Wal-Mart's sales growth, driven by sales and apparel, should generally bode well for Target Corp, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday. Wal-Mart said operating income fell 8.8 percent to $5.7 billion. Foran said the company had added more labor hours than initially planned during the quarter while also making investments in customer-facing parts of the store.Wal-Mart said consolidated revenue fell 1.3 percent to $117.4 billion, weighed down by international operations, which have been hurt by a stronger dollar. It said online sales increased 10 percent in the quarter, slower than its plans for growth in the mid-to-high-teens this fiscal year. It cited weakness in Brazil, China and the U.K.The company forecast same-store U.S. sales growth would slow to 1 percent in the fourth quarter due to a tough comparison from last year when a big drop in fuel prices and food inflation boosted sales.Wal-Mart narrowed its forecast for earnings per share in the full fiscal year to end-January to $4.50 to $4.65 from $4.40 to $4.70.

367,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Target Corp (TGT.N) faces margin pressure and will not meet its fiscal-year forecast for online sales growth, which slowed in the latest quarter, the discount retailer said on Wednesday, sending its shares down more than 5 percent.Digital sales, which include online and mobile, increased 20 percent in the third quarter ended Nov. 1, missing Target's expectations of 30 percent, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said.

370,"  (Corrects company name to Market Track from MarketTrak in paragraphs 3, 7, 8)By Kylie Gumpert and Nandita BoseNEW YORK/CHICAGO Nov 24 Target Corp's  10 percent discount on a $30.49 pair of embroidered curtains was not nearly enough to entice Valerie Jenkins, shopping in Chicago the weekend before Thanksgiving.She expects the 60-70 percent off she got during the last holidays. ""There were some very good deals this time last year,"" she said.Jenkins represents a problem for retailers going into what traditionally has been the peak shopping day of the holiday season, Black Friday. Big retailers are keeping discounts for the weekend following Thanksgiving at around the same level as last year, according to data supplied to Reuters by Market Track.But polls by Reuters/Ipsos and some others show shoppers, who got even bigger discounts closer to Christmas last year, are cautious with their spending and willing to wait for deals.The Reuters/Ipsos survey found more people planned to cut holiday spending than increase in every category surveyed: clothing, jewelry, electronics, food and toys, and that 46 percent felt they could wait longer in the season to buy because of faster shipping.Black Friday shopping will help set the tone for the rest of the holiday season, signaling to retailers whether they need to drop prices or change promotions. While Black Friday is not always a strong forecaster of holiday spending, last year reports of poor Black Friday spending were followed by deeper discounting and a rush of buying in the week before Christmas. J.C. Penney Co Inc offered an average 58 percent off in Black Friday ads this year, down from 59 percent last year, according to Market Track, which looks at circulars from top retailers.

371,"   By Kylie Gumpert and Nandita Bose | NEW YORK/CHICAGO  NEW YORK/CHICAGO Nov 24 Target Corp's  10 percent discount on a $30.49 pair of embroidered curtains was not nearly enough to entice Valerie Jenkins, shopping in Chicago the weekend before Thanksgiving.She expects the 60-70 percent off she got during the last holidays. ""There were some very good deals this time last year,"" she said.Jenkins represents a problem for retailers going into what traditionally has been the peak shopping day of the holiday season, Black Friday. Big retailers are keeping discounts for the weekend following Thanksgiving at around the same level as last year, according to data supplied to Reuters by MarketTrak.But polls by Reuters/Ipsos and some others show shoppers, who got even bigger discounts closer to Christmas last year, are cautious with their spending and willing to wait for deals.The Reuters/Ipsos survey found more people planned to cut holiday spending than increase in every category surveyed: clothing, jewelry, electronics, food and toys, and that 46 percent felt they could wait longer in the season to buy because of faster shipping.Black Friday shopping will help set the tone for the rest of the holiday season, signaling to retailers whether they need to drop prices or change promotions. While Black Friday is not always a strong forecaster of holiday spending, last year reports of poor Black Friday spending were followed by deeper discounting and a rush of buying in the week before Christmas. J.C. Penney Co Inc offered an average 58 percent off in Black Friday ads this year, down from 59 percent last year, according to MarketTrak, which looks at circulars from top retailers. Kohl's Corp is offering 54 percent off, up from 51 percent in 2014, and discounts from Staples Inc  and Office Depot are both a touch less than last year, at 45 percent and 50 percent, respectively.Appliances, entertainment items, infant products and hardware showed narrowing discounts, MarketTrak reported, while promotions for apparel, toys and electronics were getting bigger.Kurt Jetta, head of retail industry researcher TABS Group, found the discounts underwhelming.""The fact that retail has been so weak coming in to the season would suggest they may need to ramp up efforts to make up for this later,"" Jetta said.

372,"  (Adds new comments, details on Walmart protest, comment from company official, online sales data, updates shares with closing prices)By Nandita Bose and Nathan LayneCHICAGO/PITTSBURGH Nov 27 America's annual Black Friday shopping extravaganza was short on fireworks this year as U.S. retailers' discounts on electronics, clothing and other holiday gifts failed to draw big crowds to stores and shopping malls.Major retail stocks including Best Buy and Wal-Mart closed lower while Target, picked out by one analyst for its promotion strategy, saw its shares tick up.Bargain hunters found relatively little competition compared with previous years. Some had already shopped Thursday evening, reflecting a new normal of U.S. holiday shopping, where stores open up with deals on Thanksgiving itself, rather than waiting until Black Friday.Retailers ""have taken the sense of urgency out for consumers by spreading their promotions throughout the year and what we are seeing is a result of that,"" said Jeff Simpson, director of the retail practice at Deloitte. Traffic in stores was light on Friday, while Thursday missed his expectations, he said.As much as 20 percent of holiday shopping is expected to be done over the Thanksgiving weekend this year, analysts said. But  the four days are not considered a strong indicator for the entire season. A slow start last year led to deeper promotions and a shopping rush in the final ten days of December.Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, told Reuters he was not surprised that a store would see thinner crowds on Friday after it kicked off Black Friday deals on Thursday night.Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analysts were more blunt, calling Thursday a ""bust"". ""Members of our team who went to the malls first had no problem finding parking or navigating stores,"" he wrote in a note. The Macy's store at Water Tower Place mall on a rainy Chicago morning saw thin crowds in the early hours of Friday. Later in the morning, more than 1,000 protestors clogged Chicago's Magnificent Mile shopping corridor.Nia Darrell, a 23-year-old student, was shopping for coats and handbags at the store with two friends.""I shopped online yesterday and picked up most of what I wanted,"" she said."" I'm out because Black Friday is more like a tradition, but the discounts are similar even online this year.""While Black Friday may be losing some appeal in the United States, British shoppers have taken to the concept enthusiastically, with reports of large crowds at big stores and malls in the UK. Shares of Target Corp gained 0.4 percent, but J.C. Penney wad down 0.7 percent, and Macy's and Best Buy lost about 1 percent. Wal-Mart dipped 0.6 percent, while Amazon.com Inc was down 0.3 percent.A broad retail index was down 0.15 percent in abbreviated trading.Traffic was better at some retailers. Analysts at Cowen & Co said Target stood out with its ""innovative promotions,"" and teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc saw more traffic due to store-wide discounts of 40 percent. ONLINE SALES RISE Shoppers in the United States spent $822 million online between midnight and 11 am ET, a 15-percent increase from 2014 but lower than the expected growth of 19 percent, according to the Adobe Digital Index, which tracked 180 million visits to over 4,500 U.S. retail sites. On Thanksgiving Day, online sales rose 22 percent from midnight to 5 pm ET.Many stores around the country were full on Thanksgiving evening. Media showed brawling shoppers at a packed Kentucky mall Thursday, forcing a police officer to break up the fight.Wal-Mart worker group 'Our Wal-Mart' said 1,400 workers planned to fast and protest around the country for better wages, but there was no indication that would hurt sales.Early Black Friday discounts included $700 off a 60-inch Samsung television at Best Buy for $799.99, 20 percent off a $75 purchase at Target, and a Kindle for $49.99 on Amazon.com.The National Retail Federation is expecting holiday sales to rise 3.7 percent, slower than last year's 4.1 percent growth rate, due to stagnant wages and sluggish job growth.Jorgette Clark, 27, said her budget would probably be lower this year because her husband works in the energy industry.""I feel like we scaled back this year.

381,"  (Part 2 in a series, ""The Cannibalized Company: How the cult of shareholder value has reshaped corporate America)By Karen Brettell, David Gaffen and David RohdeNEW YORK Dec 10When health insurer Humana Inc reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings in late 2014 - including a 21 percent drop in net income - it softened the blow by immediately telling investors it would make a $500 million share repurchase.In addition to soothing shareholders, the surprise buyback benefited the company's senior executives. It added around two cents to the company's annual earnings per share, allowing Humana to surpass its $7.50 EPS target by a single cent and unlocking higher pay for top managers under terms of the company's compensation agreement.Thanks to Humana hitting that target, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard earned a $1.68 million bonus for 2014.Most publicly traded U.S. companies reward top managers for hitting performance targets, meant to tie the interests of managers and shareholders together. At many big companies, those interests are deemed to be best aligned by linking executive performance to earnings per share, along with measures derived from the company's stock price.But these metrics may not be solely a reflection of a company's operating performance. They can be, and often are, influenced through stock repurchases. In addition to cutting the number of a company's shares outstanding, and thus lifting EPS, buybacks also increase demand for the shares, usually providing a lift to the share price, which affects other performance markers.As corporate America engages in an unprecedented buyback binge, soaring CEO pay tied to short-term performance measures like EPS is prompting criticism that executives are using stock repurchases to enrich themselves at the expense of long-term corporate health, capital investment and employment.""We've accepted a definition of performance that is narrow and quite possibly inappropriate,"" said Rosanna Landis Weaver, program manager of the executive compensation initiative at As You Sow, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that promotes corporate responsibility. Pay for performance as it is often structured creates ""very troublesome, problematic incentives that can potentially drive very short-term thinking.""A Reuters analysis of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index found that 255 of those companies reward executives in part by using EPS, while another 28 use other per-share metrics that can be influenced by share buybacks.In addition, 303 also use total shareholder return, essentially a company's share price appreciation plus dividends, and 169 companies use both EPS and total shareholder return to help determine pay.STANDARD PRACTICE EPS and share-price metrics underpin much of the compensation of some of the highest-paid CEOs, including those at Walt Disney Co, Viacom Inc, 21st Century Fox Inc, Target Corp and Cisco Systems Inc.Fewer than 20 of the S&P 500 companies disclose in their proxies whether they exclude the impact of buybacks on per-share metrics that determine executive pay.Humana would not say whether it adjusted targets to account for its buyback last year. In a statement to Reuters, the company said it sets annual per-share targets for executives that take into account the company's ""capital allocation strategy,"" which includes buybacks, dividends, acquisitions and investments.Experts said Humana would not have reached the target without the $500 million buyback. The company told analysts at the time of the repurchase announcement in November 2014 that it expected to report annual earnings per share of between $7.40 and $7.60 for the full year.""Given the magnitude of the repurchase, the EPS would have been below $7.50 had it not been for the repurchase,"" said Heitor Almeida, a professor of finance with the College of Business at the University of Illinois in Champaign.As reported in the first article in this series, share buybacks by U.S. non-financial companies reached a record $520 billion in the most recent reporting year. A Reuters analysis of 3,300 non-financial companies found that together, buybacks and dividends have surpassed total capital expenditures and are more than double research and development spending.Companies buy back their shares for various reasons. They do it when they believe their shares are undervalued, or to make use of cash or cheap debt financing when business conditions don't justify capital or R&D spending. They also do it to meet the expectations of increasingly demanding investors.Lately, the sheer volume of buybacks has prompted complaints among academics, politicians and investors that massive stock repurchases are stifling innovation and hurting U.S. competitiveness - and contributing to widening income inequality by rewarding executives with ever higher pay, often divorced from a company's underlying performance.""There's been an over-focus on buybacks and raising EPS to hit share option targets, and we know that those are concentrated in the hands of the few, and that the few is in the top 1 percent,"" said James Montier, a member of the asset allocation team at global investment firm GMO in London, which manages more than $100 billion in assets.The introduction of performance targets has been a driver of surging executive pay, helping to widen the gap between the richest in America and the rest of the country. Median CEO pay among companies in the S&P 500 increased to a record $10.3 million last year, up from $8.6 million in 2010, according to data firm Equilar.At those levels, CEOs last year were paid 303 times what workers in their industries earned, compared with a ratio of 59 times in 1989, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit.SALARY AND A LOT MORE Today, the bulk of CEO compensation comes from cash and stock awards, much of it tied to performance metrics. Last year, base salary accounted for just 8 percent of CEO pay for S&P 500 companies, while cash and stock incentives made up more than 45 percent, according to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services. Thomson Reuters Corp, owner of Reuters News, used EPS to determine half of the performance awards in the three-year pay cycle ended in 2014 for CEO Jim Smith and other executives. Smith last year took home $6.6 million in compensation. The company's three-year performance awards going forward are based on both EPS and free cash flow per share. A company spokesman said Thomson Reuters does not adjust for the impact of stock buybacks on those metrics.Share repurchases can make the difference in meeting preset targets, according to a Reuters review of corporate proxies.At Xerox Corp, revenue, net income and spending on research and development all declined last year. But the printer and copier maker's EPS target of $1.12 was unchanged from the prior year, and managers hit it exactly after $1.1 billion in share repurchases.Half of CEO Ursula Burns's annual bonus target was predicated on hitting that EPS level; ultimately, she received a bonus of $1.98 million out of a possible $2.2 million. EPS is also a major determinant of even bigger bonuses for a three-year performance cycle ending this year.Xerox repurchased $1.35 billion of its shares in the first three quarters of this year. The company declined to comment. Its proxy statement does not indicate whether it adjusts targets to account for buybacks.Managers at information technology company EMC Corp hit their EPS target for 2014 of $1.90 with the help of $3.7 billion in share repurchases. Based on the share count before the buybacks, EPS last year would have been only $1.81, little changed from $1.80 a year earlier, according to a Reuters calculation.The EPS target accounted for half of CEO Joseph Tucci's annual $1.01 million bonus. It also is used to determine 45 percent of bonus share awards for the company's future three-year targets.EMC declined to comment. Its proxy statement does not address whether it makes adjustments to account for buybacks. It has bought back $3.11 billion in shares so far this year.Buybacks can boost a company's share price to benefit executives whose shares vest over a period of years. Activision Blizzard Inc, purveyor of ""Guitar Hero,"" ""Call of Duty"" and other well-known video games, signed Chief Executive Robert Kotick to a contract in 2012 that included $56 million in share awards that vest over time, depending in part on the share price and EPS.Last year, Kotick ended up getting about $22 million in performance-based cash and stock awards, about the same as the year prior, even as net income dropped 17 percent. How? The stock rose substantially, meeting goals for total shareholder return and increasing the value of share awards.Total shareholder return was helped by an $8.2 billion repurchase made in late 2013 - when the company and a group of investors led by Kotick and Activision Chairman Brian Kelly bought out a stake held by then-majority shareholder Vivendi. The company said the deal allowed Activision to operate with more flexibility.The shares rose 33 percent from the date of the buyback announcement in July 2013 through the end of 2014. The share price has continued to rise this year, making the awards even more valuable.Activision declined to comment. In 1992, Congress changed the tax code to curb rising executive pay and encourage performance-based compensation. It didn't work. Instead, the shift is widely blamed for soaring executive pay and a heavier emphasis on short-term results.Companies started tying performance pay to ""short-term metrics, and suddenly all the things we don't want to happen start happening,"" said Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York. ""Despite 20 years of trying, we have still failed to come up with an objective performance metric that can't be gamed.""Shareholder expectations have changed, too. The individuals and other smaller, mostly passive investors who dominated equity markets during the postwar decades have given way to large institutional investors. These institutions tend to want higher returns, sooner, than their predecessors. Consider that the average time investors held a particular share has fallen from around eight years in 1960 to a year and a half now, according to New York Stock Exchange data.""TOO EASY TO MANIPULATE"" Companies like to use EPS as a performance metric because it is the primary focus of financial analysts when assessing the value of a stock and of investors when evaluating their return on investment.But ""it is not an appropriate target, it's too easy to manipulate,"" said Almeida, the University of Illinois finance professor.In 2011, Amgen Inc CEO Kevin Sharer oversaw $8.32 billion of buybacks, by far the largest in the pharmaceutical maker's history. More than $5 billion of those repurchases came in the fourth quarter of the year.Soon after, Amgen reported that net income was lower than it had been in the three preceding years. At the same time, the buybacks lifted EPS far above the target level that determined 30 percent of Sharer's bonus, doubling the amount he earned for that portion of his $4.88 million annual bonus. Without the buyouts, EPS would have fallen below the target level.Sharer left the company in May 2012 and is now on the faculty of Harvard Business School. He did not respond to requests for comment.The Amgen board's compensation committee removed EPS as a performance metric the next year. It opted, instead, to begin using net income, saying in a 2012 proxy statement that doing so would ""align compensation with a measure that more directly correlates with the underlying performance of our operations.""Members of Amgen's 2011 compensation committee declined to comment.Some companies, including software developer Citrix Systems Inc and kidney dialysis company DaVita Inc, say they avoid EPS in pay calculations because it is too vulnerable to manipulation. Most companies that use per-share metrics for executive awards, however, say little about whether they adjust results to account for buybacks. A select few, including Johnson & Johnson, FedEx, Time Warner Inc and IBM, do disclose that they strip out the potential effect of buybacks on performance metrics.FedEx, in its most recent filing, said it excluded the effect of buybacks because the positive effect on EPS ""did not reflect core business performance."" Time Warner Inc said it adjusts for buybacks ""so that payouts were not advantaged"" if the media company repurchased more shares than it initially anticipated when setting performance goals.Steve Pakela, managing partner at Pay Governance LLC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which advises more than 40 S&P 500 companies on executive pay, said some directors ""believe you shouldn't strip out the effect"" because share buybacks may be the best use of capital.In addition to EPS, there is total shareholder return, which typically comprises a company's share price appreciation plus dividends over time. Total return, often used to compare performance among peer companies, has also become a popular performance measure for executive pay.By providing a lift to a stock's price, buybacks can increase total shareholder return to target levels, resulting in more stock awards for executives. And of course, the higher stock price lifts the value of company stock they already own.""It can goose the price at time when the high price means they earn performance shares  even if the stock price later goes back down, they got their shares,"" said Michael Dorff, a law professor at the Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles.Exxon Corp, the largest repurchaser of shares over the past decade, has rejected shareholder proposals that it add three-year targets based on shareholder return to its compensation program. In its most recent proxy, the energy company said doing so could increase risk-taking and encourage underinvestment to achieve short-term results.The energy giant makes half of its annual executive bonus payments contingent on meeting longer-term EPS thresholds. Since 2005, the company has spent more than $200 billion on buybacks.ADDITIONAL TWEAKS While performance targets are specific, they aren't necessarily fixed. Corporate boards often adjust them or how they are calculated in ways that lift executive pay.Humana specifies EPS ranges to determine annual bonuses paid to its executives. For the past three years, buybacks of more than $500 million a year increased EPS. That wasn't all, however. For each of those years, the board altered calculations in ways that also bumped EPS higher.For 2012, then-CEO Michael McCallister received a higher bonus than he otherwise would have -- $1.63 million -- after Humana's board removed litigation expenses from its EPS calculation.He was succeeded as CEO at the start of 2013 by Broussard. For that year, Broussard's annual bonus was lifted into the maximum range, for a payment $2.44 million, after accounting for the cost of posting additional reserves against long-term insurance policies.For 2014, Humana discounted from its EPS calculation losses from paying down some bonds, even as its overall debt levels increased. That adjustment brought the company just below its EPS target of $7.50.The $500 million buyback the company announced late last year, part of its total $872 million in buybacks in 2014, was an accelerated share repurchase. In this sort of deal, a company buys all the stock from an investment bank in a single transaction. That allows it to book the reduction in shares outstanding immediately, and the bank then buys the shares on the open market over the ensuing months.Humana's accelerated share repurchase lifted EPS to $7.51, just above the target.Susan Young, an associate professor of accounting and taxation at Fordham University in New York, said accelerated buybacks are commonly used to reach compensation targets. ""I can't think of a good reason for this form of repurchase,"" she said, noting that the programs restrict a company's flexibility to reduce or stop buybacks if shares become too expensive.Roy Dunbar, a member of the Humana board's compensation committee, declined to comment on Humana specifically. He said the benefit of accelerated repurchases is to, ""in a controlled way, buy a significant slice of available shares early in the program,"" before an announced buyback pushes up the share price and increases the cost to the company.He also said an accelerated program allows shareholders to see immediate action, which is ""important to signal a higher degree of confidence in something shareholders care a great deal about.""In general, he said, ""effective compensation committees are aware of impact of share repurchases on EPS, particularly when EPS is part of the equity compensation of management.""In July, Aetna Inc announced that it would acquire Humana in a deal that at the time valued Humana at $37 billion. If Broussard leaves after the deal, he won't go empty-handed.Just before the Aetna deal was announced, Broussard's compensation agreement was modified to accelerate equity awards and remove restrictions on exercising some stock options if he leaves or is terminated within two years of any acquisition, a regulatory filing shows.At the end of last year, Broussard held unvested share awards valued at around $12.8 million, which have since increased in value as Humana's share price has climbed 18 percent.(Edited by John Blanton)",2015-12-10,TGT,"Thu Dec 10, 2015 | 12:00pm EST",SPECIAL REPORT-Buybacks enrich the bosses even when business sags,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-buybacks-pay-idUSL3N13J3ZQ20151210?type=companyNews
382,"  * Deal valued at $15.4 bln on fully diluted basis* Combination to help negotiations with big retailers* Newell Brands to have total sales of about $16 bln* Jarden shares trade well below $60/share offer   (Adds details, analysts comment; updates shares)By Yashaswini SwamynathanDec 14 Newell Rubbermaid Inc, known for its food containers, agreed to buy Sunbeam and Coleman products maker Jarden Corp for more than $15 billion in a deal that will give it more leverage with retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The deal announced on Monday comes amid growing pressure for retailers to hold down prices as they compete with online players such as Amazon.com Inc.Reuters reported in October that Wal-Mart, which provides nearly 13 percent of Newell Rubbermaid's revenue, was asking suppliers to cut prices.The deal, while primarily aimed at accelerating growth, will make it easier for Newell to fend off demands for price cuts, Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino, told Reuters.Based on 220.35 million Jarden shares outstanding as of Oct. 30, the deal has a value of $13.22 billion. However, Newell Rubbermaid said that on a fully diluted basis the offer was valued at $15.4 billion.The combined company, to be called Newell Brands, will have annual sales of $16 billion.Newell Brands' revenue from Wal-Mart is expected to be more than 2.6 times Newell Rubbermaid's 2014 revenue from the retailer, the Newell Rubbermaid said in an investor presentation, while revenue from Target Corp stores is expected to be 1.9 times bigger.From Amazon, revenue is expected to grow by 1.8 times after the deal closes in the second quarter of 2016. The deal - which gives Newell Rubbermaid ownership of more than 120 Jarden brands, including Yankee Candle, Crock-Pot cookware and class rings maker Jostens Inc - will also significantly increase its U.S. distribution network.PREMIUM DISAPPPOINTS Newell Brands will be led by Newell Rubbermaid Chief Executive Michael Polk. Martin Franklin, Jarden's founder and executive chairman, will be on the board.Jarden shareholders will receive $21 in cash and 0.862 Newell shares for each share held, implying a $60 per share offer. The offer is at a 24 percent premium to Jarden's closing stock price on Dec. 4, the day before reports emerged that the company was in talks to combine with Newell. Jarden's shares were up 1 percent at $53.30 in early afternoon trading, far below the offer price, while Newell's stock was down 10.5 percent at $40.51.Analysts attributed the gap between the offer price and  Jarden's shares to disappointment in the premium and the exclusion of Franklin from an executive role in the new company.Newell Rubbermaid shareholders will own about 55 percent of Newell Brands.The companies said they expected to realize cost savings of $500 million in the four years after the transaction closes.Goldman Sachs was lead financial adviser to Newell Rubbermaid, while Centerview Partners advised the board.Barclays was the lead financial adviser to Jarden, with UBS Investment Bank also advising.Jones Day and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett provided legal counsel to Newell Rubbermaid, while Greenberg Traurig LLP and Kane Kessler PC were legal advisers to Jarden.(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan; Additional reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Ted Kerr)",2015-12-14,TGT,"Mon Dec 14, 2015 | 1:37pm EST",UPDATE 3-Newell Rubbermaid to buy Jarden to create consumer durables giant,http://www.reuters.com//article/jarden-ma-newellrubbermaid-idUSL3N1433OC20151214?type=companyNews
383,"   By Nandita Bose  Target Corp is in the early stages of developing its own mobile wallet, three people familiar with the matter said, joining Wal-Mart Stores Inc in posing a threat to recent entrants like Apple Pay.The fourth-largest U.S. retailer has not committed to launch the product, which would allow customers to pay for goods using an app on their mobile phones. The mobile wallet could launch as early as next year, but it is too early to predict, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.Target's team has made some decisions, including to partner  with credit card companies, and they are in favor of processing transactions using scanning technology to communicate with payment terminals, the two sources said.However, Target has not tested the wallet in its stores so far, said the third source, who was not authorized to disclose the details.Target's entry would create a powerful new competitor in a small, crowded market, challenging Apple Inc's Apple Pay, Alphabet Inc's Android Pay and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Samsung Pay.  Target's move also would raise new questions about the viability of a plan by a number of retailers, including Target and Wal-Mart, to create a joint mobile wallet, called CurrentC. Target spokesman Eddie Baeb said on Friday the retailer is testing CurrentC, which is being developed by the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), in a few stores but it is also exploring additional mobile wallet solutions. He declined to comment on whether Target was developing its own mobile payment service.""Target is a participant of the MCX and we are testing its CurrentC mobile wallet with guests as part of a pilot in Columbus, Ohio,"" Baeb said.Mobile wallets have struggled to find favor with merchants and customers, with many shoppers not finding the new systems worth the trouble to activate for every purchase.  Still, wallet companies are cramming into the space in the expectation that consumers eventually will choose to pay with phones and that winning vendors will forge deep, profitable links with customers. CurrentC's aim was to become competitive with credit cards while reducing the fees retailers pay to card companies. Last week, Wal-Mart became the first member of the group to announce its own mobile payment service, Wal-Mart Pay.  Wal-Mart said it would remain part of the CurrentC consortium and the sources said Target planned to as well.    The urgency by Wal-Mart and Target to jump into the mobile payments space stems from the delays in CurrentC's rollout and the need to remain ahead in the payments business, industry experts said.    Target does not accept any type of mobile wallet in stores, but takes Apple Pay in its mobile application.     The Minneapolis-based retailer is planning to integrate its wallet into its existing mobile application and does not intend to employ the wireless near-field communication technology used by the likes of Apple Pay and Android Pay, one of the sources added.    It is leaning toward using QR code technology, used by Starbucks Corp and Wal-Mart, which allows customers to scan a code at the payment terminal, the sources said.    Like Wal-Mart, Target aims to directly link customers' credit cards to its payment app, they added.    Target's mobile wallet is not likely to bypass credit card companies. The retailer is looking for ways to integrate its Red store credit and debit cards, as well as cards from other issuers, the sources said.    Gregory Burch, vice president of strategic initiatives at payment terminal manufacturer Ingenico, said given the proliferation of mobile payment services, retailers have to make it worthwhile for shoppers to use their mobile wallets in stores.""It is crucial these retailers are able to build (customer) habit,"" he said.

384,"   By Nandita Bose and Kylie Gumpert | CHICAGO/NEW YORK  CHICAGO/NEW YORK Dec 24 Retailers are struggling to meet even modest forecasts for the holiday shopping season this year after the ""Super Saturday"" before Christmas failed to live up to its nickname, industry research groups said.The last Saturday before Christmas often sets the annual record for retail sales, vying with Thanksgiving weekend's Black Friday. In recent years, last-minute shopping has determined the success of the season, and a relatively weak final weekend bodes poorly for retailers.This year Super Saturday weekend sales in stores and online rose 4 percent to $55 billion, after a 2.5 percent gain last year, according to retail consultancy and private-equity fund Customer Growth Partners. That puts overall store and online sales from the start of November through Dec. 22 on track to rise 3.1 percent, below the 3.2 percent pace the firm forecast and down from 4.1 percent growth in the same period last year.""Sales have been sluggish so far this year as most consumers are still buying close to need,"" said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. ""What's worse is the marked deceleration from a year ago,"" he said.Last year, last-minute sales gained in the final 10 days of the holiday season, driven by savings from lower gasoline prices. If sales, spurred by gift card redemptions, hold up in the week after Christmas this year, retailers could move closer to meeting performance forecasts, consultants and retail experts said.The National Retail Federation, the leading industry body, has forecast a 3.7 percent rise in store and online sales this year. Discounts across categories have been deeper than last year, in the range of 20 percent to 50 percent, said Traci Gregorski, vice president of marketing at analytics firm Market Track. But consultants said the discounting still had not been enough to boost store traffic materially.Promotions earlier in November took a toll on in-store sales during the Thanksgiving weekend, when total spending was the same as last year, according to the NRF.The drop in store traffic has been offset to a large extent by online sales. Forrester expects U.S. households to spend $95.5 billion online during the holiday season, up 11 percent over last year. E-commerce accounts for 10 percent of U.S. retail spending annually, but 14 percent of spending during November and December, the company said. The surge in online sales did not significantly disrupt services this year at delivery companies like United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, which put firm cut-off dates for gifts to ship in time for Christmas, the companies and consultants said.Most retailers had little choice but to comply with the cut-off dates.""We have stopped (free shipping) for orders that promised delivery by Christmas"" because of UPS' cut-off date, said Noelle Sadler, chief marketing officer at online clothing retailer Lulus. WEAKER TRAFFIC Analytics firm RetailNext, which tracks specialty stores like Best Buy Co Inc and large retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, said sales dropped 6.7 percent over the pre-Christmas weekend compared with a year ago, and store traffic dipped 10.4 percent. However, customers who did hit the stores spent more.""The jury is still out,"" said Bridget Johns, head of customer engagement at RetailNext. ""We still have over a week before the season closes but it will surely be a race to the finish line.""Best-sellers during the holiday season have included toys and home improvement items like appliances, tools, furnishings and home decor.But apparel sales plummeted as warm weather hurt sales of winter clothing and discounts on electronics hurt retail margins, even as sales volumes in the category remained robust.

385,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  U.S. home improvement retailer Lowe's Cos Inc (LOW.N) agreed to buy Canada's Rona Inc RON.TO for C$3.2 billion ($2.28 billion), winning over Rona's board with a far higher offer than an unsolicited bid more than three years ago that was opposed by the company and Quebec politicians.The deal will put Lowe's in a stronger position to compete with Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in Canada's more-than $30 billion home improvement market.Lowe's, which withdrew a C$1.8 billion offer for Rona in September 2012, said on Wednesday it had made key commitments, including moving the headquarters of its Canadian business from Toronto to Rona's home base in the Montreal suburb of Boucherville, Quebec.It also said it would retain the vast majority of Rona's employees, keep the brand and ramp up distribution to independent dealers, many of whom had opposed the previous deal.Lowe's previous attempt to take over Rona became a hot-button issue in Quebec.Quebec's economic development minister said it would not be in the interest of the Liberal government to block the new deal, despite a call from the opposition Parti Québécois to reject it.Asked on a call with analysts why Lowe's had made a new offer, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said Rona was ""a much better business today."" After years of disappointing sales, Rona has been closing unprofitable stores and generally streamlining operations under Chief Executive Robert Sawyer. Sales at established stores have risen five quarters in a row.Lowe's push into Canada comes a year after Target Corp (TGT.N) exited the country after less than two years due to supply chain and other issues.The big difference is that Lowe's is buying an established business, while Target was largely starting from scratch. CAISSE ACCEPTS Lowe's, the world's No. 2 home improvement chain, had only 40 of its 1,850 North America stores in Canada as of March. Rona has about 700 stores.Home Depot has 182 Canadian stores, its website shows. Lowe's will pay C$24 per share for Rona's common shares - more than double the stock's close on Tuesday.Rona's largest shareholder, Quebec public pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, said it would accept the offer. The Caisse holds about 17 percent of Rona, Thomson Reuters data shows.BMO Capital Markets analyst Peter Sklar said the deal would likely win regulatory approval.Rona's shares were trading as high as $C23.57 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, their highest since July 2007. Lowe's shares were down nearly 8 percent at $66.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

386,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Target Corp's (TGT.N) quarterly sales at established stores topped analysts' estimates as its initiatives around higher-profit items drove traffic, showing that the company's turnaround efforts under CEO Brian Cornell were gaining traction.The U.S. retailer, whose shares rose as much as 4 percent to $76.95, also forecast a higher-than-expected adjusted profit for the full year.Same-store sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) missed market expectations last week, hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish apparel demand.Target's apparel sales rose in the fourth quarter, in contrast to weak sales at several retailers including Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N).Cornell, Target's chief executive since August 2014, has been aggressively trying to turnaround the company after several years of sluggish growth.Some of his efforts include promoting and investing in a narrower set of higher-margin ""signature"" categories such as baby and health and wellness, and pulling out of Canada. Comparable sales in higher-margin categories rose by more than three times the company average in the quarter ended Jan. 30, Target said, with  women's apparel, wearable electronics and food being the fastest growing.""Signs that CEO Cornell's strategic initiatives are gaining traction include: 'signature' categories re-accelerating to about 6 percent growth and traffic rising 1.3 percent,"" Sterne Agee analyst Renato Basanta said.Apparel sales were helped by better in-store and online presentation and the stocking of trendier styles, Target finance chief Cathy Smith said on a media call. ""We believe that Target performed somewhat above the market (in apparel) thanks to its more fashion-savvy shopper demographic and its strong marketing efforts around holiday looks,"" Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note.Concerns about a slowdown in Target's digital sales were also alleviated by its 34 percent growth in the quarter, Sterne Agee's Basanta said, terming it ""solid progress for Target's still nascent platform.""The concerns stem from Target's warning in November that it would miss its target of growing online sales by 40 percent in 2015 due to slowing electronic sales. Sales at Target stores open at least 13 months increased 1.9 percent in the quarter, beating the 1.5 percent rise analysts had expected.Excluding items, Target earned $1.52 per share, missing the average estimate by 2 cents, due to promotions.Total sales fell 0.6 percent to $21.63 billion, mainly due to the sale of its pharmacy business to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N).

Comparable sales in higher-margin categories rose by more than three times the company average in the quarter ended Jan. 30, Target said, with  women's apparel, wearable electronics and food being the fastest growing.""Signs that CEO Cornell's strategic initiatives are gaining traction include: 'signature' categories re-accelerating to about 6 percent growth and traffic rising 1.3 percent,"" Sterne Agee analyst Renato Basanta said.Apparel sales were helped by better in-store and online presentation and the stocking of trendier styles, Target finance chief Cathy Smith said on a media call. ""We believe that Target performed somewhat above the market (in apparel) thanks to its more fashion-savvy shopper demographic and its strong marketing efforts around holiday looks,"" Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note.Concerns about a slowdown in Target's digital sales were also alleviated by its 34 percent growth in the quarter, Sterne Agee's Basanta said, terming it ""solid progress for Target's still nascent platform.""The concerns stem from Target's warning in November that it would miss its target of growing online sales by 40 percent in 2015 due to slowing electronic sales. Sales at Target stores open at least 13 months increased 1.9 percent in the quarter, beating the 1.5 percent rise analysts had expected.Excluding items, Target earned $1.52 per share, missing the average estimate by 2 cents, due to promotions.Total sales fell 0.6 percent to $21.63 billion, mainly due to the sale of its pharmacy business to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N). Analysts had expected sales to remain flat.

He has pushed to revamp the retailer's grocery business with newer offerings, driven online growth and overhauled Target's archaic and complicated supply chain. He has also outlined cost savings plans, cut thousands of jobs and pulled out of Canada.His efforts have slowly started to pay off. Target's stock shortages were 40 percent lower during the holiday season compared to last year, the company reported a better-than-expected comparable sales growth and a 34 percent increase in online sales growth. This year, Target will focus on improving sales online and on mobile, localize assortment in stores and open more smaller-format stores in urban markets, Cornell said.

Bloomberg first reported the news on Wednesday, which a McKesson spokesman later confirmed to Reuters. (bloom.bg/1R4mk3q)The company said it started informing workers about the lay-offs in mid-March. McKesson also said it was offering severance benefits and outplacement services for impacted employees. The company, which distributes drugs to retailers such as CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), said in January its fiscal 2017 earnings would likely be hit by weak generic drug pricing. McKesson also expects to be weighed down by an expiration of its contract with pharmacy benefit manager Optum and changes in contracts with Omnicare and Target Corp (TGT.N).It has focused on inking deals to spur growth. McKesson said it would buy Canadian drugstore chain Rexall Health for C$3 billion ($2.23 billion) in March and said it was buying two privately held cancer care service providers for a total of $1.2 billion in February. As of March 2015, the company employed about 70,400 full-time workers, according to a regulatory filing.

(bit.ly/1UL793S)Valdez spent 16 years at Amazon as a senior executive in the Seattle-based retailer's operations department overseeing the company's international supply chain expansion. Target and other major brick and mortar retailers are aggressively investing in their ecommerce businesses as they try to catch up with Amazon, which revolutionized online retail through aggressive pricing and speedy delivery.In announcing his hiring in February, Target touted Valdez' experience, calling him a ""seasoned supply chain leader"" who was focused on Amazon's international supply chain expansion.The lawsuit said his new role as the chief supply chain and logistics officer at Target would breach Valdez' noncompete agreement with Amazon, which required him to not engage in competition with Amazon for 18 months after leaving the company. Amazon claims that Valdez was privy to confidential information in a highly competitive area for both companies - moving and shipping goods in the most effective manner.In its suit, Amazon said the agreement it signed with Valdez prevents him from disclosing confidential information on Amazon's future plans.

395,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Target Corp (TGT.N) has been accused in a lawsuit of failing to pay overtime to workers with low-level management responsibilities at its warehouses in New York state.    The lawsuit, which seeks class action status, accuses the retailer of violating state labor law by misclassifying ""operations group leaders"" as exempt from overtime requirements and not paying them for all hours worked.    Target was sued six months after the Obama administration proposed making nearly 5 million more U.S. workers eligible for overtime pay.    That proposal, which is being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, is widely expected to narrow an exemption for white-collar workers from overtime pay protections based on the percentage of time they spend on management tasks.     Target ""controls very carefully what the group leaders do such that they are not left with meaningful executive authority that would satisfy exemption under the law,"" Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer for the named plaintiff, Robert LaPointe Jr, told Reuters.    Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said Target's distribution center group leaders are properly classified as exempt, salaried team members and said these department leaders hire, manage and lead teams of up to 50 people. ""They are competitively compensated and rewarded for their performance. We dispute the allegations in the suit,"" she said.    Sagafi said the lawsuit may expand to cover Target’s activity in other states.    He did not say how many potential plaintiffs might be covered, but the complaint said more than 40 group leaders in New York state might be covered.

398,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK For much of the last three years, investors have been willing to pay more for expected profit at Walgreens than for competitor CVS, but the pharmacy chain may be losing that edge on Wall Street.Analysts are now putting much more favorable ratings on CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), and CVS shares are outrunning Walgreens so far this year and closing the valuation gap.When Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) reports fiscal second-quarter results on Tuesday, it could win converts. The company is expected to report earnings of $1.28 per share, up 8 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken rates both stocks as ""buys,"" but said that most investors choose between the companies, with Walgreens now representing a higher-risk, higher-reward play, and CVS the lower-risk stock as Walgreens undergoes changes under a new CEO. Perhaps reflecting the view that CVS is a safer bet, a greater portion of analysts are recommending its shares, with 85 percent placing ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings on the stock against 58 percent for Walgreen, according to Thomson Reuters data. Walgreens shares are trading at 18 times forward earnings estimates compared with 17.4 times for CVS. But that gap has been wider for most of the past year. ACQUISITION PRESCRIPTION With a market cap of about $93 billion, Walgreens has established itself as a massive international retailer and distributor after completing the acquisition of Europe's Alliance Boots more than a year ago. That company's former executive chairman, Stefano Pessina, was named to head Walgreens on a permanent basis last July. Well-regarded by investors, Pessina has been leading changes that include significant cost cutting, according to analysts. Meanwhile, uncertainty clouds Walgreens' latest big deal - its proposed $9.4 billion acquisition of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), which would expand its U.S. drugstore footprint but faces antitrust scrutiny.Seattle-based Smead Capital Management holds more than 860,000 Walgreens shares and views the company as a ""best in class player"" in operating pharmacy outlets and convenience stores, said Tony Scherrer, Smead's director of research.CVS has also been on the acquisition path, with recent deals for pharmacy services provider Omnicare and Target Corp's (TGT.N) fleet of pharmacies. CVS, with a market cap of about $115 billion, is one of the biggest U.S. managers of prescription benefits - a business in which Walgreens lacks a comparable big presence - in addition to being the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain by sales behind Walgreens, according to Euromonitor. That pharmacy benefits business, which has been increasing revenue at a faster pace than the pharmacy side, gives CVS an edge, said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds in Rye, New York, who prefers CVS shares to Walgreens. CVS should also merit a higher stock market value, he said, because deals in the pharmacy benefits, or PBM, industry have been struck at higher premiums than for drug-store mergers.""I just think with the PBM in particular, (CVS is) going to have a much better growth rate in both revenue and earnings,"" Jonas said.

399,"  SYDNEY, April 8 The managing director of Wesfarmers Ltd's Target department stores, Stuart Machin, resigned on Friday amid an investigation into whether the retailer inflated earnings by bringing forward supplier rebates.Machin denied involvement in the scheme to boost Target's first-half profit by seeking extra rebates from some 30  suppliers in return for promises of price rises in the second half. However, he said it was time to go.""Latterly, I have been dismayed to learn of the accounting issues at the half year,"" Machin said in a statement released by Wesfarmers.""I was not aware of these, but they happened on my watch and as managing director I accept my share of the responsibility,"" he said. ""The right thing is now for me to move on"". In December, Wesfarmers announced Machin was shifting from his position as Target's managing director to a yet-to-be-identified senior executive role in July. A Wesfarmers spokeswoman would not comment on earlier press reports that the rebates helped boost Target's first-half earnings by around 25 percent.The retailer's fiscal 2016 first-half earnings before interest and tax rose 5.7 percent to A$74 million ($55.84 million). Wesfarmers has accepted Machin's resignation which comes as an internal investigation into the rebates nears completion, according to the spokeswoman.The Australian Target chain is not affiliated with the U.S. group of stores of the same name.

401,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Discount retailer Target Corp  has started raising employee wages to a minimum of $10 an hour, its second hike in a year, pressured by a competitive job market and labor groups calling for higher wages at retail chains, sources said.Target management has informed store managers, who in turn have started informing employees about the wage hike and most employees who earn less than $10 per hour should see their base pay go up in May, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.The $1-per-hour raise marks the second time Target has followed Wal-Mart Stores Inc in raising base wages. It also comes as a union-led push for a $15 minimum wage, the so-called ""Fight for Fifteen"" movement, is gaining traction in cities across the country and even has become a topic in the U.S. presidential campaign, with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a $15 ""living wage.""Target's decision reflects growing competition for workers in an increasingly strong labor market. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits has fallen to its lowest point in 42-1/2-years, and the jobless rate is only 5.0 percent.Target last raised its minimum pay rate in April 2015 to $9 an hour, up from the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour at the time. The move last April matched a similar announcement by Wal-Mart. The world's largest retailer in February 2015 said it will lift its base pay to $10 an hour in 2016, a step it has implemented in recent weeks.Target's plan will also raise pay for employees who already make over $10 an hour. Such workers will be entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike, which is related to experience and position of the employee, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media.Target declined to confirm it is offering the pay increase.

402,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Discount retailer Target Corp has started raising employee wages to a minimum of $10 an hour, its second hike in a year, pressured by a competitive job market and labor groups calling for higher wages at retail chains, sources said.    Target management has informed store managers, who in turn have started informing employees about the wage hike and most employees who earn less than $10 per hour should see their base pay go up in May, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters. The $1-per-hour raise marks the second time Target has followed Wal-Mart Stores Inc in raising base wages. It also comes as a union-led push for a $15 minimum wage, the so-called “Fight for Fifteen” movement, is gaining traction in cities across the country and even has become a topic in the U.S. presidential campaign, with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders calling for a $15 “living wage.” Target's decision reflects growing competition for workers in an increasingly strong labor market. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits has fallen to its lowest point in 42-1/2-years, and the jobless rate is only 5.0 percent. Target last raised its minimum pay rate in April 2015 to $9 an hour, up from the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour at the time. The move last April matched a similar announcement by Wal-Mart. The world's largest retailer in February 2015 said it will lift its base pay to $10 an hour in 2016, a step it has implemented in recent weeks.  Target's plan will also raise pay for employees who already make over $10 an hour. Such workers will be entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike, which is related to experience and position of the employee, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media.Target declined to confirm it is offering the pay increase. ""We pay market competitive rates and regularly benchmark the marketplace to ensure that our compensation and benefits packages will help us to both recruit and retain great talent, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said.

405,"   By Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Discount retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) is cracking down on suppliers as part of a multi-billion dollar overhaul to speed up its supply chain and better compete with rivals including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). The sixth-largest U.S. retailer by sales plans to tighten deadlines for deliveries to its warehouses, hike fines for late deliveries, and could institute penalties of up to $10,000 for inaccuracies in product information, according to a letter sent to suppliers and obtained by Reuters and an interview with Target's chief operating officer John Mulligan.The moves, effective May 30, are the first major steps Target has taken since Mulligan was appointed as COO late in 2015 to fix supply problems that emerged after it expanded product offerings, including fresh food, several years ago. A tighter grip on its deliveries is seen as crucial to keeping shelves stocked, maximizing sales and controlling costs. Target has already announced an investment of over $5 billion in supply chain and technology infrastructure between 2015-2017.Mulligan told Reuters in an interview on Monday that the company aims to include suppliers in the effort.""These steps are a key part of becoming more reliable,"" Mulligan said. The new rules and penalties are detailed in a letter sent to suppliers. They will start to take effect at the end of the month and will be rolled out over the next 60-90 days.In the letter, Target said the goal was to keep products stocked to ""lower missed sales for all of us.""Mulligan and Chief Executive Brian Cornell met over 200 suppliers recently to talk through the changes. He described the discussion as productive.  ""We had a very long question-and-answer session,"" Mulligan said. ""Obviously there were concerns, so we listened to those and we feel very good with where we are going with our vendor partners.""Next on his list for improvements is Target's international supply chain, and he has already started holding talks with vendors who import products to the Unites States, Mulligan said.Target is not the first large retailer to focus on supply chain precision.     At an annual vendor conference in February, Wal-Mart informed suppliers that it was raising its standard for on-time delivery to 95 percent from 90 percent, according to a Wal-Mart presentation slide posted on a Facebook group and confirmed by several suppliers.    Wal-Mart is also cutting the window for deliveries to within 1 to 2 days of a target date, depending on the product category, from 1 to 4 days previously, the Wal-Mart slide showed. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the changes.   NEW RULES  Target's supply chain became more complex several years ago when it expanded its offering of perishable goods such as meat, fresh produce and dairy products.Further complications came when the retailer started catering to online shoppers by shipping orders directly from warehouses and also allowing them to pick up online orders in stores.Amy Koo, principal analyst with Kantar Retail said the new changes mean Target can hold less inventory, which is key to being an efficient retailer. ""In theory, everything can move faster, and they will have less stuff in the system."" Target's stores nationwide in 2015 had 8 to 9 billion items on store floors, in transit or in warehouses at any given point.The new rules, detailed in the letter, call for domestic suppliers to give a single-day arrival date for shipments to Target's warehouses. Domestic suppliers constitute the majority of Target's vendor base.  These suppliers will no longer have a ""grace period"" to ship a few days after the promised date without penalties, the letter says. Suppliers said the current grace period for shipments is two to 12 days depending on product category.A packaged foods supplier who ships products to Target's warehouses said the cost of narrowing the delivery window to a single day will be ""entirely ours, and they won't share any of that.""Target will also hike fines on late shipments to 5 percent of the order cost, according to the letter, which adds that the retailer is considering ""escalating charges of $5,000-$10,000"" for suppliers who fail to provide complete and accurate product information.Currently, late fines range between 1-3 percent depending on the product, according to suppliers.Mulligan said Target will be flexible with suppliers during an adjustment period.The retailer, which operates 1,800 stores and 40 U.S. warehouses, will roll out the proposed changes over the summer, the letter says.Household, paper, pet products and center-store grocery suppliers have to comply with the rules in June; health and beauty vendors in July and divisions including apparel, home and electronics in August.

414,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO A pile-up of unsold inventory across U.S. retail chains is likely to squeeze profits further as stores struggle to make up for a weak first quarter marred by weak sales and share declines.Moving the stale stock of mostly clothes, accessories and electronics is likely to lead to bigger discounts and steeper markdowns, which in turn would reduce chances for a swift profit rebound.    Tepid consumer demand for small discretionary purchases is likely to compound the problem, analysts said.     Disappointing sales by some of the biggest retailers including Target Corp (TGT.N), Macy's Inc (M.N), JC Penney (JCP.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) are likely to lead to even more promotions and discounts to woo customersTarget's shares fell to a 52-week low on Wednesday after its sales missed estimates.Macy's stock fell as much as 15 percent on Wednesday after it reported a drop in sales and cut guidance.     Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell, speaking after the company released its earnings, cautioned investors about the impact of the stock build-up.""Many of our competitors are sitting on meaningful excess inventory, which we expect will extend the very intense promotional environment into the months ahead,"" he said.    According to a report by analytics firm Dynamic Action, retailers sold 4 percent fewer items at full price in the first quarter than a year ago, while the percentage of promotional products ordered online jumped 63 percent.Such orders reached a record high in March, when they soared 86 percent from a year ago, the report said.  The jostling to sell excess inventory over the next three months could hit sales growth, said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with financial services firm Edward Jones.     ""Right now retailers have started cutting back on deliveries for the third and fourth quarter,"" he said, referring to new inventory orders. That could leave them understocked for the end of the year, when most retailers make as much as 40 percent of their annual sales, he said.    Some retailers might be able to avoid slashing prices.The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), bucked the trend and posted surprisingly higher sales on Thursday as lower-income consumers spent more. That should mean Wal-Mart sold much of the stock earmarked for the quarter, easing the pressure to offer steep promotions and discounts, analysts said. Other bright spots included home improvement chains like Home Depot (HD.N) and Lowe's Companies Inc (LOW.N), which have benefited from a housing recovery; and off-price apparel retailers like TJX Cos (TJX.N), which offer low-priced branded apparel and accessories.""Real disposable income growth has remained weak and that has contributed to the growth and outperformance of off-price chains and the continued slowdown for department stores,"" said Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners.Off-price chains such as Ross Stores Inc (ROST.O) and Burlington Coat Factory had been a negligible force in the industry until a few years ago. But as consumers try to get more bang for their buck, chains that offer quality branded goods at lower prices have become increasingly popular.

Comparable sales at U.S stores had last fallen in 2009.Analysts earlier this month said a pullback in spending by high-income consumers, who make up Costco's core customer base, contributed to lower comparable sales in April, when the company posted flat growth.Unseasonably cold weather in April, transition issues arising from the company switching to Visa Inc (V.N) for its co-branded credit cards from American Express Co (AXP.N) may have also weighed on comparable sales during the third quarter ended May 8.While retailers such as Macy's Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported weak quarterly sales, citing unseasonable weather and lower demand for apparel and electronics, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which largely caters to lower-income customers, reported better-than-expected sales, helped by demand for basic apparel and higher drug prices.  The quarterly results from retailers suggest that lower-income customers are spending while middle and higher-income customers are holding back. Comparable store sales were flat in the third quarter, lower than the 1 percent rise analysts were expecting. Excluding the impact of fuel and currency fluctuations, sales at comparable stores rose 3 percent, below the average analyst estimate of 4.6 percent growth.Net income attributable to Costco rose to $545 million, or $1.24 per share, in the third quarter ended May 8 from $516 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.

417,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S retailer Target Corp (TGT.N) is asking many suppliers to take on up to an extra 3-5 percent of the cost of promotions and price cuts after slow sales so far this year.Retailers often use price discounts combined with promotions - such as two-for-one offers - to sell slow-moving items and make room for newer products.Suppliers also have their own offers and advertising, and usually negotiate with retailers on how the cost of these promotional budgets will be split.    A dozen suppliers confirmed to Reuters in May that Target has demanded they take on more of the costs of marketing and selling slow-moving items, from candy to electronics.The size of these costs varies on a case-by-case basis, they said, and are confidential. In total, during the year ending Jan. 30, 2016, suppliers gave Target $379 million to fund such marketing costs, according to its latest annual report.Minneapolis-based Target, the second-largest discount retailer in the United States, wants to minimize the impact of markdowns on profit in a tough year as middle income customers make fewer discretionary purchases.    In May, Target reported a drop in sales for the quarter ended April 30, and Chief Executive Brian Cornell predicted an extended period of promotions ahead for the retailer and rivals.Most suppliers who spoke to Reuters said they will have to comply or at least deliver part of Target's demands so old stock can make way for new season products. That will strain already thin margins.""Target is not leaving a lot of room for negotiation here,"" said one supplier, who asked to remain anonymous. ""They want to get this unsold stock out of their stores in the next three months.""  Target spokeswoman Katie Boylan declined to comment on whether it has begun to demand suppliers pay more for marketing. She said Target regularly works with vendors to build promotional plans that drive sales.Target's bigger competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), had a better start to the year as its lower-income consumer base continued to spend. It is asking suppliers simply to give it lower prices, according to its suppliers. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to comment.It is not clear whether other retailers will follow Target's move. Four retailers including Macy's Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), Gap Inc (GPS.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) declined to comment.Burt Flickinger, managing director of consultancy Strategic Resources Group, suggested any retailer looking to recover from a slow start this year ""would be considering pushing their suppliers for more discounts, if they haven't started doing that already.""

That goes up to 20-30 percent for products like apparel, accessories and furniture, Flickinger said.Target's suppliers reduced spending last year on promotions and price cuts - known as vendor income receivables - by 11 percent from $426 million at the end of Jan. 31, 2015, according to the company's annual report.

The new malware was used to target a point-of-sales system that was earlier believed to be unaffected.The company said the new variant of the malware had been disabled in cases where it was detected. Wendy's expects the number of franchise restaurants that will be impacted by the cybersecurity attacks is now ""considerably higher"" than the 300 restaurants already affected.""To date, there has been no indication in the ongoing investigation that any company-operated restaurants were impacted by this activity,"" Wendy's said on Thursday.

422,"  An Amazon.com Inc shopping event that the online retailer billed as its largest ever had a bumpy start on Tuesday, with some customers unable to add discounted items to their shopping carts and rival retailers aiming for a cut of the buying frenzy.The glitch, which affected Amazon's U.S. and UK websites, sparked outrage on social media with the hashtags #PrimeDay and #PrimeDayFail trending in the United States.Amazon said it resolved the issue, in which users faced problems adding some ""Lightning Deals"" products to their carts.""#PrimeDay is giving me nothing but add-to-cart fails. Nice job @amazon. Another #PrimeDayFail,"" Twitter user Prero Design (@PreroDesign) said in a post. The snag was a blow to a company that takes pride in its stable technology infrastructure. BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said the glitch potentially indicated a flood of demand for products on Amazon. The one-day sale for members of Amazon's $99-per-year Prime subscription service had been expected to generate up to $1 billion in sales, more than double the $400 million in extra sales made during last year's inaugural Prime Day, according to Citi analysts.But by mid-day Tuesday, U.S. sales remained in line with Amazon's 2015 Prime Day, according to a report from e-commerce software company ChannelAdvisor. Sales for the United Kingdom were up 11 percent from last year as of 12 p.m. EDT.Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, said the UK results ""could be indicative of where we end up,"" with more deals for U.S. customers scheduled to launch this afternoon. Still, the results are expected to pale in comparison with the more than $14 billion of total value of goods transacted during Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Singles' Day shopping festival in China in November.Amazon.com Inc shares were down 0.7 percent at the close of trading, while broad stock market indices were up 0.7 percent. Amazon devices such as the Echo voice-enabled speaker, Fire TV and Fire tablet were available at big discounts as were a host of other products from high-end televisions to shoes and toys.Several other U.S. retailers appeared to attempt cashing in on the hype surrounding Amazon's Prime Day event, by offering their own online midsummer promotions.Wal-Mart Stores Inc launched free shipping with no minimum order threshold on all items, touting products ""at or lower than Amazon's prices."" Gap Inc, Macy's Inc, Target Corp and others marketed midsummer sales as well.

423,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon's long shadow is falling on retailers previously thought immune to the threat of e-commerce, forcing U.S. fund managers to rethink their approach to consumer stocks by focusing on companies whose businesses cannot be upended by the online giant.At the core of the problem: Amazon.com Inc, once thought of as a place to buy books and household goods, is on track to become the largest apparel retailer in the United States by 2017, according to estimates from Cowen and Co, displacing department store operator Macy's Inc. Amazon's push into higher-end clothing over the last three years only adds to its dominance in e-commerce overall, with a nearly 40 percent market share, one that is larger than the next 21 retailers combined - a group that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Best Buy Co Inc, according to research firm Slice Intelligence. Amazon shares hit a record high on Monday, day ahead of its Prime Day sales event. By market value, the company surpassed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ""Retail is a landmine and you just don’t know who is going to be disrupted by Amazon. You are seeing money rotate into names where people feel comfortable with companies that won’t be Amazon'ed away,” said Scott Moore, a portfolio manager at Buffalo Funds.  More has shifted his portfolio from traditional department stores and into companies such as Home Depot Inc, whose bulky, heavy items are hard to ship profitably, he said. Overall, actively managed large-cap funds now hold more restaurant, home improvement, and leisure stocks - all sectors in which Amazon does not yet compete -  than at any other time in the last five years, according to Morningstar data, while they have steadily cut holdings of apparel and department stores over the same period. The number of large-cap funds that own shares of Amazon, meanwhile, has risen 15 percent over the last three years.  Susan Bao, a co-portfolio manager of the $9.9 billion JP Morgan Large-Cap Core fund, said she no longer holds traditional retailers such as Macy's or Target Corp, and does not expect to do so again. Instead, she is focusing on companies such as cruise-ship operator Carnival Corp, which should benefit from an improving jobs market. ""This is one of companies that's going to do better when the consumer is in better shape that's also Amazon-proof,"" she said. Shares of Carnival are down 13.8 percent year to date, in part because of fears of the Zika virus, while Amazon's stock is up 10.8 percent over the same time.  Fund managers who are bullish on department stores say that Amazon will likely continue to dominate the retail industry even as Macy's and others expand their online businesses. Lawrence Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said that he expects Sears Holding Corp to fold ""within the next calendar year,"" sending more shoppers to rivals such as JC Penney Company Inc at a time when the company is in the middle of a corporate turnaround that has helped it produce solid same-store sales growth.

426,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON A widening criminal probe casts new light on a bitter defeat hedge fund activist Bill Ackman suffered in his 2009 bid for board seats at U.S. retailer Target Corp.    Target for years has paid proxy solicitor Georgeson LLC to track the votes of its top investors. This week, five current and former Georgeson employees were charged with fraud for using bribes to get advance voting information on proxy battles.    The same tactics cited in the criminal complaint were used to help Target defeat Ackman in 2009, according to a former Georgeson employee turned whistleblower. Ackman, who runs hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, failed in the high-stakes battle to install his own slate of directors at Target and change its business direction.    ""We knew long in advance who was winning"" the Target proxy battle, Carl Clark, the whistleblower, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. He said he was fired by Georgeson in 2012 and that he flagged to authorities that bribes were being used to gain advance access on how investors were voting. The details were similar to those in the charges filed this week.Georgeson has not been charged and said in a statement on Tuesday that it was cooperating with the investigation. A spokeswoman, Rachel Hamilton-Wilkes, declined to discuss details of the case.    Pershing Square executives declined to comment, spokesman Eric Kuo said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department, Christina DiIorio-Sterling, which filed the charges, declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.Proxy solicitors like Georgeson have become more prominent with the rise of activist investors. They help companies assess whether shareholders will vote for or against management recommendations, including who should sit on the board.Advance notice of likely proxy voting patterns would give Target extra time to identify holdouts and change investors' minds. Information filed in U.S. District Court in Boston by prosecutors suggests that Target and many other companies benefited from an inside line Georgeson had at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which helps big investors cast their votes.Target has not been accused of being aware of the behavior outlined in the criminal complaint. Target, which declined to comment, continued to use Georgeson for proxy solicitation services at least through this spring, according to disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Brian Bennett, while working at ISS, tapped into the company's computer system to see how votes were being cast on behalf of big institutional investors that include mutual funds, according to U.S. prosecutors. They said he did this in exchange for tickets to sporting events provided by Georgeson employees. One bribe included two tickets worth more than $1,400 to a Boston Celtics basketball game, according to a criminal complaint.    Bennett pleaded guilty to fraud charges last year and awaits sentencing in U.S. District Court in Boston. His attorney on Friday declined to comment at a status conference held on his case.   Georgeson's Australian corporate parent, Computershare Ltd, hailed its work for Target in its 2009 annual report.     ""In one of the biggest proxy solicitations of the year, Georgeson represented Target Corporation in its successful proxy fight with a high profile activist investor."" Polling investors is hard work that involves a lot of cold calls to people who do not want to be harassed, according to this week's complaint.    ""(Eighty percent) of clients do not divulge,"" one of the former Georgeson employees, Michael Sedlak, told Bennett, according to the filing. ""They just say they voted.""An attorney for Sedlak did not return messages seeking comment.In 2013, Bennett's former company, ISS, paid $300,000 to settle SEC charges it failed to safeguard client voting data. The SEC said its investigation found that information on more than 100 shareholder advisory clients had been shared.All of Target's four board nominees were re-elected with more than 70 percent of votes cast, while none of Ackman's nominees got more than 22 percent of votes cast, Target has said.    The case is unsettling, said one institutional investor who had backed one of Ackman's nominees in the 2009 vote, because companies already have a lot of influence over shareholder elections. In theory, inside information such as what the Georgeson team was getting could make a difference in close contests.    ""It's a fairness issue,"" said the money manager, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the 2009 vote.

428,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON, July 15  BOSTON, July 15 A widening criminal probe casts new light on a bitter defeat hedge fund activist Bill Ackman suffered in his 2009 bid for board seats at U.S. retailer Target Corp.Target for years has paid proxy solicitor Georgeson LLC to track the votes of its top investors. This week, five current and former Georgeson employees were charged with fraud for using bribes to get advance voting information on proxy battles.The same tactics cited in the criminal complaint were used to help Target defeat Ackman in 2009, according to a former Georgeson employee turned whistleblower.

430,"   By Nandita Bose and Siddharth Cavale  Target Corp reported a drop in demand for Apple Inc's products that hurt the retail chain's electronics sales in the second quarter, but said it is working with the iPhone maker to capitalize on new product launches during the second half.Earlier on Wednesday, Target cut its fiscal-year profit outlook after quarterly sales fell more than expected due to lower demand for electronics and a weak start to a revamp of its grocery business.The company's shares closed down 6.4 percent at $70.63 after falling as much as 7.4 percent.Chief Executive Brian Cornell said customer visits declined across product categories during the quarter but electronics sales fell by a double-digit percentage rate and accounted for about two-thirds of the overall decline in sales at stores open at least a year. About a third of the decrease in electronics sales stemmed from reduced demand for Apple products, which were down more than 20 percent. In April, Apple reported its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years due to a saturated market for smartphones.Cornell said one of the first tasks for newly appointed Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton is to spend time with Apple to make sure ""we're putting the right plans together for the back half of the year, that we're ready to capitalize on their new innovation that they will be bringing to the market.""Apple's long-awaited iPhone 7 is expected to be launched next month and retailers hope it will create enthusiasm among consumers and boost phone sales. For the past several quarters Best Buy Inc, the largest electronics retailer in the United States, has complained about the lack of innovative new products to excite consumers. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN Target's sales declined from the previous quarter as well as from a year earlier, indicating a ""significant slowdown in trade,"" said Neil Saunders, chief executive officer of research firm Conlumino. Sales at stores open at least one year fell 1.1 percent in the second quarter ended on July 30, which Saunders said was the first decline in two years. Target said it expected same-store sales to be flat to down 2 percent in the second half of the year. The company's sales have suffered as shoppers increasingly use online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc and focus their spending on big-ticket items like cars and home renovations rather than small discretionary purchases.The company lowered its full-year profit forecast to between $4.80 and $5.20 per share from a prior range of $5.20 to $5.40. Target, which has been reorganizing its grocery business by adding more organic and fresh food, said those early efforts were disappointing. The business had a ""small"" decline in comparable sales and was pressured by price deflation for meat, milk and other food items.The company gained market share in the apparel and home improvement categories, Cornell said.Net income attributable to the company fell nearly 10 percent to $680 million in the second quarter.

The New York City-based company said it expects fiscal 2017 adjusted profit to be between $3.38 and $3.44 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $3.53 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""We believe risk of other economic and political disruptions will remain high as we start our new fiscal year,"" CFO Tracey Travis said on an earnings call. Rival L'Oreal SA (OREP.PA) earlier reported second-quarter sales growth marginally below forecast as it said Western Europe was being held back due to a ""very difficult market in France"". Estee Lauder said it expects ""especially strong external headwinds"" in the current quarter. Sales are expected to be in the range of $2.86 billion-$2.89 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $2.94 billion.The company also reported a smaller-than-expected rise in quarterly sales, hurt by lower tourist spending due to the strong dollar and a dip in customer visits at stores such as Macy's Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), where it sells high-end beauty products.Macy's and Target also cited lower traffic for the drop in sales in their latest quarter.

440,"   By Nandita Bose and Subrat Patnaik  Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) shares rose 19 percent on Tuesday after the retailer reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by stronger online sales and a housing recovery that sparked demand for items like televisions and refrigerators.The largest U.S. electronics retailer also raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook and reported a surprise increase in sales at stores open at least a year.The results bucked a string of weak performances in the electronics category by competitors like Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and reflected Best Buy's resilience against larger online rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).Best Buy reported a nearly 24 percent increase in online sales, whose share of domestic revenue has risen to 10.6 percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier. It said it benefited from faster shipping and improvements in the checkout process and search functionality.""Given the heavily promotional July environment due to Amazon's Prime Day and Walmart's steady diet of competing offers, Best Buy's online results stand out,"" Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said. He estimated the company's online business at about $5 billion. Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said that along with e-commerce investments, the retailer is focusing on improving employee retention and training ""with a heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills."" During the second quarter ended on July 30, demand at Best Buy increased for items like home theaters and large appliances, categories where Target and Wal-Mart typically do not have a significant market share, according to analysts. Sales declined for mobile phones and gaming, where those rivals have a sizeable presence.Mobile phone sales have fallen industrywide due to a dearth of new products. Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said he expected demand to increase this quarter and next as scheduled product introductions draw consumers. Apple Inc's APPL.O long-awaited iPhone 7 is set for availability next month. Last week, Target blamed its poor performance in part on lower sales of electronics due to a drop in demand for Apple products.Excluding special items, Best Buy's second-quarter earnings of 57 cents per share beat the analysts' average forecast of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose slightly to $8.53 billion from a year earlier, snapping a three-quarter streak of declines and exceeding analysts' estimates of $8.40 billion.  Sales at established stores increased 0.8 percent. Analysts had expected a 0.60 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Best Buy said it expected low-single-digit percentage growth in fiscal-year operating income, compared with a previous forecast of ""approximately flat"" results.The company gave a third-quarter profit and revenue outlook roughly in line with analysts' estimates.

441,"   By Heather Somerville and Subrat Patnaik  Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] has plucked a top executive from U.S. retailer Target to help lead the growing ride-services company and reshape its image.Uber said on Tuesday it hired Jeff Jones, chief marketing officer for Target Corp, to oversee the bulk of its global operations. Jones will be president of ride-sharing at Uber, running local Uber services in every city, as well as marketing efforts and customer support.The hire underscores efforts by Uber, which has become the dominant on-demand ride service, to bolster its reputation and brand. Since 2009, the company has aggressively expanded to more than 450 cities, at times steamrolling regulators and launching campaigns against local lawmakers.Jones joined Target in 2012 to rejuvenate its brand and is credited with modernizing the retailer's marketing efforts.

442,"   By Heather Somerville and Subrat Patnaik  Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] has plucked a top executive from U.S. retailer Target to help lead the growing ride-services company and reshape its image.Uber said on Tuesday it hired Jeff Jones, chief marketing officer for Target Corp, to oversee the bulk of its global operations. Jones will be president of ride-sharing at Uber, running local Uber services in every city, as well as marketing efforts and customer support.The hire underscores efforts by Uber, which has become the dominant on-demand ride service, to bolster its reputation and brand. Since 2009, the company has aggressively expanded to more than 450 cities, at times steamrolling regulators and launching campaigns against local lawmakers.Jones joined Target in 2012 to rejuvenate its brand and is credited with modernizing the retailer's marketing efforts.

451,"   By Dustin Volz  Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) said on Thursday that at least 500 million of its accounts were hacked in 2014 by what it believed was a state-sponsored actor, a theft that appeared to be the world's biggest known cyber breach by far.Cyber thieves may have stolen names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, the company said. But unprotected passwords, payment card data and bank account information did not appear to have been compromised, signaling that some of the most valuable user data was not taken.The attack on Yahoo was unprecedented in size, more than triple other large attacks on sites such as eBay Inc (EBAY.O), and it comes to light at a difficult time for Yahoo.Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is under pressure to shore up the flagging fortunes of the site founded in 1994, and the company in July agreed to a $4.83 billion cash sale of its internet business to Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N). ""This is the biggest data breach ever,"" said well-known cryptologist Bruce Schneier, adding that the impact on Yahoo and its users remained unclear because many questions remain, including the identity of the state-sponsored hackers behind it.On its website on Thursday, Yahoo encouraged users to change their passwords but did not require it.Although the attack happened in 2014, Yahoo only discovered  the incursion after August reports of a separate breach. While that report turned out to be false, Yahoo's investigation turned up the 2014 theft, according to a person familiar with the matter.Analyst Robert Peck of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said the breach probably was not enough to prompt Verizon to abandon its deal with Yahoo, but it could call for a price decrease of $100 million to $200 million, depending on how many users leave Yahoo. Steven Caponi, an attorney at K&L Gates with a practice including merger litigation, said that Yahoo's breach could fall under the ""material adverse change"" clause common in mergers allowing a buyer to walk away if its target's value deteriorates.  ""That would give Verizon the opportunity to renegotiate the terms or potentially walk away from the transaction if it is a material change. Whether it is a material change will depend in large part on what kind of information was compromised,"" Caponi said. Still, it is rare for mergers to fall apart over material changes. Verizon said in a statement it was made aware of the breach within the last two days and had limited information about the matter.""We will evaluate as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests,"" the company said.Shares of Yahoo stock closed a penny higher at $44.15, while shares of Verizon, were up about 1 percent. RISING ATTACKS The Yahoo breach follows a rising number of other large-scale data attacks and could make it a watershed event that prompts government and businesses to put more effort into bolstering defenses, said Dan Kaminsky, a well-known internet security expert.Retailers and health insurers have been especially hard hit after high-profile breaches at Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Premera Blue Cross. ""Five hundred of the Fortune 500 have been hacked,"" he said. ""If anything has changed, it's that these attacks are getting publicly disclosed.""Three U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to be identified by name, said they believed the attack was state-sponsored because of its resemblance to previous hacks traced to Russian intelligence agencies or hackers acting at their direction. Yahoo said it was working with law enforcement on the matter, and the FBI said it was investigating.""The investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo's network,"" the company said.While the breach comprised mostly low-value information, it did include security questions and answers created by users themselves. That data could make users vulnerable if they use the same answers on other sites. A former Yahoo employee said the Q&A were deliberately left unencrypted, which allowed Yahoo to catch fake accounts more easily because fake accounts tended to reuse questions and answers.News of the massive breach at one of the nation's largest email providers may fan concern that U.S. companies and government agencies are not doing enough to improve cyber security.     Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement he was ""most troubled by news that this breach occurred in 2014, and yet the public is only learning details of it today."" Technology website Recode first reported Tuesday that Yahoo planned to disclose details about a data breach affecting hundreds of millions of users.

454,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Monday said it stands behind John Stumpf, a member of its board and the chief executive of bank Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), despite growing concerns about his leadership during a customer service scandal.Pressure has mounted on Stumpf in recent days to resign as CEO of Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by deposits, after revelations the bank for years opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer approval to satisfy managers' demands for new business.    Lawmakers of both major U.S. political parties in Congress have excoriated Stumpf, accusing him of creating a culture in which such a practice could thrive.Earlier this month Stumpf resigned from an advisory role at the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Chevron executives had cited his experience and reputation as a major benefit to its shareholders when recommending him to the board. The company's board also noted his position at the Fed when it nominated him to the board.""John (Stumpf) is a valued member of our board,"" Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. ""Given the investigations that are underway, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.""     Stumpf joined the 10-person Chevron board in 2010, the same year he became chairman of the San Francisco-based bank and three years after he became its CEO. Both companies are headquartered in California's Bay Area and are roughly 35 miles (55 km) apart.  Stumpf also is a director at retailer Target Corp (TGT.N), which declined to comment on whether he will remain on its board.  At Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil and natural gas producer, Stumpf serves on board committees that oversee corporate governance and executive compensation.Chevron does not hold any meaningful stake in Wells Fargo.

456,"   By Steve Gorman | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Two of America's biggest commercial brands - discount retailer Target and fast-food chain McDonald's - have taken steps to tamp down hysteria stemming from a recent spate of creepy clown sightings in the run-up to Halloween at the end of this month.Target (TGT.N) decided last week to winnow down its assortment of clown masks and costumes available for sale in U.S. stores and online ""given the current environment,"" company spokesman Joshua Thomas said on Monday.Although Target received some isolated consumer comments about scary clown accessories, the decision to pull some masks from inventories stemmed from ""a conversation internally about how we can respond to the situation at hand,"" Thomas told Reuters.The clown-mask culling, limited to one in-store product item and about 10 different selections online, affected a ""very tiny"" portion of Target's overall Halloween merchandise, Thomas added. Target declined to specify exactly which products were pulled but said those kept in stock reflected a more traditional, less threatening image of happy, cheerful clowns.Similarly, McDonald's (MCD.N) and its franchise owners have cut back in the number of public appearances being made by performers dressed up as the chain's trademark hamburger-happy clown Ronald McDonald during the past two weeks, according to the company. The fast-food chain, in a statement, cited ""the current climate around clown sightings in communities"" for its decision.Reports of menacing individuals dressed as clowns or wearing clown masks began surfacing in late August around Greenville, South Carolina, and have since spread to several other states, perplexing police and unnerving parents across the country. Clowns have been reported spotted lurking near wooded areas or on dark roads, and even driving in cars, some brandishing knives or waving wads of money at children.

457,"   By Steve Gorman | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Two of America's biggest commercial brands - discount retailer Target and fast-food chain McDonald's - have taken steps to tamp down hysteria stemming from a recent spate of creepy clown sightings in the run-up to Halloween at the end of this month.Target (TGT.N) decided last week to winnow down its assortment of clown masks and costumes available for sale in U.S. stores and online ""given the current environment,"" company spokesman Joshua Thomas said on Monday.Although Target received some isolated consumer comments about scary clown accessories, the decision to pull some masks from inventories stemmed from ""a conversation internally about how we can respond to the situation at hand,"" Thomas told Reuters.The clown-mask culling, limited to one in-store product item and about 10 different selections online, affected a ""very tiny"" portion of Target's overall Halloween merchandise, Thomas added. Target declined to specify exactly which products were pulled but said those kept in stock reflected a more traditional, less threatening image of happy, cheerful clowns.Similarly, McDonald's (MCD.N) and its franchise owners have cut back in the number of public appearances being made by performers dressed up as the chain's trademark hamburger-happy clown Ronald McDonald during the past two weeks, according to the company. The fast-food chain, in a statement, cited ""the current climate around clown sightings in communities"" for its decision.Reports of menacing individuals dressed as clowns or wearing clown masks began surfacing in late August around Greenville, South Carolina, and have since spread to several other states, perplexing police and unnerving parents across the country. Clowns have been reported spotted lurking near wooded areas or on dark roads, and even driving in cars, some brandishing knives or waving wads of money at children. The phenomenon has created a stir on social media, with the hashtag #IfISeeAClown and @ClownSightings generating a large following on Twitter.

462,"   By Nandita Bose | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Target Corp (TGT.N) will offer more deal-driven promotions and extend its free shipping window to January this holiday season as it looks to turn around performance in what has so far been a lackluster year for the retailer.Target also expects consumer spending to remain robust in November and December despite uncertainty around the U.S. presidential elections. The holiday shopping season is an important time for retailers during which they earn an outsized portion of their annual profits and sales.""We are looking at very low unemployment, fuel prices remain  low, the commodity pressure on food is down,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters in a meeting on Tuesday. ""The overall approach for the consumer is going to be positive this season.""     Improving performance during the holiday months is crucial for Target. After a slow first half of the year, the retailer has warned of flat or slightly lower same-store sales for the second half of 2016, as shoppers turn to the internet and spend on big-ticket items like cars and home renovations, rather than small, discretionary purchases that make up the bulk of Target's offerings. The Minneapolis-based retailer said it will offer more deals this year under its program ""Ten Days of Deals.""Target will also extend its free shipping offer until Jan. 1 this year from Dec. 25 last year and drop shipping fees for all online orders for a third year in a row. The retailer currently requires a minimum online order of $25 to qualify for free shipping. Free shipping boosted Target's digital sales growth to over 30 percent during the fourth quarter last year and is a key strategy that allows it to better compete with rivals like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Target expects its ship-from-store program, which it has expanded to 1,000 stores from over 400 last year, to speed up delivery times. The retailer also said it would increase its holiday advertising budget for television, with a special focus on Spanish-language programs, as it looks to bring in more Hispanic shoppers, a traditionally strong consumer demographic for Target.It expects growth to be strong in the home decor, toy and apparel categories. Target will also focus on selling electronic items like the new Apple Watch. In August, the retailer said low demand for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) products hurt electronics sales during the second quarter and that it was working with the iPhone maker to capitalize on new product launches.

This is the third high-profile exit at Target in less than four months. In September, the Minneapolis-based retailer's chief digital officer Jason Goldberger left the company, a month after Target's chief marketing officer Jeff Jones left to join Uber Technologies [UBER.UL].  Revamping the grocery business and making the sixth-largest U.S. retailer a more compelling destination for groceries has been a key priority for Chief Executive Brian Cornell who took over in 2014.Since then Target has added more healthy, organic and gluten-free items in an effort to attract millennial shoppers, improved its store design and made leadership changes in the business. But despite these efforts, grocery sales during the second quarter fell with Target reporting its first quarterly drop in comparable sales in two years. The company lowered its forecast for the rest of the year, saying it expects sales to be flat to down 2 percent in the two remaining quarters.Target's sales have suffered as shoppers increasingly use online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and focus their spending on big-ticket items like cars and home renovations rather than small discretionary purchases.

467,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Target Corp (TGT.N) on Wednesday reported a much higher-than-expected quarterly profit after benefiting from a strong back-to-school shopping season and increased online sales, and it gave an optimistic outlook for the all-important holiday period.The Minneapolis-based retailer's shares, which had fallen nearly 2 percent so far this year, rose 6.4 percent to end at $76.03. Results have improved from recent quarters, when competition from online rivals like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and slower sales of smaller items like electronics and food hurt Target's earnings. The company had to shake up its top leadership, with three high-profile exits in the past four months. Target's sales for the third quarter ended on Oct. 29 showed the company was still losing market share, said Neil Saunders, chief executive officer of research firm Conlumino.""Although Target's performance has improved, it would be wrong to say that it is now a company firing on all cylinders,"" he said. The company said demand for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) merchandise, which had been disappointing in the second quarter, improved because of new products like the iPhone 7. Ahead of the holidays, advance orders for the brand were three times higher than a year earlier,  Target said it expected consumer spending to remain strong through the holidays. Last week, department store rivals Macy's Inc (M.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) forecast an acceleration this quarter.Target CEO Brian Cornell said store visits increased and sales trends improved by a percentage point during the third quarter.Digital sales jumped 26 percent, an acceleration from previous quarters. Comparable sales in high-margin ""signature"" categories such as baby, health and wellness outpaced those overall by three percentage points. ""As we move into the biggest quarter of the year, we are pleased with our inventory position,"" Cornell said.Target, which has been investing heavily to improve its supply chain for over a year, said it would be well-stocked during the holiday season even though it will keep its overall inventory base lower than last year. The retailer also stress-tested its website with a promotion during the third quarter and said it was prepared to handle the surge in online orders. Last year, the website crashed briefly during Cyber Monday, the biggest U.S. online shopping day, which falls right after the Thanksgiving weekend.  Target forecast fiscal-year earnings of $5.10 to $5.30 per share, excluding special items, up from a prior outlook of $4.80 to $5.20. It also raised the forecast for its sales performance at stores open at least a year by one percentage point to a range of down 1 percent to up 1 percent for this quarter.Net income attributable to Target rose nearly 11 percent to $608 million in the third quarter from a year earlier.Earnings of $1.04 per share before special items beat the analysts' average estimate of 83 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total sales fell 6.7 percent to $16.4 billion.
