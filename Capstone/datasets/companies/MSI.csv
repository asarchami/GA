7,"   By Nadia Damouni, Nicola Leske and Gerry Shih | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Lenovo Group said on Wednesday it agreed to buy Google Inc's Motorola handset division for $2.91 billion, in what is China's largest-ever tech deal as Lenovo buys its way into a heavily competitive U.S. handset market dominated by Apple Inc.It is Lenovo's second major deal on U.S. soil in a week as the Chinese electronics company angles to get a foothold in major global computing markets. Lenovo last week said it would buy IBM's low-end server business for $2.3 billion.The deal ends Google's short-lived foray into making consumer mobile devices and marks a pullback from its largest-ever acquisition. Google paid $12.5 billion for Motorola in 2012. Under this deal the search giant will keep the majority of Motorola's mobile patents, considered its prize assets.Shares in Google climbed 2.2 percent to about $1,131 in after-hours trading. Reuters reported the deal earlier on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the deal.The purchase will give Lenovo a beach-head to compete against Apple and Samsung Electronics as well as increasingly aggressive Chinese smartphone makers in the highly lucrative U.S. arena.In 2005, Lenovo muscled its way into what was then the world's largest PC market by buying IBM's personal computer division. It has powered its way up the rankings of the global smartphone industry primarily through sales on its home turf but has considered a U.S. foray of late.""Using Motorola, just as Lenovo used the IBM ThinkPad brand, to gain quick credibility and access to desirable markets and build critical mass makes a lot of sense,"" said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett.""But Motorola has not been shooting the lights out with designs or sales volumes in smartphones. So the value is simply in brand recognition to achieve market recognition faster - and to expand the design and marketing team with talent experienced at U.S. and Western markets."" The deal is subject to approval by both U.S. and Chinese authorities.Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S. acquisitions in 2012, according to a report issued in December by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Analysts say political issues could cloud the deal, especially with Lenovo trying to seal the IBM deal at the same time.In the deal for the Motorola handset business, Lenovo will pay $660 million in cash, $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares, and another $1.5 billion in the form of a three-year promissory note, Lenovo and Google said in a joint statement.RISE OF THE CHINESE  In two years, China's three biggest handset makers - Huawei, ZTE Corp and Lenovo - have vaulted into the top ranks of global smartphone charts, helped in part by their huge domestic market and spurring talk of a new force in the smartphone wars.Huawei declined to comment on the deal on Wednesday.In the United States, the Chinese companies continue to grapple with low brand awareness, perceptions of inferior quality and even security concerns. In the third quarter of last year, ZTE and Huawei accounted for 5.7 percent and 3 percent of all phones sold in the United States, respectively, trailing Apple's 36.2 percent and Samsung's 32.5 percent, according to research house IDC.Lenovo had negligible market share. Globally, however, Lenovo ranked fifth in 2013 with a 4.5 percent market share, according to IDC. That's up from 3.3 percent in 2012 and virtually nil a couple years before that.On the Google front, the Internet company has struggled to turn around loss-making Motorola. Now it's willing to step back from the hardware arena and throw its weight behind handset makers that propagate its Android software, Kantar analyst Carolina Milanesi said.""It all points to Google thinking in the short run that they're better off betting on Samsung and keeping them close,"" Milanesi said. ""And of course now they're enabling a second strong runner (Lenovo) in the Android ecosystem.""Analysts had seen Google's Motorola acquisition as primarily a way to secure the company's trove of patents amid the technology sector's increasing legal battles.Many industry observers were surprised that Google did not immediately sell the hardware division after the deal closed, choosing instead to operate Motorola a separate company.It did sell Motorola's cable television set-top box business to Arris Group Inc for $2.35 billion at the end of 2012.Lenovo is being advised by Credit Suisse Group while Lazard Ltd advised Google on the transaction, the people said.(Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Soyoung Kim, Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler)",2014-01-29,MSI,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 6:15pm EST",Lenovo to buy Google's Motorola in China's largest tech deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-google-lenovo-idUSBREA0S1YN20140129?type=companyNews

9,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc's quarterly revenue beat Wall Street's target despite an ongoing decline in prices for its online ads and deepening losses at Motorola, the handset-making division to be sold to China's Lenovo.Shares of Google, which have risen more than 20 percent in the past three months, rose nearly 4 percent to $1,178 in after-hours trading on Thursday.Google executives said in a conference call on Thursday that the company benefited from strong demand from brand marketers and retailers in the fourth quarter, as well as healthy demand for online ads in international markets.""In the holiday season one thing has become very clear, the Web has truly become the new holiday store window,"" Google Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora said. Paid clicks on Google's online ads jumped 31 percent during the typically busy holiday quarter, but the average cost per click that marketers paid the company slid 11 percent.Google's advertising rates, like those of other Internet companies including Yahoo Inc, has been under pressure as more consumers access its online services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, where advertising rates are lower than on PCs. Motorola, which Google has agreed to sell to China's top PC maker for $2.91 billion, saw operating losses of $384 million in the quarter, more than double the $152 million loss from a year earlier.The Internet search giant has struggled to turn the unit around in the face of steep competition from Apple Inc, and the sale of the loss-making unit is considered a positive for Google. Google's consolidated revenue, which includes the money-losing Motorola smartphone business, rose to $16.86 billion from $14.42 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for $16.75 billion.Revenue in Google's core Internet business totaled $15.7 billion in the last three months of the year, up 22 percent from the $12.91 billion in the year-ago period.Google's consolidated net income was $3.38 billion, or $9.90 per share, compared to $2.89 billion, or $8.62 per share, in the year-ago period.

The stock fell 8.2 percent on concerns Lenovo might have overpaid for a loss-making business and would dilute the value of shares by issuing new ones to help pay for the purchases.Together with the IBM agreement, Lenovo has agreed in the last week to fork over as many as 800 million shares, representing about 7.7 percent of its outstanding stock.With its acquisition of Motorola, Lenovo is emerging as the most viable contender to global smartphone leaders Apple and Samsung - albeit still a distant third-place player.The deal will allow Lenovo to step outside its China comfort zone and firmly into other regions, including the United States, where Chinese smartphone makers have struggled, and Latin America, where Motorola remains a strong brand.Google has the opposite problem. China is one place its presence is barely felt since it left the market in 2010 because of network security concerns.Its search engine, which dominates in most of the world, recorded China market share by usage of just 1.6 percent in December, according to Beijing-based data firm CNZZ. Before 2010, its share reached 29 percent, according to Analysys Mason. Even Google's Android operating system, which Samsung also uses, has struggled in China. Only 3.5 percent of Android devices in China have its Google Play app store installed, limiting its profit potential.Whether the Lenovo partnership might reopen the door to China remains to be seen. Programs such as Google Maps and Google Plus, which is blocked by censors, would still be unavailable to most mobile users.NEW CHALLENGER Lenovo's global smartphone market share following the acquisition will be more than 6 percent, compared with Samsung's 28.8 percent and Apple's 17.9 percent as of December 31, according to Lenovo and IDC.For Motorola, Lenovo will pay $660 million in cash, $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares, and another $1.5 billion in the form of a three-year promissory note, Lenovo and Google said in a joint statement.

13,"   By Nadia Damouni, Nicola Leske and Gerry Shih | NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Lenovo Group said on Wednesday it agreed to buy Google Inc's Motorola handset division for $2.91 billion, in what is China's largest-ever tech deal as Lenovo buys its way into a heavily competitive U.S. handset market dominated by Apple Inc.It is Lenovo's second major deal on U.S. soil in a week as the Chinese electronics company angles to get a foothold in major global computing markets. Lenovo last week said it would buy IBM's low-end server business for $2.3 billion.The deal ends Google's short-lived foray into making consumer mobile devices and marks a pullback from its largest-ever acquisition. Google paid $12.5 billion for Motorola in 2012. Under this deal the search giant will keep the majority of Motorola's mobile patents, considered its prize assets.Shares of Google climbed 2.6 percent to about $1,136 in after-hours trading. Google Chief Executive Officer Larry Page said that Google would be best served by focusing on smartphone software rather than devices.Reuters reported the deal earlier on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the deal.The purchase will give Lenovo a beach-head to compete against Apple and Samsung Electronics as well as increasingly aggressive Chinese smartphone makers in the highly lucrative U.S. arena.In 2005, Lenovo muscled its way into what was then the world's largest PC market by buying IBM's personal computer division. It has powered its way up the rankings of the global smartphone industry primarily through sales on its home turf but had considered a U.S. sortie of late.""Using Motorola, just as Lenovo used the IBM ThinkPad brand, to gain quick credibility and access to desirable markets and build critical mass makes a lot of sense,"" said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett.""But Motorola has not been shooting the lights out with designs or sales volumes in smartphones. So the value is simply in brand recognition to achieve market recognition faster - and to expand the design and marketing team with talent experienced at U.S. and Western markets.""RISE OF THE CHINESE  The deal is subject to approval by both U.S. and Chinese authorities.Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S. acquisitions in 2012, according to a report issued in December by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Analysts say political issues could cloud the Motorola sale, especially with Lenovo trying to seal the IBM deal at the same time.Lenovo will receive over 2,000 ""patent assets"" as part of the transaction, the companies said, but it remains unknown which will change hands and whether they might be subject to extra scrutiny from regulators.For Motorola, Lenovo will pay $660 million in cash, $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares, and another $1.5 billion in the form of a three-year promissory note, Lenovo and Google said in a joint statement.""The acquisition of such an iconic brand, innovative product portfolio and incredibly talented global team will immediately make Lenovo a strong global competitor in smartphones,"" Lenovo's chief executive, Yang Yuanqing, said in a statement. In two years, China's three biggest handset makers - Huawei, ZTE Corp and Lenovo - have vaulted into the top ranks of global smartphone charts, helped in part by their huge domestic market and spurring talk of a new force in the smartphone wars.Although Huawei and ZTE have made some inroads in the United States, where the Chinese companies continue to grapple with low brand awareness, perceptions of inferior quality and even security concerns. Lenovo has until now stayed out of the U.S. market.In the third quarter of last year, ZTE and Huawei accounted for 5.7 percent and 3 percent of all phones sold in the United States, respectively, trailing Apple's 36.2 percent and Samsung's 32.5 percent, according to research house IDC.Huawei declined to comment on the Lenovo deal on Wednesday. ZTE did not immediately offer comment.Globally, Lenovo ranked fifth in 2013 with a 4.5 percent market share, according to IDC. That's up from 3.3 percent in 2012 and virtually nil a couple years before that. STEP BACK For Google, the sale represented a solution to a persistent headache as Motorola's losses widened in recent quarters. It also showed Google is willing to step back from the handset arena and throw its weight behind device makers that propagate its Android software, Kantar analyst Carolina Milanesi said.""It all points to Google thinking in the short run that they're better off betting on Samsung and keeping them close,"" Milanesi said. ""And of course now they're enabling a second strong runner (Lenovo) in the Android ecosystem.""In 2012, analysts saw Google's Motorola acquisition as primarily a way to secure the company's trove of patents amid the technology sector's increasing legal battles - rather than a bona fide push into the handset business.Many industry observers were surprised that Google did not immediately sell the hardware division after the deal closed, choosing instead to operate Motorola a separate company.It did sell Motorola's cable television set-top box business to Arris Group Inc for $2.35 billion at the end of 2012.In a blog post on Wednesday, Google's Page highlighted the strategic choice in selling the Motorola handset business.""The smartphone market is super competitive, and to thrive it helps to be all-in when it comes to making mobile devices,"" Page wrote.

Goldman raised its price target to $1,200 from $1,125. Google, whose shares were trading at $750 this time last year, said it benefited from strong demand from brand marketers and retailers in the quarter.""In coming quarters, we expect improvement in cost-per-click (CPC) trends as Product Listing Ads and AdWords Enhanced Campaigns lift CPCs,"" UBS Securities analyst Eric Sheridan, who raised his target by $50 to $1,350, wrote in a note to clients.

21,"   By Dan Levine  A U.S. judge on Wednesday declared a mistrial in a lawsuit brought by private patent owner Intellectual Ventures against Google Inc's Motorola Mobility unit after jurors could not unanimously agree, according to an Intellectual Ventures statement.The trial between Intellectual Ventures and Motorola in Delaware federal court was the first for IV since it was founded 14 years ago and pitted two adversaries in the current national debate over patent reform. It involved three patents covering a variety of smartphone-related technologies, including Google Play.U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Wilmington, Delaware declared the mistrial on Wednesday, nearly two weeks after the trial began and one day after the jury began deliberating.""Mistrials are an occasional fact of life, and it is disappointing,"" said Melissa Finocchio, chief litigation counsel for Intellectual Ventures. IV is looking forward to a retrial, she said. Motorola maintained its opposition. ""We continue to believe this lawsuit was based on overbroad patent claims meant to tax innovation,"" Motorola said in a statement.Google, which acquired Motorola in 2012, is backing attempts to curb software patents and make it easier to fight lawsuits. IV has warned that Congress should not act too rashly to weaken patent owners' rights. Google recently announced that it would sell its Motorola handset business to Lenovo but that it would keep the vast majority of Motorola's patents. A Google spokesman declined to comment on how Motorola's patent liabilities would be impacted by the sale.Privately held Intellectual Ventures and other patent buyers have been accused by some in the technology industry of burdening innovation by using the patents they buy to pursue lawsuits instead of building products. IV argues that unlike some of the firms denounced as ""patent trolls"" it invests only in quality intellectual property and does not file frivolous lawsuits. The multi-billion dollar patent firm has other lawsuits in pre-trial stages and has agreed to settlements for other, separate claims, but the Motorola lawsuit is the first case it has taken to trial since IV was founded 14 years ago.IV has raised about $6 billion from investors and has bought tens of thousands of intellectual property assets from a variety of sources.

27,"  * Q3 net profit $265.3 mln, up 29 pct from year earlier* Acquisitions to weigh on earnings in short term -CEO* Profit recovery after 2005 ThinkPad buy took two yearsBy Paul CarstenBEIJING, Feb 13 Lenovo Group Ltd  leader Yang Yuanqing says the Chinese technology giant will draw on cost-cutting lessons learned when it bought IBM Corp's  ThinkPad laptop unit to turn losses into profit at businesses acquired for $5.2 billion last month.Reporting third-quarter profit jumped 29 percent, Lenovo's chief executive warned the drive to turn around the Motorola handset business it bought from Google Inc and the computer server unit it bought from IBM will squeeze earnings in the short term.For Yang, the pain may only last ""a couple of quarters"" after the deals close, he said, and is worth it: though October-December personal computer sales were strong, the aggressive acquisitions are a key plank in Lenovo's search for future sources of growth as the broader desktop PC market shrinks and computer users go mobile.""In the short term (the deals) will have a negative impact on performance,"" Yang said in a telephone interview after the earnings were announced. Lenovo, the world's biggest maker of PCs, later specified it will likely take three to five quarters to turn around the Motorola phone business.Analysts say it may take the company at least that long to turn around its acquisitions. Heavyweights like Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc, dominant in global smartphones, will also provide stiff competition as Lenovo seeks to build up the Motorola business. ""I'm expecting a slowdown in the underlying, organic business,"" said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, a Hong Kong-based technology analyst at JI Asia, an affiliate of Societe Generale. ""It will be at least a year before Lenovo can turn around growth,"" he said, speaking before Yang's comments.DEJA VU Investors might be experiencing déjà vu.

A key part of its strategy for IBM's low-end servers is to surf on Lenovo's presence in China, where it said server demand remains strong.But the sheer size of these deals - the price tag is close to half of Lenovo's market value - will weigh on the company for some time.

28,"  * Q3 net profit $265.3 mln, up 29 pct from year earlier* Acquisitions to weigh on earnings in short term -CEO* Profit recovery after 2005 ThinkPad buy took two yearsBy Paul CarstenBEIJING, Feb 13 Lenovo Group Ltd  leader Yang Yuanqing says the Chinese technology giant will draw on cost-cutting lessons learned when it bought IBM Corp's  ThinkPad laptop unit to turn losses into profit at businesses acquired for $5.2 billion last month.Reporting third-quarter profit jumped 29 percent, Lenovo's chief executive warned the drive to turn around the Motorola handset business it bought from Google Inc and the computer server unit it bought from IBM will squeeze earnings in the short term.For Yang, the pain may only last ""a couple of quarters"" after the deals close, he said, and is worth it: though October-December personal computer sales were strong, the aggressive acquisitions are a key plank in Lenovo's search for future sources of growth as the broader desktop PC market shrinks and computer users go mobile.""In the short term (the deals) will have a negative impact on performance,"" Yang said in a telephone interview after the earnings were announced. Lenovo, the world's biggest maker of PCs, later specified it will likely take three to five quarters to turn around the Motorola phone business.Analysts say it may take the company at least that long to turn around its acquisitions. Heavyweights like Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc, dominant in global smartphones, will also provide stiff competition as Lenovo seeks to build up the Motorola business.""I'm expecting a slowdown in the underlying, organic business,"" said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, a Hong Kong-based technology analyst at JI Asia, an affiliate of Societe Generale. ""It will be at least a year before Lenovo can turn around growth,"" he said, speaking before Yang's comments. DEJA VU Investors might be experiencing déjà vu.

29,"   By Ellen Wulfhorst | MANCHESTER, New Hampshire  MANCHESTER, New Hampshire Sipping his breakfast coffee in a cozy booth at Chez Vachon, a New Hampshire cafe favored by political junkies and a regular stop for aspirants on the campaign trail to the White House, Bill McEvoy debated the presidential future of Republican Chris Christie.""If they can prove that he lied, then he's out,"" said McEvoy, 71, referring to the so-called Bridgegate scandal that has dogged Christie for weeks and raised questions about whether his administration orchestrated massive traffic jams as political payback.Short of that, McEvoy said, ""I think he can come out of it looking good.""While Christie has seen support tumble in national polls since the controversy erupted, interviews with more than two dozen voters and party activists in New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina - the initial proving grounds for presidential candidates - suggest he may yet be able to overcome the scandal.What many said they want from Christie is time and attention, a display of hands-on, retail politicking ahead of the first caucus in Iowa and the first two primaries, in New Hampshire and in South Carolina.In Iowa, A.J. Spiker, chairman of the state Republican Party, compared Christie to Mitt Romney, who was criticized for health-care reforms he helped pass as governor of Massachusetts.Conservatives denounced ""Romneycare"" as a prototype for President Obama's health-care policy, yet Romney won the Iowa caucus and the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.""People can do well here - if they come and they work the state and they talk to the people,"" Spiker said. ""I would say if Romney can overcome 'Romneycare,' if everything we know about the bridge scandal is public, then Christie should be able to overcome that.""Besides, he added, the Iowa caucus is roughly two years away. ""A lot happens in two years,"" he said.EMBARRASSED AND HUMILIATED  Christie has denied knowledge of the closure of three traffic lanes at the busy George Washington Bridge five months ago, which blew up into a scandal in January with the release of emails showing some of his aides and appointees may have orchestrated the snarl as political payback against a local mayor.State and federal officials are investigating the incident.While a contrite Christie held a nearly two-hour-long news conference soon after news of the scandal broke, claiming lack of knowledge about the plot and describing himself as embarrassed and humiliated by his staff, the imbroglio has dented his political standing.Only 22 percent of voters in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey held a favorable view of Christie in late January, down from 33 percent in October.A poll by the University of New Hampshire showed that a third of the state's Republican primary voters were less likely to vote for Christie because of the scandal. But nearly all of the rest said it had little impact on their view. An early proving ground in the presidential race, New Hampshire has accurately picked the Democratic and Republican winning nominees in three-quarters of the contests in the last 50 years.Candidates campaigning in the state are exposed to grueling media attention and pointed questions from voters who demand face time during informal stops at local businesses such as Manchester's bustling Chez Vachon.That may benefit Christie, whose straight-forward, no-nonsense style has made him a national political force and will likely play well with New Hampshire voters, said Alan Glassman, chairman of the Belknap County Republican Committee""There's an astuteness on their part,"" Glassman said of his fellow state Republicans. ""They can tell whether somebody's trying to pull the wool over their eyes.""Another political aficionado at Chez Vachon was retired trucker Henry Fitts, who boasts of never missing a chance to vote. At 71, he has seen plenty from his seat at the landmark diner and says he thinks the tempest will teach Christie to be a better candidate and help tamp down his reputation as a bully. ""I think he's going to come out cleaner than previously,"" said Fitts. ""He's going to look a lot more sensitive when it's all done.""New Hampshire's primary is often fueled by the state's large bloc of independents, who can vote in either party's primary.After Iowa and New Hampshire, Christie, if he runs, would next move to South Carolina, the first contest of the primary season held in a southern state.South Carolina's scorecard is nearly perfect in choosing the Republican nominee. The winner there has gone on to claim the party nomination every time, with one exception, since the state's primary began in 1980.Candidates there face a formidable force of social and religious conservatives, which may prove to be a bigger challenge for Christie than overcoming a traffic scandal 700 miles to the north, local voters said.""I do not like him as a candidate for president,"" said Debbie Jones, 60, who lives on Isle of Palms and is active in the county Republican Party.""It has nothing to do with Bridgegate, but everything to do with being another of the Republicans who don't follow conservative beliefs and follow our Constitution,"" she said.(This story was refiled to remove extraneous word in third from last paragraph)(Additional reporting by Harriet McLeod in Charleston, South Carolina; Editing by Gunna Dickson)",2014-02-21,MSI,"Fri Feb 21, 2014 | 4:22pm EST","From a tainted Christie, Republican voters demand time and attention",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-politics-christie-idUSBREA1K1UZ20140221?type=companyNews

39,"  (Adds details on decision, background on dispute)By Diane Bartz and Dan LevineWASHINGTON, April 25 A U.S. appeals court on Friday revived patent claims Apple made against Google's Motorola Mobility unit that had been dismissed shortly before trial, giving the iPhone maker another chance to seek a sales ban against its smartphone competitor.The appeals court also revived a patent claim Motorola Mobility had made against Apple but ruled Motorola could not seek a sales ban of its own.Apple and companies that make phones using Google's Android software have filed dozens of such lawsuits against each other around the world to protect their technology. Apple, in particular, argues that Android phones that use Google software copy its iPhones. In litigation between technology companies that boast multi-billion dollar margins, court-ordered sales bans are seen as a far more serious threat than monetary damages. Despite years of court challenges to Android, Apple has not been able to win a crippling injunction.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had been hearing two cases - one in which Apple accused Motorola Mobility, which has since been bought by Google, of infringing its patents. Motorola, in turn, accused Apple of infringing three patents, including one that is essential to ensuring smartphones are interoperable.The cases were consolidated at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Judge Richard Posner, who took the case, dismissed it in 2012 before trial, saying that neither company had sufficient evidence to prove its case. The appeals court considered six patents in the two cases - three belonging to Apple and three to Motorola Mobility. The two companies had appealed a variety of issues, ranging from the definitions of some patents to whether money damages were sufficient for infringement or if sales bans should be put on  infringing products.Posner had ruled an injunction barring the sale of Motorola phones would harm consumers. He also had ruled that even if infringement occurred, Apple could not sue because it could not prove it had been hurt by the infringement. But the appeals court decided Posner defined one of Apple's patents too narrowly and ordered him to reconsider Apple's request for an injunction. The appeals court affirmed the lower court's decisions on two Motorola Mobility patents. But, as in the case of the Apple patent, it disagreed with the lower court's decision that Motorola Mobility would be entitled to no damages even if infringement was proven on a third patent. The appeals court said, however, that Motorola Mobility cannot request an injunction for infringement of that patent, the appeals court said.Since the appeal began, Google announced that it was selling Motorola Mobility's handset business to Lenovo but would keep the vast majority of the patents. It is unclear if Lenovo will assume liability in the patent fights.Apple and Google both declined to comment.The case is at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and is Apple Inc. V. Motorola Mobility. It is case number 2012-1528, -1549.

40,"  * EU antitrust chief: Motorola action against Apple illegal* Samsung must honour pledge not to seek injunctions* Almunia: smartphone wars shouldn't be at consumers' expense   (Recasts, adds quotes, details)By John O'DonnellBRUSSELS, April 29 The European Union's antitrust enforcer has told two top smartphone makers to stop filing aggressive patent lawsuits against rivals such as Apple, aiming to end a patent war and open the market to freer competition.The European Commission reprimanded Motorola Mobility on Tuesday for taking such action against Apple, hoping the ruling will halt a rising tide of legal disputes among rivals vying for profit in the global smartphone market.The EU's anti-trust enforcer also said that Samsung Electronics must keep a promise not to seek injunctions against rivals if they sign a licensing agreement.""The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers,"" said Joaquin Almunia, the European commissioner in charge of anti-trust enforcement. The landmark ruling will help draw a line under a long-running feud between smartphone makers and a slew of legal action against rivals by manufacturers who claimed their designs had been copied.Although no fine will be imposed on Google Inc's  Motorola, the Commission ruled that the company had been wrong to seek an injunction against Apple in Germany for copying a 'standard-essential' patent, for which Apple had bought a license.Such patents, which cover basic mobile technology such as the mechanism to make and end a phone call, have become the scene of bitter legal confrontation.Phone companies often argue that their technology, such as Apple's slide-to-unlock keypad, should be covered by such legal protection to prevent rivals stealing a lead. HIGH STAKES Ever since Apple entered the market with its iPhone, smartphone makers have been seeking to mimic its success. This has led to a series of claims and counter-claims by inventors that their technology had been stolen, including some of the basic building blocks of a mobile phone.""The EU is being the voice of reason,"" said Ben Wood of advisory firm CCS Insight. ""Smaller phone makers can no longer afford to get into protracted legal battles over patents. Essential patents, such as making a mobile phone connect to a mobile network, must be available.""We forecast that over 1.2 billion smart phones will be  sold worldwide this year and this means the stakes are high.""The Commission ordered Motorola to resolve its dispute with Apple in Europe at the negotiating table, not in the courtroom.""While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology,"" said Almunia.The patent wars between tech companies, which also include Microsoft, Nokia and smaller rivals, underscore the fierce battle for market share in the lucrative mobile phone industry.The world's top smartphone makers, Samsung and Apple, are suing each other in more than 10 countries.

41,"  BRUSSELS, April 29 The European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, ruled on Tuesday that Motorola Mobility broke EU competition rules by seeking an injunction against Apple on the basis of a smartphone patent.""The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers,"" EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. ""While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of inter-operable products,"" he said. The Commission ruled that it was abusive for Motorola to seek an injunction against Apple in Germany on the basis of a patent it had committed to license. Apple had agreed to buy a licence and pay royalties. The Commission did not to impose a fine on Motorola because there is no case-law by the European Union Courts dealing with the legality of such injunctions and because national courts have so far reached different conclusions on this.

46,"  Gemalto NV, the French digital security company, said on Friday that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected its patent claim relating to the Android smart phone operating platform.Gemalto, which makes smart cards, filed a suit in the United States in October 2010 against Google, Motorola, Samsung and HTC, alleging that their Android applications infringed on its patents.The company's shares, which are traded in Amsterdam, fell  1.8 percent early on Friday.""Gemalto's has consistently patented and broadly licensed its innovation so we are certainly disappointed by this judgment with regards to the scope of use of some of our intellectual property,"" Olivier Piou, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.Piou said the decision would have ""no impact on our historical patents licensing activity, nor on the company’s 2017 long-term objectives.""

49,"   By Foo Yun Chee and Alexei Oreskovic | BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO  BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO European regulators are preparing what could be a stern challenge to Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) (GOOG.O) mobile software business in the coming months after a nearly four-year investigation into the company's Web search practices left rivals and European politicians dissatisfied.Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said that with a new antitrust chief taking over in November, European regulators are laying the groundwork for a case centered on whether Google abuses the 80 percent market share of its Android mobile operating system to promote services from maps to search.The Commission has stepped up inquiries just in recent weeks, sending companies questionnaires that seek far more details than previous queries on the matter in 2011 and 2013. In one questionnaire seen by Reuters, respondents were asked whether there was a requirement set by Google, written or unwritten, that they not pre-install apps, products or services on mobile devices that compete with Google software like its search engine, app store and maps.Companies must provide emails, faxes, letters, notes from phone calls and meetings, and presentations stretching as far back as 2007 related to such deals with Google, suggesting the European Commission wants to know if Google’s behavior has been long-term. Respondents have been given until early September to reply to more than 40 questions.While any company is free to use the open-source Android as they choose, mobile handset makers that want to use the newest version must sign a contract that stipulates a minimum number of Google services be pre-installed on devices, according to a third source, a former Google executive with knowledge of the matter.The impending Android inquiry adds to a growing list of regulatory challenges that complicate the Internet company's ambitions in a vital market. Europe accounted for more than $30 billion in digital advertising spending in 2013.The European Commission is likely to start a formal probe into Android once it wraps up an investigation into whether Google ranks its own services higher than those of its rivals in search results, according to the two people with knowledge of the matter.One of the sources said going after Android would help stem a growing chorus of complaints. Google struck a deal with Almunia in February by agreeing to display rivals' links more prominently, but the preliminary settlement was criticized as inadequate by rivals such as Microsoft Corp, U.S. consumer review site Yelp Inc and German and Spanish publishers, as well as some European politicians. Outgoing European Commission antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia may decide to open a second case against Google at the same time he announces the closing of the first, the source said.“It’s a political game. Can Almunia afford not to bring a case? He has to bring a case,” the source said. WAVE OF DISTRUST Google faces criticism in Europe about everything from privacy to tax policies, and is wrestling with a European court’s ruling that requires it to remove links from search results that individuals find objectionable. For a Factbox, please click [ID:nL2N0Q41Z2]Android's 80 percent market share is at a level akin to Microsoft's Windows, itself the target of a long-running European investigation.At the same time, the company has grown so large as to inspire distrust in some corners, with a chorus of public criticism from politicians and business executives. Mathias Dopfner, the Chief Executive of German publisher Axel Springer said he was “afraid” of Google in an April open letter published in German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Axel Springer is a member of the Open Internet Project, which has submitted a complaint against Google to the EC.""They are in a stormy patch at the moment"" in Europe, says Alasdair Young, a professor at Georgia Tech’s Sam Nunn School of International Affairs. “It’s pretty unusual for a company to be hit by so many big policy threats at the same time.” The search investigation is not a done deal, with the Commission having indicated it may seek more concessions from Google before making a final decision in September.But the real fight may be shifting to mobile.Search is ""like the movie everybody's already walked out of,"" said David Balto, a former Policy Director at the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, who has done some consulting work for Google. ""People are going in there, trying to collect the popcorn boxes, but they don’t notice the movie’s over.""Android represents a crucial channel for Google to extend its search engine into the mobile world. Regulatory action that impedes Google’s ability put search front-and-center within Android could threaten its primary money-making service.  Handset makers such as Samsung (005930.KS) and LG Electronics (066570.KS) may also benefit by being freer to pre-install or alternative online services on devices. That may in turn grant better shop-window placement to rival services from Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Yahoo (YHOO.O).A Google spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that Google is committed to keeping Android open and that ""anyone can use Android without Google, and anyone can use Google without Android."" ""Since Android's introduction, greater competition in the smartphone market has given consumers more and better choices. Both the U.S. FTC and Korean Fair Trade Commission have examined Google's agreements around Android in depth and concluded that there was no cause for legal concern,"" the spokeswoman said. LONG ARM OF THE LAW But the questionnaires sent to telecoms operators and handset makers using Android suggest that the European regulators are looking for evidence to build its case.Regulators asked if Google had ever communicated ""that it was not in favor of your undertaking manufacturing, marketing or launching a smart mobile device with your own or a third-party application or service pre-installed or set as default.""Another question asked for examples of major commercial difficulties faced by app stores competing with Google Play. The watchdog also asked for details of revenue-sharing with Google.Much will depend on Almunia’s successor. The 66-year-old Spaniard, whose term as antitrust chief ends in October, has fueled a growing feeling within the Commission that he may have been too soft on Google. The incoming head may decide to take a tougher line following criticism in recent months from French and German ministers as well as European lawmakers.Mindful of the Commission’s power to impose multi-billion euro fines and the distraction of a drawn-out regulatory battle that could hurt the corporate image, Google will likely seek a quick end to any Android probe, said Andreas Kafetzopoulos, a lawyer at Dechert, whose practice focuses on European competition law.“In fast-moving technology markets, protracted adversarial antitrust proceedings rarely benefit anyone. Settlement would again be the most likely outcome of a new Google case,” Kafetzopoulos said.

""Our Federal business will be more stable, backlog is up and the order visibility is higher than it was a quarter ago.""Revenue will, however, reflect the increase in orders only from the fourth quarter, Brown said.Motorola Solutions will become more dependant on government spending after completing the sale of its enterprise business, which makes rugged mobile computers, tablets and barcode scanners, to Zebra Technologies Corp.Government and public safety systems, constituting most of the company's remaining businesses, brought in two-thirds of Motorola Solutions' total revenue before the sale. The company forecast sales to drop 7-9 percent in the third quarter ending September, implying sales of about $1.94 billion at the midpoint of that range.MORE SAVINGS Motorola Solutions, which has been cutting costs to boost profitability, said it expects to save $300 million by the end of 2015 - more than its targeted $200 million. About half of the cost savings will likely come from general and administrative cost controls, Brown said.Operating margins shrank to 9.9 percent in the second quarter ended June 28 from 13.6 percent a year earlier.Total sales fell 7 percent to $1.39 billion. Sales in North America dropped 14 percent to $841 million.""Overall market demand in North America was down in the first half,"" Brown said on a call with analysts.The company earned 47 cents per share, excluding items.Motorola Solutions forecast earnings of 35-41 cents per share from continuing operations this quarter.Chief Financial Officer Gino Bonanotte said the profit forecast was below second-quarter levels due to a higher tax rate.Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola Solutions' shares were down 3.7 percent at $61.73 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling to $61.50.

54,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) for Motorola Solutions, Inc. (Motorola Solutions; NYSE: MSI) at 'BBB'.  Fitch also rates the $1.4 billion senior notes issuance at 'BBB'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable.  The ratings affect $5.5 billion, including the undrawn revolving credit facility  (RCF). A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Motorola Solutions will issue $1.4 billion of senior unsecured notes and use $1  billion of net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding  pension obligations. The company will use the remaining net proceeds to redeem  $400 million of 6% senior notes due 2017 under a make-whole provision.  KEY RATINGS DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for more stable long-term  operating performance pro forma for the Enterprise segment sale. The remaining  company will consist mainly of the Public Safety segment and have leading market  share, greater visibility and lower end-market cyclicality. Profitability will  remain strong, with operating profit margin in the mid- to upper-teens and  annual free cash flow (FCF) of $250 million to $500 million. Fitch expects credit metrics will remain weak for the 'BBB' rating, pro forma  for the Enterprise sale and debt issuance, given lower profitability levels and  structurally higher debt levels. This, in combination with smaller scale,  reduced revenue diversity and mature government and public safety markets,  reduces flexibility at the current rating for operational shortfalls from lower  profitability. Pro forma for the Enterprise sale and debt issuance, Fitch expects total  leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) near 3x for 2014. Adjusted for net  pension obligations and rent expense, Fitch estimates leverage was nearly 4x but  will decline below 3.5x in the near term assuming the use of net proceeds to  meaningfully address $1.6 billion of net global pension obligations. Over the  longer term, Fitch expects leverage adjusted for net pension obligations and  rent expense will remain below 3.5x. Fitch expects low-single-digit negative revenue growth for 2014, driven by North  American government markets and lower than anticipated Enterprise sales. The  2014 guidance incorporates mid-single-digit growth in Enterprise and low- to  mid-single-digit revenue declines in Government. Pro forma for the Enterprise  sale, revenues will exceed $6 billion and organic revenue growth will be in the  low single digits with growth driven increasingly by markets outside the U.S. Despite a weaker near-term demand environment, the ratings and Outlook reflect  Fitch's expectations for still solid operating profit and FCF in 2014.  Restructuring actions will drive operating leverage, offsetting lower gross  margin attributable to a growing services business and lower hardware revenues.  Operating profit margin is anticipated to remain in the upper teens in 2014,  contributing to FCF before pension contributions in excess of $250 million.  The company remains on track to close the sale of the Enterprise business,  excluding the iDEN business, to Zebra Technologies Corp. for $3.45 billion of  cash by the end of 2014. Motorola Solutions will return 100% of the sale  proceeds to shareholders.  The ratings are supported by MSI's:  --Leading market positions in Public Safety and Enterprise markets, driven in  part by a solid intellectual property (IP) portfolio and brand name;  --Expectations for consistent operating performance and annual FCF of $250  million to $500 million;  --Solid liquidity position. Ratings concerns center on:  --Mature growth rates for public safety businesses;  --Strained government budgets in developed economies, which could be a drag on  more robust international spending;  --Reduced diversification and revenue base following the sale of the Enterprise  business. RATINGS SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions could result from: --Leverage adjusted for net pension obligations and rent expense exceeding 3.5x  beyond the short term, from weaker than expected profit margins; --Sustained annual FCF below $250 million due to more  significant-than-anticipated government spending cuts;  Positive rating actions are not anticipated, given Fitch's expectations for  structurally weaker credit metrics. As of June 30, 2014, Fitch believes liquidity was solid and supported by:  --$2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents ($1.7 billion of which was in the  U.S.); --An undrawn $2 billion senior unsecured RCF expiring 2019. Pro forma for the senior notes issuance and redemption, total debt was  approximately $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2014, consisting of various tranches  of senior notes. Aside from the undrawn RCF's expiration in 2019, Motorola's  nearest debt maturity is $750 million of 3.75% senior notes due 2022.  Fitch rates Motorola Solutions as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'BBB';  --Senior unsecured RCF 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB';  --Short-term IDR and commercial paper program 'F2'.

55,"   By Mary Wisniewski | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked Illinois lawmakers on Tuesday to reform sentencing for low-level drug offenses, which would include ticketing rather than arresting people caught with small amounts of marijuana.Emanuel said decriminalization of possession of less than eight grams of marijuana in the third-largest U.S. city since 2012 has kept non-violent offenders out of courts and jails and reduced paperwork, freeing up police officers to deal with violent crimes.Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy were addressing a joint, bipartisan committee of state lawmakers that is holding preliminary hearings to overhaul the Illinois criminal code to address problems with prison overcrowding and mandatory minimum sentencing rules.The mayor and police chief also recommended that possession of less than one gram of controlled substances such as cocaine be a misdemeanor rather than a felony. The plea for softer drug laws is part of Emanuel and McCarthy's strategy to also push lawmakers to adopt harsher sentences for gun crimes. Chicago officials say illegal guns are a major factor in the city's high number of murders.Emanuel said on Tuesday that the change statewide would save tax dollars that can be used on crime prevention programs.""It doesn't make sense that one arrest for a very small amount of a controlled substance can lead to a lifetime of struggles, sending people in and out of prison and putting up barriers to getting a job or finding a place to live,"" he said at the hearing in Chicago. Sixteen states plus the District of Columbia have decriminalized marijuana possession and two states have legalized retail sales, according to NORML, a group lobbying to legalize the drug.""It's consistent with both Democratic and Republican efforts at the state levels to reduce prison populations,"" NORML executive director Allen St. Pierre said of Emanuel's proposal.  A May 2014 Roosevelt University study of the implementation of the marijuana decriminalization ordinance in Chicago was critical of the city police, finding they were still more likely to arrest people caught with small amounts of pot than ticket them.McCarthy and Emanuel told lawmakers that the city has reduced arrests by 14 percent over the past three years, and that the number of burglaries - a crime often related to drug problems - and other crimes has also gone down in the same time period.

61,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal appeals court rejected Motorola Mobility LLC's bid to sue several Asian suppliers under U.S. antitrust law for fixing prices of mobile phone displays sold to its foreign units.    Wednesday's decision by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago may lessen protections against inflated prices for U.S. consumers who buy cellphones, computers and other products whose components are made outside the country.Circuit Judge Richard Posner said Motorola could not invoke U.S. antitrust law because the ""immediate victims"" had been non-U.S. subsidiaries that had bought most of the liquid crystal display screens that carried inflated prices.While Motorola, a unit of China's Lenovo Group Ltd, claimed it paid the defendants more than $5 billion during a conspiracy that ran from 1996 to 2006, only 1 percent of the components were shipped to the United States.""Motorola's foreign subsidiaries were injured in foreign commerce — in dealings with other foreign companies,"" Posner wrote for a three-judge panel.""To give Motorola rights to take the place of its foreign companies and sue on their behalf under U.S. antitrust law would be an unjustified interference with the right of foreign nations to regulate their own economies,"" he added.The defendants include AU Optronics Corp, Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd, HannStar Display Corp, LG Display Co, Samsung Electronics Co, Samsung SDI Co, Panasonic Corp's Sanyo unit, Sharp Corp and Toshiba Corp.Some LCD makers have pleaded guilty to U.S. criminal price-fixing charges. Wednesday's decision limits the scope of Motorola's separate, civil lawsuit, which also alleged violations of state antitrust and consumer protection laws. The civil case had also drawn concern from the court that Motorola was trying to obtain U.S. antitrust protections even as it shifted tax burdens to other countries. Motorola, which is based in Chicago, denied that accusation, saying it repatriated foreign profits and paid U.S. taxes.UNFRIENDED  ""The court's opinion basically says that Motorola can't have it both ways,"" said Robert Wick, a partner at Covington & Burling who represents Samsung Electronics and argued the defendants' case before the 7th Circuit on Nov. 13. ""Motorola can't be a foreign company for purposes of manufacturing phones, but a U.S. company when it comes to asserting antitrust claims.""Motorola spokesman Will Moss said: ""We disagree with the decision, and are considering our options.""Posner said Motorola and its customers were only ""indirect"" purchasers of the LCD screens, and that Motorola's claims were barred under a 1982 law limiting antitrust claims against non-U.S. companies to conduct directly linked to domestic commerce.Of the screens shipped to non-U.S. factories, 42 percent were used in products sold in the United States, and 57 percent in products sold elsewhere. The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission had submitted a brief urging that U.S. antitrust law did cover the price-fixing conspiracy.But Posner said the government stopped short of saying Motorola deserved antitrust damages, and merely sought assurance that U.S. efforts to obtain criminal and civil sanctions against foreign companies for antitrust violations would not be impeded.""Motorola has lost its best friend,"" Posner said, referring to the government.A Justice Department spokesman said the government is pleased the court recognized the ""propriety"" of its efforts to protect U.S. consumers from non-U.S. price-fixing cartels.Lenovo bought Motorola Mobility for $2.91 billion in October from Google Inc, which had purchased the company two years earlier.The case is Motorola Mobility LLC v.

62,"  * Net profit $253 mln vs $200 mln analyst f'casts* Motorola contribution helps mobile sales leap 109 pct* PC shipments up 5 pct   (Adds CEO comments and details on results, strategy)By Gerry ShihBEIJING, Feb 3 Lenovo Group Ltd, the world's leading PC maker, said on Tuesday its third-quarter revenue rose 31 percent to $14.1 billion, beating investor expectations, as its mobile division sales more than doubled following its acquisition of Motorola.The results, released before the Hong Kong Stock Exchange opened Tuesday, sent Lenovo shares 5.7 percent higher in morning trade to HK$10.76, compared with a 0.36 percent fall on the broader Hang Seng index. Lenovo paid $2.91 billion for Motorola, the U.S. handset brand with a long sales history in the United States and Europe, as part of an effort to diversify away from the shrinking PC market.Lenovo's results took into account two months of Motorola's performance - the acquisition closed Oct 31 - and the company said Motorola sold more than 10 million handsets during the quarter for the first time.Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told Reuters the acquisition will set Lenovo apart from Chinese rivals Xiaomi Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, as competition intensifies between them for the title of No. 3 global smartphone maker behind Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc. ""We're not the same as the other Chinese players because now we have become a global player,"" Yang said.Xiaomi, in particular, has swept aside Lenovo in China but has largely avoided Western markets due to fears of intellectual property challenges.Yang pledged to fight back against Xiaomi in China by adopting its rival's Internet distribution model. Lenovo in May signed a deal with e-commerce site JD.com and announced a subsidiary last month to sell smartphones and wearables exclusively online. Under Lenovo, Motorola will re-enter the Chinese market and be distributed primarily online, Yang said.Total sales from the mobile division leapt 109 percent to $3.39 billion, or a quarter of the company's sales.Lenovo said net profit was $253 million, down from $265 million a year prior due to ballooning expenses associated with closing two major acquisitions. The Beijing-based company also acquired IBM's low-end server unit for $2.1 billion.The results beat expectations of $13.71 billion in revenue and $200 million in net profit, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates.Lenovo continued to consolidate its hold on the PC market, reaching a record 20 percent share during the quarter with sales of $9.15 billion. Shipments rose 5 percent compared with a 3 percent decline in the broader industry, with growth particularly strong in Eastern Europe.

69,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Patent holding company Intellectual Ventures' second crack at holding Motorola Mobility liable for using its technology without permission partially succeeded on Wednesday after a U.S. jury in Delaware found Motorola infringed a patent on multimedia text messaging.The jury, which deliberated for about a day and a half, cleared Motorola on a second patent related to wireless bandwidth, which it said was invalid. Damages are to be determined later. It was the second time the two companies faced off in court. The first round, in February 2014, ended in mistrial after jurors could not agree on a verdict.Another trial between the two, involving a single Intellectual Ventures patent related to detachable computer devices, is scheduled to begin Thursday. “We are encouraged by today’s verdict,” said Melissa Finocchio, IV’s chief litigation counsel. “As we look ahead to the next trial, we remain committed to defending inventor rights and protecting the interests of our investors and customers.” Motorola declined to comment. China's Lenovo Group (0992.HK) acquired the Motorola handset division from Google Inc (GOOGL.O) in October. Founded in 2000, Bellevue, Wash.-based Intellectual Ventures is one of the largest intellectual property owners in the world, with more than 70,000 patents and patent applications to its name. It only recently began suing companies in addition to its longtime strategy of licensing its wide array of patents. It sued Motorola in 2011, alleging that several of Motorola's mobile devices infringed its patents. Intellectual Ventures and other companies like it have been accused by some in the technology industry of burdening innovation by using the patents they buy to pursue lawsuits instead of building products. Such companies are a central focus of renewed Congressional efforts at patent reform, aimed at  curbing litigation.  Intellectual Ventures argues that unlike some of the firms denounced as ""patent trolls"" it does not file frivolous lawsuits. In February, Intellectual Ventures won a $17 million patent verdict against security software maker Symantec Corp (SYMC.O), strengthening its track record in court. The case is Intellectual Ventures I Llc et al. v. Motorola Mobility Llc, No. 11-cv-908, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.

71,"  Motorola Mobility said a U.S. jury ordered the company to pay $10.2 million in damages for using Fujifilm Corp's patented technology in its phones without permission.Fujifilm Corp, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Fujifilm Holdings Corp, sued Motorola in 2012, accusing the company of infringing three of its patents on digital camera functions and a fourth patent relating to transmitting data over a wireless connection such as Bluetooth.The damages the jury ordered on Monday were lesser than the $40 million Fujifilm sought while going into the trial, which began on April 20.The jury in San Francisco said Motorola, a unit of China's Lenovo Group, proved that three of the disputed patents - two on face recognition and one on wifi-bluetooth were invalid. Motorola failed to prevail on a patent related to converting color images to monochrome.  ""We are pleased with the verdict related to three out of the four patents and are evaluating our options on the one patent on which we did not prevail,"" Motorola spokesman William Moss said in an email.A spokeswoman for Fujifilm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Motorola, which Lenovo bought from Google Inc last year, had argued that the Fujifilm patents should be canceled because they were not actually new or they were obvious compared to previously patented inventions. The company also argued it already held a license to Bluetooth technology. The case is Fujifilm Corp v. Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc et al, in the U.S. District Court for the California Northern District, No. 12-cv-3587.

77,"  BEIJING/HONG KONG Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK), the world's biggest PC maker by sales, said on Thursday its annual net profit rose 1 percent to $829 million, slightly below analyst expectations, as intense competition in the Chinese smartphone market eroded margins.Analysts had forecast a net profit of $857 million. Revenue during the 2014/15 financial year rose 20 percent to $46.3 billion as Lenovo expanded its share of the shrinking PC market to one-fifth. In the fourth-quarter alone, revenue rose 21 percent to $11.3 billion.Lenovo said PC sales, by far the group's largest business,  rose across all geographic regions but targeted Europe in particular as an area of potential growth. PC sales to businesses rose 3 percent year-on-year despite a 3 percent drop in the broader market, it added.Speaking to reporters in Hong Kong on Thursday, Yang acknowledged Lenovo's smartphone business was flagging on its home turf, a slowing market characterized by intense competition and razor-thin margins.Industry analyst group IDC said last week smartphone shipments in the world's most populous country shrank for the first time in six years as the market became saturated. Yang said the company needed to improve profitability in China after the smartphone division's performance crimped Lenovo's overall operating margin in China.""We have encountered bigger challenges in China during the past few years,"" Yang said. ""Our advantage was at the carriers sales channels in the past, but now we need to rebuild our retail and online sales channels.""Lenovo, whose phones are selling well in markets outside China, recently launched a sub-brand called ShenQi that is sold only online in a bid to attract young, price- and fashion-conscious buyers and ward off Internet-based rivals like Xiaomi Inc XTC.UL. Lenovo has been expanding into enterprise computing and smartphones to offset the decline in PC sales globally. The Beijing-based firm closed in October its $2.1 billion acquisition of IBM's low-end server unit and also its $2.9 billion purchase of Motorola.The company said both the IBM unit and Motorola were ""on track to deliver their targets"", with Motorola, which re-entered the Chinese market in January, set to turn profitable within 4 to 6 months. The American handset maker accounted for 7.8 million out of Lenovo's total 18.7 million mobile units sold during the quarter.Yang also downplayed reports that the U.S. Navy would replace its IBM low-end servers out of cybersecurity concerns following the unit's transfer to a Chinese owner. He said the matter could be resolved and would not affect Lenovo's business. ""Lenovo is trusted and respected worldwide and our PC business has also expanded globally including in the U.S. government and army. We haven't heard such complaints...We are willing to communicate with the U.S. government to solve problems.""After beating earnings expectations in consecutive quarters, Lenovo shares have risen nearly 50 percent to HK $13.6 in the past 12 months, outpacing the 23 percent gain in the broader market.

81,"  (Adds background, no comment from Microsoft and Google)By Andrew ChungNEW YORK, July 30 In a setback for Google Inc , a U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday that the low licensing rate Microsoft Corp pays to use some of Google's Motorola Mobility patents had been properly set.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said a lower court judge properly determined the patents' value even though the royalty rate was only a fraction of what Motorola had asked for. Google sold the Motorola handset business to Lenovo  last year but kept its patents.The court also upheld $14.5 million awarded to Microsoft for Motorola's breach of contract to license its patents fairly. Both Microsoft and Google declined to comment on the decision.The case has been broadly followed by the technology industry because it could affect how Google and others negotiate royalty rates on their technology. Microsoft sued Motorola in 2010, alleging Motorola had breached its obligation to offer licenses to wireless and video patents used in Xbox game consoles and Windows products at a reasonable cost.After a 2012 trial, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said the appropriate royalty rate was $1.8 million, far less than Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year. A jury later found Motorola in breach of contract. Google appealed the verdict and the royalty rate to the 9th Circuit. The dispute highlighted a debate over how much patent owners should be able to ask others to pay to use inventions that have become widely adopted in certain technologies.Apple, Intel and other companies filed court papers in support of Microsoft's position, while major patent licenser Qualcomm opposed Robart's calculation, saying it will devalue patents and cause ""incalculable damage"" to innovation.The case in the 9th Circuit is Microsoft Corp vs. Motorola Mobility Inc et al, 14-35393.

82,"  NEW YORK, July 30 Google Inc will have to make do with the low rate it must offer Microsoft Corp to use some of its Motorola Mobility patents after a U.S. appeals court on Thursday ruled the licensing rate had been properly set. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower court judge properly determined the patents' value even though the royalty rate was only a fraction of what Motorola had asked for. Google sold the Motorola handset business to Lenovo last year, but kept its patents.

98,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. Government Accountability Office on Tuesday upheld a protest by Harris Corp filed against the FBI's plans to award a sole-source contract to rival Motorola Solutions Inc for two-way radios under a larger umbrella contract.The congressional agency said the FBI violated federal regulations when it notified vendors that it planned to award two contracts worth $335 million to Motorola, shutting out four other companies that were authorized to supply equipment under a bigger contract with the Department of Homeland Security.
