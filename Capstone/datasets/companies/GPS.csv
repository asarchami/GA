8,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI When Gap Inc (GPS.N) began an online campaign ahead of the launch its Old Navy label in China, the iconic U.S. clothes retailer posed an important question to its potential Chinese consumers: have you heard of Old Navy? Only a few had.Brand awareness is one of the uphill battles Gap faces in China as the U.S. firm looks to increase its stake in the world's second largest clothing market, where it lags rivals H&M (HMb.ST), Japan's Uniqlo, owned by Fast Retailing Co Ltd (9983.T) and Inditex SA's (ITX.MC) Zara.Gap, which launched its first Old Navy store in Shanghai on Saturday, plans to open five stores of the value-end chain this year as well as adding 30 Gap stores to its current 81, Gap's Greater China president Jeff Kirwan told Reuters on Saturday.""Outside North America this is the largest opportunity for us, acknowledged by all the senior leadership in the company. This is the number one growth vehicle for the company,"" Kirwan said in an interview at Gap's Shanghai office.A bastion of the clothing sector in the United States, where it has around four percent of the apparel market, Gap entered China behind its rivals, setting up its first own-brand shop in 2010. It now has around 80 stores, around half the number of rivals H&M, Inditex-owned Zara and Uniqlo.""I hadn't heard of Old Navy before. I was just passing by and saw something going on. It was my sister who told me it was part of Gap,"" said Ji Yin, 30, queuing for the flagship store's launch in Shanghai's up-market Jing'an district.Gap's China team plans to invest in promoting brand awareness with local shoppers, especially online, to play into the rapid growth of China's e-commerce sector, a segment of the retail market that is unusually large.""We're putting a lot of attention into e-commerce for both brands,"" Kirwan said.They might need it. Gap's account on popular Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, has just 86,000 followers, a figure dwarfed by Uniqlo's 3.6 million Weibo fans. Old Navy, which joined Weibo in January, has just 3,700 followers so far. ""If you can get a social media buzz in China it goes fast and wide, because Chinese people are very well connected. Without one, it's difficult for a consumer brand in China. It's almost a must I would say,"" said Nick Debnam, Asia Pacific chairman for consumer markets at KPMG.FINDING A NICHE One hurdle facing Gap is that some consumers say it lacks the trendy image of Zara but prices itself above affordable rivals such as Uniqlo, a specialist in basic clothing items. Gap says with its Old Navy brand it will try to leverage an energetic and enthusiastic ""American voice"".""Gap's position in China is not very clear. It's outpaced by Zara on a fashion level and out-competed by Uniqlo on the concept of high-value basics,"" said Cherry Dai, Shanghai-based project manager at consulting firm SmithStreetSolutions.Price is also an factor for China's cost-conscious consumers. A pair of Gap women's jeans costs up to 599 yuan ($97.48), higher than around 299 yuan ($48.79) in Uniqlo and 399 yuan ($65.11) in H&M, according to a Reuters' analysis. Kirwan said the key rivals for Old Navy - where a similar item cost up to 299 yuan - would be Uniqlo and H&M.Uniqlo has 260 mainland China stores, and has Uniqlo plans to add up to 100 stores each year. Tiger Pan Ning, Uniqlo's Greater China CEO, told a press conference in Hong Kong on Friday that Uniqlo's wide store footprint, speed of openings, and its range of simple, everyday basics gave it a ""competitive edge"".In a market where low cost can be equated with low quality, however, price is not the only factor determining success.""The most important criteria is of course the clothes being good-looking. The price should also not be too low,"" said Wang Manxue, 21, a female student in Shanghai, who shops at France's Etam Developpement SCA (TAM.PA) and boutique Chinese brands. GROWTH PROSPECTS A shift towards mass market retail could work in Gap and Old Navy's favor. Lower-priced fast-fashion brands such as H&M and Zara beat store expansion goals last year, while two-thirds of high-end retailers missed their target.Other mid-range brands have also struggled in China. Esprit Holdings Ltd (0330.HK) shut 38 directly managed stores last year as it grappled with high rents, stalling sales and wholesalers with too much inventory.""I think Old Navy has a better shot (than Gap) of pushing deeper into China,"" said Kirwan, referring to its potential in lower tier cities, increasingly the engines for China growth.""We'll read the customer and if the customer is happy with the brand then we'll get very aggressive and move quickly.""Though launching a new brand from a standing start will require substantial capital spending, there is significant potential for growth in China despite fierce competition from both international and domestic rivals.""The China market is just huge at that price level,"" said Vincent Liu, Hong Kong-based consumer sector partner at consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group.

12,"  * Gap Inc to open 35 stores in China this year* Targets price-conscious shoppers with Old Navy brand* Will invest to boost online fans, lags rivals* China No. 1 growth vehicle for Gap - China headBy Adam JourdanSHANGHAI, March 1 When Gap Inc began an online campaign ahead of the launch its Old Navy label in China, the iconic U.S. clothes retailer posed an important question to its potential Chinese consumers: have you heard of Old Navy? Only a few had.Brand awareness is one of the uphill battles Gap faces in China as the U.S. firm looks to increase its stake in the world's second largest clothing market, where it lags rivals H&M , Japan's Uniqlo, owned by Fast Retailing Co Ltd  and Inditex SA's Zara.Gap, which launched its first Old Navy store in Shanghai on Saturday, plans to open five stores of the value-end chain this year as well as adding 30 Gap stores to its current 81, Gap's Greater China president Jeff Kirwan told Reuters on Saturday.""Outside North America this is the largest opportunity for us, acknowledged by all the senior leadership in the company. This is the number one growth vehicle for the company,"" Kirwan said in an interview at Gap's Shanghai office.A bastion of the clothing sector in the United States, where it has around four percent of the apparel market, Gap entered China behind its rivals, setting up its first own-brand shop in 2010. It now has around 80 stores, around half the number of rivals H&M, Inditex-owned Zara and Uniqlo.""I hadn't heard of Old Navy before. I was just passing by and saw something going on. It was my sister who told me it was part of Gap,"" said Ji Yin, 30, queuing for the flagship store's launch in Shanghai's up-market Jing'an district. Gap's China team plans to invest in promoting brand awareness with local shoppers, especially online, to play into the rapid growth of China's e-commerce sector, a segment of the retail market that is unusually large.""We're putting a lot of attention into e-commerce for both brands,"" Kirwan said.They might need it. Gap's account on popular Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, has just 86,000 followers, a figure dwarfed by Uniqlo's 3.6 million Weibo fans. Old Navy, which joined Weibo in January, has just 3,700 followers so far.""If you can get a social media buzz in China it goes fast and wide, because Chinese people are very well connected. Without one, it's difficult for a consumer brand in China. It's almost a must I would say,"" said Nick Debnam, Asia Pacific chairman for consumer markets at KPMG.FINDING A NICHE  One hurdle facing Gap is that some consumers say it lacks the trendy image of Zara but prices itself above affordable rivals such as Uniqlo, a specialist in basic clothing items. Gap says with its Old Navy brand it will try to leverage an energetic and enthusiastic ""American voice"".""Gap's position in China is not very clear. It's outpaced by Zara on a fashion level and out-competed by Uniqlo on the concept of high-value basics,"" said Cherry Dai, Shanghai-based project manager at consulting firm SmithStreetSolutions.Price is also an factor for China's cost-conscious consumers. A pair of Gap women's jeans costs up to 599 yuan ($97.48), higher than around 299 yuan ($48.79) in Uniqlo and 399 yuan ($65.11) in H&M, according to a Reuters' analysis.Kirwan said the key rivals for Old Navy - where a similar item cost up to 299 yuan - would be Uniqlo and H&M.Uniqlo has 260 mainland China stores, and has Uniqlo plans to add up to 100 stores each year. Tiger Pan Ning, Uniqlo's Greater China CEO, told a press conference in Hong Kong on Friday that Uniqlo's wide store footprint, speed of openings, and its range of simple, everyday basics gave it a ""competitive edge"".In a market where low cost can be equated with low quality, however, price is not the only factor determining success. ""The most important criteria is of course the clothes being good-looking. The price should also not be too low,"" said Wang Manxue, 21, a female student in Shanghai, who shops at France's Etam Developpement SCA and boutique Chinese brands.GROWTH PROSPECTS A shift towards mass market retail could work in Gap and Old Navy's favour. Lower-priced fast-fashion brands such as H&M and Zara beat store expansion goals last year, while two-thirds of high-end retailers missed their target.Other mid-range brands have also struggled in China. Esprit Holdings Ltd shut 38 directly managed stores last year as it grappled with high rents, stalling sales and wholesalers with too much inventory.""I think Old Navy has a better shot (than Gap) of pushing deeper into China,"" said Kirwan, referring to its potential in lower tier cities, increasingly the engines for China growth.""We'll read the customer and if the customer is happy with the brand then we'll get very aggressive and move quickly.""Though launching a new brand from a standing start will require substantial capital spending, there is significant potential for growth in China despite fierce competition from both international and domestic rivals.""The China market is just huge at that price level,"" said Vincent Lui, Hong Kong-based consumer sector partner at consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group.

13,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Alibaba's dominance of online retail in China faces its biggest-ever challenge as the firm founded by Jack Ma in a one-room apartment 15 years ago lines up a U.S. initial public offering that could value the firm at around $140 billion.In a rare blip, Alibaba Group Holdings lost market share last year while its nearest rivals all grew, according to Euromonitor. The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd, is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.""In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it's a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,"" said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin's company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba's Tmall.Alibaba's e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma's firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China's e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China's legions of smartphone users.Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm's e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week.PEELING AWAY Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery retailer Yihaodian. Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba's market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.""We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,"" said Wang.Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.""As a mature Internet brand we're looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,"" Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women's apparel retailers on Alibaba's platforms. ""We go and sell our products where the consumers are.""RIVALS RISING Alibaba's vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious. JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources.Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in ""the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market"", Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.""I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,"" said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. ""It's not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more.""Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop's online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year. Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart's global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.MA VS MA Alibaba's Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China's central bank.When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his company's Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent's WeChat.WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a ""killer weapon"" for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country's mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.""The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,"" said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.""Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,"" said Zhang.($1=6.14 Yuan)(Reporting by Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Additional reporting by Jane Lee in JINAN, Paul Carsten in HONG KONG and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-03-17,GPS,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 1:03am EDT","As giant U.S. IPO nears, Alibaba's China e-commerce crown slips",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-china-ecommerce-idUSBREA2G04T20140317?type=companyNews
14,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB-' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) for The Gap, Inc. (Gap). The Rating Outlook is Stable. The company  had $1.4 billion of debt outstanding at fiscal year-end Feb. 1, 2014. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is supported by Gap's improved operating results over the past two  years, strong free cash flow after dividends (FCF), and growth opportunities in  its online business, emerging markets and newer retail concepts. These factors  are balanced against its mature businesses in North America, declining mall  traffic, and some underlying fashion risk. Gap posted a second year of solid results in 2013, when comparable store sales  were up 2%, following a 5% increase in 2012. This growth reflected strong  customer response to the company's apparel offerings and healthy 21% growth in  online sales offsetting weakness in the company's international results due  primarily to declines in the Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen. Comp sales growth  slowed to 1% in the second half of 2013, and will likely track at or near that  level in 2014, driven by double digit growth in online sales (which is currently  adding approximately 3% to the consolidated comp), and modestly negative store  level comps.  Top-line sales will also be driven by square footage growth of around 2.5% in  2014, which represents the second year of expansion (0.8% growth in 2013)  following square footage declines from 2008 - 2012 when the company rationalized  its North American store base. Expansion is focused in Asia and emerging  markets, with the planned addition of 30 new Gap stores in China, 25 Old Navy  stores in Japan, as well as 30 new Athleta stores in the U.S. Fitch expects Gap  will continue to grow its square footage at a low single digit pace going  forward.  Gap's gross margin rate declined by 40bps (basis points) during 2013, reflecting  difficult competitive conditions in the second half, and particularly during the  holiday season. This was offset by a 130bp reduction in the SG&A ratio as the  company tightly managed its operating expenses. The result was a 90bp  improvement in the EBIT margin to 14.0% from 13.1% in 2012, and Fitch expects  EBIT margins will be relatively flat at around 14% in 2014. Financial leverage (adj. debt/EBITDAR) was flat at 2.9x at year-end 2013, as  growth in EBITDA to $2.7 billion from $2.5 billion in 2013 was offset by  modestly higher adjusted debt levels due primarily to higher rent expense (which  is capitalized at 8 times). Leverage is expected to be relatively steady going  forward at around 3x as growth in EBITDA is expected to offset the impact of  higher rent expense from international expansion.  Gap has maintained solid liquidity, with an unused $500 million revolver and  cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion as of year-end, compared with  management's stated cash target of $1.2 billion. In addition, the company  generated strong FCF after dividends of $714 million in 2013. Fitch expects FCF  to range from $700 - $800 million in 2014, and that it will be directed to share  repurchases. The company may also use some of its excess balance sheet cash for  share repurchases, but is nonetheless expected to retain sufficient cash to  handle its seasonal working capital needs without having to tap its $500 million  revolver.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include an extended period of positive sales momentum and margin  improvement and the maintenance of more conservative financial policies that  drive adjusted leverage toward the mid-to-high 2x range on a sustainable basis.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include a performance reversal and a more aggressive financial  posture that pushes adjusted leverage toward the mid 3x range.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: The Gap, Inc.  --IDR at 'BBB-';  --$500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB-';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'.

15,"  * Chinese giant's U.S. IPO may be biggest tech listing ever* Executive Vice Chair Joe Tsai eyes new e-commerce strands* Finance arm targets banking, credit cards and insurance* Tencent, banks and regulators stand in Alibaba's wayBy Paul Carsten and Matthew MillerHONG KONG/BEIJING, April 3 Alibaba, the world's biggest e-commerce company, changed how China shops. Now the man driving its blockbuster U.S. stock sale wants to transform the rest of the country's services industry, adding new users to the giant's 300 million customers.Joe Tsai, executive vice chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, sees an Alibaba future that stretches from banking to education, travel to entertainment. Customers will buy mutual funds using Alibaba mobile applications, safeguard homes with Alibaba insurance, and use Alibaba virtual credit cards to order goods from U.S. websites that will arrive on China's doorsteps in 10 days.On March 16, Alibaba said it's planning an initial public offering in the U.S. Analysts say it could be worth more than $16 billion. That would surpass Facebook Inc's  2012 listing, valuing Alibaba at over $140 billion.""In five to 10 years we're still going to be an e-commerce business, but the kind of things we sell on our platform will be a lot more diverse than just physical products,"" said Tsai in an interview with Reuters days before the IPO announcement.""We're going to be selling digital content, there's going to be services that will flow through our platforms,"" he said. ""Our vision is to become more a part of people's lives and fulfill all of their needs.""Alibaba already accounts for about 80 percent of all online shopping by individual consumers in China, which iResearch expects to reach 2.45 trillion yuan ($394 billion) this year.If Alibaba has seemed unstoppable in its 15-year rise, an IPO that could make it one of the world's most important technology companies comes as the firm faces its most serious challenges so far.Chief rival Tencent Holdings Ltd has the upper hand in mobile services, now the most important battleground for Chinese Internet companies. Alibaba's strategy of building a global e-commerce empire with its own financial services is attracting close scrutiny from China's regulators and resistance from the country's banks.There's more riding on Tsai's ability to pull off the giant IPO than just Alibaba's fortunes. Tsai found out himself, after Facebook's debut flop, that a high-profile failure can turn investors sour on a whole sector: In what he termed a ""hairy"" experience, an Alibaba plan to raise $10 billion in private funding that coincided with Facebook's listing nearly went awry as investors backed away from Internet companies.SHARP TACTICIAN Tsai declined to discuss specifics of Alibaba's IPO or its finances but on March 12 he told Reuters Alibaba would ""never"" change its partnership structure to list in Hong Kong.Alibaba's revenue climbed 60 percent to $4.9 billion for the nine months ended September, the latest period for which numbers have been published, according to filings by 24 percent shareholder Yahoo Inc. Net profit was $2.2 billion, a near eight-fold increase. Tsai, a 50-year-old Taiwan-born Yale law school graduate, has emerged as Alibaba's chief strategist and financial tactician. He left Swedish investment firm Investor AB's Hong Kong office in 1999 to join what was then founder Jack Ma's startup - Alibaba.Tsai served 14 years as Alibaba's chief financial officer, steering investment strategy and handling negotiations with big-buck investors like Yahoo and Japan's Softbank Corp , with its 37 percent stake.As Alibaba's executive vice chairman since early 2013, Tsai has taken on the role of driving more than $3.8 billion of investments in everything from digital mapping to online education.The strategy, said Tsai, has a single focus: to boost Alibaba's core e-commerce business, especially as consumers shop more on smartphones. ""We'll be sticking very close to our knitting, staying very true to our core business, e-commerce,"" said Tsai.INVENTING E-COMMERCE That business is huge. Take China's ""Singles' Day"", the annual Nov. 11 commercial celebration for people who are single that Alibaba has turned into the world's biggest online shopping day.Last time, goods sold on Alibaba's platforms were worth over 35 billion yuan ($5.63 billion). By comparison, the last U.S. ""Cyber Monday"" of year-end holiday sales online racked up $1.74 billion.""Alibaba effectively created the way e-commerce works in China,"" said Duncan Clark, managing director at Beijing-based technology advisor BDA. ""It took a lot of guts and a lot of capital,"" said Clark, hired as a consultant in Alibaba's early years, who introduced Ma at a Stanford University lecture in 2011. Alibaba today has over 25,000 employees. Its Taobao marketplace allows individuals and small businesses to sell directly to customers. Instead of collecting a fee on sales, like eBay Inc, it charges vendors to advertise.Alibaba's other big business, Tmall.com, is more like Amazon Inc. It provides an online storefront for brand-name companies like sportswear maker Nike Inc and clothing retailer Gap Inc, earning revenue from sales commissions and set-up fees.Connecting these businesses is Alipay, an online payment platform comparable to eBay's PayPal that allows consumers to skirt traditional bank payment systems. Alipay, part of Alibaba Small and Micro Financial Services Group and not part of any proposed listed company, controls almost half of China's online payment market.At home Alibaba is investing in financial services, housed within Alibaba Small and Micro Financial Services Group. It is buying a controlling stake in a local fund management firm, and laying the groundwork for a private bank.""We want to provide financial services to our customer base because we see that as an extension of what we do,"" said Tsai.Underpinning Alipay's financial services ambition is the trove of personal and corporate credit data it collects from customers. ""We hope that we can make changes to the financial system in China,"" said Tsai. ""As you know, the financial system in China is a little bit antiquated.""'WECHAT DOMINANT'  Successful as it has been, Alibaba faces its first serious challenges to future growth.As more than 80 percent of China's Internet users go online using mobile devices, rival Tencent, China's biggest Internet company by revenue, dominates smartphone usage through its WeChat app. On WeChat, users can update social network profiles, play games, book a taxi, shop and, as with Alipay, invest in a wealth management product.""WeChat has won China,"" said Ben Thompson, who writes about technology at stratechery.com in Taipei. ""It's going to be the dominant application.""Tsai disagrees. ""They have never been successful in e-commerce,"" he said. ""A chat app? We don't think that's important at all. If people want to shop they will use the (Alibaba) Taobao app.""Alibaba's independent financial services arm also faces a battle. The company's foothold in banking and fund management has irked China's big state-owned banks and attracted increased scrutiny and regulation from watchdogs.""There are a lot of vested interests that have been disrupted, and a lot of large banks are not happy,"" said Tsai.Banks are worried about the wide popularity of online wealth management products, which Alipay pioneered only last year. In nine months, its Yu'e Bao platform is now home to China's biggest money market fund by offering interest rates almost double the amount China's traditional banks are allowed to offer on one-year deposits.China's biggest state banks have responded by cutting how much their customers can spend on online payment services, while the country's central bank is discussing draft regulations to tighten restrictions on Internet banking.  .WINNING HABIT Tsai is used to making things work.Two years ago, his skills were tested when Alibaba needed to raise about $10 billion in private funding to buy back shares from Yahoo and delist Alibaba.com, a business-to-business e-commerce unit then traded in Hong Kong, as the first step on the path to Alibaba's IPO.However, the fundraising coincided with the troubled Facebook IPO, when shares slumped on their debut.""We had planned on going on the road to start to raise capital (for a bank syndicated loan) for the transaction, and then the Facebook IPO happened,"" said Tsai. ""Literally overnight, because of the Facebook experience, most of the institutional investors were turned off by Internet companies.""Alibaba eventually raised the capital from lenders - just two days before the deadline. ""That was pretty hairy,"" Tsai said.Now, Tsai is joining other Chinese Internet companies in listing in the U.S. E-commerce rival JD.com plans a $1.5 billion IPO, while Weibo Corp, 18 percent-owned by Alibaba, is seeking a $500 million listing.Though important, the IPO won't distract Alibaba from its core mission, Tsai said.""When you look at Alibaba you really should think of us as one of the largest technology companies in the world. And technology companies innovate.""

16,"  (Adds details on Gap Inc sales)By Phil WahbaApril 10 Family Dollar Stores Inc, seeking to reverse declining sales and profit, said on Thursday it is slashing prices to win shoppers, cutting jobs, and shutting hundreds of stores.Other retailers, including Gap Inc, posted disappointing monthly sales and store traffic.Family Dollar, which caters to lower-income shoppers, many living paycheck to paycheck, reported sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.8 percent in the quarter ended March 1. It expects sales to decline this quarter, too.Family Dollar Chief Executive Officer Howard Levine, on a call with investors, pointed to ""a more financially constrained consumer,"" echoing recent comments from rivals. Wal-Mart Stores Inc a few weeks ago said sharp cuts in food stamp benefits and higher payroll taxes had pinched its customers.""There's still in a big part of the economy where price matters,"" said Wharton Business School professor Barbara Kahn.A group of U.S. retailers posted sales figures that suggested  consumers remained cautious in March.The Thomson Reuters Same Store Sales Index, which tracks monthly sales at stores open at least a year at some key retailers, registered a 2.2 percent increase for March, below last year's result of 2.7 percent.Gap Inc reported a 6 percent decline in comparable sales, with store traffic at its namesake clothes stores ""well below"" its expectations. Sales also fell at its Banana Republic and Old Navy stores. To be sure, retailers were not helped by cold weather last month and a later Easter, which this year will fall on April 20.The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dipped to 80.0 in March from 81.6 in February, its lowest point since November.Apparel retailers Victoria Secret parent company L Brands Inc, Cato Corp, The Buckle Inc, and Zumiez Inc all reported same-store sales declines for March, while Stein-Mart Inc reported a smaller increase than Wall Street analysts expected.Rite Aid Corp reported a 5 percent decline in same-store sales of general merchandise. But the drugstore company gave a better-than-expected profit for its new fiscal year, and shares rose 10 percent to $7.04, their highest level since 2001.Costco Wholesale Corp reported a better-than-expected 5 percent increase in March same-store sales. The S&P Retail Index closed down 2.1 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent decline for the broader S&P 500  L. Brands shares were down 5.2 percent.

The market research firm sees China's internet retail market tripling from 2012 to over $300 billion in 2018 as the country's smartphone-savvy shoppers buy everything from plane tickets to sneakers online.China's biggest social media company, Tencent Holdings Ltd , is leading the revolt, linking the country's most popular messaging app, WeChat, with the number two e-commerce player, JD.com.An array of smaller rivals is also clawing away at Alibaba's lead, while household retail names like Nike Inc and Gap Inc are increasingly striking out away from the giant's Tmall electronic platform to set up more distinctive online stores of their own.""In China shopping is a social activity. You want to tell friends about it, recommend it - it's a smartphone activity, and whoever owns that organisational ability also has a hold over how a person shops,"" said Frank Lavin, Hong Kong-based chief executive of Export Now. Lavin's company helps global firms set up shop in China through Alibaba's Tmall.Alibaba's e-commerce prospects at home loom large after Ma's firm said on Sunday it was starting plans for a long-awaited listing in the U.S. - potentially the biggest-ever IPO by an Internet company - which could surpass the $16 billion raised by social media giant Facebook Inc in 2012.Alibaba still held a sturdy 45.1 percent of China's e-commerce market last year, down from 46.1 percent a year earlier, according to Euromonitor, and remains bullish in the face of Tencent, JD.com and others. It is beefing up its mobile services to keep up with China's legions of smartphone users.Alibaba did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, though the firm's executive vice chairman Joe Tsai was upbeat about the firm's e-commerce prospects in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong last week. PEELING AWAY Alibaba is now battling rivals on multiple fronts. Alongside JD.com, heading for a $1.5 billion IPO of its own in the U.S., are well-funded vehicles like household appliance retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's grocery retailer Yihaodian.Smaller niche players like cosmetics specialist Vipshop Holdings Ltd are also growing in stature. And with global and local brands peeling away from Tmall, the trend is likely to see Alibaba's market share extend its fall, said Bryan Wang, Beijing-based vice president for Forrester Research.""We have definitely seen a lot more customers asking us in the last year about how to get away from Tmall,"" said Wang.Popular Internet clothing retailer HSTYLE has partly flown the nest. Competing with brands like H&M and Uniqlo, it has branched out from just having a Tmall outlet and now books half its sales through its own site and on JD.com and Tencent.""As a mature Internet brand we're looking to provide more individual service to our shoppers,"" Zhao Yingguang, founder and chairman of HSTYLE, told Reuters in an interview, describing his brand as one of the leading women's apparel retailers on Alibaba's platforms. ""We go and sell our products where the consumers are."" RIVALS RISING Alibaba's vast resources have helped it see off weaker players so far such as Otto Group, 139shop.com, Mecox Lane, Newegg.com and others, but the remaining contenders are more seasoned in competition with Alibaba - and ambitious.JD.com still lags some way behind Alibaba in second place with a 14 percent market share last year, up fractionally from a year earlier. But its IPO plans and the deal with Tencent - a less well-known name outside China than Alibaba, but worth almost $150 billion by market value - will give it new financial and operational resources.Tencent, meanwhile, hopes its JD.com tie-up will help it to extend its presence in ""the fast-growing physical goods e-commerce market"", Tencent president Martin Lau said in a statement. The deal also arms JD.com with the 225 million monthly active users of the WeChat messaging service in China.As well as technology leading change, consumers themselves are developing new habits, becoming more picky and looking to get more for their money.""I am leaning toward specialist stores now, because the service is often better than the giant retailers and the delivery I always find is faster,"" said Grace Lin, 20, a student in Shanghai. ""It's not necessarily that I use Tmall less now, but I do use other stores more."" Lin often shops on cosmetics specialist Vipshop's online site. The firm saw revenue climb 145 percent in 2013, while customer numbers shot up 130 percent over the same period, according to an earnings conference call this month. Vipshop almost doubled its market share to 1.8 percent last year.Suning, a traditional electronics retailer with a strong bricks and mortar presence, is bulking up its online presence, as is rival Bain Capital-backed Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. Both raised their market share last year.Yihaodian leverages majority owner Wal-Mart's global name and product range, while other niche players such as Jumei and Yesmywine.com corner specific markets in cosmetics and alcohol.MA VS MA Alibaba's Jack Ma has locked horns repeatedly of late with his rival at Tencent, co-founder Pony Ma - a namesake but unrelated. Rhetoric from the two internet giants has grown increasingly barbed as competition has raged from gaming and microblogs, to taxi hire app price wars and online payment systems that are now the subject of close scrutiny by China's central bank.When Tencent launched a ""red envelope"" feature for WeChat, which let users send money gifts by smartphone over the Chinese New Year, Jack Ma wrote it was a ""Pearl Harbour attack"" on his company's Alipay payment system, referring to the unexpected bombing of the American port during World War II. Tencent said over 8 million people used the WeChat feature.Alibaba-invested Weibo Corp, a popular Twitter-like social media platform, filed for a $500 million U.S. IPO of its own on Friday, as it looks to defend its position against fierce competition from Tencent's WeChat.WeChat does indeed present a threat to Alibaba. In a research report in December, Standard Chartered said its payment function, known in Chinese as Weixin, paired with its wide popularity, could be a ""killer weapon"" for Tencent to take market share in mobile e-commerce.China has some of the most active mobile web users in the world. The country's mobile Internet users hit 500 million in 2013, and is estimated to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.""The wind is blowing against Alibaba and the biggest risk is coming from the mobile sector,"" said Zhang Chenhao, executive director at e-commmerce-focused investment advisory firm Gold Sand Capital.""Firms are all lining up - the school of Tencent or the school of Alibaba - and the camps are forming,"" said Zhang.($1=6.14 Yuan)   (Reporting by Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Additional reporting by Jane Lee in JINAN, Paul Carsten in HONG KONG and SHANGHAI newsroom; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-07-14,GPS,"Mon Jul 14, 2014 | 12:59am EDT","CORRECTED-RPT-As giant U.S. IPO nears, Alibaba's China e-commerce crown slips",http://www.reuters.com//article/china-ecommerce-graphicspixtvrepeatcorre-idUSL3N0ME17U20140714?type=companyNews

So she does a lot of mixing and matching.""I don't blindly follow what they put out,"" LePard said of store displays. ""I don't want to wear just one brand. I don't want to be a stereotype.""She's hardly alone. Recent surveys have found that members of the U.S. Millennial Generation - the roughly 80 million Americans born between 1977 and 2000 - pride themselves on their individuality, and shop accordingly.Compared with their parents, millennials are far less likely to identify with a political party or to formally affiliate with a religion - key indicators of an independent streak - according to Pew Research Center. As shoppers, they are less attached to brands and more willing to create their own style, surveys by Nielsen, The Boston Consulting Group and other researchers have found.This generational trait is forcing retailers to rethink everything from their merchandise and marketing to their dressing rooms and logos. Some companies, including H&M and Urban Outfitters Inc, have ridden the individuality wave while others, such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale, have been slow to react and are paying the price.At stake is the $600 billion millennials spend a year in the United States, according to Accenture, a sum that's projected to grow to an estimated $1.4 trillion in 2020, when the oldest of the cohort will be 43.

Accustomed to building Facebook pages and other online identities, millennials are comfortable with the notion of mixing and matching different elements of their persona, a trait that carries over into their shopping choices, according to analysts and academics.     To reach this first generation of ""digital natives,"" it's no longer enough for stores to offer a rack and a dressing room. ""People are looking to create a unique identity,"" said Allen Adamson, an author and branding expert at Landor Associates. ""They want to put together their own story rather than have someone else tell them.""In addition to an inviting website and easy payment system, retailers are trying to make shopping more exciting for this over-stimulated generation. At H&M's midtown Manhattan store, for example, shoppers can strut their stuff on the store's fashion walk and then possibly have their video selected to be displayed outside.Gap is stressing that same aspiration with its new ""dress normal"" ad campaign, which uses taglines such as ""dress like no one's watching"" and ""simple clothes for you to complicate."" Sales at Gap stores fell 5 percent in the last quarter. The company said the ad campaign is aimed at customers who want to ""dress for themselves.""That certainly describes Brianne Casey, a 24-year-old New Yorker, who studied marketing and now works as an assistant to a buyer for a retail chain.Casey said she shops at a variety of stores to get the best prices and follows fashion trends on blogs to see what's hot. But in the end, she said, ""I like creating my own style.""

40,"   By Prak Chan Thul | PHNOM PENH, Sept 17  PHNOM PENH, Sept 17 Cambodia deployed armed troops in its capital on Wednesday as garment workers held rallies to revive a campaign for higher wages that had helped to stoke a year-long political crisis.About 500 textile workers rallied in an industrial suburb of Phnom Penh, demanding a sharp hike in the monthly minimum wage to $177 from $100, as dozens of soldiers armed with assault rifles watched. Witnesses said army helicopters flew over the factories earlier.About 100 police were also deployed at economic zones in Svay Rieng province, bordering Vietnam, where garment workers also gathered, Pav Sina, president of the Collective Union Movement of Workers, told Reuters.""Why is our government so afraid of its own people, especially people who are only protesting to earn a basic salary?"" said Naly Pilorge, director of rights group Licadho.Licardo said two union leaders were arrested by police.But no incidents of violence were reported.The growth of the garment sector has become a vital but troublesome issue for the government of long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen. It has been a boon for the fledgling economy, providing as many as half a million jobs and generating $5 billion annually, but frequent protests by increasingly assertive unions have tested the government's patience.At stake if the campaign leads to prolonged strikes is the possibility of reduced orders from firms that outsource to Cambodian factories, such as Gap, Nike, H & M Hennes & Mauritz and Zara, owned by Inditex.""We want to send a message to all buyers that they must provide a basic wage,"" Ath Thon, president of the biggest independent union, the Coalition of Cambodian Apparel Workers Democratic Union, told reporters at the rally. VIOLENT CRACKDOWN Cambodia's garment sector is dwarfed by those in China and Vietnam, but lower wages have lured brands to the country. However, complaints about ""sweat shop"" working conditions and a crackdown by security forces in January, which killed at least five people, could damage the reputations of the brands.Instability in Cambodia comes as Myanmar offers generous tax breaks to manufacturers and Vietnam, which exported $18 billion worth of textiles last year, negotiates a raft of global trade deals to slash tariffs. Ath Thon said an alliance of union activists was also lending support for Wednesday's campaign in numerous capital cities by delivering petitions to Cambodian embassies and high street stores selling garments made in Cambodia.IndustriALL, which represents 50 million workers in 140 countries, said campaign activities had taken place in Australia, Belgium and Switzerland.""They understand that Cambodia's garment sector has victimized many workers and when they couldn't receive the basic wage, they protested and got killed,"" Ath Thon said, adding that 400,000 Cambodian textile workers participated in the campaign.The long-running dispute over pay looked to have been settled prior to last year's election, when the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia agreed to gradually raise the minimum wage to $160 by 2018.But things changed when the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) made an election campaign pledge to raise the figure further. CNRP won support from textile unions during its months of street protests to demand a re-run of a July 2013 poll it said was rigged by the ruling party.CNRP struck a deal with the Cambodian People's Party two months ago to end its year-long parliamentary boycott and a fragile truce remains, although it is unclear whether CNRP is backing the latest wage campaign.

41,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  Gap Inc (GPS.N) Chief Executive Glenn Murphy will retire in February and hand over the reins of the apparel retailer to its digital business head Art Peck, as the company looks to tap customers' increasing preference for online shopping. Shares of Gap, which reported weaker-than-expected same-store sales for September, fell about 8 percent in extended trading.Peck's appointment comes into effect on Feb. 1, Gap said in a statement. He will also join the board of the company, which owns fashion brands such as Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy. ""I don't think there will be a massive shift in strategy going forward,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar told Reuters. Peck, 58, joined Gap in 2005 after more than 20 years at Boston Consulting Group. He headed Gap's North America business, which accounts for more than three-quarters of its revenue, in 2011 and 2012.   ""I think he has the relevant experience necessary to continue to execute on ongoing strategic initiatives, including global expansion, digital and margin expansion,"" Weishaar said. Gap has been looking to reduce its dependence on the highly competitive North American market. The retailer said in August that it would open 40 stores in India as part of its plan to expand in emerging markets. The company had 80 stores in China at the end of 2013. ""We'll have 110 stores in the country by the end of this year and we predict China can become a billion-dollar market for Gap in the coming years,"" Peck said on a conference call.  Murphy, 52, took over as Gap's CEO in July 2007. Since then, Gap's market value has nearly tripled. While the company's earnings have risen 54 percent in the period, revenue growth has been relatively disappointing at 2.4 percent.Gap also said Bob Fisher, an independent director with a 35-year history with the company founded by his parents, would become the non-executive chairman of its board. The company reported flat same-store sales for September, hurt by weak sales in its Gap brand. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 1.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.The apparel retailer said weak sales in the Gap brand were expected to hurt margins in the third quarter. Gap's shares were at $38.60 in heavy trading after the bell. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had risen about 7 percent this year.

54,"  (Adds Gap results, analyst comment)By Sruthi RamakrishnanJan 8 U.S. teen apparel retailers American Eagle Outfitters Inc and Aeropostale Inc said business in the holiday shopping quarter was better than they had expected as margins improved due to fewer discounts.Makers of teen apparel, one of the weakest retail sections, were expected to have a tough holiday season as shoppers cut spending on discretionary items and paid fewer visits to malls.So, most apparel makers cut inventories to avoid discounting heavily during the last few weeks of the holiday period when promotions and offers peak as retailers scramble to get rid of unsold stock.Teen apparel retailers, scarred by bloated inventories in the 2013 holiday period due to a severe winter, spent less on inventory this time around and chose, instead, to invest in their online business. This strategy combined with a revival in consumer sentiment also helped apparel retailer Gap Inc report a 3 percent rise in same-store sales in the holiday season.Gap said December comparable sales rose 1 percent, higher than the 0.4 percent rise estimated by research firm Consensus Metrix, helped by the Old Navy brand. American Eagle raised its fourth-quarter profit forecast and Aeropostale said it expected a smaller loss for the same period.""We think consumers are healing as evidenced by better sales and we expect inventories to be clean following a strong Holiday,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.While promotional intensity in apparel category continues to persist, strong inventory control is helping retailers preserve their gross margin, Cowen and Co analyst Oliver Chen told Reuters. The fall in Aeropostale's same-store sales slowed to 9 percent in the nine weeks ended Jan. 3 from 15 percent a year earlier, while the drop in American Eagle's comparable sales slowed to 2 percent from 7 percent.Aeropostale's shares rose as much as 26.5 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. American Eagle's shares, however, fell as much as 5.2 percent.Analysts said it was premature to say whether American Eagle's recent uptick in sales and profit trends would continue.""We believe it is too soon to declare victory and we lack visibility that these positive trends will continue,"" Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Richard Jaffe wrote in a note.

Growth outside its home turf is key to Fast Retailing reaching its target of becoming the world's top apparel retailer ahead of Zara-owner Inditex SA, Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M) and Gap Inc in coming years.In September-November, the first quarter of the firm's fiscal year, overseas sales at its Uniqlo casual-wear chain jumped 47 percent from a year earlier. That helped drive a 40 percent rise in operating profit to 91.4 billion yen ($763 million), beating the average estimate of 77.71 billion yen in a Thomson Reuters poll of four analysts.The company left its operating profit outlook for the year through August unchanged at 180 billion yen, but suggested it may have grounds to lift that target in future after its quarterly results came in better than expected. ""After the autumn/winter season, when things are clear after looking at each business and foreign exchange rates, we will consider a revision if needed,"" Chief Financial Officer Takeshi Okazaki told a news conference on Thursday.Overseas sales at Uniqlo, known for its HeatTech fabric technology and rainbow coloured-basics, were particularly strong in Asia, led by greater China and South Korea, Fast Retailing said. Still, the United States was a weak spot. Uniqlo sales in Japan rose 12 percent, with its HeatTech line, Ultra Light Down jackets and other winter items selling well.Spending per customer also grew after the company hiked prices 5 percent to offset the weaker yen, a factor that raises import costs.Okazaki said Uniqlo Japan may have to raise prices again given the sharp depreciation in the yen. The Japanese currency is now down almost 20 percent versus the dollar since last summer.Uniqlo Japan sales made up 48.5 percent of Fast Retailing's overall sales during the quarter. That marks the first time they have accounted for under 50 percent, as sales at Uniqlo overseas and other brands, including Theory, GU and Princesse tam.tam, accelerated.Fast Retailing shares have jumped more than a third since the start of its fiscal year in September, outperforming a roughly 8 percent rise in Japan's broad Topix index. The stock closed up 2.3 percent before the results announcement.

Piperlime generated less than $100 million in annual sales.The company, whose namesake brand saw a 4 percent drop in store sales in November and a 5 percent drop in December, said Bay will leave the company immediately.

The company last month eliminated the role of Gap brand creative director Rebekka Bay, and in October said digital head business' Art Peck would take over as CEO.Comparable sales at Gap brand stores fell 6 percent in the fourth quarter, while those at Banana Republic rose 1 percent.The company said net income rose to $319 million, or 75 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, from $307 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose 2.8 percent to $4.71 billion. Overall comparable sales rose 2 percent.Excluding items, the company earned 75 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 74 cents per share on revenue of $4.71 billion.

65,"  MEXICO CITY Feb 27 Mexico's Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (GAP), which operates airports along Mexico's Pacific Coast, on Friday said its fourth-quarter profit fell 30 percent on weak revenue and a less favorable tax bill.The company reported a profit of 627 million pesos ($42.5 million), compared to a profit of 896 million pesos in the year-earlier quarter that included a 207 million peso tax benefit.

The companies can then reduce over-staffing and under-staffing.His requests come as workers' advocates claim success in efforts to increase pay and benefits at fast food companies and national retailers, including recent raises of minimum wages by McDonald's Corp and Wal Mart Stores Inc.Schneiderman said the ""on-call"" practice might violate the law in New York, where employers are subject to a rule that says employees who report for a scheduled shift on any day have to be paid for at least four hours at the basic minimum hourly wage. Target said workers are informed of their schedules 10 days before the start of a work week and it does not employ ""on-call"" shifts. JC Penney said it has a policy against on-call scheduling.

Schneiderman asked the retailers to provide details on the processes they follow to schedule on-call shifts, such as whether they use computerized systems and penalize employees who do not follow on-call procedures.He also asked the companies for any analysis they might have conducted on cost savings associated with on-call shifts and the impact on workers' wellbeing.

71,"  * FY sales growth seen at top end or above 20-25 pct target* Operating margin target lifted to 4.5 pct* Q1 helped by early spring, better trend forecasting* Q2 starts well, Gap deal to help* Shares up 0.4 percent   (Adds details, background, quotes)By Emma Thomasson BERLIN, May 12 Europe's largest dedicated online fashion retailer Zalando lifted its forecast for sales and profit growth for 2015 on Tuesday after an early start to the spring and less discounting drove a strong first quarter.The company, which had already rushed out better-than-expected preliminary results last month, said it now expects full-year sales to rise at the top end or slightly above the 20-25 percent corridor it had previously predicted.It lifted its target for an adjusted operating margin to 4.5 percent from a previous expectation to stay around the level of 3.7 percent it recorded in 2014. Zalando shares, which listed in Frankfurt last October at 21.50 euros and have already risen 10 percent this year, traded up 0.4 percent to 28.11 euros by 0758 GMT.The company founded in 2008, which only moved into the black at the end of last year, reported first-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 29 million euros ($32.57 million), compared with a year-earlier loss of 23 million. The Berlin-based firm also said sales accelerated from the previous quarter to rise 28.5 percent to 644 million euros, with growth stronger than it expected in its core markets of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.Management board member Ruben Ritter said the rise was driven by an early start to spring as well as less discounting than a year ago due to Zalando becoming more nimble in responding to trends like booming demand for sneakers.""In the second quarter, the positive momentum continues,"" he told a conference call for journalists, adding he expected that the period would also be helped by the imminent launch of sales on its site of garments from U.S. chain Gap.The firm, which now ships 1,500 brands to customers in 15 countries, has said it expects to increase its staff to about 10,000 by the end of 2015 from around 8,000 now, hiring particularly in the tech and logistics field.($1 = 0.8903 euros)   (Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Maria Sheahan)",2015-05-12,GPS,"Tue May 12, 2015 | 4:11am EDT",UPDATE 1-Zalando more optimistic for 2015 after strong quarter,http://www.reuters.com//article/zalando-results-idUSL5N0Y31MD20150512?type=companyNews

74,"   By Ramkumar Iyer  Apparel retailer Gap Inc (GPS.N) reported an 8 percent fall in quarterly profit, hurt by a stronger dollar, supply delays in the United States and lower demand for its namesake brand.A series of fashion misses have turned shoppers away from the Gap brand toward fast fashion chains such as H&M, Inditex's (ITX.MC) Zara and Forever 21.The women's clothing business at the Gap brand has been a challenge for several seasons due to quality and fit issues and for being out of trend, Chief Executive Art Peck said during a post-earnings conference call.""We are off trend and in some cases, way off the brand,"" he said.A substantial and sustainable improvement at the Gap brand should not be expected before spring 2016, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe said.Gap's Old Navy line, however, has attracted more customers with its affordable-yet-trendy merchandise, helping it become the largest brand by sales in the company's portfolio. Comparable sales at Old Navy increased 3 percent in the first quarter. A stronger dollar hit quarterly sales by $90 million and hurt profit by 3 percent in the first quarter ended May 2, Gap said on Thursday.The dollar .DXY gained about 0.7 percent against a basket of currencies in the February-April quarter.Shipment delays due to strikes at West Coast ports also hurt sales at U.S. stores as fewer items were available for sale, the company said. Gap's second-quarter results are also expected to be weighed down by late shipments, as the company will likely have to offer discounts on delayed merchandise, Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Simmons said on the call.Total comparable sales fell 4 percent, while comparable sales fell 10 percent at the Gap brand and 8 percent at Banana Republic. Teen apparel retailer Aeropostale Inc ARO.N on Thursday estimated a bigger-than-expected second-quarter loss, citing low demand, disruptions at the West Coast ports and store closures. Gap said net income fell to $239 million, or 56 cents per share, from $260 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average estimated a profit of 56 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell 3 percent to $3.66 billion.The San Francisco, California-based company's shares closed at $38.56 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Thursday's close, they had fallen 8 percent this year.

GAP said its internal statutes prevented a single shareholder from holding more than 10 percent of the company.GAP's lawyer, Virgilio Rincon, told reporters the ruling meant Grupo Mexico would have to trim its stake in GAP to 10 percent from a current 24 percent. ""Today legality won and there will be an orderly sale in the market without affecting the interests of investors,"" he said.A source with knowledge of Grupo Mexico's thinking said the decision in favor of GAP was a surprise for the Grupo Mexico and that it would now have no other option but to sell its GAP shares to get its stake below 10 percent. ""There's no other way,"" the person said.The source described Grupo Mexico's long-running effort to increase its stake in GAP as a pet project of Grupo Mexico's publicity-shy chief executive, German Larrea.Grupo Mexico did not responded immediately to requests for comment. GAP said in a statement that the ruling upheld its statutes, which it has long defended.Shares of GAP, which runs airports in 12 Mexican cities, including Guadalajara and Tijuana, were down 1.5 percent at 107.40 pesos, while those of Grupo Mexico fell 1.39 percent to 47.72 pesos.

All times in ET/GMT)       WEEK AHEAD      The stragglers for the earnings season - Home Depot, Wal-Mart and a few others - will report results to close out the quarter next week, with expectations that retailers would see decent sales after recent revisions show better-than-expected activity in the second quarter. The markets will also continue to watch the Chinese yuan after its unexpected devaluation this week, with anticipation that the dollar will strengthen a bit more, boosting bond-market activity in what is otherwise expected to be a slower week.      Fed minutes are released on Wednesday and will be parsed for clues of an interest rate rise. The Changes in the July statement pointed to an improving economy and labor markets. Characterization of the debate in the minutes could indicate how firm opinions are about the state of the U.S., and how confident members are that inflation and employment will move towards the Fed's target levels. Investors will also look for the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 0.2 percent in July, a bit down from a rise of 0.3 percent in June. Housing data, including housing starts and building permits on Tuesday and existing home sales on Thursday will be in focus. The Conference Board releases its Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity on Thursday.      Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp release its results for the second quarter. Wal-Mart is expected to report better-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday, while Target is expected to miss estimates when it reports on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, TJX Cos Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The off-price retailer is expected to be helped by lower gas prices, wage growth, and higher traffic to its stores as more consumers hunt for bargains. A hike in the number and quality of brands in its stores and merchandise that reflects popular fashion trends is also expected to drive sales. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on industry trends and plans to expand in international markets.      Home Depot Inc, the world's No. 1 home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimate on Tuesday. Strong housing market data over the last few months is expected to have kept overall demand for home improvement goods steady. However, record rainfall in May and June in large parts of the United States is likely to have kept a lid on sales of products in the home exterior improvement categories, such as paint and gardening supplies. Lowe's Companies Inc, the second-largest U.S. home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimates on Wednesday.      Hardware and software maker Hewlett-Packard Co is expected to report third-quarter earnings slightly above analysts' average estimate on Thursday. HP has been cutting costs and focusing on higher-margin sales in the face of a strong dollar and weak enterprise demand for its services. The company is also in the processes of separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.      Salesforce.com Inc, the world's biggest maker of online sales software, is expected to report a second-quarter profit above analysts' average estimate. Salesforce has struggled to earn consistent profits despite strong revenue growth over the past few years, hurt by higher spending on hiring. The company reported a profit for the first time in seven quarters in May. On Thursday, the investors will look for improvement in margins in the quarter and merger-related comments.      Data storage equipment maker NetApp Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue on Wednesday slightly above average analysts' estimate. NetApp, which cut about 500 jobs in May, has been trying to boost growth by focusing on cloud-based products as businesses cut spending on high-end storage systems. The company appointed George Kurian as its new CEO in June to replace Tom Georgens. Investors would be looking for second-quarter forecast.      On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota speaks before the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Price Measurement Issues in a Low Inflation Environment"" conference, in Seoul, South Korea. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco releases the text of the speech Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams delivered before the Bank Indonesia-BIS Research Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia.      Apparel retailer Gap Inc is expected to report a second-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday. Out of fashion merchandise and a general lack of trendy products have led to a decline in sales at the company's flagship Gap brand, leading to heavy discounts. Shipment delays caused due to disruptions at the West Coast ports early this year and a strong dollar are also expected to hurt the company's results in the quarter. Investors will look for comments on recovery at the Gap brand and performance in the current quarter.      On Wednesday, teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The earnings beat is expected to be driven by trendy, fashionable merchandise, lower discounts, benefits from lower cotton prices and tight inventory controls. American Eagle is also benefiting from a new multi-channel distribution center that allows it to control inventories more efficiently by enabling it to supply to its brick-and-mortar as well as online stores. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on promotions and trends, and expectations for the back-to-school shopping season.      Agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co has been hurt by a strong dollar as well as weak demand for its farm and turf equipment, which make up about two-thirds of its annual revenue. Falling U.S. farm income and weak commodity prices have reduced spending on new equipment by farmers. In May, Deere forecast a fall in global sales for its farm equipment in 2015 and said it would close plants and cut jobs. When the company reports its third-quarter results on Friday, the investors will be looking for an update on the company's plans to shutter more factories to adjust to lower demand, as well as whether it is expected to take a hefty charge on a tractor recall announced earlier in August. They will also be looking for more information on a fire in a chemical warehouse in China last week that left some Deere workers critically injured.      Friday data is expected to show that Canada's June retail sales have increased a little, compared with the previous month's reading. It is likely to have risen 0.2 percent, compared with a rise of 1.0 percent in May. Canada's inflation data is also out on Friday. Country's annual inflation is likely to have advanced 1.4 percent in July, up from 1.0 percent in June. Statistics Canada releases June wholesale trade data on Thursday.      On Thursday, Mexico's statistics institute will release GDP data for the second quarter, after the central bank said it sees quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.3 percent for the period, slackening from the first quarter after weaker-than-expected exports and a slump in domestic oil output. The same day, data with show how economic activity fared in June, after slowing to a nine-month low in May. On Friday, retail sales data for June will show how domestic spending performed after rebounding by 0.2 percent in May.           MONDAY, AUGUST 17      U.S. homebuilder sentiment is expected to stay strong in August as the National Association of Home Builders's NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index is likely to show an increase to 61 from 60 in July, which was the highest since November 2005. (1000/1400) Also, the New York Federal Reserve releases its New York Fed's Empire State general business conditions index for August. (0830/1230)      Beauty products company Estee Lauder Co Inc has been seeing a revival in sales in North America, helped by product launches and acquisitions. However, Estee has to increase promotions in its flagship Clinique and Estee Lauder brands which have shown some weakness. The company's smaller brands such as Smashbox and Bobbi Brown have seen a rise in demand, helped by their extensive online presence. Even as sales in overseas markets like the UK and China grow by double digit percentages, a stronger dollar in the past few quarters has stripped their value. The company is expected to beat revenue and profit estimates for the fourth quarter. Investors will be keen on 2016 forecast, updates on acquisitions and the impact of the dollar.      Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales slightly above analysts' average estimates. The beat is expected to be driven by strong performance at the flagship Urban Outfitters brand, which accounts for a majority of sales, but margins are expected to be pressured by higher promotions at the Anthropologie brand, where sales growth has slowed in recent quarters. The company is also benefiting from investments in its fast-growing e-commerce and online division. Investors will look for commentary on sales recovery at the Anthropologie brand, promotions, and updates on performance for the back-to-school shopping season.

91,"  YANGON Aug 29 Myanmar has set a minimum wage of 3,600 kyat ($2.80) for an eight-hour work day, a move likely to boost investment in the fast-growing country's garment industry.The decision on a minimum wage, which follows two years of often acrimonious debate between garment factory owners and labour unions, was announced on Saturday.Myanmar's government has targeted garments for rapid growth, and Saturday's statement may help spur this, as it gives clarity on the law and labour costs to global apparel brands buying clothes from Myanmar.Companies that have pushed for creation of a minimum wage include giant Swedish retailer Hennes & Mauritz, which works with 13 factories in Myanmar, and U.S. retailer Gap Inc , which buys from two.Once a thriving industry, Myanmar's garment sector was hit hard by sanctions imposed by the United States, stripped of trade benefits and abandoned by brands who feared the reputational risk associated with the former junta.In a bid to change this, Myanmar lawmakers passed a minimum wage law in 2013, but negotiations between employers, trade unions and the government were delayed by garment workers' strikes and threats from garment factory owners - many from China and South Korea - to close if the minimum wage was set too high. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE  Under the newly-established level, Myanmar's minimum monthly pay would be around $67 a month, based on a six-day work week, giving it a competitive advantage over thriving garment makers such as Vietnam and Cambodia where the monthly minimum wage ranges from $90 to $128, according to the International Labor Organization.Myanmar's announcement only stated the wage-rule for a ""standard eight-hour work day"". It did not mention overtime compensation.Saturday's statement comes less than three months before Myanmar's first free elections in 25 years. Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy is widely expected to comfortably win the poll. The approved wage would apply to workers across all sectors, but exclude small and family-run businesses that employ fewer than 15 people, National Minimum Wage Committee, a forum comprising all negotiating parties, said in state-run Myanma Ahlin newspaper.The wage will come into effect on Sept. 1.Myanmar exported $1.5 billion of clothes and materials in 2014, up from $1.2 billion the previous year and $947 million in 2012, according to the Global Trade Atlas.The World Bank has projected that Myanmar's economy will expand about 8 percent in the current fiscal year.

Larsson, who will join Ralph Lauren and its board in November, is credited with reviving sales at Old Navy division, successfully implementing a model of offering trendy clothes at low prices.Annual sales at the business rose 8 percent in 2014 and became Gap's biggest business. Sales  for the division were $6.62 billion, or 40.3 percent of Gap's total. Lauren's fashion empire includes brands Polo and Denim & Supply, and the company makes clothing, accessories, furniture, home decor items and footwear under its labels.Born Ralph Lifshitz in the Bronx in 1939, Lauren's parents were Jewish immigrants from Belarus, and he changed his name to Lauren at age 16. The company also said that Jackwyn Nemerov, chief operating officer, would retire in November at which time she will become an adviser to the company.(Reporting by Sneha Banerjee and Ramkumar Iyer in Bengaluru and Siddharth Cavale and Kylie Gumpert in New York; Editing by Maju Samuel and Cynthia Osterman)",2015-09-29,GPS,"Tue Sep 29, 2015 | 6:57pm EDT",CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Ralph Lauren hires Old Navy exec to replace him as CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/ralph-lauren-ceo-idUSL3N11Z57420150929?type=companyNews
93,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 06 (Fitch) A significant change at the top for The Gap, Inc.  has sent credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the struggling retailer  significantly wider, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest CDS Case Study  Snapshot. Five-year CDS on The Gap have widened 50% over the past week and 94% over the  month to price at the widest levels in over three years.  After pricing  consistently in line with 'BBB' levels over the course of this year, credit  protection for The Gap is now pricing in below investment grade territory. 'The Gap's CDS spread widening in recent days likely reflects market concerns  stemming from the exit of Old Navy's chief, who had been the driving force  behind that brand's turn-around,' said Director Diana Allmendinger. Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

94,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 19 (Fitch) Recent announcements by Gap Inc. (Gap) do not have a  near-term impact on the company's credit rating, according to Fitch Ratings.  However, the announcements, which have included disappointing margin guidance,  management departures, and new debt issuance, are collectively of concern in  regard to current and future business trends.  Gap's current 'BBB-' ratings reflect its strong free cash flow, expense  management, and real estate discipline but are limited by its inconsistent  success introducing new product lines across its brands. Management has indicated that Q3 2015 gross margins are expected to be close to  those of Q2, which is typically Gap's lowest margin quarter due to summer  product clearance. The Q3 2015 gross profit margin is now expected to decline  nearly 300bps vs. 2014, compared to declines of 100bps and 200bps in Q1 and Q2  of 2015, respectively. While YTD declines are partially related to the strong US  dollar, Fitch believes they are the result of higher inventory-clearing markdown  activity. Weak margins highlight continued difficulty connecting to customers  with compelling, trend-right fashion. Gap has announced several key management departures, most prominently the  president of Old Navy, currently Gap's most successful brand (and most sales  generative at 40% of FY 14 company revenue). Fitch is concerned the president's  departure could lead to a slowdown in comp momentum for Old Navy, given that  current strength at Old Navy is mitigating sales weakness at Gap (38% of sales)  and Banana Republic (18% of sales). While Fitch does not expect significantly positive sales growth from any of  Gap's brands, a slowdown at Old Navy would have negative EBITDA implications if  the Gap branded stores did not improve concurrently. Additionally, the departure  of Banana Republic's creative director suggests that weak trends in that  business will likely continue at least for the next six to nine months, as  product lines under her direction have not resonated well with customers. Gap has also announced a $400 million two-year term loan, with proceeds intended  for share repurchases. While the new facility has only modest implications  (10bps) on leverage, Fitch generally views as negative a company's decision to  increase leverage during times of operational difficulty. However, Gap is  expected to end 2015 with approximately $1 billion of cash and full revolver  availability and anticipates free cash flow (post dividend) generation around  $400 million annually beginning 2016, providing Gap ample liquidity. Fitch currently rates Gap 'BBB-', predicated on its operational discipline and  free cash flow generation. The company has shown willingness to address its cost  structure and real estate, most recently through this year's closure of  approximately 15% of North American Gap brand stores. Moreover, Gap has also  been an innovator in omnichannel capabilities, which should support market share  as shopping behaviors continue to change. EBITDA growth, and therefore leverage  metrics, has been held back by the company's inconsistent track record  merchandising trend-right assortments, leading to weak comp store sales growth  and erratic gross margins.  Fitch's negative ratings sensitivities include sustained EBITDA at or below $2.3  billion and leverage of 3.5x. Fitch currently expects 2015 EBITDA of close to  $2.2 billion and leverage of 3.5x, assuming recent product challenges continue  into the holiday selling season, yielding slightly negative Q4 comps and  year-over-year gross margin declines similar to Q3. These estimates fall well  below management's most recent earnings guidance as of Aug. 20.  Fitch currently anticipates EBITDA improving to $2.4-2.5 billion over the next  three years, resulting in leverage of 3.3-3.4x following repayment of the $400  million term loan. The EBITDA rebound is predicated on slightly positive comps  and 100 - 150bps gross margin improvement from 2015, resulting in margins 50 -  100bps below 2014. Positive comp momentum is expected to begin with better  product acceptance in Spring 2016, which should benefit from early 2015 changes  to management and merchandise processes. A worse-than-expected holiday or lack  of sales momentum into spring 2016 could trigger a negative ratings outlook or  downgrade. Fitch currently rates Gap Inc. as follows: The Gap, Inc.  --Issuer Default Rating 'BBB-';  --$500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB-';  --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

99,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Nov 27 The holiday shopping rush that kicked off on Friday is unlikely to bring much cheer to investors looking for a revival in retail stocks.After months of uninspiring sales growth and recent disappointments from Macy's and Nordstrom, shareholders of apparel sellers have had little to be thankful for and face a challenging holiday season.Those stocks have reflected a shift by consumers away from discretionary items like designer-label clothes and cosmetics toward smartphones, televisions, home goods and travel, as well as an ongoing migration to online spending.Early indications suggested this year's holiday season was off to a slow start. Crowds were thin at U.S. stores and shopping malls in the early hours of Black Friday and on Thanksgiving evening, as shoppers responded to early holiday discounts with caution.Macy's stock has plummeted 39 percent this year while Nordstrom is down 22 percent and Tiffany & Co is 23 percent lower - all far worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index's 1-percent gain.On the other hand, Home Depot has surged 29 percent in 2015 and discount store Dollar Tree is up 6 percent.The S&P 500 retail index has risen 27 percent this year, with much of that gain driven by its largest component, Amazon.com, which continues to undercut brick-and-mortar rivals and has seen its stock more than double this year. Earnings expectations vary for the holiday shopping quarter; Lowe's on average is expected to grow its earnings by 29 percent from a year ago while videogame store GameStop  is seen growing earnings by 9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.Gap Inc, which warned this month about weak sales and a strong dollar, is seen posting a 24 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings.""You really have to bifurcate between the largely apparel retailers and hard-goods retailers,"" said Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.His top picks include discount retailer Big Lots as well as Best Buy, which specializes in the electronic goods consumers are buying these days and also has a compelling valuation at 12 times expected earnings. By comparison, Nordstrom trades around 17 times earnings and Target has a price-earnings ratio of 15. Polls going into holiday season have been mixed: A Reuters/Ipsos survey found more people planned to cut holiday spending than to boost it, while Gallup reported Americans plan to spend an average of $830 each on gifts this season, up from $720 a year ago at this time.U.S. retail sales edged up a meager 0.1 percent last month after staying unchanged in both September and August, according to the Commerce Department.FBR technology analyst Daniel Ives and his team planned to visit at least 25 Best Buys and other big-box stores over the weekend in New York and other major cities to gauge consumer appetite for Microsoft's Xbox One game console and Apple's smartwatch, launched in April. ""It's not quantitative, but it gives you anecdotal data points that become part of the mosaic of your thesis about whether to be bullish or bearish on trends, names and products,"" Ives said.Since 2008, early sales estimates following Black Friday and Cyber Monday have had little or no bearing on retail stock performance for the holiday quarter, according to a report by LPL financial.The short-term performance of stocks in the week after Thanksgiving has also been similarly inconsistent.For the past three years, Wal-Mart Stores has lost as much as 3.9 percent or gained as much as 2.6 percent in the week following Black Friday, according to Thomson Reuters data.By comparison, the S&P 500 has been flat to up 0.5 percent in the week following Black Friday for the past three years.Amazon.com's stock performance in the week following Thanksgiving has been even more erratic. It lost 8 percent last year, lost 2 percent in 2013 and jumped 5 percent in 2012.(Editing by Bernadette Baum)",2015-11-27,GPS,"Fri Nov 27, 2015 | 12:28pm EST",Wall St Week Ahead-Holiday shopping unlikely to cheer many investors,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-stocks-weekahead-idUSL1N13F20S20151127?type=companyNews

The survey also showed an equal number of U.S. shoppers sought to buy items online as they did in physical stores over the Thanksgiving weekend.Shares of Macys and Nordstrom have reflected a shift by consumers away from discretionary items like designer-label clothes and cosmetics toward online spending and merchandise such as smartphones, televisions, home goods and travel.Macy's stock has plummeted 39 percent this year while Nordstrom is down 22 percent and Tiffany & Co is 23 percent lower - all far worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index's 1 percent gain.

By comparison, Nordstrom trades around 17 times earnings and Target has a price-earnings ratio of 15.Polls going into holiday season have been mixed: A Reuters/Ipsos survey found more people planned to cut holiday spending than to boost it, while Gallup reported Americans plan to spend an average of $830 each on gifts this season, up from $720 a year ago at this time.U.S. retail sales edged up a meager 0.1 percent last month after staying unchanged in both September and August, according to the Commerce Department. FBR technology analyst Daniel Ives and his team planned to visit at least 25 Best Buys and other big-box stores over the weekend in New York and other major cities to gauge consumer appetite for Microsoft's Xbox One game console and Apple's smartwatch, launched in April.""It's not quantitative, but it gives you anecdotal data points that become part of the mosaic of your thesis about whether to be bullish or bearish on trends, names and products,"" Ives said.Since 2008, early sales estimates following Black Friday and Cyber Monday have had little or no bearing on retail stock performance for the holiday quarter, according to a report by LPL financial.The short-term performance of stocks in the week after Thanksgiving has also been similarly inconsistent.For the past three years, Wal-Mart Stores has lost as much as 3.9 percent or gained as much as 2.6 percent in the week following Black Friday, according to Thomson Reuters data.By comparison, the S&P 500 has been flat to up 0.5 percent in the week following Black Friday for the past three years.Amazon.com's stock performance in the week following Thanksgiving has been even more erratic. It lost 8 percent last year, lost 2 percent in 2013 and jumped 5 percent in 2012.(Additional reporting by Barani Krishnan; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jonathan Oatis)",2015-11-29,GPS,"Sun Nov 29, 2015 | 4:20pm EST",Wall St Week Ahead-Holiday shopping unlikely to cheer many investors,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-stocks-weekahead-idUSL1N13O0H020151129?type=companyNews

116,"  May 10 Shares of Gap Inc slumped 13 percent to a more than four-year low on Tuesday after fewer shoppers visiting the company's stores in the key spring season resulted in a steep decline in comparable-store sales.The 47-year old company has struggled in the past few quarters as a series of fashion misses turned off shoppers amid increasing competition from retailers such as H&M, Forever 21 and Inditex's Zara.Gap Chief Executive Art Peck, who took the helm last year, had repeatedly asked Wall Street for patience, promising that the company's spring season - which he dubbed the ""no excuses moment"" - would witness a revival in the apparel retailer's fortunes.Overall sales at established stores fell 5 percent in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 2.6 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. San Francisco-based Gap on Monday also gave a grim estimate for its first-quarter profit. The company is expected to report results for the quarter on May 19.Gap's shares were down 12.5 percent at $19.09 in morning trading. The stock is now trading at levels last seen in early 2012, when Gap emerged from a largely successful turnaround under former CEO Glenn Murphy.

118,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating for The Gap, Inc. (Gap) to 'BB+' from 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook  is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.  The downgrade reflects Fitch's reduced confidence in stabilization of sales,  expectations of continued gross margin volatility, and belief that Gap will need  to continue using real estate actions and large-scale cost reduction programs to  protect EBITDA in the face of sales declines. Fitch expects EBITDA to decline to  the $2 billion range in 2016 versus $2.3 billion in 2015 and a peak of $2.7  billion in 2014, with leverage expected to remain in the mid-3x range.  The rating continues to reflect positive aspects of Gap's credit story,  including its capital discipline, positive free cash flow (FCF), scale, and  investments in omnichannel capabilities. KEY RATING DRIVERS Weak Sales Continue Gap's comparable store sales (comps) continue to be weak, with -5% comps in  first quarter 2016 (1Q16) following -7% comps in 4Q15, despite significantly  easier comparisons and an assumed benefit from sourcing and merchandising  changes made in 2015. Gap continues to see material declines in traffic, and  while traffic declines are an issue across the mall space, Gap's outsized  declines are an indication that customer loyalty is waning as product continues  to disappoint. Gap operates in a challenging mid-market apparel sector, which has been  characterized by lack of a strong product cycle and sales bifurcation to  higher-end aspirational brands and lower-end fast fashion and off-price  channels. Gap and its peers have seen volatile sales results and have needed to  use significant omnichannel investments and higher-than-expected markdowns to  drive sales. Old Navy's (42% of 2015 revenue) recent weakness is of particular concern, given  that the brand has mitigated sales declines at the Gap and Banana Republic  brands for several years. Old Navy had not seen a quarterly comp decline since  4Q11 but produced comps of -8% and -6% in 4Q15 and 1Q16, respectively. Old  Navy's value-oriented positioning should benefit sales in a period of trade-down  but it appears that broader market discounting, and potential merchandising  issues are causing weak sales trends. Fitch previously assumed that merchandising changes made in 2015 would begin to  show improvement in 2016, yielding flattish comps by the end of the year; weak  1Q trends have diminished confidence in this expectation. Fitch now believes  comps could improve to the negative 1% - 2% range by 4Q16 and remain modestly  negative thereafter. Gross Margins Still Volatile Fitch previously anticipated gross margins improving in 2016, predicated on  improving sales trends, reduced inventory buys and a faster product cycle. Gross  margins have fallen from a peak in the 40% range in 2009 - 2010 to the mid-36%  range in 2015. Fitch projects that weak sales exacerbated by merchandise misses  have caused 1Q16 gross margin erosion of 250 - 300 basis points (bps; to  approximately 35%), leading to an EBITDA decline of around 30% vs. 2015.  As a result of 1Q weakness, Fitch is less confident that the company's process  changes and reduced inventory position can improve gross margins this year.  Fitch now believes gross margins could be down around 150bps to the 35% level  for the full year. EBITDA Protection through Expense Management Continues Gap announced it will seek additional opportunities to streamline its operating  infrastructure and will evaluate its international real estate fleet (primarily  Old Navy and Banana Republic) to offset weak sales. Fitch has generally viewed  these moves positively, including the 2015 closure of around 15% of North  American Gap brand stores. However, the Gap's continued reliance on  transformational cost management programs to protect EBITDA as sales decline is  a negative. Although details of the announced cost savings are expected to be shared on the  company's upcoming 1Q earnings call, Fitch has assumed that SG&A could decline  2% - 3% in 2016 and modestly thereafter, following a 3.5% decline in 2015. As a  result, Fitch expects 2016 EBITDA to decline approximately 15% to $2 billion  even with a projected $100 million of net expense reduction. While the company could realize modest SG&A and occupancy declines beginning  2017 due to the slowdown of international expansion, store closures, and other  restructuring activity, the resulting income benefit could merely offset  anticipated sales declines. As a result, EBITDA could remain range bound in the  low $2 billion range. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Comp sales are expected to be negative 3% - 4% in 2016, and modestly negative  beginning 2017. Revenue growth approximates comp sales due to lack of unit  expansion.  --EBITDA declines from $2.3 billion (14.4% of sales) in 2015 to $2 billion  (13.1% of sales) in 2016, reflecting around 150bps of gross margin decline and  2% - 3% SG&A reduction, and remains in the low $2 billion range thereafter. --Annual FCF after dividends of $400 million- $500 million, which will support  the company's share repurchase program. In 2016 the company will use FCF and  existing cash to pay down the $400 million term loan issued in 2015.  --Adjusted leverage remains in the mid-3x range over the next three years,  assuming flat rent expense. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade would be predicated on a combination of the following: --Stabilized comp trends, defined as several consecutive quarters of flattish  comps; --Modest year-over-year gross margin improvement and SG&A leverage on a  sustained basis, yielding EBITDA trending from the $2 billion level in 2016  toward $2.5 billion; --Leverage trending to the low-3.0x range, based on the above EBITDA trend and  paydown of the company's $400 million term loan. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include continued sales weakness driving EBITDA to around $1.7  billion and adjusted leverage towards 4x. LIQUIDITY Gap has maintained strong liquidity, with an unused $500 million revolver and  cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion as of Jan. 30, 2016. The company  generated FCF after dividends of $500 million in 2015 and Fitch expects FCF to  range from $400 million- $500 million annually over the next three years. Fitch  expects FCF to be directed towards the repayment of the company's $400 million  term loan in 2016 and towards share repurchases thereafter.  The company may also use some of its excess balance sheet cash for share  repurchases, but is nonetheless expected to retain sufficient cash to handle its  seasonal working capital needs without having to tap its $500 million revolver  maturing May 2020. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded the following ratings: The Gap, Inc.  --Long-Term IDR to 'BB+' from 'BBB-';  --$500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility to 'BB+/RR4' from  'BBB-';  --Senior unsecured notes to 'BB+/RR4' from 'BBB-'.

Gap's net income fell 46.9 percent to $127 million, or 32 cents per share, for the first quarter ended April 30, in line in the average analyst estimate.Net sales were down 6 percent at $3.44 billion, the company had reported on May 9.Up to Thursday's close of $17.28, the stock had fallen about 30 percent this year.

Analysts on average had expected a decline 1.20 percent.Gap also estimated adjusted profit of 58-59 cents per share for the second quarter ended July 30. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 48 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, which saw higher traffic to its stores in June,  is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings after the bell on Aug. 18.Sales at established stores fell 2 percent in the latest quarter. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 2.60 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.The company has said it would focus on North America and would shut 75 Old Navy and Banana Republic stores outside the region. ""Performance was uneven within the quarter, with challenging traffic in May and July,"" Jack Calandra, senior vice president of investor relations said in a pre-recorded call.U.S. apparel retailers are struggling to draw shoppers who are increasingly seeking steep discounts and are choosing cheaper and trendier clothes offered by fast-fashion retailers such as H&M , Forever 21 and Inditex's Zara. Mall traffic has also steadily decreased as millennials have taken to the internet to shop for apparel and accessories.Comparable sales at Banana Republic stores fell 9 percent, the sixth straight quarter of decline.The company's net sales fell 1.3 percent to $3.85 billion, but topped analysts' estimate of $3.78 billion.Up to Monday's close of $25.62, the stock had fallen by more than a quarter in the past 12 months.

140,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Shares of Gap Inc had their biggest jump in eight years on Friday and many of its rivals also rose after the apparel retailer posted September sales that were not as bad as expected and kindled hopes of a potential recovery in the sector.Gap's report provided respite to shares of mall retailers that have been crippled in recent years by low-price fast-fashion competitors, a trend where consumers are spending their extra income on apparel, and the growing dominance of Amazon.com.Gap was up 14.9 percent at $26.16, on track for its largest one-day increase since November 2008. Abercrombie & Fitch, Bebe Stores, Ralph Lauren and Chico's FAS all gained 2 percent or more on Friday after Gap's report late the day before. Gap said comparable sales in September fell 3 percent compared to a 1 percent drop in September last year. It blamed the drop on disruptions caused by a fire at a distribution center that it reported at the end of August. Analysts on average had expected a 2.9 percent dip, according to Thomson Reuters data. Some analysts focused on a 4 percent increase in comparable sales at Gap's Old Navy segment, even as comparable sales at its Banana Republic unit fell 9 percent and Gap Global declined 10 percent.""We see a potential scenario of the segment producing high single digit comps this winter, aiding the company will turn the corner on leveraging rent and occupancy,"" wrote Deutsche analyst Paul Trussell, who upgraded his rating on GAP to ""hold"" from ""sell"". Six analysts recommend selling Gap, while 23 have ""hold"" ratings and just three recommend buying, according to Thomson Reuters data.Gap's rally on Friday left its stock up 5 percent in 2016 but still down 10 percent over the past 12 months. The S&P 500 has gained 7 percent over the past year. Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe even saw a silver lining in the fire at the Fishkill, New York facility, its primary distribution center for the U.S. Northeast. ""Given poor results at Gap and Banana Republic, likely attributable to unappealing merchandise assortments, we don't view the product lost in the fire as an important loss but rather a fortuitous reduction in inventory,"" wrote Jaffe in client note.
