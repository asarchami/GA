0,"  Jan 24 FirstEnergy Corp said on Friday it is continuing work on the replacement of a transformer at the 892-megawatt Unit 1 at the Beaver Valley nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.     The unit shut Jan. 6 due to a transformer failure.      A First Energy spokeswoman could not say when the unit would likely return to service but noted ""the outage is expected to be shorter than a typical refueling outage, which is normally about 30 days.""      ""We are well into the replacement process. This is a large component that requires some time to replace,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Young.     A spokesman at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Neil Sheehan, said ""Work is continuing on the installation and testing of the new transformer ... While the work may be taking slightly longer than anticipated, the delays would not be considered significant.""     Sheehan noted ""This type of replacement schedule is in line with what we have seen at other plant sites."" The NRC does not forecast when a reactor will return to service.     The NRC said FirstEnergy had two spare transformers at Beaver Valley (a new one and a refurbished one). The company decided to install the new, unused transformer, since the used one would have required additional refurbishment work.     Beaver Valley 2, meanwhile, was operating at full power Friday morning, according to an NRC report.      ---------------------------------------------------------- PLANT BACKGROUND/TIMELINE    STATE:     Pennsylvania    TOWN:      Shippingport in Beaver County, some 35 miles (56 km)             northwest of Pittsburgh    OPERATOR:  FirstEnergy Nuclear    OWNER(S):  FirstEnergy    CAPACITY:  1,777 MW    UNIT(S):   - Unit 1 - 892-MW Westinghouse pressurized water               reactor (PWR)               - Unit 2 - 885-MW Westinghouse PWR    FUEL:      Nuclear    DISPATCH:  Baseload      TIMELINE:    1976 -     Unit 1 enters service    1987 -     Unit 2 enters service    2007 -     FirstEnergy filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory               Commission to renew the reactors' original 40-year               operating licenses for another 20 years    2009 -     NRC renews operating licenses    2036 -     Unit 1 license expires    2047 -     Unit 2 license expires   ",2014-01-24,FE,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 2:11pm EST",FirstEnergy works on Pennsylvania Beaver Valley reactor transformer,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-operations-firstenergy-beaverv-idUSL2N0KY1EC20140124?type=companyNews

4,"  March 14 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is seeking public comment on a draft report assessing the environmental impacts of extending the operating license for FirstEnergy Corp's Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Ohio.In February, the NRC staff said it found no environmental issues that would preclude a 20-year license renewal for the 894-megawatt reactor.The NRC said it will hold two public meetings on March 25 at a site near the plant and accept comments through April 21.The renewal of the Davis-Besse operating license is controversial in part because the reactor was the site of what the NRC has called one of the most dangerous nuclear incidents in the United States.In 2002, workers discovered corrosion had eaten a hole in the plant's reactor vessel head, which kept the unit shut until 2004. Although the hole did not hurt anyone, the NRC fined FirstEnergy more than $5 million for the actions that led to the corrosion. Davis-Besse is a pressurized-water reactor located approximately 20 miles (32 km) east of Toledo.The current operating license expires April 22, 2017. FirstEnergy submitted its license renewal application to the NRC on August 27, 2010. The draft environmental impact statement is a step in the license renewal review process, which proceeds along two tracks - one for safety issues and another for environmental issues.The NRC staff issued its final safety evaluation report in September 2013 and expects to issue the final supplemental environmental impact statement in September 2014. The NRC, however, has said it will not make a final licensing decision on any reactor until it completes its waste confidence rule making for the long-term storage of nuclear waste, currently scheduled for September 2014.The NRC said the date of a final decision on the Davis-Besse license renewal and for all 18 pending reactor license renewals are still to be determined.For a factbox on U.S. nuclear renewals, see",2014-03-14,FE,"Fri Mar 14, 2014 | 12:06pm EDT",NRC seeks comment on Ohio nuclear reactor license renewal,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-firstenergy-davisbesse-idUSL2N0MB0XY20140314?type=companyNews
5,"  (Adds comment by FirstEnergy)May 16 Some coal-fired generators may have offered electricity at 22 times the average price for power last winter, making some plants too expensive to run, said the market monitor for PJM, the biggest power grid operator in the United States.Monitoring Analytics said PJM was competitive overall during the first three months of the year, but noted that some coal-fired generators lifted prices in January, though their feedstock costs did not rise. The monitor, which tracks the market and can make recommendations to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, did not name the companies or identify any locations.The monitor is investigating the price increases and will take appropriate actions, according to its quarterly report released Thursday.PJM operates the grid serving 61 million people in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states from New Jersey to Illinois and the District of Columbia.The biggest coal-fired generators in PJM include units of Duke Energy Corp, FirstEnergy Corp and PPL Corp . In January, on the highest demand days, the monitor said several generators boosted offer prices for some of their gas-fired units to the market's price cap of $1,000 per megawatt hour due to the higher prices for gas at that time.The average price of PJM power was $45 per MWh in 2013. ""That is expected behavior in a competitive market,"" the monitor said in the report. ""But some coal units also increased their offer prices significantly, including offers at $1,000 per MWh, in anticipation that their generation would be committed regardless of their offer price,"" the monitor said.""Given that coal costs did not increase,"" the monitor said, ""this behavior is consistent with economic withholding.""Officials at PPL were not immediately available for comment. A spokesman at Duke declined to comment. FirstEnergy said in an email the ""economic withholding"" issue does not apply at any of its facilities since they were net purchasers of power during that time due to outages at a few of their plants.The monitor also recommended changes to PJM's capacity market, which pays generators for keeping their plants available, to reduce payments to units that are not able to run due to lack of fuel during the peak winter demand months.From Jan. 6-8, a polar vortex caused extreme cold in PJM's region, forcing the grid operator to take several emergency measures and pay extremely high prices to buy power to make sure it had enough generation to keep the lights on.On Jan. 7, when demand for power hit a winter record of 140,467 megawatts, the monitor said some 40,700 MW were out of service, of which 38,500 MW were ""forced outages."" Lack of gas caused about 10,400 MW of those forced outages at the peak hour.

8,"   By Scott DiSavino  For big U.S. power companies like FirstEnergy Corp, the Supreme Court's decision knocking back landmark rules reducing air pollutants from coal-fired plants has arrived too late for them to turn away from a natural gas-fueled future.Big coal-fired generators said on Monday that they would press ahead with facility upgrades and plant closures even after the court invalidated one of President Barack Obama's major environmental initiatives, which would set new limits on the amount of mercury and other hazardous pollutants.In a 5-4 decision, the court found that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should have considered the compliance cost of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule. The EPA has estimated it would cost the power industry $9.6 billion a year to comply with the rule. While the prospect of a suspension in the rule - and increased demand for coal - cheered some investors on Monday, with stocks such as coal miner Peabody Energy Corp surging more than 9 percent, the power firms who could also benefit from a reduced regulatory burden said they were staying the course.The durability of cheap natural gas, and the likelihood that other EPA reforms, like the upcoming Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions, will survive legal challenge, are giving few any reason to rethink plans to shut some 22,000 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired power capacity this year - a sum equal to about fourth-fifths of all the closures in the preceding decade.Ohio-based FirstEnergy, one of the nation's largest coal plant operators, is not putting any MATS projects on hold, said spokeswoman Stephanie Walton.At the end of March, FirstEnergy had spent $145 million of an expected total $370 million on MATS-related upgrades. It has already shut coal-fired units in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia due in part to MATS over the past few years, Walton said.Officials at others including American Electric Power Co Inc and Duke Energy Inc also said they would make no changes to their ongoing MATS compliance activities. ""Most of the companies' decisions to retire or upgrade plants will not be undone,"" said Rob Patrylak, managing director at Navigant Consulting, a consulting firm.Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, an appeals court will decide whether to throw out the entire rule. NO TURNING BACK  The gas market has already benefited from the MATS rule because utilities had to make decisions years ago whether to shut or upgrade their coal and other power plants.With gas at the lowest level in three years, power plant consumption of gas was expected to reach 25.4 billion cubic feet per day in 2015, a record high, up from 20.8 bcfd four years ago, when the MATS rules were first unveiled.Gas prices are languishing at $2.77 per million British thermal units, down from $4.65 during the same time last year, making gas very competitive with coal.""Any relief will be muted given utilities have already retired a significant amount of coal-fired generation and this repeal would do little to change course for planned retrofits since billions in investment have been made already,"" analysts at FBR & Co, an investment bank, said in a report. In 2012, there were about 300,000 MW of coal-fired generation in the United States. About two-thirds of that, or about 200,000 MW were already MATS compliant, according to federal energy data.That means generators had to decide whether to retire or upgrade the remaining 100,000 MW of coal plants by April 2015 or seek a one-year extension to comply.At least 165 coal units received extensions to continue operating beyond April 2015, according to the National Association of Clean Air Agencies in March.Generators have been shutting older coal plants for years because relatively cheap gas from booming shale production has made it uneconomical to upgrade the units to meet increasingly strict federal environmental rules.Over the prior 10 years to 2014 they shut a total of about 28,600 MW of coal power.Generating companies have said they plan to shut 22,000 MW of coal generation in 2015, with most of those plants already shut by the end of April due to the mercury rule, and another 10,300 MW in 2016, according to Reuters and federal data.
