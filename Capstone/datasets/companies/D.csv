2,"  (Adds background, details from report, comment from environmentalists, share price)By Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON May 15 Dominion Resources' bid to export liquefied natural gas from the coast of Maryland cleared a major hurdle on Thursday with a favorable environmental review from federal regulators.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's review of Dominion's Cove Point found that the project would not have a significant impact on the environment since it would be built in the same area as the company's existing import facility.In a 241-page report, FERC said the project would have minimal effects on wetlands, vegetation and wildlife if it takes appropriate mitigation measures such as spill prevention and wetland erosion protections.FERC also concluded that the project had ""sufficient layers of safeguards"" to prevent accidents and to protect public safety.With its environmental review complete, analysts have said in recent months they expect FERC to make a decision on the project some time this summer.Located about an hour's drive from Washington, D.C., Cove Point has been a target for environmentalists concerned about pollution from the shale gas boom that paved the way for LNG exports. Green groups and local residents blasted the FERC's decision to issue an environmental assessment, saying a more robust environmental impact statement would allow in-depth analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions that could result from the project and would provide more opportunities for public input.In response to the opposition, FERC has agreed to hold a public meeting to gather comments on its assessment.Dominion defended the commission's decision to forego the more detailed analysis.""This project will be built within the existing footprint and fence line of an industrial site,"" said Diane Leopold, president of Dominion Energy. ""There is no need for additional pipelines, storage tanks or permanent piers, thus limiting its impact and making an environmental assessment appropriate."" Unlike impact statements, environmental assessments prepared by federal agencies are meant to be concise documents without an abundance of long descriptions or detailed data.But a mere assessment ""isn't up to the task of weighing these impacts,"" said Nathan Matthews, an attorney for the Sierra Club. Green groups have threatened to challenge the report in court if they deemed it insufficient.Dominion has strongly disputed those complaints, arguing that the project will actually help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by replacing coal-fired power generation, and that it will not make a big difference to shale gas development. Companies need approval from both the Department of Energy,  which determines whether the proposed exports would be in the public interest, and FERC, which assesses environmental and safety effects of the projects' construction and operation.Cove Point earned conditional approval from the Energy Department last year to export 0.77 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas.Most of the exports from the Maryland terminal, once it is operational, are expected to be headed for Asia.Dominion shares were down 0.7 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, at $69.42.(Reporting by Ayesha Rascoe, editing by Ros Krasny and Diane Craft)",2014-05-15,D,"Thu May 15, 2014 | 2:11pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Dominion's LNG export project clears environmental hurdle,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-ferc-dominion-resourc-idUSL1N0O11F920140515?type=companyNews

4,"  WASHINGTON May 21 U.S. green groups asked federal regulators on Wednesday to allow more time for public comment on an environmental review of Dominion Resources'  Cove Point liquefied natural gas export project, a move that could delay permitting for the facility.The Chesapeake Climate Action Network and Earthjustice petitioned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend its comment period for the review by 60 days, which would push the deadline for public input on the project to Aug. 13.The groups said additional time was needed to ""fully analyze the highly technical information"" included in the review issued last week, which found Dominion's Cove Point project would not have a significant impact on the environment. Absent a delay, FERC is expected to decide on the project's fate some time this summer. The Cove Point complex is on Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, a little more than a hour's drive from Washington. Environmentalists have criticized FERC for issuing a relatively brief environmental assessment of Cove Point, instead of a detailed environmental impact statement. Unlike impact statements, environmental assessments prepared by federal agencies are meant to be concise documents without an abundance of long descriptions or detailed data.

5,"  (Adds Dominion comment in last paragraph)WASHINGTON, June 9 U.S. environmental regulators have asked for more time to review a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant project planned for a site on a bay near Washington, D.C.The Environmental Protection Agency, one of the departments that contributes to assessments of LNG projects, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a 30-day extension to conduct a review of Dominion Resources Inc's  Cove Point liquefaction project in Maryland.FERC, which assesses environmental and safety issues involving LNG projects, gave Cove Point a green light last month. It is expected to make a final decision on the project sometime this summer after a public comment period and input from agencies. The additional time ""will allow the agency to compile comments from its regional associate internal reviewers and the required need for EPA headquarters' review,"" the EPA said in a letter to FERC dated June 3, and released on Monday. FERC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.U.S. green groups have also asked FERC to extend the public comment period by 60 days, which would push the deadline for public input to Aug. 13. Some green groups say the plant, about an hour's drive from the nation's capital, would bring the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking to Maryland. They also say the process of super cooling natural gas for export and shipping it thousands of miles to customers in Asia and Europe reduces the environmental benefit of switching from coal to natural gas.A Dominion spokesman said there has already been ample opportunity for the public to comment on environmental aspects of the project and that FERC's review last month raised no new issues that require an extended comment period.

6,"  (Adds environmental group reaction)By Ros KrasnyWASHINGTON, Sept 29 U.S. federal regulators late Monday approved construction of Dominion Resources'  liquefied natural gas export project in Cove Point, Maryland.Cove Point is the fourth U.S. LNG export project to get the green light to begin construction from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It will be able to export up to 5.75 million metric tons of LNG a year when fully operational.Dominion's facility is one of about two dozen projects that hope to ship a growing bounty of domestic natural gas to countries in Asia and Europe.The Cove Point site, a little more than an hour's drive southeast of Washington, D.C. on Chesapeake Bay, boasts four large storage tanks and a pier built in the 1970s to import LNG from Algeria, underscoring just how much U.S. market dynamics have changed. ""We are pleased to receive this final approval that allows us to start constructing this important project that offers significant economic, environmental and geopolitical benefits,"" said Diane Leopold, president of Dominion Energy.Construction is estimated to cost between $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, the company said, adding that it has fully subscribed the marketed capacity of the project with 20-year service agreements that will see LNG shipped to Japan and India.In the past decade the United States has ridden a wave of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to become the world's top gas producer. FERC said approval came after more than two years of consideration during which the agency heard from more than 140 speakers at three public meetings related to its environmental assessment and received more than 650 comments from the public and federal, state and local agencies.The project has been criticized by environmental groups. It lies close to hundreds of homes in the town of Lusby, a golf course and a state park, as well as the complex ecosystem of Chesapeake Bay itself, the largest estuary in the United States.Several environmental and community groups denounced the decision, saying the export facility was a local risk but and provide more incentives for gas extraction by fracking in the mid-Atlantic region. ""Exporting LNG will mean more drilling and fracking, and that means more climate pollution, more risk of contaminated groundwater, and more threats to the health of people who live near gas wells,"" said Deb Nardone, director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Natural Gas campaign.Other groups said they would considering legal challenges. ""Ultimately we may have to take the case to court,"" said Jocelyn D'Ambrosio, associate attorney at Earthjustice.FERC in May released results of its environmental assessment of Cove Point, showing the facility could be built safely with no significant impact to environment.FERC has approved three other LNG export projects, all in the Gulf of Mexico: Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass, the Freeport LNG Development project and Sempra Energy's  Cameron facility. Fourteen other projects are pending with FERC with additional applications expected.(Reporting by Ros Krasny; Editing by Eric Walsh)",2014-09-30,D,"Tue Sep 30, 2014 | 9:55am EDT",UPDATE 2-U.S. FERC approves Dominion's Cove Point LNG export facility,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-energy-dominion-resourc-idUSL2N0RV00J20140930?type=companyNews
7,"  (Adds details)WASHINGTON May 7 The U.S. Energy Department said Thursday it has given the final approval for Dominion Resources to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its Cove Point, Maryland plant.The Cove Point plant is investing $3.8 billion in new infrastructure to ship up to 0.77 billion cubic feet of LNG starting late in 2017 to countries with which the United States does not have free trade agreements. The DOE said it conducted ""an extensive careful review"" of Dominion's applications and considered the economic, energy security and environmental impacts of the plant before approving the Cove Point shipments for 20 years.Some environmentalists have fought Cove Point, believing the LNG trade would increase pollution from fracking in the United States. Others support greater development of natural gas as a replacement for coal. The Sierra Club and several other green groups on Thursday filed suit in the District of Columbia Circuit court over a recent decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve the terminal.
