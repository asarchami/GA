0,"  HONG KONG Feb 14 Hong Kong-listed oil trader and shipping firm Brightoil Petroleum Holdings has held talks with U.S. oil companies Anadarko Petroleum Corp  and Newfield  Exploration Co to buy their China operations, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Brightoil has been searching for upstream investment opportunities in China and overseas for several years. Trading in its shares has been suspended since Feb. 11 pending an announcement of a ""very substantial acquisition"".A source close to Brightoil said the pending announcement pertained to a major upstream transaction. It was not immediately known whether the trading halt was related to the talks held with Anadarko and Newfield. Brightoil declined to comment. Anadarko and Newfield did not reply to emails seeking comment. The sources declined to be identified because the talks were confidential.Reuters reported in November that Anadarko was considering the sale of its holdings in oil and gas projects in China worth about $1 billion. Houston-based Anadarko owns about a 35 percent interest in production and development projects in China's Bohai Bay. It also has a 50 percent interest in the South China Sea exploration acreage. Brightoil, which has a market value of $2.5 billion, is the third-largest marine fuel supplier by volume in Singapore, which is the largest bunkering port in the world.Last year, the firm's trading and bunkering business added crude oil, diesel and petrochemicals, expanding on its shipping fuel trading roots.",2014-02-14,NFX,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 1:29am EST","Brightoil held talks with Anadarko, Newfield to buy China operations - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/brightoil-china-talks-idUSL3N0LJ1XB20140214?type=companyNews
1,"  * The company could just sell 30pct of Malaysian business* Murphy joins other US companies in scaling back from Asia* Good demand for Newfield's Southeast Asia sale triggersBy Denny ThomasHONG KONG, Feb 14 Murphy Oil Corp is considering selling of some of its Asian oil and gas assets in a deal that could fetch up to $3 billion, people familiar with the matter said, as it joins other U.S. energy companies in scaling back from the region. Energy majors from BP to Shell have faced pressure from shareholders to control spending and return spare cash amid concerns over the impact of rising costs and the returns available if oil prices drop.Murphy's planned sale comes after Newfield Exploration Co  and Hess Corp sold their Southeast Asia operations, partly to address share price underperformance. Murphy's move to shed its Asian assets was prompted in part by the strong demand generated from the Newfield and Hess auctions last year, the people told Reuters.They said, however, that the process was still in its early stages and that Murphy could in the end decide not to sell. Murphy, which has a $10.7 billion market value, is working with a U.S.-based consultant which has reached out to some potential Asian energy companies and sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East, the people added.Murphy has interests in oil and gas fields in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brunei and Australia. Malaysia is the biggest of Murphy's Asian portfolios, and accounted for more than 45 percent of its total 2012 net production, according to the company's website.One of the deal structures being discussed include selling just 30 percent of the Malaysian operations, one of the people said.A Murphy spokesman did not immediately reply to an email and a call to his office seeking comment.",2014-02-14,NFX,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 11:50pm EST",UPDATE 1-Murphy Oil eyes sale of up to $3bln worth of Asia assets- sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/murphy-asia-idUSL3N0LJ1IP20140214?type=companyNews
2,"  KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 Malaysian oil and gas services firm SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd said net profit quintupled in the first quarter, driven mainly by contributions from its newly acquired tender rig business from Norway's Seadrill and assets from U.S. firm Newfield Exploration.Net profit rose to 509.42 million ringgit ($158.35 million) in the three months to April 30 from 93.67 million ringgit in the same period a year earlier, according to a stock exchange filing late on Thursday.SapuraKencana, which completed the $2.9 billion purchase from Seadrill in April 2013, said it expected earnings to rise for the full year on the back of full contributions from the tender rig business.It added that additional contributions would also come from the Malaysian oil and gas fields it took over from Newfield, an acquisition that it completed on Feb. 11 this year. The company said it had a healthy order book of 27 billion ringgit.SapuraKencana also said in a separate filing, also after the market closed, that it had won $415 million in engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning contracts in Malaysia and Thailand. SapuraKencana's wholly owned unit in Malaysia secured the two contracts from Hess Exploration and Production Malaysia B.V. and Carigali-PTTEPI Operating Company Sdn Bhd.SapuraKencana said the contracts were expected to add to its earnings between the second quarter of this year and September 2017. Its shares rose 1.17 percent to 4.33 ringgit per share before the close, outperforming the broader index's 0.26 percent rise.($1 = 3.2170 Malaysian Ringgit)(Reporting By Yantoultra Ngui; editing by Jane Baird)",2014-06-19,NFX,"Thu Jun 19, 2014 | 8:22am EDT",Malaysia's SapuraKencana posts profit jump due to acquisitions,http://www.reuters.com//article/malaysia-sapurakencana-results-idUSL4N0P02SU20140619?type=companyNews
3,"  (Adds details, background)Jan 13 Oil and gas producer Newfield Exploration Co said it would retain its assets in China, saying a slump in oil prices had created ""headwinds"" in the sale process.The company said in early 2013 that it planned to exit its international business.""The recent and significant pull back in global oil prices created headwinds for our China sales process... Although our intent was to monetize the asset, it was not a sale at any price,"" said Chief Financial Officer Larry Massaro.Oil prices tumbled 5 percent to near six-year lows of $45.19 on Tuesday before recovering ground. Hong Kong-listed oil trader and shipping firm Brightoil Petroleum Holdings had held talks with Newfield to buy its China operations, sources told Reuters in February last year.Newfield, which has offshore oil properties in China, said the assets would be reclassified as ""continuing operations"".The assets contributed about 0.3 million barrels of oil to fourth-quarter production, the company said. The Pearl facility in south China sea is currently producing oil and would reach a peak rate in mid-2015.Shares of the Houston-based company closed down marginally at $22.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had fallen about 45 percent in the last six months.(Reporting By Tanvi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2015-01-13,NFX,"Tue Jan 13, 2015 | 6:01pm EST",UPDATE 1-Newfield retains China assets after oil drop hits sale process,http://www.reuters.com//article/newfield-explor-china-assets-idUSL3N0US5MK20150113?type=companyNews

5,"  (Corrects Newfield Exploration's credit rating in paragraph seven)By Stephen LaceyNEW YORK, Feb 26 (IFR) - Exploration and production companies are bracing for a sustained period of low commodity prices by deleveraging through stock sales - and well-funded firms are surprisingly leading the way.Ahead of the semi-annual redetermination of credit facilities, eight US explorers have been able to raise US$3bn so far this year through the sales, even though crude prices remain anemic.And most are firms that are not facing the liquidity crunch that has hit much of the E&P sector, including investment-grade rated Noble Energy, which raised $1bn this week.""The biggest correlation to industry valuations is financial leverage, not what basin they are operating in or how they are hedged,"" said Robert Santangelo, co-head of Americas equity capital markets at Credit Suisse.Investment-grade rated Noble (Baa2/BBB-) sold 21m shares overnight Wednesday via Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan at $47.50, in the upper half of the $46.50-$48.00 marketing range and relative to a $49.81 last sale.The banks and Noble's management discussed the financing confidentially with select institutional investors before more broadly marketing publicly, according to market sources.Newfield Exploration (Ba1/BBB-) surfaced Thursday morning with a sale of 22m shares at $33.00, an increase from the 18m shares that had been marketed at $32.60-$33.70 via sole bookrunner Credit Suisse.While not entirely guaranteed, there was an ""element of certainty"" associated with the funding that suggested some type of capital commitment on the part of CS, sources said.""The capital markets have improved. The window is opening up for a lot of these companies,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, E&P analyst at Topeka Capital Markets.""You've seen companies enter the capital markets to fund their 2015 budgets, ensure they don't trip their loan covenants should oil prices remain depressed, or just simply to shore up their balance sheets.""Adding to the wave of recapitalizations, Concho Resources secured roughly $600m on a capital-committed stock sale after the market close Thursday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, sole books, is looking to off-load its purchase of 5.6m shares at $108.00-$109.50, versus a $112.97 last sale, with final pricing due Friday morning.GOING ON OFFENSE? The equity raises may not be entirely defensive.Newfield, for example, is using the equity funding to fully repay the $610m it has drawn on a revolving credit facility, as it negotiates increasing the size of the facility from $1.4bn to $1.8bn.The company also continues to ""monitor conditions"" in the debt capital markets to potentially redeem $700m principal of its 6.875% notes due 2020. Newfield has slashed its capital budget for 2015 to $1.2bn, which is down sharply from $2.1bn last year and in line with the $1.3bn of Ebitda analysts are projecting it will generate this year.Significant to living within the capital structure, it will devote 70% of this year's budget to high-return assets in the Anadarko Basin.""Our equity issuance will allow us to restore the full capacity on our revolver and ensure we have a strong financial position,"" said Cindy Hassler, Newfield's communications manager.""We also wanted to make sure that we are able to hold by production (HBP) our STACK acreage in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and be opportunistic around any potential bolt-on acquisitions that may come our way,"" Hassler told IFR.""STACK and SCOOP are a couple of great plays that deliver returns even in the current price environment.""US production is likely to keep a cap on oil prices. Total US production averaged 9.2m barrels per day in January and is projected to grow to 9.5m in 2016, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Crude prices meanwhile continue to struggle.West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, took another downturn Thursday, falling $2.04 per barrel to $48.95.While that was up from a low of $43.58 in late January, it is still below the $100-plus levels seen last autumn.And the current 12-month STRIP - the average price of the next 12 months and the primary metric used in re-determining producer borrowing bases - trades at just $49.89.While there is a lack of conviction about any near-term recovery, CS's Santangelo and other market-watchers think better-funded companies such as Newfield have the ability to think a bit further down the road.""Investors are taking a constructive view on mid-to-long-term oil prices,"" Santangelo said.""For well-capitalized companies, investors are looking through the low-point implied by the current STRIP, under the belief that unconventional US oil producers survive current low price environment and operate in a more realistic mid-cycle pricing.""Noble Energy shares fell 5% to $47.32 Thursday, while Newfield Exploration fell 6.7% to $33.60.""While a majority of stocks are pricing in north of $75 per barrel of oil, an improving oil price would quickly drive multiple contractions and NAV expansions for these companies,"" said Topeka's Sorbara.""We continue to expect $75-plus per barrel of WTI crude oil to come back in the next 9-12 months, as we believe oil supply will come off the market.""A version of this story will appear in the February 28 edition of IFR Magazine   (Reporting by Stephen Lacey; Editing by Marc Carnegie)",2015-02-27,NFX,"Fri Feb 27, 2015 | 4:50pm EST",CORRECTED-E&P oil firms using stock sales to de-lever,http://www.reuters.com//article/oil-stocks-ep-idUSL1N0W034X20150227?type=companyNews

11,"   By Ernest Scheyder | HOUSTON  HOUSTON U.S. oil producer QEP Resources Inc said on Tuesday it would spend $600 million to buy acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas, the latest in a recent string of sector acquisitions as crude prices stabilize near $50 per barrel.The deal comes a day after Marathon Oil Corp said it would pay $888 million for Oklahoma acreage. Devon Energy Corp, Pioneer Natural Resources Co and others have announced similar deals so far this month, eager to ink agreements as oil prices rise from lows plumbed in 2015. QEP plans to buy 9,400 acres in Texas from unnamed sellers, funding the deal by offering 20 million shares of its stock.The offering was not immediately popular on Wall Street, and shares of QEP fell 3.2 percent to $18.70 in post-market trading after the deal's announcement. The deal is worth about $64,000 an acre, which is high compared with recent shale acreages in the United States, in part because of the Permian's famously thick oil-bearing rock formations. On a pure price per acre basis, acreage transactions inked since May have ranged between $11,190 an acre for Newfield Exploration Co's purchase of assets from Chesapeake Energy Corp in Oklahoma, to around $14,557 in Marathon Oil Corp's acquisition of PayRock Energy Holdings LLC. Denver-based QEP said the new land offers 430 potential drilling locations, a 50 percent boost to the company's possible drill sites in the Permian. The new land - in Martin County - is roughly 10 miles away from QEP's existing acreage in the Permian.The acreage currently produces 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) from vertical wells. ""We believe this acquisition, combined with our existing crude oil assets, will enhance our crude oil production growth and improve our operating efficiency,"" Chuck Stanley, QEP's chief executive, said in a statement.   The deal is expected to close by September.
