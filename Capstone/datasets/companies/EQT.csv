0,"  STOCKHOLM Jan 9 Swedish private equity firm EQT plans to list British food outlet operator SSP on the London Stock Exchange later this year, three people familiar with the matter said.An initial public offering of SSP would come on the back of a strong 2013 for listings where private equity firms were a driving force, taking advantage of rising stock markets to sell assets.Two of the people said SSP could be worth around 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) on an enterprise value basis and that a listing could potentially take place in June at the earliest. EQT and SSP both declined to comment.The process is at an early stage as EQT has not yet appointed any financial advisors, the people said, adding that the first step will be to pick an IPO advisor who will help hiring banks as bookrunners ahead of a listing. SSP employs some 30,000 people and runs restaurants, cafés and bars in airports and railway stations, serving more than 1 million people per day in 30 countries. It owns brands such as Caffè Ritazza and Whistlestop.The firm, which EQT bought in 2006, had sales of 1.74 billion pounds in 2012 and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 139 million pounds, according to EQT's website. EQT in December listed bath and toilet maker Sanitec  which has strongly outperformed the wider market after Sweden's biggest IPO since 2006.EQT is also preparing a listing of jointly owned Danish outsourcing firm ISS this year, according to sources.",2014-01-09,EQT,"Thu Jan 9, 2014 | 12:45pm EST",RPT-EQT plans listing of food outlet operator SSP -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/ssp-listing-idUSL6N0KJ3SL20140109?type=companyNews

""My resignation at Sulzer has nothing to do with my role at EQT and the potential sale of Metco to EQT or the Russian (Vekselberg),"" Wennemer told Reuters on Friday.Sulzer is selling the Metco unit to concentrate on more lucrative businesses making pumps and equipment and providing services for the oil and gas industry. Lenders are preparing debt packages of 560 million Swiss francs to back EQT's bid, bankers familiar with the transaction said. Initially the sale had attracted interest from a number of strategic players like British Bodycote as well as from several private equity firms.An Oerlikon spokeswoman said she had nothing new to say on the deal.EQT declined to comment while Sulzer was not immediately available to comment.",2014-01-17,EQT,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 6:18am EST","Sulzer's Metco attracts bids from Oerlikon, EQT - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/sulzer-metco-sale-idUSL5N0KR0YP20140117?type=companyNews

6,"  * Adviser has sent documents to Carlyle, EQT, PAG and TPG -sources* Savera earns more than 80 pct of revenue from China -sources* PE backed-majority stakes deals rose 83 pct in China in 2013 -TR dataBy Stephen AldredHONG KONG, March 6 Spain's Savera Group, which earns most of its revenue in China, is seeking a buyer for around 70 percent of itself, in a sale valuing the company at up to $500 million, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The maker of tracks used to guide elevators is working with financial adviser Business Development Asia (BDA) and is targeting private equity buyers, said the people, who declined to be identified because the sale is confidential. BDA has sent sales documents to potential buyers including the U.S.'s Carlyle Group and TPG Capital Management , Sweden's EQT and Hong Kong's PAG, the people said.Savera began as a European-focused company in 1967, but now earns more than 80 percent of revenue from China, said one of the people who has seen the sales documents.Bankers have drawn comparisons with the 2010 sale of Dutch cylinder maker Hyva, which earned around 70 percent of revenue from Asia, with the majority from China. Hyva was bought by private equity firm Unitas Capital and NWS Holdings for around $700 million, Reuters previously reported. Savera's sale would be the latest in a series of deals where suitors have had the opportunity to buy controlling stakes in businesses either based in China or with significant exposure to the world's second-biggest economy.The future of many such businesses is now largely reliant on Chinese growth, and private equity firms and corporate buyers are seeking opportunities to leverage on European technology and combine it with Chinese demand, according to bankers,Private equity investment in China is still largely focused on buying small stakes in growing companies heading for an initial public offering, according to industry executives. However, the shutdown of China's capital markets for over a year starting in late 2012 and a difficult financing environment for small and mid-sized enterprises led to an 83 percent increase in majority stakes acquisitions in 2013, Thomson Reuters data showed.While that is starting from a low base - total deal volume was $1.4 billion - companies have also increased in size after years of sustained economic growth in China, which is further attracting private equity attention.Savera has estimated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of around $60 million, and the business could be sold at over eight times that value, or around $500 million, the people said.The first round of bidding is due at the end of March, the people said.Savera and BDA did not respond to requests for comment.

Another person said Credit Suisse, Sweden's Carnegie and Norwegian bank DNB would also act as bookrunners.XXL has said in job ad it is considering a stock market listing in the next three years, but gave no further details. EQT, which owns a 65 percent stake in the fast-growing retailer, declined to comment. XXL did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The banks either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.XXL adds to a pipeline of sizeable Nordic listings planned for the second half of 2014, building on a strong start to the year for the region.In the first six months of 2014, $4.8 billion worth of shares were sold in initial public offerings of Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and Finnish companies, up from just $712 million in the first half of 2013, making it the best six-month period for the region since the second half of 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data. Denmark and Sweden made up the biggest part of the listings, with Danish outsourcing firm ISS and Swedish cable operator Com Hem topping the list. But for the second half, Norway's IPO pipeline also contains some big firms.Cable operator Get, which could be worth 14 billion crowns including debt, is preparing a listing as well, sources told Reuters in May. Also, the Norwegian state has picked advisors for a privatisation of real estate firm Entra, where an IPO is a possible exit route. For XXL, an enterprise value (including debt) of 9 billion crowns would equal about 18 times 2015 forecast earnings after tax, corresponding to roughly twelve times forecast earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), one of the people said.That would mean a significant premium for XXL over most specialty retailers. The European sector trades at around 9 times forward EBITDA earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.XXL recorded 29 percent sales growth last year. The retailer had sales of 4.0 billion Norwegian crowns in 2013. Core earnings rose by 18 percent to 463 million.The firm has 22 stores in Norway, 15 in Sweden and one in Finland according to its website. It employed 1,360 people at the end of 2013, more than double the 2010 number.($1 = 6.1616 Norwegian crowns)    (Reporting by Sven Nordenstam; editing by Niklas Pollard and Jane Merriman)",2014-07-01,EQT,"Tue Jul 1, 2014 | 11:02am EDT","UPDATE 1-EQT picks Goldman Sachs, ABG for XXL listing - sources",http://www.reuters.com//article/xxl-ipo-idUSL6N0PC4BG20140701?type=companyNews

The financing includes a 595 million-euro first lien loan denominated in euros, sterling and dollars and a 225 million-euro second lien loan, denominated in euros and dollars. The second lien has been pre-placed with a Goldman Sachs fund. There is also a 25 million-euro revolving credit facility, the bankers said.Leverage is 5.5 times through the senior and 7.6 times in total, they added. EQT was not immediately available to comment on the financing. ""Leverage is high but it always has been on this credit. BvD is a well known, great quality asset and a real cash machine.  It has a very good existing syndicate of lenders too who could recommit relatively quickly,"" one of the bankers said.Charterhouse acquired BvD in July 2011 backed with 505 million euros of leveraged loans. Shareholders took a 210 million-euro dividend payment earlier this year by amending existing debt and raising a new subordinated loan, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. BvD had debt to earnings of around 6.7 times after Charterhouse took a dividend in February, and before that it was around 4.7 times, the banking sources said.Established in 1991, BvD is an electronic publisher of private company financial information and has more than 650 employees operating from 33 offices across Europe, the Americas and Asia, according to EQT.

Auriga, EQT and CVC declined to comment, while FMC was not immediately available for comment.Cheminova, which develops and supplies crop-protection products to increase the yield and quality of crops, posted a 14 percent rise in EBITDA to 305 million Danish crowns ($53 million) in the second quarter on sales up 3 percent to 1.9 billion crowns. It says it has about 2-3 percent of the global market share and operates out of more than 20 countries.Makers of weedkillers have experienced higher second-quarter demand than usual from the United States, as farmers rush to cultivate fields after a long winter, while fungicide producers have benefited from increased demand from Asia.

30,"  Pennsylvania environmental regulators on Tuesday sought a record $4.5 million penalty from EQT Corp, a natural gas producer, for damage caused by the release of fracking fluids from a gas drilling site in the Marcellus region.The production of shale gas using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology has created thousands of jobs and is one of the major contributors to economic growth in Pennsylvania.But over the past year or so, the state has levied big fines and even pursued criminal charges against some drillers over water and soil pollution from leaking fracking fluids.The state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) filed the complaint with the Environmental Hearing Board requesting the $4.5 million civil penalty for what the state called a ""major pollution incident"" in 2012 in Tioga County.""This action was necessary because the company has not been cooperative during our investigation. The department does not tolerate this unacceptable attitude toward compliance and proper protection of Pennsylvania's environment,"" Acting DEP Secretary Dana Aunkst said in a statement.EQT meanwhile said it filed a complaint against the DEP on Sept. 19 after unsuccessful attempts to resolve the company's liability for the 2012 accidental discharge from a well pad impoundment. ""The timing is suspect, and the exorbitant proposed penalty is inconsistent with both past and recent agency practice,"" Lewis Gardner, EQT's general counsel and vice president for external affairs, said in the company's statement.""The DEP`s proposed penalty seems designed more for headlines than for the lawful enforcement of the Commonwealth's environmental statutes,"" Gardner said.In September, another gas producer, Range Resources Corp, agreed to pay a $4.15 million fine to settle DEP allegations of contamination of water and soil from fracking fluids. At the time, the DEP said that was the biggest fine against an oil and gas operator in the state's shale drilling era. Separately, the state Attorney General is pursuing a criminal case against XTO Energy, an oil and gas production unit of Exxon Mobil Corp, again for damage from leaking fracking fluids. XTO has said the spill was an accident by a contractor and the criminal charges are baseless.The DEP said EQT received the first sign of a possible leak from the impoundment containing water and fracking fluids in April 2012. The company said it became aware of the leak in May 2012 and notified the DEP.EQT removed the soil from beneath the impoundment liner by mid-September 2012 and said the site now meets statewide clean-up standards. The DEP, however, said the site continues to pose environmental problems, noting water was still being collected and transported off-site for treatment and disposal due to contamination.Separately, EQT said the state attorney general filed a Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission misdemeanor complaint against the company related to the 2012 incident.EQT shares fell about 0.7 percent, or 57 cents, to $88.74 at mid-afternoon.

Bloomberg had reported earlier that EQT was the frontrunner to buy the business.Siemens this year announced plans to list its audiology unit, but declining equity markets have made such a move less attractive and sources told Reuters in August that the group was renewing efforts to divest the business. Another two sources close to the matter said that Siemens had not given up on the idea of a possible initial public offering (IPO), despite rocky equity markets that have caused several IPOs to be pulled or delayed.A spin-off to existing shareholders is also an option. Siemens' Chief Executive Joe Kaeser is seeking to focus the group on its most promising businesses to close the gap on more profitable competitors such as Switzerland's ABB and United States-based General Electric.The German trains-to-turbines group has sold or spun off a string of assets in the past decade but failed to find a buyer for Siemens Audiology Solutions four years ago.Sources familiar with the business, whose accounts Siemens does not publish separately, have said it has annual sales of about 700 million euros and core earnings of 160-170 million.

Previously, sources had said that Telair may be valued at up to $1 billion in a potential sale.Telair's workers fear that a sale to an industry  player may cause severe job cuts as seen after TransDigm's acquisition of a Telair unit in 2010, an employee representative said.

""The process of finding a strategic partner is continuing,"" a spokesman for Unister said.ProSieben, EQT and General Atlantic declined to comment. ""The sale has proven to be somewhat difficult and it is still uncertain if it will go through,"" one of the sources said.A first attempt to sell the group earlier in 2014 was delayed by legal issues after prosecutors charged some of its managers with tax fraud, unauthorised sale of financial products and violation of competition rules. Since the relaunch of the auction in autumn, price has proven a major sticking point as Unister Holding, held by its founders, entered discussions seeking to get 1 billion euros, a significant premium over peers, some of the sources said.According to information provided to potential bidders, Unister was expected to post a 65 percent rise in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to more than 90 million euros in 2014, on gross revenues of more than 2 billion euros.But people familiar with some of the bidders had said the earnings jump was achieved in part by a change in accounting methods, adding their estimates for underlying earnings was closer to 70 million euros.Spanish peer eDreams Odigeo trades at a multiple of 5.7 times its expected core earnings.

The business being sold employs 18,000 staff in maintenance and assembly services for the auto, energy and chemicals industries and posted sales of 1.2 billion euros last year.Voith Chief Executive Hubert Lienhard said last month that he wants to focus on the so-called Industrial Internet, through which traditional supply chains are being turned into business networks capable of capitalising on the latest digital trends. He also announced a restructuring that includes 1,600 job cuts, mainly in its ailing paper machine tools operation.As part of its push into increased automation and digitisation of manufacturing processes, Voith acquired a 25 percent stake in industrial robot maker Kuka last year. Voith is expected to market the industrial services business to peers such as Spie and Tyco, as well as buyout groups such as EQT, Apax, Bridgepoint and DBAG, which have experience with similar assets, the sources said.Other sources close to potential buyers said that the business could be valued at seven to eight times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).The business posted EBITDA of 38 million euros last year, but excluding certain one-offs, its core earnings were about 45 million euros, the sources said.

It expects to close the sale in the second half of this year.The four Polish energy groups on the shortlist declined to comment. Representatives of EQT were not immediately available for comment. Sources had told Reuters earlier this month that Poland's four top power firms and a number of investment and infrastructure funds had made initial bids for PKP Energetyka.PKP Energetyka is Poland's No.5 power company by the amount of energy sold and the only Polish energy firm with a country-wide distribution network. Its sale is expected to raise up to 1 billion zlotys ($266.1 million). Sources had earlier told Reuters that Tauron bid in a consortium with state-run Polish insurer PZU as financial back-up provider. Reuters was not able on Tuesday to obtain the full short-list, and so it was unclear if there were others on the list besides PGE, Enea, Tauron, Energa and EQT.The sale has also drawn interest from the likes of Australia's Macquarie and IK Investment Partners, sources had said previously.

46,"   By Arno Schuetze | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT German women's fashion group CBR [EQTEC.UL], known for its Street One and Cecil brands, has been earmarked for sale by its private equity owner EQT this year in a potential 1.2 billion euro ($1.3 billion) deal, two people familiar with the matter said. The Swedish buyout group has started a process of selecting banks to help it organize a stock market listing or sale as early as the second half of the year, they added.EQT declined to comment.""An IPO (initial public offering) is the favored option, but if someone were to offer a good price EQT would not turn them down,"" one of the sources said.  CBR expects to post 2015 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of roughly 100 million euros this year and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 90 million.  ""CBR may fetch an EBIT multiple of up to 13,"" one of the sources said. At this valuation, the company would be sold for 1.17 billion euros. Fashion retail groups such as H&M (HMb.ST), Inditex (ITX.MC), Next (NXT.L), Marks and Spencer (MKS.L), Fast Retailing (9983.T) and Esprit (0330.HK) trade at an average of 11.5 times their expected EBITDA. EQT bought CBR from buyout groups Apax and Cinven in 2007 for roughly 1.5 billion euros. At the time, net debt stood at   1.2 billion euros, which has been reduced to 500 million. Last year, CBR made roughly 600 million euros of sales of the shirts, trousers and scarves of the Street One brand targeting younger women and of the Cecil brand with its focus of more mature women. It has 8,100 points of sale.EQT is joining a raft of private equity groups seeking to take advantage of surging stock markets to exit investments made before the financial crisis.  Apax last month took online car marketplace Auto Trader (AUTOA.L) public, and CVC in February sold a stake in Sunrise (SRCG.S) via the stock exchange. Several others are preparing similar steps.In parallel to preparing an IPO, EQT will shop the asset to other private equity investors as well as fashion groups that are willing to expand via acquisitions. Japan's Fast Retailing, with its Uniqlo chain, has been scooping up a swathe of assets over the past decade and Denmark-based fashion house Bestseller A/S is also seen as by industry experts as a potential buyer.

They said it was unclear how many of these potential suitors had actually placed preliminary bids.EQT bought Classic Fine Foods in 2011, hoping to benefit from expected strong growth in the Asian high-end foods market, following economic growth in the region and an increased consumer taste for Western cuisine.The Swedish investor has hired boutique firm Rippledot Capital Advisers to manage the sale, the sources said. Classic Fine Foods is projected to have core earnings of about $25 million in 2015, one of the people said.A deal value of up to 16 times forward earnings would be clearly above the average multiple of 8 that food retailers such as Marks & Spencer, Carrefour, Tesco  or Kroger trade at. But the bidders are ready to pay a premium to get a hold of a distribution network that could help them ride Asia's boom in consumer goods and branded foods business, the sources said.The buyer would get control of a niche business that imports, stores and distributes foodstuffs, and has about 700 staff.Metro, EQT, DKSH and Bain declined to comment, while Manassen and Baring were not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours.Metro has said it expects to become more active in acquisitions in future, starting small but potentially building up to ""sizeable"" deals.

GPs are just structured vehicles, so all of the variables are known.""Higher-gearing to distribution growth of EQT Midstream Partners was the primary selling point of the deal, which saw banks accelerate pricing a day after closing book-building on Friday afternoon.EQT GP's only assets are interests in EQT Midstream. Specifically the vehicle owns 21.8m LP units, a 2% general partnership stake and all of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs). The IPO represents a roughly 8.6% interest in EQT GP on the upsize, with EQT Corp retaining the remaining 91.4% stake.Parent EQT is using the US$621m raised to help fund capex over the next two years. Higher-gearingEQT Midstream is targeting distribution growth of 20% annually through 2017, via a mixture of organic projects, acquisitions from third parties and dropdowns of projects from the parent.Distributions at EQT GP, by comparison, would grow by 41% annually on a 20% growth in the underlying, assuming no additional LP units are issued to fund acquisitions, according to the company's roadshow presentation.The ""higher gearing"" comes from the IDRs. EQT Midstream was floated by EQT in June 2012 with an initial quarterly distribution of 35 cents, a 6.67% yield to the US$21 pricing of 14.375m units.The company recently set its payout for the first quarter at 62.5 cents, providing a 3% yield at the current US$82.76 unit price, and above the 52.5-cent level required to trigger the high-splits on the IDRs. Above the high-splits, the general partner is entitled to a growing proportion of the underlying cash flows as an ""incentive"" to grow the distribution.EQT Midstream plans to spend US$500m on organic growth projects this year, including to expand capacity of the Equitrans Transmission natural gas pipeline, a 700-mile FERC-regulated pipeline that connects to major long-distance pipelines, from 3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (Bcfe/d) to 4 Bcfe/d.In March the unit spent US$1.05bn, including US$997.5m in cash, to acquire the Jupiter gathering system from EQT that included a 10-year fixed-fee contract to production off-take.

Distributions at EQT GP, by comparison, would grow by 41% annually on a 20% growth in the underlying, assuming no additional LP units are issued to fund acquisitions, according to the company's roadshow presentation.The ""higher gearing"" comes from the IDRs.EQT Midstream was floated by EQT in June 2012 with an initial quarterly distribution of 35 cents, a 6.67% yield to the US$21 pricing of 14.375m units.The company recently set its payout for the first quarter at 62.5 cents, providing a 3% yield at the current US$82.76 unit price, and above the 52.5-cent level required to trigger the high-splits on the IDRs. Above the high-splits, the general partner is entitled to a growing proportion of the underlying cash flows as an ""incentive"" to grow the distribution.EQT Midstream plans to spend US$500m on organic growth projects this year, including to expand capacity of the Equitrans Transmission natural gas pipeline, a 700-mile FERC-regulated pipeline that connects to major long-distance pipelines, from 3 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (Bcfe/d) to 4 Bcfe/d.In March the unit spent US$1.05bn, including US$997.5m in cash, to acquire the Jupiter gathering system from EQT that included a 10-year fixed-fee contract to production off-take.

54,"  * IPO will include 200 mln euro cap increase* CBR owner EQT to sell shares worth 200-300 mln eur -source* IPO expected to take place early July -source   (Adds details on timing, background)FRANKFURT, June 9 German women's fashion group CBR, known for its Street One and Cecil brands, is planning an initial public offering (IPO) later this year, the company said on Tuesday.The flotation will comprise new shares worth about 200 million euros ($226 million) issued in a capital increase as well as shares worth 200-300 million euros owned by private equity group EQT, a person familiar with the deal said.The listing, expected to value CBR at roughly 1.4 billion euros including debt, is expected to take place in early July, the person said. Swedish EQT is joining a raft of private equity groups seeking to take advantage of surging stock markets to exit investments made before the financial crisis. Nonetheless, CBR said EQT would keep a significant stake following the IPO.EQT bought CBR from buyout groups Apax and Cinven in 2007 for about 1.5 billion euros. At the time, net debt stood at 1.2 billion euros, which has been reduced to 500 million.Last year, CBR posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of 105 million euros, having increased its core earnings by 7 percent annually since 2012. Retail fashion companies such as H&M, Inditex , Next, Marks and Spencer, Fast Retailing and Esprit trade at an average of 11.6 times expected core earnings.CBR had just over 600 million euros of revenues from the sale of shirts, trousers and scarves of the Street One brand targeting younger women and of the Cecil brand with its focus on more mature women. The company's margin tops that of peers such as Tom Tailor , Gerry Weber and Esprit, among others, because its wholesale focus means it needs very low levels of working capital. It also benefits from tax losses carried forward and goodwill amortisation of 140 million euros a year, the person said.The company plans to use some of the proceeds from the initial public offering to further reduce its leverage, but also for investment in its ecommerce business and CBR-owned retail outlets.So far, wholesale activities account for 85 percent of revenues, while ecommerce and retail sales through its own shops account for the rest.CBR's management has not held talks with prospective buyers of the company, a second person familiar with the company said. A situation similar to that at perfume retailer Douglas, which was snapped up by buyout group CVC while preparing an IPO is therefore seen as unlikely, the person said.($1 = 0.8836 euros)   (Reporting by Arno Schuetze; editing by David Clarke)",2015-06-09,EQT,"Tue Jun 9, 2015 | 4:31am EDT",UPDATE 1-German fashion group CBR to list on stock exchange,http://www.reuters.com//article/cbr-holdg-ipo-idUSL5N0YV0ON20150609?type=companyNews

CBR has just over 600 million euros ($675 million) in annual revenues from the sale of shirts, trousers and scarves of the Street One brand targeting younger women and of the Cecil brand with its focus on more mature women.Shares are due to start trading on July 2 and the price range has been set at 14-18 euros. The company is targeting a dividend yield of 6.2 to 7.3 percent, Chief Executive Christoph Rosa said on a conference call on Tuesday.That compares favourably with a dividend yield of 3.6 percent at German rival Gerry Weber, 3.5 percent at Hugo Boss and 2.9 percent at H&M, according to ThomsonReuters data. CBR, owned by investment group EQT, said on Monday that it intends to sell 19.4 million shares, including an over-allotment option, giving its equity a value of up to 650 million euros.The company is planning to sell new shares worth 200 million, 90 percent of which will be used to reduce the company's debt by a third to 316 million euros. EQT will sell shares worth up to 92 million euros. EQT, which bought CBR from buyout groups Apax and Cinven in 2007 in a 1.5 billion euro deal, will see its stake decrease to 51-56 percent in the share sale.Including debt and if priced at the upper end of the range, the company will be valued at 965 million euros or roughly 9.5 times its expected core earnings of about 102 million euros.

56,"   By Freya Berry and Sven Nordenstam | LONDON/STOCKHOLM  LONDON/STOCKHOLM Swedish investor EQT is looking to list Dometic in a deal that could value the company, which makes fridges and cookers for caravans and boats, at about $2 billion including debt, three sources said on Tuesday.EQT is working with Lazard (LAZ.N) to prepare the market listing for Dometic, which had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.36 billion crowns ($156 million) in the year to March 31, 2015, the sources said.  The Swedish company has had a checkered history with private equity. Lenders took over Dometic from former owner BC Partners in 2009, when it struggled to repay its debt. Since buying the firm in 2011, EQT has had to inject more capital. Bankers say Dometic could trade at a similar multiple to earnings as Sweden's Thule (THULE.ST), another company that caters to the leisure industry and that was listed by Nordic Capital last year.Thule is trading at about 14 times forecast core earnings for 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. A similar multiple for Dometic could give that business an enterprise value of up to $2.2 billion.EQT and Lazard declined to comment. An initial public offering (IPO) could take place as soon as the last quarter of this year, but is more likely to be in early 2016, another source said, cautioning that no deal was certain.DEBT PILE The total value of shares sold in IPOs in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden was almost $5.3 billion in the first half of this year, up more than 6 percent on the same period last year. The countries accounted for 13.9 percent of the value of shares sold in IPOs across Europe, up from 10.3 percent last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. At a valuation of $2.2 billion, it would be the second largest company to float this year after Swedish hotel property firm Pandox (PANDXb.ST), which listed in June and has an enterprise value of 20.8 billion crowns, according to Thomson Reuters data.The main list on the Stockholm stock exchange had 12 IPOs in the first six months of 2015, up from seven a year ago. Most of the newcomers have performed better than the broader market.Dometic had net debt of 9.18 billion crowns as of March 31, leaving it with a high net debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.7. In June 2014, it amended the terms of its senior debt facilities and raised a new 314 million euro ($346 million)payment in kind bond with 9.50 percent interest.An equity listing could allow Dometic to repay this deeply subordinated debt, with the breakage costs associated with redeeming the bond before maturity dropping significantly from June 2016.In 2012 and 2013, EQT put 625 million crowns of extra cash into the business and converted a 1.1 billion crown shareholder loan into equity. EQT then injected 1 billion crowns of equity when Dometic acquired Atwood Mobile Products in September 2014.EQT previously owned the business 2001 to 2005 after buying it from appliance maker Electrolux (ELUXb.ST). After an unsuccessful attempt at listing in 2003, the private equity fund sold Dometic to BC Partners two years later.

Metro, emerging from years of restructuring and disposals of non-core businesses including the recent sale of Kaufhof department stores, has said it expects to make more acquisitions in future, starting small but potentially building up to sizeable deals.Europe's fourth-biggest retailer said its existing food delivery business grew 14.5 percent in its third quarter to the end of June to account for more than 10 percent of cash and carry sales, while online sales jumped 26 percent.Metro said the purchase of Classic Fine Foods (CFF), which supplies upmarket hotels and restaurants with high-quality products such as dairy, meat and seafood, would help its cash and carry business expand in fast-growing Asian markets.Reuters reported in May that Metro was among suitors for CFF including China' state-owned Bright Food Group Co and Switzerland's DKSH. EQT bought CFF in 2011, hoping to benefit from expected strong growth in the Asian high-end foods market due to an increased consumer taste for Western cuisine.Metro has already moved into food delivery in core markets such as China, Germany and Russia and Chief Executive Olaf Koch said he wanted to expand CFF into selected European countries to better tap the growth potential for the service. ""We see the acquisition of CFF as a good complementary acquisition that will enhance two growth channels: Asia cash and carry and cash and carry delivery in western Europe,"" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who rates Metro ""outperform"".Metro's shares were up 5.5 percent by 1001 GMT, outperforming a 0.2 percent gain in the European retail sector .Metro also reported on Thursday that third-quarter earnings before interest, tax (EBIT) and special items fell 17 percent to 209 million euros ($228 million) on sales down 1.4 percent to 14 billion euros, both roughly in line with analysts' average forecasts.Metro has suffered in the last year due to its large exposure to Russia, where it is one of the biggest food retailers but which has seen consumer confidence dive since the country's involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.CEO Koch told journalists that Metro would slow the pace of new store openings in Russia to seven to eight a year from a previous 20.($1 = 0.9160 euros)   (Writing by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Mark Potter)",2015-08-06,EQT,"Thu Aug 6, 2015 | 7:10am EDT",UPDATE 2-Metro buys Asia food service group for $290 mln,http://www.reuters.com//article/metro-ag-results-idUSL5N10H1CI20150806?type=companyNews

Europe's fourth-biggest retailer said like-for-like sales fell 0.4 percent after a rise of 2.5 percent in the previous quarter, which it said was mainly due to Easter falling earlier this year.

EQT and advisor Morgan Stanley have started to explore options for the business after receiving indications of interests from potential buyers. Both declined to comment.EQT bought a majority in EEW from E.ON in 2012 and acquired the remainder in May. EEW has benefited from a booming German economy as well as rising imports of waste, helped in part by a rise in UK landfill taxes. It is running at full capacity, which has allowed it to raise prices.While large local peers such as Remondis and Alba might face antitrust issues if they attempt to buy EEW, Asian groups with interests in the industry such as CKI, Everbright and Sembcorp are expected to express interest, the sources said.EEW has long-term contracts for accepting waste and for delivering energy, process steam and heat. Like grids or pipelines, it generates stable returns, making it attractive for infrastructure funds. Funds such as MS Infrastructure or Macquarie might take a look, the sources said.In 2015, EEW is expected to post earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation of 160 million euros on sales of 470 million euros, the sources said.The group has a 17 percent market share in Germany.

Morgan Stanley is advising EQT on the sale, the sources said.EQT, Morgan Stanley and the bidders declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.Since the collapse in oil prices in mid-2014, there has been strong demand for mid-stream storage and pipeline assets due to their stable valuations compared to oil exploration and production assets. Investors speculating to sell oil at higher prices in the future have also increased demand for storage assets and made the business of storing oil highly profitable.Koole is expected to post earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of roughly 80-90 million euros this year, the sources said. EQT is hoping to reap 14-15 times that in a potential deal, in line with the multiples paid in Vopak's sale of U.S. terminals to Kinder Morgan earlier this year and of ANZ Terminals to Macquarie last year.EQT bought Koole in 2011 and has expanded the business with several bolt-on acquisitions such as terminals from Westway, NOVA and BP, which in January also announced the sale of another European oil storage asset.Koole is held by EQT's fully invested fund Infrastructure I, which has divested three companies this year - Denmark's NORD,  U.S.-based RTI and Sweden's Swedegas.Bankers are preparing debt packages of around 6.5 times core earnings to back infrastructure bidders, totalling up to 585 million euros of debt financing expected to be in the form of loans.The loans could comprise a five-year facility and a three-year bridge facility, which will be taken out via the bond market.

70,"   By Sven Nordenstam | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Oct 30 Private equity firm EQT plans to list Sweden's Dometic, a maker of appliances for caravans and boats which could be worth more than 20 billion Swedish crowns ($2.35 billion) including debt, in late November, two people familiar with the matter said.One of the sources said EQT was also planning to list education provider AcadeMedia in the last week of November, shortly after Dometic, and hotel chain Scandic the following week. The people declined to be identified because the plans are not yet official.EQT and the companies declined to comment. Dometic could officially announce its listing plans as early as Monday, the sources said.The listings would add to a record year for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Stockholm. So far this year, there have been 14 IPOs on the main list of the stock exchange, the highest in 15 years, most of which have outperformed the market by a wide margin. In the year through September, Dometic had adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 1.66 billion Swedish crowns on sales of 11.2 billion. Scandic Hotels had EBITDA earnings of 951 million crowns in 2014, whereas AcadeMedia made 728 million crowns.Reuters reported last month EQT had picked banks to lead a listings of Dometic, whereas sources told Reuters last year banks had been picked for a listing of Scandic Hotels. EQT has said it is considering a listing for AcadeMedia but not when.In a sign of continued investor appetite for new companies even as equity markets have turned more volatile in recent months, the latest Swedish newcomer, Bravida has outperformed Stockholm's all-share index by 4 percentage points compared to its IPO offer price on Oct. 16.

71,"  (Widens coding)* EEW of interest to several companies, including Chinese* Unusually for China, state firms may bid against each other* Beijing seeking ways to tackle growing refuse problem* German company valued at $1.6-2.1 billionBy Denny Thomas and Arno SchuetzeHONG KONG/FRANKFURT, Nov 17 At least three Chinese state-owned enterprises are bidding for a German waste management company, underscoring China's desire to acquire advanced technology to tackle a growing refuse problem, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The rare bidding war between government companies is also a sign that China is giving greater freedom to its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), as part of President Xi Jinping's reforms of the country's sprawling government entities.Chinese state-backed Beijing Enterprises Water Group Ltd , China Everbright International Ltd and Beijing Capital Group are among the suitors who have submitted  initial bids for Energy from Waste (EEW), the people added.It is Europe's market leader in energy-to-waste and valued at 1.5-2 billion euros ($1.6-$2.1 billion), they said.If successful, the deal would mark China's biggest outbound M&A in the sector in about 16 years, according to Thomson Reuters data. China had set a target to spend about $16 billion between 2013 and 2016 to improve sewage disposal and garbage treatment, according to domestic media reports.Swedish buyout firm EQT put the company up for sale after taking full control of the waste-burning power producer, Reuters reported in September.It is currently drafting a vendor due diligence report, reviewing the tentative offers and will soon shortlist several bidders, with a view to signing a deal in early 2016, the sources familiar with the process added.Heavy Chinese interest and competition among state companies for an overseas asset comes as the government struggles to cope with an acute environment and waste recycling problem.China needs top notch waste management technology to convert the enormous amounts of refuse the world's most populous country generates. ""EEW has state-of-the-art emissions control technology and also employs a very efficient garbage collection management system,"" one person familiar with the company said.Waste treatment and recycling has emerged as one of China's   biggest challenges as it tries to tackle pollution and ease pressure on its depleted and contaminated water and soil.RUBBISH HEADACHE Government researchers have estimated that as much as 7 billion tonnes of waste is buried around China's major cities, and the capital Beijing is now surrounded by a belt of landfill sites known disparagingly as the ""seventh ring road"". To ease the problem, China aims to convert 30 percent of its rubbish to electricity by 2030, up from less than 5 percent now. However, plans to build waste-to-energy power plants have routinely been opposed by residents alarmed at pollution risks.EEW has long-term contracts for accepting waste and for delivering energy, process steam and heat. Like grids or pipelines, it generates stable returns, making it attractive to waste management companies.EQT hired Morgan Stanley to run the sale process and the asset is being heavily marketed in Asia, the people said.Beijing Enterprises, Beijing Capital and China Everbright are working with international banks on the deal, the people added. Last year, Beijing Capital paid almost $800 million to buy New Zealand's biggest waste management firm.Separately, German utility Steag and Macquarie Group's  infrastructure arm have put in a joint bid, as have several infrastructure groups, the people added.EQT, Steag, Macquarie, Morgan Stanley and China Everbright International declined to comment. Beijing Enterprises was not available for comment, while Beijing Capital Group did not provide an immediate response.EEW has a 17 percent market share in Germany and operates around 20 plants, with two-thirds of its sales coming from accepting garbage and the rest from selling energy.About 10 percent of the waste is imported from other countries, mainly the United Kingdom.In 2015, EEW is expected to post earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation of 180 million euros, the sources said.

Some analysts had predicted last month that Kuoni would struggle to get more than the market capitalisation of around 1.1 billion francs for its businesses.The shares jumped 19 percent at 1030 GMT, hitting their highest level in 18 months. The stock has more than doubled from a 13-year low it hit on Sept. 3.The Swiss group said last week EQT was its preferred suitor among several potential bidders wooing it after it sold off European and Asian tour operating businesses last year that had fallen prey to online rivals and jitters from attacks in Tunisia and Egypt. What remained was a growing visa unit that arranges travel permits for governments and companies, a loss-making business that organises accommodation, transport and tours for other operators, as well as a hotel-bed database unit whose margins have been under pressure.""It is our ambition to enable Kuoni to strengthen the leading market position of its businesses both through organic growth and acquisitions,"" said Michael Bauer, a partner at EQT Partners in Zurich.People familiar with the matter said they expect EQT will also seek to acquire the online hotel booking business Hotelbeds Group that tourism group TUI has put on the block.

82,"   By Pamela Barbaglia, Edwina Gibbs and Martinne Geller | LONDON/TOKYO  LONDON/TOKYO Japan's Asahi Group Holdings (2502.T) said it is in exclusive talks to buy SABMiller's SAB.L Peroni, Grolsch and Meantime beer brands for 2.55 billion euros ($2.9 billion), as it looks to offset slow growth in its home market.The sale of the European brands is being orchestrated by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), which is trying to secure antitrust approval for its $100 billion-plus takeover of SABMiller, agreed last year. Asahi is Japan's biggest brewer with 38 percent of its home market, where a shrinking population and the increasing popularity of wine have weighed on beer sales over two decades. With Peroni, Grolsch and Meantime, the company would diversify its footprint with sizeable positions in the premium beer segments of Italy, Britain and the Netherlands, and new distribution opportunities for its namesake Asahi Super Dry.Asahi said it was buying the overseas businesses for growth, while its home market will remain its profit mainstay.""For Asahi this is the answer to a prayer,"" said a source familiar with the matter. The $2.9 billion price tag represents an estimated multiple of 21.5 times the brands' earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), according to Nomura analysts. They say that compares to a multiple of 17.1 times EBITDA that AB InBev is paying for SABMiller. ""We believe that the high multiple likely reflects competitive tension as well as low borrowing costs in Japan,"" Nomura said in a note.However, the source said Asahi had based its offer on an EBITDA figure of 170 million euros, a multiple of only 15 times. The offer is on a debt and cash free basis and hinges on regulatory approval of AB InBev's purchase of SABMiller, which is expected later this year.Asahi and AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer, have agreed to a period of exclusivity while they conduct the relevant employee information and consultation processes.      Reuters previously reported that AB InBev had received offers from U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), Fraser and Neave Ltd (FRNM.SI), which is part of Thai Beverage (TBEV.SI), and European investment firms PAI Partners SAS, EQT Corp and Jacobs Holding. AB InBev, which makes Budweiser and Stella Artois, is making the biggest acquisition in consumer goods history with the purchase of London-listed SABMiller. It has already agreed to sell SAB's majority-stake in U.S. venture MillerCoors to Denver-based venture partner Molson Coors (TAP.N) for $12 billion.Questions remain over the future ownership of SABMiller's Chinese joint venture CR Snow.Asahi was advised by Rothschild, while AB InBev was advised by Lazard and Deutsche Bank. Legal advisers were Hogan Lovells for SAB and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer for AB InBev.

85,"   By Michael Shields | ZURICH  ZURICH Switzerland's takeover regulator still has concerns about some terms of Swedish private equity firm EQT's takeover of travel group Kuoni KUNN.S and rejected an appeal by a major shareholder over a planned share swap associated with the deal.EQT declined to comment on the takeover board's decision and how that might affect its offer for the ailing travel group, which has been hit by competition from online travel companies and unrest in popular tourist destinations. The shareholder, the Kuoni und Hugentobler Foundation, said in a statement that it was still deciding whether to challenge the board's ruling, announced on Thursday, but said it expected the 1.35 billion Swiss franc ($1.41 billion) deal unveiled last month to go ahead as planned.Under Swiss takeover regulations, the foundation has five trading days to decide whether to accept the board's decision or pursue the matter further.The watchdog first set out conditions for EQT's purchase of Kuoni on Feb. 25, which included the stipulation that the ""best price"" rule, guaranteeing equal treatment of all shareholders, must apply. The foundation initially appealed against the ruling in early March.  Stockholm-based EQT has offered 370 Swiss francs per share to holders of Kuoni's publicly traded ""B"" shares. Separately, the foundation agreed to tender to EQT's Luxembourg-based Kiwi Holding vehicle its unlisted ""A"" shares, which accounted for 6.25 percent of the capital and 25 percent of the voting rights of Kuoni, in return for a stake in Kiwi. The value of that deal has not been publicly disclosed. EQT's offer prospectus, dated Feb. 29, said ""the value at which the Kuoni A Shares will be contributed has not yet been agreed"". The foundation had said the A shares were a distinct asset class and should be treated differently from the B shares. But the Swiss watchdog has insisted that the ""best price"" rule must apply to the transaction. The publicly traded B shares, which fell by just over 3 percent in early trading, were 1.1 percent lower at 361.75 Swiss francs by 1236 GMT (8.36 a.m. ET), below EQT's offer price.The foundation, based in Stans, Switzerland, said the offer to B-share holders was not affected by its considerations on whether to challenge the ruling, and it was ""still convinced that the transaction will be carried out as planned"". Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich, said in a note to clients that the takeover board's ruling was unlikely to scupper the deal but could force the foundation and EQT to renegotiate their part of the transaction. Cox said that as the takeover board had ruled against EQT offering the foundation a premium to B-share holders, and given that EQT has said it won't raise its bid, the foundation will likely have to take a smaller holding in Kiwi. EQT's offer is set to run until April 13 unless it is extended.

The publicly traded ""B"" shares, which fell by just over 3 percent in early trading, were 1.03 percent lower at 362.00 Swiss francs by 0915 GMT.EQT in February launched an agreed offer for Kuoni for 1.35 billion Swiss francs ($1.4 billion), taking on a travel group that has been hit by competition from online travel and holiday companies and unrest in popular tourist destinations. It offered 370 Swiss francs for each publicly listed B share, while the Kuoni und Hugentobler Foundation had agreed to transfer its A shares to EQT's Luxembourg-based Kiwi Holding vehicle in return for a stake in Kiwi.The foundation had said the A shares were a distinct asset class and should be treated differently from the B shares.

89,"  ZURICH, April 14 Private equity group EQT has secured nearly 80 percent of the voting rights in Swiss travel group Kuoni, it said on Thursday, clearing a major hurdle for its roughly 1.4 billion Swiss franc ($1.45 billion) takeover offer for listed shares.After an initial acceptance period for Kuoni's listed ""B"" shares ended on Wednesday, EQT held 79.6 percent of voting rights and 74.6 percent of Kuoni's share capital including a block of unlisted ""A"" shares held by the Kuoni and Hugentobler Foundation, which has agreed to a share swap.This easily surpassed the thresholds in the offer and paved the way for EQT to wrap up the deal by May 19, it said.EQT had said last week its 370 franc per share offer for B shares remained intact despite a regulator's ruling questioning terms of a parallel share swap with the foundation. The B shares rose 1.65 percent to 369.25 francs by 0955 GMT.EQT wants to delist the ailing travel group, which has been hit by competition from online travel companies and unrest in popular tourist destinations, to implement a new growth strategy.

99,"   By Pamela Barbaglia and Sophie Sassard | LONDON  LONDON Swedish buyout firm EQT has hired JPMorgan (JPM.N) to handle the sale of German bandage and plaster cast maker BSN medical in a deal expected to be worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.25 billion), three sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.EQT, which acquired 69 percent of BSN medical in 2012 for 1.8 billion euros, is looking to launch a so-called dual track process allowing it to sell or list the business toward the end of the year depending on market conditions, the sources said. EQT and JPMorgan declined to comment. The business, which employs over 5,500 people across the world, is already being looked at by some U.S. heavyweight private equity funds which are expected to show interest, the sources said. BSN's sale would represent the second exit from a healthcare business for Stockholm-based EQT this year after it agreed to sell its medical device firm Atos Medical to PAI Europe for 850 million euros in May. Buyout funds are keen to invest in the healthcare industry, seen as resilient and capable of generating stable revenues even in a tough market.PAI Partners recently agreed to buy French drugmaker Ethypharm for about 750 million euros from fellow private equity firm Astorg, valuing it at more than 12 times its 2015 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 60 million euros. BSN Medical could fetch a multiple of at least 10 times its core earnings of about 200 million euros, the sources said. The Hamburg-based company was set up in 2001 as a joint venture between Germany's Beiersdorf AG and Britain's Smith & Nephew as the two companies decided to combine operations in wound care, fracture management, physiotherapy and compression therapy.  EQT has grown the business over the years through a series of acquisitions as part of a buy-and-build strategy to expand BSN's operations in markets including France, Brazil, South Africa and New Zealand.

Additionally, EQT has received bids for its online bicyle retailer Internetstores - known for the fahrrad.de platform - which it has put on the block with the help of William Blair and for which it has asked to see a price of about 200 million euros or 14 times expected core earnings, they added.EQT and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, while Arma Partners and William Blair were not immediately available for comment.The SAG sale, which is set to officially launch after the summer break, may attract companies from the construction sector, such as Strabag, Vinci, Bouygues , Spie and Caverion as well as other private equity groups. SAG, formerly the energy-related activities of RWE  Solutions, constructs and runs energy grids, employs roughly 8,000 staff and has annual sales of about 1.4 billion euros. It was founded in 1916 as Starkstrom Aktiengesellschaft to advance the electrification of Germany by building infrastructure.EQT, which bought SAG in 2008, last year injected some fresh equity into the group after SAG ran into trouble with some offshore projects and as it saw its French business suffer from the weak economy.Since then, SAG's business has rebounded, and its 2016 EBITDA is expected to be double that of 2014, one of the people said.($1 = 0.8988 euros)   (Editing by Maria Sheahan and Georgina Prodhan)",2016-06-24,EQT,"Fri Jun 24, 2016 | 9:50am EDT",UPDATE 1-EQT launches sale of German utility services provider SAG - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/eqt-sag-sale-idUSL8N19G51V?type=companyNews

124,"  FRANKFURT U.S. software management group CA Inc (CA.O) said on Thursday it has agreed to buy Austrian business automation firm Automic from private equity group EQT in a 600 million euro ($635 million) deal as it seeks to expand in Europe. Automic specializes in helping developers of some of the most complex business applications to roll out new releases of software at companies such as Bosch, Netflix, eBay, Exxon Mobil, Vodafone, Société Générale, General Electric and Swisscom. It aims to post earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 44 million euros in its fiscal year ending in April 2017, on sales of 142 million.The deal values Automic at 13.6 times its expected core earnings, while CA trades at 7.5 times.  CA's shares dropped 3.4 percent by 1633 GMT.Buyout group EQT acquired the company in 2012 for 210 million euros and made 3.2 times its money as measured by its internal rate of return of more than 30 percent.  At the time of EQT's acquisition of Automic, the company made 65 million euros in sales and was very focused on its clients in the German-speaking world. EQT brought in a new management team, bought the largest European peer Orsyp and invested in the U.S. sales force.  The buyout group had launched an auction in summer with the help of investment banks Arma Partners, Goldman Sachs and attracted suitors including buyout group Advent.
