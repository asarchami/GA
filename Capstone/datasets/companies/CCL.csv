3,"  By Andrea LorenzHOUSTON Jan 31 Several ill passengers who disembarked from a Princess Cruises ship in Houston on Friday said they felt like prisoners forced to their cabins for days when the vessel suffered the second outbreak of a stomach illness to hit a cruise ship in a week.The seven-day cruise returned a day early on reports of fog in Houston at around the time of its planned arrival, the company said.""They threatened people, told them that if they didn't stay in their room, they would have them put on a ... Coast Guard ship and brought back to land. It was terrible,"" passenger Steve Juneau told local ABC broadcaster KTRK.Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for the cruise line, said it is policy to ask passengers suffering from stomach and digestive problems to stay in their rooms to prevent problems from becoming worse. Those in cabins are provided with room service.""The last thing that we want to do is to have passengers out and about with those types of symptoms and spreading the illness to others,"" she told Reuters. Some passengers felt a few crew members may have overstepped their bounds by confining those who were not showing any symptoms to their rooms. During the course of the cruise, 178 passengers and 11 crew members reported ill to the ship's medical center, the cruise line said.The ship had 3,104 passengers and 1,149 crew members on board. About three passengers have symptoms of the gastrointestinal norovirus, the cruise line, which is owned by Carnival Corp, said Benson.Some passengers said they were treated kindly by the crew, but many were skeptical of the reason for the early return. ""I wanted to get out,"" passenger Robert Fisher told KTRK. ""I was tired of being held as a prisoner in the room.""Passenger Cathy Russell told local NBC broadcaster KPRC she was quarantined to her room for 80 hours and treated well.""They brought us whatever we needed ... provided room service, so they did what they could do,"" Russell said.

6,"   By David Quiñones  (The headline and 1st paragraph of this March 10 story have been corrected to show passengers are not seeking $5,000 per month for life and corrects 11th paragraph quote to two hours from five hours)By David QuiñonesMIAMI Three passengers suing Carnival cruise lines for damages after an engine fire left their ship adrift for days are asking the company to pay $5,000 per year for life while the rest are seeking $2,500 to $5,000 for four to five years.A lawsuit brought by 33 passengers of the ill-fated 2013 voyage could change how cruise lines insulate themselves from legal actions, according to maritime legal experts.A second pending lawsuit with three-times as many plaintiffs has the potential to further undo the advantageous legal position cruise lines have long enjoyed.Both cases stem from a February 2013 incident when the Carnival Triumph broke down after launching from Galveston, Texas for what was to be a four-day cruise with a stop in Cozumel, Mexico.A fire broke out in the ship's engine room as it was returning from Cozumel. The Triumph was left without engine power, or air conditioning and working toilets. Stalled in the Gulf of Mexico for five days, passengers described human waste seeping into hallways, and being forced to sleep on deck under makeshift tarps with no cooked food.A federal judge in South Florida last week finished hearing three weeks of testimony from passengers and is expected to issue a judgment in the next two months. The Miami lawsuit is the first from the Triumph incident to go to trial, with others in preparation, according maritime lawyers.In a statement, Carnival Corp said that while it recognizes its guests experienced uncomfortable conditions, everyone returned safely and were provided with a full refund, a free future cruise and an additional $500 per person.""This is an opportunistic lawsuit brought by plaintiff's counsel and plaintiffs who seek to make a money grab,"" a company spokeswoman said.One of the plaintiffs, Debra Oubre, 59, said she has experienced panic and anxiety attacks since the cruise, and also blames the experience for a urinary tract infection. ""It was chaotic. People were in dire need of help,"" said Oubre. ""We were standing in line for food for two hours.""Federal judge Donald Graham has already ruled that the engine catching on fire is proof alone of negligence on the part of Carnival, a significant blow for the cruise line, according to Robert Peltz, a Miami maritime lawyer.""It would seem rather obvious that ships shouldn't just catch fire and then have fire suppression systems that don't work,"" Peltz said. Carnival has since started a fleet-wide ""enhancement,"" including a major re-wiring of its engine rooms and improvements to fire safety and emergency power features.Cruise lines like Carnival have successfully inoculated themselves against passenger lawsuits by printing stringent terms on their tickets that require passengers to waive their right to a class-action lawsuit.Graham's ruling, which is expected to come in the next two months, could find the terms of conditions printed on the tickets, so-called ""contracts of adhesion,"" to be overreaching.The contracts have rankled some federal judges in southern Florida where several cruise lines are based, according to maritime lawyer, David Neblett. The splintering of myriad cruise cases for relatively meager sums clogs their calendars, he said.One term of the ticket contract is that passengers can only bring their cases to the Southern District of Florida and plaintiffs lawyers complain that people coming from other states to litigate is too costly for them.(Editing by David Adams and Grant McCool)",2014-03-11,CCL,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 4:33pm EDT",Carnival passengers sue for damages over disrupted 2013 cruise,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-carnival-lawsuit-idUSBREA2A1SU20140311?type=companyNews

8,"  (Adds details from conference call, COO comments, background; updates shares)By Devika  Krishna KumarApril 24 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world's second-largest cruise operator, said its quarterly profit fell by two-thirds as costs rose and passengers spent less onboard.Shares of the company, whose cruise lines include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruise, fell as much as 3.2 percent in early trading.The company shortened or canceled six cruises during January-March, typically the strongest season for cruise operators.Voyage disruptions hurt yields, which include ticket sales and spending on board, by about 0.5 percent in the first quarter ended March 31.Royal Caribbean said its cruise operations were hurt by several mishaps in the first quarter.The company and its larger rival Carnival Corp faced disruptions when a collision between Kirby Inland Marine oil barge and a cargo ship in March spilled residual fuel oil in the Gulf of Galveston, shutting the Houston Ship Channel.The cruise industry has just started recovering from negative publicity after a series of headline-grabbing mishaps, including virus outbreaks and engine fires, over the past two years.Carnival, the world's No. 1 cruise operator, forecast a full-year profit below analysts' estimates in March as it cuts prices and spends more on advertising. Royal Caribbean has also been struggling to boost sales in the Caribbean, its biggest market.""While we were seeing strong bookings for the Caribbean with recent booking volumes trending well above last year's levels, the environment remains very promotional,"" Chief Financial Officer Jason Liberty said on a post-earnings conference call.Royal Caribbean said it expected pricing in the Caribbean to remain under pressure this year.""We needed to introduce more promotions (in the Caribbean) in March and April to close the occupancy gap,"" Chief Operating Officer Adam Goldstein told Reuters.Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, rose 1.3 percent on a constant-currency basis in a quarter in which cruise liners usually offer their best deals. SMOOTH SAILING AHEAD Royal Caribbean said it expected smoother sailing in the coming quarters as bookings were seen rising and demand for its Chinese and European cruises was expected to stay strong.The company said it expected double-digit percentage rise in yields in its Europe and Asia Pacific cruises this year.Europe cruises account for 22 percent of the company's capacity, while Asia Pacific sailings make for 12 percent.

14,"  (Fixes misplaced decimal point in dollar conversion, penultimate paragraph)* Salvage operation one of the largest in maritime history* Captain on trial for abandoning ship, causing the wreck* Ship to be towed to Genoa for scrappingBy Eleanor Biles GIGLIO, Italy, July 14 Technicians on Monday began a complex operation to refloat and tow away the wreck of the Costa Concordia, two and a half years after the luxury liner capsized off the Italian coast, killing 32 people.The rusty hulk of the once-gleaming white 290-metre ship, which ran aground on rocks near the Tuscan holiday island of Giglio while carrying out a display manoeuvre, has been resting on a temporary platform since being righted a year ago. The process of re-floating the 114,500 tonne ship at the end of one of the largest salvage operations in history began when air was pumped into 30 large metal boxes, or sponsons, attached around its hull. The air will force out water in the sponsons and slowly refloat the vessel.""Our hope is not 100 percent but 300 percent that everything goes well and they manage to take this away, that they remove this testimony to human weakness as quickly as possible,"" said island resident Antonio Bellardo. After the ship has been raised about two metres, later on Monday it will be further stabilised with chains and cables, and tug boats will move it about 30 metres into the harbour, where it will be prepared to be towed within days to Genoa in northern Italy, to be scrapped.The ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, is on trial accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck as he sailed too close to shore to ""salute"" the port, and abandoning ship. He is fighting the charges.Paying for the disaster, including breaking up the vessel and repairing damage to Giglio, is likely to cost the ship's owner and operator Costa Crociere, a unit of Carnival Corp , more than 1.5 billion euros ($2.05 billion), its chief executive said last week.The hulk will be demolished and scrapped in Genoa by a consortium including oil services company Saipem and Genoa-based companies Mariotti and San Giorgio.

15,"  (Corrects euro-dollar conversion in penultimate paragraph on story published on Sunday)* Cruise liner's prow to emerge on Sunday* Rough seas to push back departure one day to Tuesday* Survivor says ship departure will let her ""move forward""By Eleanor Biles and Silvia OgnibeneGIGLIO, Italy, July 20 The massive hulk of the Costa Concordia is nearly ready to be towed away from the Italian island where it struck a rock and capsized two-and-a-half years ago, killing 32 people, officials said on Sunday. The rusting prow of the once-gleaming white luxury liner was due to emerge fully from the water for the first time on Sunday, and the ship should be ready to tow on Monday, but the departure has been pushed back a day due to forecasts of rough seas.The 114,500-tonne Concordia has been slowly lifted from the sea floor since Monday, when salvagers began pumping air into 30 large metal boxes, or sponsons, attached around the hull.The air has forced water out of the sponsons, lifting the cruise liner 7.5 metres off the undersea platform where it had been resting, Franco Porcellacchia, the engineer in charge of the salvage, said. There are 6.3 metres to go, he added. A convoy of 14 vessels, led by the tug boat Blizzard, will then tow the Concordia to a port near Genoa, where it will be broken up for scrap, completing one of the biggest maritime salvage operations in history.The president of the French Concordia survivors group Anne Decre, who is on the island of Giglio, told Reuters on Sunday that the departure of the ship will be an important symbolic moment for those who were aboard the night of the shipwreck. ""It gives us the opportunity to try and collect ourselves and move forward,"" she said, adding that the liner will take the same route to Genoa it should have taken more than two years ago to complete its ill-fated cruise.""We hope that we will also be able to return to our route.""The ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, is on trial on charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck as he sailed too close to shore to ""salute"" the port, and abandoning ship. He is fighting the charges.Paying for the disaster, including breaking up the vessel and repairing the damage to Giglio, is likely to cost the ship's owner and operator Costa Crociere, a unit of Carnival Corp , more than 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion), the company's chief executive has said.The cruise liner will be demolished and scrapped in a port near Genoa by a consortium including oil services company Saipem  and Genoa-based companies Mariotti and San Giorgio.

16,"  * Costa Concordia to leave Tuscan island on Wed for scrapyard* Whole operation to cost ship owners over 1.5 bln euros* One of largest maritime salvage operations in historyBy Eleanor Biles and Silvia OgnibeneGIGLIO ISLAND, Italy, July 23 Maneouvres began early on Wednesday to remove the rusty hulk of the Costa Concordia cruise liner from the Italian island where it struck rocks and capsized two years ago, killing 32 people.A convoy of 14 vessels, led by the tug boat Blizzard, will start to tow the Concordia later on Wednesday to a port near Genoa in northern Italy where it is due to arrive on Sunday, before being broken up for scrap.The once-gleaming white luxury liner sank off the holiday island of Giglio in January 2012 after sailing too close to shore. Its wreck has remained there ever since as engineers embarked on one of the largest maritime salvage operations in history.Over the past week, salvagers have slowly lifted the 114,500-tonne ship from underwater platforms by pumping air into 30 large metal boxes, or sponsons, attached to the hull. Franco Porcellachia, engineer in charge of the salvage, said on Tuesday that his team had done everything in their power to make sure the ship, which is around two-and-a-half times the size of the Titanic, was structurally sound.""When we are in sight of the port of Genoa, we can declare victory,"" said Franco Gabrielli, the head of Italy's civil protection service, on Wednesday.The whole salvage operation is set to cost the ship's owners Costa Crociere, a unit of Carnival Corp over 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion), its chief executive said earlier this month.Bad weather delayed the process by two days, and salvage master Nick Sloane said on Wednesday that ""forecasts are good"" and ""today is a big day for Giglio"". Probably before midday, the ship will take a route out of the port towards the east, before heading north at a rate of two knots, or nautical miles per hour, Sloane said.DEPARTURE  The wreck's departure removes both the physical remains, which prompted worries about pollution on the picturesque Tuscan coastline, and the visual spectre of a chaotic evacuation of crew and passengers, some of whom jumped ship and swam ashore.""At the beginning, this ship was a place where I saw tragedy strike, I saw death,"" said Italian Luciano Castro, a survivor of the tragedy. ""Over time though, I thought this ship is also a place where a miracle occurred. It is true that unfortunately 32 people died but also 4,000 people were saved.""The ship's captain Francesco Schettino is fighting charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck as he tried to ""salute"" the port, and abandoning ship.During court proceedings earlier this year, the cruise company's crisis coordinator said Schettino tried to persuade him to pretend an electrical blackout had caused the wreck.One person who was on the ship when it sank is still missing. Salvage organisers have said the search for the body will continue once the Concordia has left Giglio.The ship was righted in September in a complex ""parbuckling"" operation in which the huge hulk was slowly lifted off the rocks in an operation that took 19 hours and drew media coverage from around the world.The demolition and scrapping will be done by a consortium including Italian oil services group Saipem and Genoa-based companies Mariotti and San Giorgio.

20,"  SHANGHAI Oct 15 China, the world's largest shipbuilder, is looking to build its first luxury cruise vessel, with help from cruise operator Carnival Corp and Italian shipyard Fincantieri SpA, as the country looks to expand domestic tourism.Carnival said on Wednesday it has signed a memorandum of understanding with China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC),  with the eventual aim of forming a joint venture that would also include Italy's Fincantieri.China's cruise industry is predicted to become one of the world's largest with 4.5 million passengers by 2020, according to government figures. It has become a top target for firms like Carnival and Royal Caribbean as its fast-growing middle class eye new holiday options. Carnival said it would provide ship design and shipbuilding expertise to help create and define the overall specifications for the China-built cruise ship. It said the MoU also included other opportunities, such as the formation of a domestic cruise company. China's shipbuilding industry, which stormed past South Korea to become the world's largest in 2010, has been hit hard by a prolonged global shipping slump. That has left many of its yards with high debt burdens and a lack of orders. The government has moved to support the industry, which employs millions of workers, by providing subsidies to encourage shipping lines to order new ships. It has also encouraged yards to venture into building higher-tech vessels, such as offshore equipment.CSSC, one of China's top two state-owned shipbuilding firms, has shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange through its subsidiary China CSSC Holdings. At 0334 GMT, shares in CSSC Holdings were down 3.8 percent, while the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.4 percent.

25,"  * More than 100 being monitored in case they are infected* Obama says sealing off West Africa would make situation worse* GlaxoSmithKline says work on developing vaccine moving rapidly* Canada to ship vials of experimental vaccine to WHO   (.)By Roberta RamptonWASHINGTON, Oct 19 With three cases of Ebola diagnosed in the United States and  more than 100 people being monitored for possible infection,   President Barack Obama said on Saturday that Americans ""can't give in to hysteria or fear"" about the spread of the virus.While Obama administration and world health officials remained focused on tackling Ebola at its source in three West African countries, Texas state authorities said 14 people had been cleared from an Ebola watch list. Three weeks of monitoring for fever and other symptoms was expected to end for others in the next two days if they remained asymptomatic.Those include Louise Troh in Dallas, fiancée of the now deceased Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan, who became the first U.S.-diagnosed Ebola case in late September while visiting her. Troh, her 13-year-old son and two Duncan relatives have been in mandatory quarantine in Dallas that ends on Sunday.The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement that 145 people with ""contacts and possible contacts"" with the virus were being monitored.In his weekly radio address, Obama made plain he does not plan to accede to demands from some U.S. lawmakers for a ban on travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the worst-hit countries, where more than 4,500 people have died since March in the worst Ebola outbreak on record.""We can't just cut ourselves off from West Africa,"" Obama said. ""Trying to seal off an entire region of the world, if that were even possible, could actually make the situation worse.""Obama, who has been criticized over his administration's handling of Ebola, held a flurry of meetings this week and on Friday appointed Ron Klain, an experienced Washington lawyer, to   oversee efforts to contain the disease. Republicans questioned why he did not pick a medical expert.""I hope he (Klain) is successful in this. I think it's a step in the right direction, but I just question picking someone without any background in public health,"" Republican Rep. and House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce told CNN.The World Health Organization has also been faulted for failing to do enough to halt the spread of the virus.The WHO said it would publish a full review of its handling of the crisis once the outbreak was under control.There is no cure or approved vaccine yet for Ebola but pharmaceutical companies have been working on experimental drugs. The virus is transmitted through an infected person's bodily fluids and is not airborne. Canada said on Saturday it would ship 800 vials of its experimental Ebola vaccine, undergoing clinical trials, to the WHO in Geneva, starting on Monday. Iowa-based NewLink Genetics Corp holds the commercial license for the Canadian vaccine.Britain's biggest drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline, said  work to develop a vaccine was moving at an ""unprecedented rate"" and the next phase, if successful, involving vaccinating frontline healthcare workers, would begin in early 2015.FEAR Obama sought to put the extent of the disease in the United States in perspective. ""What we're seeing now is not an 'outbreak' or an 'epidemic' of Ebola in America,"" he said. ""This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear.""A series of Ebola scares has hit the country since Duncan, who died on Oct. 8, was diagnosed. Americans' faith in the medical system and in its disease prevention  ability was jolted by early missteps in his case. In a public letter on Saturday night, Texas Health Resources Chief Executive Barclay Berdan acknowledged that the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where Duncan first went ""made mistakes in handling this very difficult challenge,"" including initially not correctly diagnosing his symptoms.Berdan said aggressive actions and changes since then ensured that the hospital was ""a safe place"" for patients and staff, and that outside experts would be consulted to determine how two nurses caring for Duncan became infected with Ebola.Amber Vinson is at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, while Nina Pham is being treated at the National Institutes of Health outside Washington.People who had contact with them or Duncan are being monitored, while some 800 passengers who flew with Vinson on a trip she made to Ohio before being diagnosed, as well as those  on subsequent flights on the same planes, have been contacted by  Frontier Airlines, it said on Saturday.Also being monitored are a lab worker at the hospital who is not ill but is in isolation at sea in her cabin on the Carnival Magic cruise ship owned by Carnival Corp. The worker had no contact with Duncan but may have come in contact with test samples. The ship was on its way back to Galveston, Texas.The Ohio Department of Health strengthened its recommended Ebola quarantine protocols to limit travel by those required to have their health condition monitored locally or report it to officials. Ohio said its vigilance was meant to exceed CDC recommendations.Obama has stressed that containing Ebola should include help for the worst-hit countries and Washington plans to deploy up to 4,000 military personnel to the region by late October.

26,"  * More than 100 being monitored in case they are infected* Obama says sealing off West Africa would make situation worse* GlaxoSmithKline says work on developing vaccine moving rapidly* Canada to ship vials of experimental vaccine to WHO   (Adds more people to come off Ebola watch list in Texas on Sunday and Monday)By Roberta RamptonWASHINGTON, Oct 18 With three cases of Ebola diagnosed in the United States and  more than 100 people being monitored in case they are infected,  President Barack Obama said Saturday that Americans ""can't give in to hysteria or fear"" about the spread of the virus.As though to illustrate his point, a Dallas bus and train station was closed on Saturday afternoon over concern about a woman who fell ill. The woman was first reported to be on the checklist for possible Ebola exposure but turned out not to be.While Obama administration and world health officials were still focused on tackling Ebola at its source in three West African countries, Texas state authorities said 14 people had been cleared from an Ebola watch list. On Sunday and Monday, more were expected to end 21 days of monitoring for fever and other symptoms if they are asymptomatic.They could include Louise Troh in Dallas, fiancee of the now deceased Liberian man who was the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States in late September while visiting her. Troh, her 13-year-old son, and two relatives of Duncan have been in mandatory quarantine at an undisclosed location in Dallas.In all, 145 people with ""contacts and possible contacts"" with the virus were being monitored, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement.In his weekly radio address, Obama made plain he is not planning to give in to demands from some lawmakers for a ban on travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the worst-hit countries where more than 4,500 people have died since March in the worst Ebola outbreak on record.""We can't just cut ourselves off from West Africa,"" Obama said. ""Trying to seal off an entire region of the world, if that were even possible, could actually make the situation worse,"" he said. Obama has been criticized over his administration's handling of Ebola. He held a flurry of meetings in the past week and on Friday appointed Ron Klain, a lawyer with long Washington experience, to oversee the effort to contain the disease.Republicans questioned why he did not pick a medical expert.""I hope he (Klain) is successful in this. I think it's a step in the right direction, but I just question picking someone without any background in public health,"" Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN on Saturday.The Obama administration is not alone in facing criticism. The World Health Organization has been faulted for failing to do enough to halt the spread of the virus.The agency promised it would publish a full review of its handling of the crisis once the outbreak was under control, in response to a leaked document that appeared to acknowledge that it had failed to do enough. There is no cure or approved vaccine yet for Ebola but pharmaceutical companies have been working on experimental drugs. The virus is transmitted through an infected person's bodily fluids and is not airborne.Canada said on Saturday it would ship 800 vials of its experimental Ebola vaccine, undergoing clinical trials, to the WHO in Geneva, starting on Monday. Iowa-based NewLink Genetics Corp holds the commercial license for the Canadian vaccine.Britain's biggest drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said on Saturday that work to develop a vaccine was moving at an ""unprecedented rate"" and the next phase, if successful, involving vaccinating frontline healthcare workers, would begin early in 2015.FEAR Obama sought to put the extent of the disease in the United States in perspective. ""What we're seeing now is not an 'outbreak' or an 'epidemic' of Ebola in America,"" he said. ""This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear."" A series of Ebola scares has hit the country since the Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, was diagnosed. He died in a Dallas hospital isolation ward on Oct. 8.  Americans' faith in the medical system and in authorities' ability to prevent the disease from spreading was jolted by a series of missteps when he was initially not diagnosed.Two nurses who were part of the team caring for Duncan contracted Ebola. Amber Vinson is being cared for at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, while Nina Pham is being treated at the National Institutes of Health just outside Washington.A chain of people who had contact with either Duncan or the sick nurses are being monitored. Some 800 passengers who took the same planes as Vinson on a trip she made to Ohio before being diagnosed, and passengers on subsequent flights using the same planes, have been contacted by the airline, Frontier Airlines, the carrier said on Saturday.The airline said in a letter to employees that it had been informed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the Dallas nurse may have been in a more advanced stage of the illness than previously thought when she traveled back to Dallas from Cleveland on Oct. 13.Those being monitored include a lab worker at the hospital, who is not ill but is in isolation at sea in her cabin on the Carnival Magic cruise ship owned by Carnival Corp. The lab worker did not have contact with Duncan but may have come in contact with test samples. The ship was on its way back to Galveston, Texas.Obama has stressed that containing Ebola should include help for the worst-hit countries and Washington plans to deploy up to 4,000 military personnel to the region by late October. Obama is preparing to ask for additional funds from Congress to beat Ebola and could make the request next week, according to a Bloomberg report.British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Saturday European Union leaders should raise the amount of money pledged to fight Ebola to 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) and mobilize at least 2,000 workers to head to West Africa. A spokeswoman at Cameron's office said the EU commission and 28 member states had pledged a total of 500 million euros so far to fight Ebola.Combating the disease was also among the subjects of talks being held on Friday and Saturday between American and Chinese top diplomats.(Additional reporting by Mohammad Zargham and Eric Beech in Washington, Frank McGurty in New York, Anna Driver in Dallas,  Tom Miles in Geneva, and Costas Pitas in London; Writing by Frances Kerry and Megan Davies; Editing by David Clarke, Grant McCool and James Dalgleish)",2014-10-19,CCL,"Sat Oct 18, 2014 | 9:54pm EDT",WRAPUP 6-Americans 'can't give in to hysteria or fear' over Ebola -Obama,http://www.reuters.com//article/health-ebola-usa-idUSL2N0SD0DX20141019?type=companyNews

The Costa Concordia was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio and capsized, killing 32 people. The ship remained partially submerged near the port of the holiday island for more than two years before being raised and towed away this year in one of the largest and most complex maritime salvages ever completed. ""We will ask Costa for 30 million euros in damages to Tuscany's image,"" the region's president, Enrico Rossi, told a court in the Tuscan city of Grosseto, according to a statement. Rossi said the region had registered a decline in tourism, and that Giglio had lost 45,000 visitors due to the disaster.      A consultant to Giglio's local government, Carlo Scarpa, asked the same court for 190 million euros in damages, most of it for tarnishing the island's image, according to a source present during the proceedings.The two officials spoke during an ongoing trial against Concordia Captain Francesco Schettino, who is being tried for multiple charges, including manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship.  ""To reconstruct the image of Tuscany as a top tourist destination will require years of work, substantial investments and costly national and international advertising campaigns,"" Rossi said. Costa Cruises last year avoided a criminal trial by agreeing to pay a 1 million-euro fine to the Italian state, but victims and local administrations have pursued damages separately. Shortly after the January 2012 shipwreck, Costa Cruises also agreed to pay about 11,000 euros to each of the more than 3,000 passengers for items lost and any psychological damages to passengers who suffered no physical injuries.Sources involved in the trial say a verdict may be read during the first few months of next year.

54,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Carnival Corp (CCL.N), the world's largest cruise ship operator, issued a profit forecast for the current quarter that missed analysts' estimates, overshadowing better-than-expected third quarter results.Carnival's shares fell as much as 5.7 percent to $49.67 on a weak day for the broader market.Like most U.S. corporations with large overseas operations, Carnival has been struggling with the effects of a strong dollar and sluggish global economy.The company warned on Tuesday that geopolitical issues such as the migrant crisis in Europe could pose a challenge to pricing in the region.However, Chief Executive Arnold Donald said the company's strategy in the market has not changed. ""It is not as if Europe is falling off a cliff or something,"" Donald told Reuters.Carnival forecast current-quarter adjusted earnings of 36-40 cents per share, below the 46 cents analysts were expecting on average.

Carnival became the first cruise operator to be allowed to sail to Cuba, following U.S. President Barack Obama's historic visit to Havana last week.On Wednesday, the company revised its full-year profit forecast to $3.20-$3.40 per share from $3.10-$3.40.Chief Executive Arnold Donald said on a conference call with analysts that it was too early to know the exact impact from the Brussels attack but the company was ""comfortable"" with its forecast. The company said it shifted some ships in its Costa cruise line to China from the challenging trading environment in Southern Europe in the quarter ended Feb. 29.Net revenue yield, which takes into account spending per available berth, rose 5.7 percent in constant currency in the first quarter. Carnival's revenue rose 3.4 percent to $3.65 billion - the first rise in five quarters - marginally beating the average analyst estimate of $3.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.This was in contrast to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, which reported revenue below the average analyst estimate last month.Carnival's net income nearly tripled to $142 million, or 18 cents per share, for the first quarter, from $49 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, Carnival reported a profit of 39 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 32 cents.Carnival's shares were up 3.6 percent at $51.44 on Wednesday.

68,"  * New markets needed as Japan, Korea demand drops* Floating terminals offer small growth opportunities* Asia LNG prices down 80 pct from early 2014By Sonali PaulPERTH, April 14 The world's top producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are investing in ship-fuelling operations, floating import terminals and power plants to open new markets and keep from drowning in a fuel surplus expected to last into the next decade.Companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total  and Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Bhd are scrambling to create demand as cheap coal and cleaner wind and solar power threaten to curb growth in the 250 million-tonnes-a-year LNG market.LNG suppliers have been put in a tough spot as demand from the world's top importers of the past few decades, Japan and South Korea, has declined due to slowing economies, more efficient use of power, and switches to coal and renewables.Using LNG, employed now mostly in power generation, as a fuel for transport is one of the industry's biggest hopes. ""If we can secure only 10 percent of the heavy transport market, you're talking about 70 million tonnes (a year) extra demand. That's almost as much as Japan,"" Shell's integrated gas director, Maarten Wetselaar, told reporters at a conference in Perth, Australia, this week.Shell recently signed a deal to supply LNG to Carnival Corp , the world's biggest cruise operator, and sees huge potential to fuel ships, trucks and buses, which it says use the equivalent of 700 million tonnes of LNG a year in oil products.Australia's Woodside Petroleum also took a small step this week to grow LNG demand in transport, buying an LNG-fuelled supply vessel that could be a seed for developing LNG as a shipping fuel in Australia. Woodside is also eyeing road transport markets, such as for trucking. FLOATING TERMINALS It was against the backdrop of a vast surplus, stalled demand and weak prices that Woodside scrapped its plans for the $30 billion Browse floating liquefaction plant off Western Australia.LNG imports by Japan and South Korea fell last year by 7 million tonnes, offsetting growth in the rest of Asia and leading to the region's first annual drop in demand since 2009, the International Gas Union (IGU) said in a report this week.Over the past two years supply growth and shrinking demand has pulled spot LNG prices in Asia LNG-AS down 80 percent to just above $4 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). ""It appears unlikely that demand in this region will fully recover in the near-term,"" the IGU said.To help develop markets, Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said his company is willing to co-invest in floating storage and regasification units, which can cost less than $100 million and be developed quickly.Compared with Woodside's cancelled Browse investment that would be a tiny commitment. The lower cost is an equally important factor for less developed countries that do not have the demand or cash for the enormous projects of the past, making small-scale LNG projects key to the spread of the fuel.Egypt, Jordan and Pakistan started importing LNG at floating terminals last year. And in 2016, another 12.3 million tonnes a year in import capacity will be added by new floating terminals in Colombia, Ghana and Puerto Rico.Malaysia's Petronas also sees opportunities to co-invest in import terminals in Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Vietnam, said its head of LNG trading and marketing, Ahmad Adly Alias.French oil and gas giant Total is trying a slightly different approach, tying up with major importer Korea Gas Corp  to develop new markets, and working with Indonesia's Pertamina to build an import terminal and pipe gas to an independent power project (IPP).""We are not a fan of investing in an IPP, but if we need to create demand, why not?"" Total CEO Patrick Pouyanné told reporters at the conference.

People born in Cuba can, however, travel to the island on an airplane.""American citizens, Cuban Americans have a right to travel, and we should not be in a situation where the Cuban government is forcing its discrimination policy on us,"" Kerry said. ""So we call on the government of Cuba to change that policy and to recognize that if they want a full relationship, a normal relationship, with the United States, they have to live by international law and not exclusively by their own,"" he said during a trip to Miami.Carnival officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company has told the Miami Herald it had no choice but to enforce the rule when booking tickets for its new Miami-to-Havana route. It said it has asked the Cuban government to waive the rule before the first ship sails on May 1.A State Department official said, ""Secretary Kerry in no way meant to convey that Carnival is supporting policies that are discriminating against Cuban American travelers."" Miami is the center of the U.S. Cuban-American community, and many of its residents from the island nation, who fled Cuba after its Communist revolution, are vehemently opposed to President Barack Obama's moves toward more normal relations with Havana.Critics of the policy say Washington should not ease a half century of restrictions on travel and trade until Cuba has free elections and its human rights record improves.  Kerry, who gave two interviews to local media, met with business leaders and addressed college students, said Cuba could move more quickly to improve its rights record. But he said he was sure a more open relationship with the United States would yield positive changes.""I think more could happen faster. More should happen faster. But I'm not surprised. Nobody expected that. This has been 50-plus years of the status quo ... but there are changes that are in place for the positive,"" Kerry said.

Carnival is due to become the first U.S. cruise company to sail directly to Cuba in more than half a century on May 1, but the exclusion of Cuban-Americans has prompted a lawsuit against the company and protests in Miami.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday that Carnival ""needs to not discriminate"" and called on Cuba to change the policy.

Carnival's May 1 cruise, the first from the United States to the Communist-run country since the 1959 revolution, was thrown into doubt when the company triggered a backlash in Miami by refusing Cuban-Americans passage due to a Cold War-era law.A statement carried by state-run media said starting April 26, Cuban citizens would be authorized ""independently of their migratory status to enter and leave as passengers and crews of cruise ships.""""We are extremely pleased.

91,"   By Patricia Zengerle and Mike Stone | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. companies are looking for ways to persuade President-elect Donald Trump to soften his threats to cancel the Obama administration's opening to Cuba, a reversal they fear could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.During his campaign, Trump said he thought restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba was fine, but that Democratic President Barack Obama should have pushed harder for concessions from Havana before easing restrictions on travel and trade.On Monday, three days after the death of revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, the Republican president-elect said in a Twitter post that he would end what he referred to as Obama's ""deal"" if Cuba did not do more for its people.But he did not promise to reverse the changes, and advocates for closer ties said they hoped the businessman-turned-politician would stay true to his roots and foster economic ties.""He has said things that are frankly hopeful to folks on both sides of the debate,"" U.S. Representative Mark Sanford, one of several Republican lawmakers who back increased engagement, told Reuters.Trade associations for companies with business interests in Cuba hope to persuade Trump to continue Obama's opening, and have been discussing a joint effort to press the Republican's administration, a person with knowledge of the talks said.Trump won the White House on promises to create jobs. Advocates for increased engagement argue that promoting U.S. trade with Cuba would create opportunities, and jobs, in industries from telecommunications to agriculture, and particularly in tourism. SMALLER PIECE OF CAKE Several U.S. airlines are already flying to Cuba, Starwood Hotels & Resorts signed a contract to manage a Cuban hotel and Carnival Corp has begun cruises to the island.While business in Cuba has yet to generate much revenue for U.S. companies, reversing Obama's policies could leave Americans out of a potential market or mean their investments so far have been wasted. ""If the U.S. continues to limit trade (with Cuba), and the European Union, China and Russia continue to expand trade, there will be a smaller piece of cake left for U.S. companies,"" said Jose Maria Vinales Camallonga, director of International Operations at Lupicinio, a Spanish law firm that represents large corporations in their Cuba dealings.As Trump issued his tweet on Monday, American Airlines Flight 17, the first commercial flight in more than half a century between the United States and Havana took off for the Cuban capital, part of a wider push by U.S. carriers to boost flights there.If flights stopped or demand slipped because Trump imposed new travel restrictions, U.S. airlines could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue in the years to come, said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.The Department of Transportation has authorized 1.2 million seats for trips to Cuba by commercial U.S. carriers per year, below the 3.4 million airlines requested, but representing significant revenue, he said. Cuba also represents a potential market for U.S. products such as chickens, wheat and rice, though U.S. farm exports to the island have actually fallen since Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro moved to normalize relations in December 2014.Still, lawmakers from several states with big agricultural sectors like Arkansas and Texas back closer ties.If Trump reversed Obama's Cuba policies ""he would have to take on one of his main constituencies, which is the business community,"" said Julia Sagebien, an expert on Cuban business at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. In a bid to cement Obama's Cuba policy before Trump takes over on Jan. 20, the administration has been encouraging U.S. companies to forge further business deals.More than half a dozen announcements, in areas from travel to manufacturing to telecommunications, had been expected in the next two months, a person familiar with the matter said.

92,"   By Susan Heavey | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Carnival Corp's Princess Cruise Lines will plead guilty to seven felony charges for polluting the seas and deliberate acts to cover it up, and pay a record $40 million criminal penalty, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.The charges against Carnival's Santa Clarita, California-based Princess unit stem from ""illegal dumping of oil contaminated waste from the Caribbean Princess cruise ship,"" the department said in a statement on the company's ""deliberate pollution of the seas and intentional acts to cover it up.""Shares of Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator, were down more than 2 percent at $50.29 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the announcement. The Caribbean Princess had been making illegal discharges since 2005 using bypass equipment - including a so-called ""magic pipe"" - to circumvent pollution-prevention equipment that separates oil and monitors oil levels in the ship's water, the department said.""We are extremely disappointed about the inexcusable actions of our employees who violated our policies and environmental law when they bypassed our bilge water treatment system and discharged untreated bilge water into the ocean,"" Princess Cruises said in a statement.The cruise line also said it has implemented measures to improve oversight and accountability and invested in training and equipment upgrades to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. U.S. investigators began to probe the ship's actions after a whistle-blower engineer reported illegal dumping off the coast of England in August 2013. Two other top ship engineers then ordered a cover-up, called on subordinates to lie and sought to remove the pipe.  ""This is a company that knew better and should have done better,"" Assistant Attorney General John Cruden said in the statement. ""Hopefully the outcome of this case has the potential not just to chart a new course for this company but for other companies as well.”The Caribbean Princess ship visited ports in nine U.S. states and two territories, including Florida, New York, Maine the U.S. Virgin Islands, the department said.  U.S. investigators also found the Caribbean Princess and four other Princess ships engaged in two other illegal practices affecting water discharge, it added.U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer in Miami called the company's conduct overall ""particularly troubling,"" given its ""documented history of environmental violations,"" including in southern Florida.Cruise ship travel has generated concern among environmental groups and governments over water contamination and waste as the industry adds passengers, routes and larger ships.  Some environmental groups have criticized the cruise industry for not being more proactive in reducing air and water pollution and for not being transparent about their efforts.Friends of the Earth’s 2016 report rating cruise ship lines gave Princess Cruises an overall grade of ""C"" with an ""A-"" for water quality compliance and an ""F"" for transparency. Cruise Line International Association, which represents the industry, has pledged to take steps to reduce cruise travel's environmental impact and has said cruise lines must follow international standards.
