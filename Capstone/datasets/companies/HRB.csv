0,"   By Avik Das  U.S. tax preparer H&R Block Inc (HRB.N) said it would sell its bank unit to BofI Federal Bank, freeing the company from Federal Reserve oversight.Shares of H&R Block, which was forced to end an earlier deal to divest the division, rose about 7 percent after the bell.BofI Federal Bank, which operates from a single location in San Diego, is a unit of BofI Holding Inc (BOFI.O).BofI Holding shares were up more than 10 percent in extended trading.""H&R Block's sale of the bank has the potential to be a seismic event for the stock,"" BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said in an e-mail.""By removing itself from Federal Reserve oversight, HRB would be in position to lever itself up and use the proceeds to buy back a very significant portion of its outstanding shares,"" Palmer said. H&R Block said it expects the deal to generate excess capital of about $200 million to $250 million.The company has been seeking strategic alternatives for H&R Block Bank since October 2012 to avoid a sharp rise in costs associated with the introduction of stricter banking rules by the U.S. Federal Reserve.""This is an important step in ceasing to be regulated as a savings-and-loan holding company,"" H&R Block Chief Executive Bill Cobb said in a statement. The company said in July it would sell its banking assets to a unit of Republic Bancorp Inc (RBCAA.O) but failed to close the deal in October as it could not get regulatory approvals.H&R Block said on Thursday it expected the transaction to dilute its earnings by about 7-9 cents per share beginning in fiscal 2015. The company also said it expects to incur a related loss of about 3 cents per share in 2014.The company also expected to incur a related one-time charge of about 1 cent per share in 2014 and about 2-3 cents per share in 2015. H&R Block expects the deal to close in time for the next tax season.BofI Federal said in a separate statement it would get about $450 million to $550 million in customer deposits and balances on prepaid cards, including Emerald Cards, as part of the deal.Goldman Sachs & Co and First Annapolis Consulting Inc were the financial advisers to H&R Block. Stinson Leonard Street LLP and Covington & Burling LLP were the legal advisers.H&R Block shares closed at $28.42 on the New York Stock Exchange, while BofI Holding closed at $74.44 on the Nasdaq.(Reporting by Avik Das in Bangalore; Editing by Simon Jennings and Sriraj Kalluvila)",2014-04-10,HRB,"Thu Apr 10, 2014 | 6:35pm EDT",H&R Block to sell bank unit to BofI Federal Bank,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-hrblockbank-sale-idUSBREA391W820140410?type=companyNews

2,"  * World Bank cuts global 2014 outlook* Traders eye low volume and volatility* H&R Block rallies after fourth-quarter results* Indexes down: Dow 0.4 pct, S&P 0.3 pct, Nasdaq 0.1 pct   (Updates to open, adds H&R Block results)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, June 11 U.S. stocks edged lower on Wednesday, with indexes pulling back from record levels, though analysts viewed the market's recent uptrend as intact.Wall Street has struggled for direction lately, with daily modest moves in either direction. The S&P 500's 0.3 percent decline on Wednesday represented the benchmark index's biggest daily decline since May 20. In a cautious note, the World Bank late Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecast for 2014 to 2.8 percent from 3.2 percent due to the impact of the Ukraine crisis and a harsh U.S. winter. However, with those issues largely in the rear-view mirror, the World Bank was confident economic activity was shifting to a stronger footing.While the upward trend still considered intact, a lack of major trading events could limit gains. The Dow ended at a fourth straight record Tuesday, while the S&P 500 closed lower after four days of record finishes.""There's a bid underneath this market, and anytime we're lower it isn't long before buyers materialize, which should allow us to keep grinding higher until the next earnings season,"" said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Global Financial Private Capital in Sarasota, Florida. ""There's not much in the market that's super cheap, but equities still offer the best yield"" among asset classes.Investors were keeping an eye on low levels of both trading volume and volatility. The lighter-than-average volume could make the market vulnerable to sharp fluctuations, while some view the low levels of the CBOE Volatility index - the so-called 'fear gauge' - as a sign the market is not fully taking into account issues that could derail the rally.The VIX rose 4.6 percent to 11.48 on Wednesday but remains well under its historical average of 20. In a sign of the market's low volatility, the 14-day Average True Range on the S&P 500 hit 10.09, the lowest since February 2013. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.25 points or 0.42 percent, to 16,874.67, the S&P 500 lost 5.75 points or 0.29 percent, to 1,945.04 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 6.00 points or 0.14 percent, to 4,332.00.H&R Block Inc was the S&P's biggest percentage gainer, up 4.1 percent to $32 after reporting fourth-quarter results. Micron Technology gained 2.9 percent to $30.36 a day after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock to $50 from $30.Sources told Reuters that Amazon.com Inc later this year plans to launch a marketplace for local services, from babysitting to party clowns, beginning with a single market. Shares rose 1.9 percent to $339, limiting the Nasdaq's decline on the day.Orexigen Therapeutics Inc plummeted 16 percent to $5.73 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed a decision on the marketing application for its obesity drug by three months.Bank of America Corp has reached an impasse in negotiating a multibillion-dollar settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice relating to the bank's mortgage investments, according to the New York Times. Shares of BofA fell 1.4 percent to $15.69.

5,"   By Ross Kerber  H&R Block Inc expects a boost from new U.S. tax forms required under President Barack Obama's healthcare law and from new clients seeking the company's help, Chief Executive Officer Bill Cobb told Reuters on Wednesday.Cobb said the Kansas City, Missouri, company expected about 25 percent of its clients to file one of two forms newly required on 2014 returns by the 2010 Affordable Care Act.While Cobb would not disclose specific pricing figures, he said Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria had offered estimates in the right ranges. Luria has suggested H&R Block could charge anywhere from $5 to $30 to fill out each of the new forms. Luria estimates about 13.9 million clients will visit H&R Block's retail locations. If 25 percent of them pay $30 to file one of the new forms, that would yield as much as $104.25 million in additional revenue for the company this year. Cobb said he expected the new healthcare requirements to attract more new clients as well. ""Generally tax complexity is a good thing for H&R Block,"" Cobb said.For the year ended April 30, H&R Block said its revenue rose 4 percent to $3.02 billion, including $2.56 billion in the all-important February-April quarter.Cobb would not say how much the company will charge per form. He said H&R Block also faced higher costs such as for training its employees to handle the new paperwork. H&R Block has charged Massachusetts residents $5 to process the state healthcare form required by a law passed under then-Governor Mitt Romney, but at least one of the so-called Obamacare forms is far more complex. As the largest tax preparation service, H&R Block handles about 21 million U.S. returns a year, including roughly 7 million that taxpayers complete with the company's software. Under Obamacare, the current tax season will mark the first time people will have to reconcile their actual 2014 income with what they estimated when they signed up for health insurance exchanges.Taxpayers who earned more than they estimated will have to repay subsidies they received when they purchased their 2014 insurance. Cobb said 50 percent or more of those who received subsidies may fall into this category. People who did not have health insurance during 2014 will have to file a separate form to calculate their penalties.

6,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. consumer bureau and the Navajo Nation filed charges on Tuesday against companies and executives they say used H&R Block franchises to operate an illegal tax-refund scheme.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it is seeking court approval to collect about $438,000 in civil penalties, plus more money in redress for victims, many of whom are Navajo citizens.The CFPB said Jeffrey Scott Thomas and his company, J. Thomas Development of NM Inc, no longer own the four H&R Block franchises and that H&R Block did not participate in the scheme. The bureau also charged Dennis Gonzalez and his loan company, S/W Tax Loans, alleging they participated in the scam to steer low-income consumers into expensive risky loans.Michael Goodman, an attorney for Thomas and his company, said the CFPB's complaint represents ""allegations, not facts"" and that no consumers complained about the services.  An attorney for Gonzalez did not respond to a request for comment.According to the CFPB's complaint, which was filed in a federal court in New Mexico, Thomas set up and financed S/W Tax Loans, which offered short-term, high-interest loans that consumers could secure using their anticipated tax refunds.The CFPB claims that Thomas told tax preparers to offer consumers only these types of loans, and not more affordable loans offered through H&R Block. Tax preparers who worked for Thomas received bonuses based on the number of clients who took advantage of loans offered by S/W Tax Loans, also called Southwest Tax Loans, and consumers did not know the preparers had incentives to offer them, the CFPB said. The CFPB also accused the defendants of ""illegally and grossly"" understating the loans' annual percentage rates.The CFPB said Gonzalez, who served as S/W Tax Loan's president and was a friend of Thomas, had managerial responsibility in the business and, therefore, ""materially participated"" in the scheme.Paul Spruhan, an assistant attorney general for the Navajo Nation, said Tuesday's case marks the first time the Navajo Nation has sued a border town tax-lending service. The CFPB is seeking to ban Thomas and Gonzalez from offering financial products associated with tax refunds for five years.
