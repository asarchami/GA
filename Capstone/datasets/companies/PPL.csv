0,"  May 28 PPL Corp said Wednesday it completed refueling and maintenance work on its 1,260-megawatt (MW) Unit 1 at the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania but decided to keep the reactor shut for turbine work.PPL decided to work on the turbine so the company can complete a root cause analysis of the plant's turbine issues later this year, company spokesman Joe Scopelliti said in an email.He did not say when the unit would likely return to service.PPL has worked on or inspected the turbines at both Susquehanna units several times over the past few years. In some cases, the company has shut the unit specifically to look at the turbines, while in other cases PPL used a shutdown for other reasons such as refueling or an unplanned outage to inspect the turbines.Since 2011, the company has inspected the turbines in Unit 1 at least five times and Unit 2 at least six times. Unit 2 most recently shut for a couple weeks in March for turbine work.Scopelliti has said in the past the problem is with the low-pressure turbines. He said each unit has three low-pressure turbines and one high-pressure turbine. The low-pressure turbines were replaced in 2003 and 2004.German engineering company Siemens AG  manufactured the low-pressure turbines and is working with PPL to resolve the issue. The high-pressure turbines, meanwhile, were replaced between 2008 and 2011 as part of an uprate or power increase for the reactors.Meanwhile, the 1,260-MW Susquehanna 2 was operating at full power early Wednesday, according to a report by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.---------------------------------------------------------- PLANT BACKGROUND/TIMELINE STATE:      Pennsylvania COUNTY:     Luzerne TOWN:       Salem Township OPERATOR:   PPL Susquehanna LLC OWNER(S):   PPL Corp (90 pct) Allegheny Electric Coop Inc (10 pct) CAPACITY:   2,520 MW UNIT(S):    1 - 1,260-MW General Electric boiling waterreactor2 - 1,260-MW General Electric boiling water reactor FUEL:       Nuclear DISPATCH:   Baseload COST:       $4.1 billion  TIMELINE: 1983       - Unit 1 enters commercial service 1985       - Unit 2 enters commercial service 2008       - PPL files with NRC to build one of Areva SA's1,600 MW Evolutionary Power Reactors(EPR) at the site to be called Bell Bend.

Riverstone will own the rest.PPL, which will have no ownership interest in Talen Energy, will focus on the rate-regulated utilities it owns in the United Kingdom, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, which generated 84 percent of its earnings from ongoing operations last year.PPL shares rose nearly 3 percent to $35.17 in morning trading on Tuesday. PPL's spinoff comes after Duke Energy Corp in February announced plans to sell off its Midwest commercial generation business, including stakes in 13 power plants, citing ""volatile returns"" in a competitive market.""The deal is definitely a marker that transactions are possible, where other power producers such as American Electric Power Co Inc could potentially divest their unregulated, generation businesses,"" said BGC Financial analyst Kit Konolige.A glut of shale gas has weighed on power prices in some U.S. markets, prompting utilities to increase their reliance on the regulated portions of their businesses. ""As PPL has grown its rate-regulated business portfolio significantly over the past several years, PPL's Energy Supply business has not -- in our view -- achieved appropriate equity valuation,"" PPL's Chief Executive William Spence said in a statement.The spinoff is expected to eliminate a number of positions at plants and in corporate support services but PPL did not specify the number of job cuts.Talen Energy will operate 15,320 megawatts of generating capacity in Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Montana.

Stock was trading up 4.7 percent at 11:53 a.m. ET.The company said on Thursday it would sell a natural gas-fired plant to TransCanada Corp for $654 million and two hydroelectric projects to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP for $860 million.

13,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  Electricity producer Talen Energy Corp TLN.N said private equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC will buy the remaining stake it does not already own in the company for about $1.8 billion, amid a string of deals in the U.S. power industry.Talen Energy's shares were up nearly 16 percent in early morning trading on Friday.Falling demand in both open and regulated power markets due to increased energy efficiency and a weak economy has led to several deals as U.S. power producers and utilities look to cut costs.Talen was formed when Riverstone's generation assets were merged with Pennsylvania power company PPL Corp's (PPL.N) merchant generation business.Merchant power generation businesses sell power to wholesale markets, where prices are not regulated by the government.Shares of Talen, which owns or controls 16,000 megawatts of generating capacity for wholesale power markets, in northeast, mid-Atlantic and southwest regions of the United States, began trading in May last year. Riverstone will offer $14 per share in cash for the 65 percent stake it does not own, representing a 17.3 percent premium to Talen's Thursday close.""Valuation is high compared with where Talen shares trade, but it's consistent with public market deals,"" Guggenheim Partners LLC analyst Shahriar Pourreza said.""Stock hasn't fared well versus the other independent power producers,"" Pourreza said. ""The assets aren't as great and likely better in hands of private equity."" Through Thursday's close, Talen shares had more than halved since May last year.The agreement, which has an enterprise value of $5.2 billion, provides for a ""go-shop"" period of 40 days, during which Talen may enter into talks with parties that offer alternate proposals.The deal is expected to be funded by converting Riverstone's existing stake into shares of the new company, Talen's cash on hand, and a $250 million secured term loan. The power company would be required to pay a fee of $50 million to Riverstone if the agreement is terminated for a better proposal, but the fee will be reduced to $25 million if it accepts a superior proposal made during the go-shop period.Pourreza said a new bidder is not likely to emerge.Citi is Talen Energy's financial adviser for the deal and Kirkland & Ellis LLP its legal adviser. Goldman Sachs & Co and RBC Capital Markets are the financial advisers to Riverstone, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP its legal advisers.
