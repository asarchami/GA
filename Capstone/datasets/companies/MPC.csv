0,"  * Wholesale gasoline prices jump in US Midwest* Marathon, Valero, Exxon, PBF confront cold* Many problems seen short-livedHOUSTON, Jan 7 Frigid weather rattled several U.S. refiners on Tuesday, temporarily affecting production from Canada to Tennessee, and boosting wholesale gasoline prices in the Midwest more than 7 cents a gallon.Marathon Petroleum Corp. said its 120,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Detroit refinery lost instrument air due to freezing temperatures, while Valero Energy Corp.  reported its 180,000 bpd Memphis refinery had a ""system shutdown believed to be due to low temperatures in the area,"" according to a filing with state and federal regulators.Those notices came one day after an equipment shutdown due to cold weather at Exxon Mobil Corp's 238,000 bpd Joliet, Illinois refinery. Exxon said the refinery was back to normal operations on Tuesday. The company did not describe the malfunction but said it resulted in releases through its flare stacks.Gasoline for Midwest markets outside of Chicago climbed 7.5 cents a gallon on Tuesday to a discount of 15 cents a gallon to  the February RBOB gasoline contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, traders said.Gasoline for delivery to the Chicago market rose 5.35 cents  to an offer price of 12 cents a gallon under February RBOB, traders said. Citgo Petroleum Corp said its 174,500 bpd Lemont, Illinois refinery was ""running at planned rates"" while ""working its way through minor issues caused by low ambient temperatures.""Cold weather can pose significant challenges to refiners. Some refinery units operate at nearly 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (540 degrees Celcius). Oil and other feedstocks running through plant pipelines are heated to 300 or 400 degrees. Sudden deep drops in temperature can cause liquids to freeze - leading to breakdowns or piping ruptures.And there can be problems like that cited by Marathon at its Detroit plant. Instrument air links to sensors used to monitor the status of equipment at refineries. Without instrumentation, most refinery units go to flaring to prevent a problem until the sensors can be fixed. Energy industry intelligence company Genscape reported on Tuesday that a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit was shut down late Monday at Marathon's Detroit refinery.The outages at Marathon and Exxon appeared to be short-lived. Marathon said it was beginning the process of restarting the affected units.Other refineries were not so lucky.In Canada, North Atlantic Refining Ltd's Come by Chance refinery in Newfoundland was still offline following power cuts in the region that started on Thursday, before a blizzard hit the area and two days before a fire at a power substation, local media reported. Flaring, emissions and power trouble were reported at several other U.S. refineries on Tuesday, though weather was not immediately cited as a contributing factor.Flaring reportedly occurred at Marathon's 212,000 bpd Catlettsburg Refinery in Kentucky and PBF Energy Inc's  182,200 bpd refinery in Delaware City, Delaware.Traders said PBF's 160,000 bpd refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, was shut by a power outage.Just as cold weather was spreading across the United States, Monroe Energy LLC, a unit of Delta Air Lines Inc, started planned maintenance on a crude unit and isocracker at its 185,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania.IIR, an energy market intelligence provider, reported that some units at the plant were shut on Friday and would be shut for 30 days, though a company spokesman on Monday could not specify when the work started.Genscape reported brief, elevated flaring on Friday at the refinery.",2014-01-07,MPC,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 5:35pm EST",UPDATE 2-Frigid temperatures snarl some U.S. refinery operations,http://www.reuters.com//article/refinery-operations-weather-idUSL2N0KH1CJ20140107?type=companyNews
1,"  By Kristen Hays and Anna DriverHOUSTON Jan 29 Marathon Petroleum Corp, Valero Energy Corp and Phillips 66, the three largest U.S. independent refiners, reported quarterly results on Wednesday that topped Wall Street estimates as cheaper crude prices and rising exports helped profits.Sour crudes from Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico contributed to the lower prices, along with the opening of more pipeline capacity throughout 2013 that increased flows of cheaper inland U.S. crudes to Gulf Coast refineries - replacing some types of more expensive imports.New infrastructure - built in large part to handle surging output of unconventional North American crudes from shale deposits and Canada's oil sands - has benefited plants on the Gulf Coast, home to more than 40 percent of U.S. refining capacity.Many of those refineries have ramped up exports of fuels to Europe and Latin America, where demand is surging because of a lack of local refining capacity.Marathon more than doubled its refined product exports to 298,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter from year-ago levels, and aims to increase that capacity to 400,000 bpd. Phillips 66's exports reached 197,000 bpd, a 32 percent rise on the year and toward its goal of 500,000 bpd of export capacity.U.S. officials said exports of refined products hit a record 3.66 million bpd last week.""Gulf Coast refiners are the best positioned to benefit from price-advantaged North American crudes and the global refined product market,"" Roger Read, a refining analyst at Wells Fargo, told clients on Wednesday.Marathon shares gained 4 percent to $86.52, Valero added 2.4 percent to $51.40, while Phillips 66 shares closed down 1.2 percent to $74.18. DEBATE OVER CRUDE EXPORT BAN With output of domestic U.S. crudes surging and available refinery capacity limited, some oil producers have urged Congress to lift a ban on nearly all crude oil exports that was imposed in the 1970s.Valero has come out firmly against scrapping the rule, apparently because it could mean higher domestic crude prices.Marathon Petroleum Chief Executive Gary Heminger told analysts the company was not opposed to U.S. crude exports, but that the debate over whether to lift the prohibition could ""take a long time"" in Washington.With some political analysts saying voters who remember long gas lines from the 1970s will balk at lifting the ban, some refiners are investing in infrastructure to boost exports. Phillips 66 Chief Executive Greg Garland said the company is considering building a condensate splitter at the same marine terminal in Freeport, Texas, where a liquefied petroleum gas export terminal is under construction.Condensates are very light hydrocarbons defined as crude under U.S. law, and cannot be exported without being processed.Garland had previously said Phillips 66 didn't envision building a splitter, but the company's recently-launched midstream partnership provided a natural home for that infrastructure. He also said it would be an export terminal.""When you look at the economic value created, it encourages you to do these things,"" Garland told Reuters in an interview.Heminger hinted that Marathon, which is building condensate splitters at its Ohio and Kentucky refineries to process Utica shale condensate, is considering a similar project on the Gulf Coast, though he wasn't explicit. He said the light hydrocarbon also can be part of refineries' crude slates and shipped to Canada to dilute heavy Canadian oil so it can move in pipelines. ""We are looking more at the opportunities we have to be able to bring that condensate into our system along with the Utica condensate that we've already announced,"" he said.MORE PIPELINE CAPACITY Additional pipeline infrastructure last year eased Gulf Coast crude prices, cutting costs for refiners.Gulf Coast crude benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet, which had traded at an average $1-a-barrel premium to international Brent  for most of last year, fell abruptly to a steep discount in the fourth quarter - further discouraging imports.Valero Energy's fourth quarter profit was lifted by a $325 million gain on the sale of its interest in retail business CST Brands Inc. Excluding items, the San Antonio company had a profit of $1.78 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.66 per share.It said its 235,000-barrel-per-day Quebec City, Quebec, refinery was expected to run 100 percent North American crude oil by the end of 2014. Valero has been boosting the refinery's capacity to receive crude oil from the United States by rail.Marathon, which operates large plants in Garyville, Louisiana and Texas City, Texas, also had a profit that surpassed expectations, but maintenance costs contributed to a lower quarterly profit.For the fourth quarter, Marathon reported net income of $626 million, or $2.07 per share, down from $755 million, or $2.24 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding items, Marathon earned $2.10 per share, a figure that handily beat analysts average estimate of $1.15 per share.Phillips 66 had a quarterly profit of $826 million, or $1.37 per share, compared with $708 million, or $1.11 per share in the same quarter a year earlier.

2,"   By Kristen Hays and Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Jan 29 Marathon Petroleum Corp, Valero Energy Corp and Phillips 66, the three largest U.S. independent refiners, reported quarterly results on Wednesday that topped Wall Street estimates as cheaper crude prices on the Gulf Coast helped profits.Startups of multiple pipelines in Texas throughout 2013 increasingly brought cheaper inland U.S. crudes to Gulf Coast refineries, replacing more expensive imports and alleviating bottlenecks in the Midwest.Seaway is one such project, involving the reversal of an existing pipeline to deliver 400,000 barrels per day from the Cushing oil storage hub to the Gulf Coast. The pipeline, owned by Enterprise Product Partners and Canada's Enbridge Inc  began operations in May 2012, was expanded in January 2013 with a new twin line with capacity of 450,000 bpd planned to start up in the second quarter.Seaway was the only major artery from the bloated U.S. crude futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast, until last week when TransCanada Corp opened its 700,000 bpd Gulf Coast pipeline - the southern leg of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. The new infrastructure - built in large part to handle surging output of unconventional North American crudes - has benefited plants on the Gulf Coast, which has more than 40 percent of U.S. refining capacity.Many of those refineries have ramped up exports of fuels to Latin America and Europe.

Gulf Coast crude benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet, which had traded at an average $1-a-barrel premium to international Brent for most of last year, fell abruptly to a steep discount in the fourth quarter - further discouraging imports.The cost benefit was similar to the advantage held by Midwest refiners in recent years, as the Cushing glut pushed West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices to sharp discounts to Brent and other global crudes.

11,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault  Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) is poised to expand its growing Midwest and Gulf Coast fuel trading operation to the East Coast with Thursday's deal to buy Hess Corp's (HES.N) retail network and transport contracts.The purchase will give Marathon control of Hess's gasoline stations and access to pipelines, including the capacity to ship approximately 40,000 barrels per day on the sought-after Colonial Pipeline from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, according to the companies. The $2.9 billion deal is expected to close late in the third quarter.Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said the deal will ""further leverage"" the company's refining and logistics assets, ""providing an outlet for an incremental 200,000 (barrels per day) of assured sales from our refining system.""That likely means opening up new trading opportunities. Marathon's nearest refinery is nearly 500 miles east of New York City in Canton, Ohio, with few major pipelines in between. Shipping fuel north from its Texas and Louisiana plants should offer new opportunities for enterprising traders.""Marathon is not seen as a big, active, trader, so it will be interesting to see if that changes,"" said Robert Campbell, a New York-based analyst at consulting company, Energy Aspects.The purchase would allow Marathon to complement its diesel export business, bringing gasoline into New York Harbor as it sends distillate to Europe, he said.Marathon has shipped about 3.3 million barrels of distillate fuels out of the country in the past 12 months, sending shipments to destinations including Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, the Netherlands, and the Philippines, according to data compiled by Reuters. Marathon's exports trail those of integrated global oil companies like Shell and BP, and merchant traders like Vitol and Trafigura. ""Marathon will probably look at bringing blended product from the Bahamas into Florida and also move product out of the Midwest into Pennsylvania and PADD 1,"" Campbell said.A massive oil storage facility in the Bahamas may offer the chance for traders to use lower-cost ships to transport fuels to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast, where Marathon operates two major refineries. Shippers may use lower-cost foreign ships to transport oil through the Bahamas, bypassing regulations that require special ships for use between U.S. ports.The deal will not include the nearly 40 million barrels worth of petroleum product storage terminals up and down the Eastern seaboard that Hess sold last year to Buckeye Partners LP (BPL.N) for $850 million.It is not clear how the lack of company-owned storage terminals may affect Marathon's trading plans, although many owners - including Buckeye - typically lease out their tanks since they don't own their own retail outlets. Marathon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.EAST COAST OPPORTUNITIES The purchase of Hess's network will unite the fourth and fifth largest U.S. gasoline retailers, making it the largest company-owned and -operated chain in the nation by revenue.With a major position on the East Coast, Marathon could also become an important player in the New York Harbor market, where benchmark U.S. gasoline and diesel prices are set. Marathon doesn't trade ""much"" now, but that's likely to pick up when they take over retail outlets, said an East Coast-based products broker.Hess has long been a major importer of gasoline and other fuels into the East Coast until a year ago, when it scaled back by about 75 percent on a monthly basis, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.In 2012 it imported 19.8 million barrels of products to the region; by contrast Marathon imported just 84,000 barrels.But Marathon has become a growing force in both Midwest and Gulf Coast markets since spinning off from oil producer Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) in 2011.

13,"   By Anna Driver and Sayantani Ghosh | HOUSTON/BANGALORE  HOUSTON/BANGALORE Refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) said it would buy oil and natural gas company Hess Corp's (HES.N) retail and transport business for $2.87 billion, expanding its network of gas stations and convenience stores along the U.S. East Coast.While Hess has been shedding downstream assets to focus on more profitable shale drilling, the deal offers Marathon a buffer against the volatile refining business by boosting exposure to more stable cash flows from retail. It also provides a guaranteed market for the company's fuel, Marathon's Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said on a conference call on Thursday.Marathon Petroleum sells gasoline, food and drinks mainly through 1,480 Speedway convenience stores it owns and operates in nine states in the U.S. Midwest.

The industry group's data also showed a 1.5-million-barrel draw at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub, and a 1.4 million-barrel-draw on gasoline stocks in the week to May 23, which could be supportive for prices.Traders await the U.S. Energy Information Administration's(EIA) official report at 1100 EDT (1500 GMT) on Thursday.An uneasy calm returned to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine after government forces killed dozens of rebel fighters earlier this week. But traders were not reassured as the European energy commissioner said it is unlikely Kiev and Moscow will resolve all issues in the gas price dispute before Sunday's June 1 deadline.""This is profit-taking ahead of the EIA and API reports,"" said Bill Baruch, senior market strategist at iitrader.com in Chicago. ""With regards to Ukraine, there is a positive aspect in that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. But as fighting picks up, there is worry about the gas supply and this is going to directly affect Brent.""U.S. oil settled down $1.39 at $102.72 a barrel, and Brent fell 21 cents to settle at $109.81 a barrel.Libyan oil output shrank again because an armed group disrupted operations at Hariga port. However, Libya's turmoil has largely been priced in, traders said. They were focused instead on U.S. economic data from Tuesday showing an unexpected rise in long-lasting manufactured orders in April and a boost in consumer confidence in May.The data helped push the U.S. dollar to an eight-week high and made commodities like oil, which are priced in dollars, more expensive.Marathon Petroleum said its 522,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in Garyville, Louisiana, was partially shut due to a windstorm. That put more pressure on crude prices.U.S. gasoline futures settled 1.07 cents up at $3.0059 a gallon, having risen from an intra-session low of $2.9812 a gallon after the Marathon refinery shutdown was announced.Also weighing on oil prices, European and U.S. equities eased after two days of record highs.Investors' appetite for equities has been supported by recent strong U.S. economic data and expectations of monetary easing by the European Central Bank, while the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note touched below 2.46 percent, its lowest level since July.

23,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Marathon Petroleum Corp is considering the permanent shutdown of the smallest gasoline-producing unit at its Galveston Bay refinery in Texas in 2016, rather than make costly upgrades to bring the unit into line with environmental rules, sources familiar with the refinery's plans said on Friday.Marathon is planning on shutting its 60,000 barrel per day (bpd) fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC) unit 1 because of the cost of adding a scrubber unit that would replace the current electrostatic precipitator.The FCC was originally built during World War Two to boost gasoline production for the U.S. military. While the FCC has been upgraded since the war, it still uses the precipitator to capture a very fine powder called catalyst that may flow out of the unit and be carried into the atmosphere from the unit's stack.The Galveston Bay refinery also has a 120,000 bpd FCC, which will continue in operation.In 2016, the operating permit for the 60,000 bpd FCC  expires. To renew it, Marathon would have to add a scrubber unit to capture the catalyst. A scrubber mixes liquid into stack gas to capture catalyst, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide before they are released into the atmosphere.An FCC uses a very fine powder known as catalyst to convert gasoil produced by a crude distillation unit into gasoline. Fluidic refers to the catalyst, which acts like a fluid in the unit.""We generally do not comment on our operations,"" Marathon official Stefanie Griffiths said by email when asked about the refinery.Another refiner, Valero Energy Corp, is scheduled to shut the FCC at its 125,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana plant in 2015 as part of an agreement with environmental regulators, company Chairman Bill Klesse said in March. The Meraux refinery will rely on a hydrocracker to produce motor fuel.  BP Plc, the previous owner of the Marathon refinery, shuttered a 36,000 bpd FCC in 2006, after the refinery was idled by heavy damage from a chaotic shutdown ahead of Hurricane Rita's 2005 landfall along the Texas coast. Marathon demolished the idled FCC last year.CDU OVERHAUL WEIGHED  The sources also said Marathon is weighing overhauling one of two 218,500 bpd crude distillation units at its 451,000 bpd Galveston Bay plant.Marathon has a scheduled an overhaul of the Galveston Bay refinery's 60,000 bpd ultracracker, a hydrocracking unit, from September to mid-November, the sources said. The CDU, called Pipestill 3A, would be shut while the ultracracker work is being performed.The company is in the process of integrating the Galveston Bay refinery, which was purchased in 2013 from BP, with Marathon's 80,000 bpd refinery located across the street.If Marathon undertakes the overhaul of Pipestill 3A, it would be second crude unit overhaul at the Galveston Bay refinery this year. The refinery's other CDU, called Pipestill 3B, was overhauled from mid-January to mid- March of this year.

24,"  (Adds details from statement, background on retail and pipeline operations)July 31 Marathon Petroleum Corp, the third-largest standalone U.S. refining company, said its quarterly profit rose 44 percent, helped by higher crude refining margins on the Gulf of Mexico coast.Gulf Coast refiners' profits have shot up as new and expanded pipelines bring them cheaper North American crude, helping them boost margins when exporting refined products.Marathon's purchase of BP Plc's Texas City refinery in 2012 has raised its exposure to the Gulf Coast, which now accounts for about two-thirds of its refining capacity.Crack spread - the difference between the price of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it - for Light Louisiana sweet on the Gulf Coast rose by $2.55 per barrel in the second quarter from a year earlier, the company said. Marathon, which is making a big push into pipeline and retail businesses to shield itself from the volatile refining business, said it expects to invest about $295 million in Enbridge Inc's Southern Access Extension pipeline project.The pipeline will transport crude oil from Flanagan, Illinois, to a crude storage and blending hub in Patoka, Illinois, and is expected to up and running by mid-2015.Marathon also said that the Federal Trade Commission had concluded its review of the company's purchase of Hess Corp's retail  business and that the deal would close by the end of the year. Marathon bought the business to expand its network of gas stations and convenience stores along the U.S. East Coast. The deal will result in Marathon's retail unit, Speedway, growing to more than 2,700 stores in 23 states, the company said.Net income attributable to Marathon rose to $855 million, or $2.95 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $593 million, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.5 percent to $26.84 billion.Marathon on Wednesday raised its share buyback program by $2 billion.The company also raised its dividend to 50 cents per share from 42 cents, marking the fourth such increase since it was spun off from Marathon Oil Corp in July 2011.(Reporting by Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Simon Jennings)",2014-07-31,MPC,"Thu Jul 31, 2014 | 7:57am EDT",UPDATE 1-Marathon Petroleum profit up 44 pct as margins rise,http://www.reuters.com//article/marathon-pete-results-idUSL4N0Q65RN20140731?type=companyNews

29,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Tesoro Corp (TSO.N) and Marathon Petroleum Corp's (MPC.N) contingency plans to employ replacement workers at two of their refineries after union employees hit the picket lines are under scrutiny by inspectors in both Kentucky and California, officials of the two states said Wednesday.Kentucky's Labor Department opened an investigation into Marathon’s Catlettsburg refinery after it received a compliance complaint on Monday, a day after union workers walked out, agency spokesman Daniel Lowry said.Lowry said the investigation involves health and safety issues.Marathon spokesman Brandon Daniels said the company is cooperating with the investigation, but said he had no further information. In California the state's Department of Industrial Relations had planned inspections at Tesoro's Carson refinery before the strike, once it was clear that the company and the local chapter of the United Steelworkers were not going to agree on a new contract, agency spokeswoman Julia Bernstein said Wednesday. The state has not sent inspectors to Tesoro's other refinery, in Martinez, which was shut due to the strike, she said.  Tesoro did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The California refineries are among nine facilities represented by the USW where workers have hit the picket lines. Eight of the plants have remained operational with replacement workers.The U.S. Department of Labor has an open investigation that dates back into Marathon's Galveston Bay facility, which is among the refineries where strikes have occurred, a department spokesman said. The investigation started on Dec 10, before the strikes and stems from a complaint regarding the recording of workplace injuries, the spokesman said.  Galveston Bay is the only Texas facility with an open investigation. Officials in Washington, where workers have walked out at Tesoro's Anacortes refinery, did not respond to questions about whether the facility was visited by inspectors. Often, a complaint or an incident gets the attention of state and federal inspectors. Since the walkout on Sunday, Tesoro's Carson refinery has reported two unexpected unit upsets to state regulators.     Further walkouts may be ordered at some of the other 63 refineries and chemical plants if advances are not made, the union has said. The walkouts are in support of a nationwide pact that would cover 30,000 workers and mark the industry's first big strike since 1980.Lynne Hancock, spokeswoman for the USW, said the replacement workers lack the rigorous training that USW workers receive.""They know the ins and outs of these facilities, and have years of training,” she said.

34,"   By Jarrett Renshaw | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Tesoro Corp (TSO.N) and Marathon Petroleum Corp's (MPC.N) contingency plans to employ replacement workers at two of their refineries after union employees hit the picket lines are under scrutiny by inspectors in both Kentucky and California, officials of the two states said Wednesday.Kentucky's Labor Department opened an investigation into Marathon’s Catlettsburg refinery after it received a compliance complaint on Monday, a day after union workers walked out, agency spokesman Daniel Lowry said.Lowry said the investigation involves health and safety issues.Marathon spokesman Brandon Daniels said the company is cooperating with the investigation, but said he had no further information. In California, the state's Department of Industrial Relations had planned a routine inspection at Tesoro's Carson refinery before the strike, and decided to use the time to also check the qualifications of the replacement workers once the strike occurred, agency spokeswoman Julia Bernstein said Wednesday. The state has not sent inspectors to Tesoro's other refinery, in Martinez, which was shut due to the strike, she said.  Tesoro did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The California refineries are among nine facilities represented by the USW where workers have hit the picket lines. Eight of the plants have remained operational with replacement workers.The U.S. Department of Labor has an open investigation that dates back into Marathon's Galveston Bay facility, which is among the refineries where strikes have occurred, a department spokesman said. The investigation started on Dec 10, before the strikes and stems from a complaint regarding the recording of workplace injuries, the spokesman said.  Galveston Bay is the only Texas facility with an open investigation.Officials in Washington, where workers have walked out at Tesoro's Anacortes refinery, did not respond to questions about whether the facility was visited by inspectors. Often, a complaint or an incident gets the attention of state and federal inspectors. Since the walkout on Sunday, Tesoro's Carson refinery has reported two unexpected unit upsets to state regulators.     Further walkouts may be ordered at some of the other 63 refineries and chemical plants if advances are not made, the union has said. The walkouts are in support of a nationwide pact that would cover 30,000 workers and mark the industry's first big strike since 1980.Lynne Hancock, spokeswoman for the USW, said the replacement workers lack the rigorous training that USW workers receive.""They know the ins and outs of these facilities, and have years of training,” she said. ""The people inside now don’t have that advantage.”(This version of the story corrects paragraph five to say inspection was routine instead of planned due to strike.)

35,"  (Adds details throughout)By Erwin SebaHOUSTON Feb 21 The U.S. refinery strike widened on its 20th day, with workers at the nation's largest refinery walking off jobs and joining picket lines on Saturday as the United Steelworkers union (USW) pushes for a new contract that improves wages and safety.Strikes are underway or have been called at 15 plants, including 12 refineries with a fifth of U.S. crude processing capacity. The stoppages, which have forced companies to rely on trained temporary workers to keep plants running close to normal, are the largest in the refining sector since 1980.Shortly after talks between union and oil company representatives ended on Friday night, the union notified Motiva Enterprises of a strike by its members at the company's 600,250 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.The USW also gave notices on Friday of strikes to begin in 24 hours at Motiva's 235,000 bpd Convent, Louisiana and 238,000 bpd Norco, Louisiana refineries and the Shell Oil Co chemical plant in Norco, the union said.""The industry's refusal to meaningfully address safety issues through good faith bargaining gave us no other option but to expand our work stoppage,"" USW International President Leo Gerard said in a statement.Both sides indicated further negotiations this weekend had not been scheduled.Motiva is a 50-50 joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell Plc  and Saudi Aramco. Shell's U.S. arm Shell Oil Co is the lead oil company negotiator in talks with the USW for a national agreement on safety, pay and benefits. A Shell spokesman said the company was disappointed by the Port Arthur walkout and strike notices to the Louisiana plants.""We believe this move sets the wrong tone for both parties to move forward and reach an agreement,"" said Shell spokesman Ray Fisher. ""We remain committed to continued safe operations and productive negotiations.""The strike that began Feb. 1 was last expanded Feb. 6, when workers at BP Plc-operated refineries in Indiana and Ohio were told to begin a work stoppage the following day.Workers were already on strike at Shell's 327,000 bpd joint-venture refinery in Deer Park, Texas, and an adjoining chemical plant. The Deer Park workforce walked out when the strike began on Feb. 1. The strike may complicate operations at the Port Arthur refinery, which failed to restore its second largest crude distillation unit (CDU) to full production after restarting on Friday following a three-day shutdown to fix leaking piping, sources told Reuters.The 195,000 bpd CDU is one of three at the refinery that do the initial refining of crude oil coming into the plant and provide feedstock for all other production units.The refinery's largest CDU, which has a rated capacity of 325,000, bpd is running at about 200,000 bpd, the sources said, because a 60,000 bpd hydrocracking unit is shut due to a malfunction. The hydrocracker produces motor fuel, primarily diesel, which has become a lucrative export for U.S. refiners.Motiva also shut a 92,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at the refinery in early January for an overhaul. It is scheduled to restart in the first half of March. Shell and the union had been meeting continuously since talks resumed on Wednesday following a week-long break for the company to reply to an information request and a counterproposal from the USW.Union negotiators rejected the seventh contract offer from Shell on Thursday night.Earlier this week, the USW's lead negotiator, International Vice President Gary Beevers, told Reuters that safe staffing levels at refineries and chemical plants were a sticking point in the talks.Another point of contention is the absence of ""no retrogression"" language, which preserves agreements from previous contracts not addressed in negotiations this year.In addition to the two BP-operated plants, workers are striking at refineries and plants owned by Lyondell Basell , Marathon Petroleum Corp, and Tesoro Corp  in California, Kentucky, Texas and Washington state.Only one refinery has shut down due to the strike.Tesoro's 166,000-bpd plant in Martinez, California, was scheduled prior to the strike for a partial shutdown to perform a planned multi-unit overhaul. Company officials decided to idle the entire plant after the walkout began and said production would not resume during the work stoppage.The USW is seeking a three-year, industrywide pact that would cover 30,000 workers at 63 U.S. refineries that together account for two-thirds of domestic capacity.

43,"  Hourly workers represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW) at Marathon Petroleum Corp's Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery voted on Friday to approve a new contract, ending a two-month work stoppage, a company spokesman said.The workers at the refinery, who walked off their jobs on Feb. 1 as part of the largest strike by U.S. refinery workers in 35 years, are scheduled to begin returning to work next week, according to a report posted on the website of the Ashland, Kentucky, Independent newspaper.""We are pleased that the contract was ratified,"" said Marathon spokesman Chuck Rice.The Catlettsburg refinery continued production during the strike with temporary replacement workers. Workers at 15 plants, including 12 refineries that accounted for one-fifth of national crude oil processing capacity, walked off their jobs while the USW was negotiating a national agreement governing wages, benefits and safety policies with lead U.S. refinery owner negotiator Shell Oil Co, the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc.A new national agreement was reached on March 12. Workers at several locations have continued work stoppages while local issues are hammered out.  Workers remain on strike at Marathon's Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, and at an adjoining power generation plant. Strikes are also continuing at BP Plc's Whiting, Indiana, refinery, the BP-Husky Energy joint-venture refinery in Toledo, Ohio, and Lyondell Basell Industries refinery in Houston.

45,"  (Adds details, background)HOUSTON, April 16 Striking workers at the Marathon Petroleum Corp's Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas, rejected the company's ""last, best and final"" contract offer, according to a union official representing the workers.In rejecting the offer, the United Steelworkers told Marathon it was willing to resume negotiations on Monday in an effort to end the work stoppage that began on Feb. 1 by 1,100 hourly employees, said Larry Burchfield, vice president of USW Local 13-1, which represents the Galveston Bay workers.The company's final offer could cost more than 150 people their jobs and further roll back safety policies at the 451,000 barrel-per-day refinery, Burchfield said.""They continue to reinforce to me that their employees mean nothing to them."" he said. When a company's ""last, best and final offer"" is rejected, the company could declare an impasse and impose a set of work rules for employees to work under. The company could also choose to resume negotiations.A Marathon representative was not immediately available to comment.On Tuesday, Lyondell Basell Industries said it would impose the final offer made to striking workers at its Houston Refinery beginning on April 20. The offer had been rejected by the USW local representing the Lyondell workers a few hours earlier. Burchfield said Marathon's offer would change the jobs of chief safety officers on each of the refinery's units to positions that could be left empty if the company chooses.The chiefs of units were changed to chief safety officers as part of new poliices implemented following a deadly explosion at the refinery in 2005 that killed 15 workers when the refinery was owned by BP Plc. Workers at the refinery have previously criticized the company for rolling back safety policies adopted under BP after the explosion.The company also wants to begin requiring unit operators to perform pipefitting duties, tasks for which the operators are not trained, Burchfield said.USW members at the Galveston Bay refinery were among the first to walk off their jobs as part of the largest U.S. refinery and chemical plant workers strike in 35 years. The Galveston Bay refinery is among five plants where strikes are continuing.(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Lisa Shumaker 3)",2015-04-17,MPC,"Thu Apr 16, 2015 | 8:34pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Marathon refinery workers at Galveston Bay reject final offer -union,http://www.reuters.com//article/refinery-labor-strike-marathon-idUSL2N0XD39U20150417?type=companyNews

48,"  HOUSTON Marathon Petroleum Corp's ""last, best and final offer"" to settle an 11-week walkout by hourly workers at the Galveston Bay Refinery remains on the negotiating table despite being rejected by the United Steelworkers union (USW), the company said on Wednesday.In a letter to refinery employees, plant Manager Ray Brooks said a union counter offer made at a negotiating session on Monday included an additional proposal and reversion to prior positions.""We do not believe this demonstrates good faith bargaining by the USW and does not support an effort to get a settlement and return employees to work who been off for nearly three months,"" Brooks wrote.A union representative could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.On Tuesday, an official of USW Local 13-1, which represents striking workers at the refinery, said the union's 50-page proposal, which Marathon negotiators rejected, was a move toward the company's position. The company also said it has provided ""hundreds of pages of responses to 63 information requests that comprised 918 questions over the duration of the negotiations.""The union said on Tuesday much of Monday's long negotiating session was spent listening to spoken replies to 80 information requests.In the letter, Brooks said the offer includes the agreement on pay, benefits and workplace policies reached on March 12 by national negotiators for the USW and U.S. refinery owners. Marathon's offer also includes changes to bring the refinery's contract in-line with policies at other Marathon refineries, Brooks said. Marathon purchased the refinery and related operations from BP Plc in 2013 for $2.4 billion.  Workers have told Reuters that Marathon's push to bring policies in line with operations at company plants is rolling back safety policies implemented by BP following a deadly 2005 explosion that killed 15 contract workers and injured 180 other people. The USW has said the final offer could cost more than 150 employees their jobs. About 1,100 workers have been on strike at the Marathon refinery since Feb. 1.

""They gave us overwhelming support. They do not want to take the (the offer) to a vote.""The workers met in an auditorium at the La Marque, Texas, High School. Frequent outbursts of applause were heard coming from the auditorium during the meeting, which was open only to union members.The union rejected the offer on April 16. Last week, the refinery's manager sent a letter to striking employees saying the proposal remained on the negotiating table. The union has said the offer could cost more than 150 jobs and would roll back safety policies implemented by previous owner BP Plc following a deadly 2005 explosion. A Marathon representative was not immediately available to discuss negotiations with the union. Companies usually make a last, best and final offer in a bid to end a strike.

51,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON The two Capline owners with U.S. Midwest refining operations want to ensure they do not lose an important crude source as they and another partner evaluate reversing the oil pipeline, the nation's largest, executives with operator Marathon Petroleum Corp said in an interview on Thursday.Don Templin, Marathon's executive vice president of supply, transportation and marketing, said after the company's quarterly earnings call that Marathon maintains many crude-sourcing options to ensure access to the best-priced oil of the day.He said Capline's refining partners - Marathon and BP Plc - want to evaluate all such options ""and make sure they're comfortable that a reversal doesn't impact them in a negative way.""The third and majority Capline owner, Plains All American Pipeline LP, has repeatedly expressed support for  reversing the 1.2 million barrels per day pipeline, which once moved high volumes of imports and Gulf of Mexico crude into the Midwest. Now the region is well supplied by domestic shale oil, siphoning Capline's relevance in the region. Plains' 600,000 bpd portion of the line averaged 152,000 bpd in flows last year, according to a regulatory filing.Marathon has been more circumspect, and BP declined comment. Marathon has said another south-to-north option would be needed if Capline is reversed, while noting it could move Canadian and North Dakota Bakken crude south to Louisiana refineries. Chief Financial Officer Tim Griffith said in the interview that reversal talks also are addressing how to  feed Capline in Illinois with sufficient and economical north-to-south flows.""No one's stonewalling, these are active dialogues that will continue to go on,"" Griffith said. ""All three partners are at least committed to this exploration."" Templin added that talks of the commercial aspects of reversal are separate from a feasibility study about its engineering. That study is expected to wrap up in the coming weeks.The commercial evaluation is expected to take longer, Templin said.

52,"  HOUSTON, April 30 Marathon Petroleum Corp. , the fourth-largest U.S. refiner, said on Thursday it would split its stock 2-for-1 in June as cheap domestic crude oils allow refiners to book healthy profits for fuels they make.The company said its refining and marketing income from operations was $1.32 billion in the first quarter of 2015, up from $362 million in the same period a year ago. Marathon said the split would come in the form of a stock dividend to be distributed on June 10 to shareholders of record as of May 20.  Its shares last closed at $102.53 each.

53,"  NEW YORK Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway, a Democrat first elected in 2007, filed a lawsuit against Marathon Petroleum Corp in federal court on Tuesday. * Suit alleges Marathon violated state and federal antitrust laws by abusing the monopoly created when Marathon and Ashland Oil merged in 1998. Marathon runs only refinery in Kentucky. * Suit alleges that Marathon discourages competition by requiring independent retailers to sign unlawful supply agreements that eliminate wholesale competition, by forming exchange agreements with horizontal competitors that keep other suppliers from entering the Kentucky market. * Suit alleges the company reduces competition by adding deed restrictions to some of the property parcels it sells.  The restrictions prohibit the purchaser of the property from selling gas or operating a convenience store.  SOURCE: Kentucky Attorney General's Office here{55F72683-6DC6-4889-9E78-9C50E4C6100F}&activityType=PressRelease  (Reporting By Jarrett Renshaw)",2015-05-12,MPC,"Tue May 12, 2015 | 5:43pm EDT",Kentucky Attorney General files suit against Marathon Petroleum,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-marathon-pete-brief-idUSKBN0NX2L720150512?type=companyNews
54,"   By Erwin Seba | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Striking workers at Marathon Petroleum Corp's Galveston Bay, Texas, refinery are scheduled to vote on Monday on a new contract proposal hammered out by a federal mediator, company and union officials said on Thursday.Ratification of the contract proposal by 1,100 striking workers at the 451,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Texas City, Texas, would be a key step in ending a strike that stretched into its 104th day on Thursday.After adoption, the two sides would then have to reach terms for returning striking workers to their jobs in the refinery, which has been kept in operation since Feb. 1 by temporary replacements.

The refinery has continued to operate with temporary replacement workers since the strike began.The work stoppage by workers against the Galveston Bay Refinery has become especially bitter as the union has said the company has continued to make proposals that would eliminate job security as well as roll back safety policies put in place following an explosion that killed 15 workers in 2005, when the plant was owned by BP Plc.The strike at the Galveston Bay refinery began as part of the largest walkout by U.S. refinery and chemical plant workers in 35 years. The work stoppage spread to 15 plants, including 12 refineries that account for one-fifth of U.S. capacity. Since an agreement on national issues including pay and benefits, was reached between the USW and U.S. refinery owners on March 12, strikes at 13 plants have ended after resolving outstanding local issues.

The new proposal is based on an offer the company made in April that was rejected by Local 13-1. Workers leaving the meeting said the proposal could cost 100 employees their jobs in coming years and further eliminates safety policies.In addition to the Marathon Galveston Bay strike, workers are continuing a work stoppage at the Toledo, Ohio refinery co-owned by BP and Husky Energy.

60,"  HOUSTON Negotiators for Marathon Petroleum Corp and union workers at the company’s Galveston Bay, Texas, refinery reached a tentative agreement on Monday for a four-year contract, pointing to the end of a walkout that has lasted four months, said local union officials.Before strikers can leave their picket lines outside the 451,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Texas City, Texas, United Steelworkers union (USW) Local 13-1 and Marathon will have to complete a return-to-work agreement and union members will have to vote on the contract. The walkout at the Galveston Bay refinery is the last of 15 work stoppages that began in February after talks for a new national agreement between the USW and U.S. refinery and chemical plant owners broke down. ""Obviously, the union is optimistic about being able to negotiate a favorable return-to-work agreement to get our members back to work,"" said USW Local 13-1 Vice President Larry Burchfield on Monday night. ""We're glad we were able to reach a safe and fair contract after this long strike.""The more than 1,000 Galveston Bay Refinery workers represented by Local 13-1 went on strike on Feb. 1, one of the first locals called off their jobs by the USW's international leadership. The local is the last to complete a contract, nearly three months after a national agreement on wages, benefits and safety policies was reached by the USW International and refinery owners. The long and bitter dispute at the Galveston Bay Refinery was over changes Marathon sought to long-standing policies at the refinery, which the company bought from BP Plc two years ago. The union said those changes would remove job and safety protections for workers. Local 13-1 members twice rejected contract offers made by the company.Marathon representatives did not reply to requests for comment on Monday night.

How long it will take to reach the return-to-work agreement, which must be ratified along with the contract, is unknown. In 14 other strikes at U.S. refinery and chemical plants this year, it has taken about three weeks for striking workers to return to their jobs after the ratification vote.

King, the company's assistant general counsel for environmental, safety and security, said Marathon was seeking a settlement with the agency. ""GBR contests all citations, including Citation 1, items 1 and 2, the proposed penalties and abatement dates while the parties continue to negotiate a settlement and guidance document,"" King wrote in the letter.Both of the citations, issued on June 5, are classified as ""other than serious"" by OSHA and were issued following an inspection of the refinery in December and a six-month investigation.Item 1 of the citation lists the instances when OSHA alleges that the company failed to record the changes in hearing found by tests of five employees. The citation's item 2 lists four injuries and one illness between February and August 2014 that were not recorded.In the case of the  August illness, an employee fainted at the site and was taken to an emergency room, but the incident was not recorded in the log, according to OSHA Nor was a shoulder injury due to a fall in April 2014 even though the worker underwent treatment for two months following the fall, OSHA said.In April, Reuters reported the probe into accident reporting at the refinery. At that time, sources at the refinery said Marathon had changed several safety policies  since purchasing the plant from BP Plc in 2013.While owned by BP, the Galveston Bay Refinery was the site of the worst refinery disaster in 30 years when 15 workers were killed and 180 others injured in a 2005 explosion.Marathon reported earnings of $2.5 billion for 2014.

66,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Marathon Petroleum Corp's $15.6 billion deal to swallow MarkWest Energy Partners LP is the biggest bet yet by a refiner on fast-growing natural gas logistics and exports, analysts said on Monday. The deal, slated to close in the fourth quarter this year, will give Marathon's midstream arm a vastly larger footprint in the nation's biggest natural gas plays in the U.S. Northeast, with the potential to export as well as move natural gas liquids for fuel blending to Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, including its own.Marathon is among independent refiners eyeing growth in midstream rather than more volatile refining, forming master limited partnerships, or MLPs, to own more stable pipelines and logistics assets. While refiners have had pipeline MLPs for more than a decade, the particular focus on natural gas assets is new, sparked by demand that is expected to grow, despite a year-long price rout.""Even in this commodity price environment, we have real projects that are driving that demand,"" MarkWest's chief executive, Frank Semple, said in an interview. ""The exciting part is that 100% of that demand is going to be driven by these high production unconventional resource plays - we're in the best locations.""Such infrastructure is still racing to keep up with output even with U.S. crude futures in the low $50 a barrel range and natural gas under $3 per million British thermal units. But growth is expected, particularly in natural gas, where exports are not stymied by the decades-old crude export ban that applies to oil other than minimally processed condensate.  Simmons & Co International said in a note to investors that while MLPs are ubiquitous among independent refiners, they had been focused on growth via receipt of assets from the refiner - so-called ""drop downs"" from the refiner to the MLP.""It looks as though we are now moving on to the next stage of the subsidiaries' growth plan, which involve sizeable third-party acquisitions,"" Simmons said. Last year, Tesoro Corp's MLP bought QEP Field Services for $2.5 billion, gaining natural gas gathering pipelines and processing plants in the Rocky Mountains, Utah and North Dakota.     Phillips 66 earmarked 65 percent of its $4.6 billion capital plan for 2015 to midstream, and the company is adding fractionation capacity at its Sweeny, Texas refinery while building a liquid petroleum gas export terminal in nearby Freeport.But Marathon's MLP is aiming for a bigger grab.

The deal comes less than a month after Energy Transfer Equity's (ETE.N) unsolicited $48 billion offer for Williams Cos Inc (WMB.N).Tax-advantaged MLPs have found favor with investors because they pay out most of their cash flow as dividends. To grow their dividends, MLPs use acquisitions to expand their asset base.MPLX expects the combined company's dividend to grow by 25 percent through 2017, Chief Executive Gary Heminger said. The company maintained its target of 29 percent dividend growth for 2015. ""MPC's strong balance sheet and liquidity will enable MarkWest to accelerate organic growth in some of the nation's most economic and prolific liquids-rich natural gas resource plays,"" Heminger said.MarkWest, which processes and transports natural gas, has gained from the U.S. shale boom, operating in fields such as Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale and Oklahoma's Utica shale, among others.MPLX operates a network of crude oil and product pipelines in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast regions. MarkWest unitholders will get 1.09 common units of MPLX and $3.37 in cash for every unit held.MarkWest's shares were trading at $71.29 before the bell, below the offer price of $78.64.

It also has over 4,000 miles of pipelines, mostly natural gas and natgas liquids, and one crude oil pipeline. ""Strategically, this brings MPC/MPLX a major Northeast natural gas gathering and processing footprint, which complements MPC's nearby refining footprint ...,"" said  Raymond James analyst Cory Garcia, referring to Marathon's refineries in Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio.The deal will also help Marathon Petroleum add condensate storage and stabilization plants at a time when companies are betting on the export of processed condensate, or super-light crude, following a relaxation of the U.S. crude export ban.MPLX, which operates a network of crude oil and refined product pipelines in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast regions, is building a condensate pipeline in Ohio to move output from the Utica shale field.

72,"  (Adds quotes, background on octane demand)By Kristen HaysHOUSTON, July 30 U.S. motorists are using more ""premium"" high-octane gasoline as low oil prices led to cheaper fill-ups at the pump. But even if prices rebound, octane demand will keep growing in the long term as fuel economy standards strengthen, Marathon Petroleum Corp Chief Executive Gary Heminger said on Thursday.As auto manufacturers build more high-compression engines in anticipation of more stringent U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards through 2025, more octane will be needed in the domestic gasoline pool to fuel those higher performance vehicles, Heminger said in an interview after the company's quarterly earnings call.Butane, a cheap natural gas liquid prevalent in U.S. shale plays, can up refineries' octane output if fed into alkylation units. Marathon may add alkylation capacity to its refining system to meet future demand, Heminger said.""We see the demand going beyond just today,"" Heminger said. ""It's not a this-year, next-year phenomenon."" Valero Energy Corp, the largest independent U.S. refiner, also may add a 12,500 barrels per day alkylation unit to its Houston refinery for the same reason.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said sales of premium grade gasoline, about one-tenth of the overall market, rose by 12.6 percent in the first four months of 2015.High-octane fuel has a greater ability to resist premature detonation, or knocking, as it is compressed into an engine before ignition. The EIA said this week that U.S. gasoline demand is up 6.2 percent from a year ago, when U.S. crude prices were more than twice Thursday's settlement of $48.52 per barrel.""The overall gasoline pool is up, which you need octane for,"" Heminger said. Marathon's $15.6 billion plan to buy MarkWest Energy Partners LP, the second-largest U.S. natural gas processor and a major player in the Utica and Marcellus shales, will increase the refiner's handling of butanes and other natural gas liquids, for itself and other refiners.""We want to be the first choice in service for the producers,"" Heminger said.Butane is not the only option to make high octane gasoline. Refiners can use reformate, a blendstock derived from naphtha, but crude must run through other process units to get it, Heminger said.Butane produced in the field can just go directly into an alkylation unit and produce octane, giving the refiner a better yield, he added.(Reporting By Kristen Hays; Editing by Peter Galloway)",2015-07-30,MPC,"Thu Jul 30, 2015 | 3:57pm EDT",INTERVIEW-Marathon: Alkylation can satisfy higher octane demand,http://www.reuters.com//article/marathon-pete-results-alyklation-idUSL1N10A2M520150730?type=companyNews

Marathon Petroleum's shares fell as much as 5 percent on Thursday.Light Louisiana Sweet crude at the U.S. Gulf coast was an average $5 per barrel costlier than U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate in the quarter compared with about $2.50 a year earlier.""If you look at the differentials, Marathon has paid more (for crude) than what it did last year,"" Morningstar analyst Allen Good said.Rival Valero Energy Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as its refining margin rose to $13.71 per barrel from $9.84. Marathon Petroleum said it was hurt by ""less favorable product price realizations compared to the spot market reference prices and less favorable crude oil acquisition costs.""Crack spreads in the U.S. Midwest are trailing those in other regions of the country, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Heffern said.Crack spreads - the difference between crude oil and prices of refined products - have risen across the United States as crude prices have halved since June 2014 due to a supply glut. Marathon Petroleum also announced an additional $2 billion share buyback program on Thursday. The company said it had bought back $408 million of shares in the second quarter under the $2 billion buyback plan it had announced in July last year.Marathon Petroleum said this month it would acquire MarkWest Energy Partners LP for $15.6 billion to enter the natural gas processing business.Net income attributable to Marathon Petroleum declined 3 percent to $826 million, or $1.51 per share, in the quarter ended June 30.Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.76 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Marathon Petroleum's total revenue and other income fell 23.6 percent to $20.58 billion.The company's shares were down 4.2 percent at $53.44 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

78,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Aug 19 The biggest refiner in the U.S. Midwest is eyeing an unusual place to make more of a key ingredient for premium gasoline: the natural gas fields of eastern Ohio instead of an urban refinery.Marathon Petroleum Corp is after alkylate, which gives premium gasoline its high-octane punch.Although U.S. gasoline demand had been trending down since the peak in 2007, it is up more than 8 percent compared to a year ago as pump prices plunged alongside global crude prices, according to U.S. government data.As part of that, more motorists are choosing to buy higher octane premium gasoline. But even if prices rebound, Marathon expects sales of premium fuels to increase as auto manufacturers build more high-compression engines to meet more stringent U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards through 2025. Marathon hopes to create an alkylate hub for Midwest and Northeast markets where an abundance of its main component, butane, is produced.""This is a conceptual project we have, to manufacture octane right near the source,"" Gary Heminger, chief executive of Marathon, told analysts last month.The proposed alkylate plan was a factor in the move by Marathon's logistics unit, a master limited partnership known as MPLX LP, to buy MarkWest Energy Partners LP, the biggest natural gas processor and fractionator in the Utica and Marcellus shales, for $15.6 billion. That deal is slated to close in the fourth quarter this year. Valero Energy Corp, the largest independent U.S. refiner, and Alon USA Energy also say they may add alkylate capacity at their refineries in Houston and Big Spring, Texas, respectively.But Marathon and MarkWest envisage stand-alone infrastructure, more than 60 miles from the nearest refinery, at MarkWest's NGL fractionation complex in eastern Ohio. It is not unheard of to build a unit to make a gasoline blendstock outside of a refinery. In the 1990s stand-alone methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, units were common.Like alkylate, MTBE boosted octane in gasoline. It also helped gasoline burn cleaner.But MTBE was phased out in the United States the 2000s on concerns that it is a carcinogen, and now much of that MTBE infrastructure makes it to export to other countries that still add it to gasoline.U.S. butane field production hit a 34-year high in April this year at 10.2 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That makes alkylate cheaper to produce than another octane booster, reformate, which comes from more expensive naphtha.

101,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON The nation's largest crude pipeline likely will be reversed to move heavy Canadian crude south to Louisiana after oil prices recover from the deepest rout in a generation, Marathon Petroleum Corp Chief Executive Gary Heminger said on Thursday.""It will probably be the latter part of this decade before that happens, but we have a great asset here that will be reversed someday,"" he said in an interview after the company's quarterly earnings call.Marathon operates the 1.2 million barrels per day, Louisiana-to-Illinois Capline pipeline, once a major artery to deliver imports and Gulf of Mexico crude to the U.S. Midwest.Capline's volumes have decreased sharply as U.S. shale output boomed before prices plunged since mid-2014 on a global crude glut.Plains All American Pipeline LP, the line's majority owner, said in a regulatory filing that its 600,000 bpd portion of Capline moved an average of 170,000 bpd last year. Marathon and Plains support reversing Capline to move crude to Louisiana from Illinois, but minority owner BP Plc, which relies in part on the line to supply its massive Indiana refinery, has not signed off. All three owners must agree, and have been studying a reversal for about a year.Heminger said a reversed Capline would need to move a minimum of 500,000 bpd of Canadian heavy crude, but producers struggling with profit losses have slashed spending and deferred projects. A reversal ""is going to be commodity price driven in order to be able to get the incremental Canadian production up to speed,"" he said.He also said several planned pipeline projects would provide needed connections to move Canadian output to Capline's northern end in the Patoka, Illinois, crude hub.Those include Enbridge Energy Partners' Sandpiper and Line 3 replacement projects, each targeted for startup in 2019, he said. Both will move crude to Wisconsin, where connecting pipelines reach Illinois, and Marathon is a minority partner in Sandpiper. Multiple pipeline systems already move Canadian heavy crude through the U.S. futures hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, and then to the Texas Gulf Coast. But Louisiana refineries lack such a direct connection, Heminger noted.""The pipeline capacity in Patoka will not be an issue. It's just making sure we have the incremental projects in Canada to be able to produce the next barrel,"" he said.

109,"   By Lauren Hirsch  Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc (ATDb.TO) and Japan's Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd (3382.T) have submitted indicative offers to acquire U.S. convenience store retailer CST Brands Inc (CST.N), people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The strong interest in CST underscores the wave of consolidation sweeping the North American convenience store sector, as retailers try to cope with low profit margins and find savings through gaining scale.Couche-Tard and Seven & i, the owner of U.S. convenience store chain 7-Eleven, are competing against several other bidders for CST, including a consortium of private equity firms Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), the people said. CST will seek at least one more round of offers before deciding if will sell itself, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be named because details of the sale process are confidential. A Seven & i spokesman denied it made an offer, saying it was not interested in buying the entire company although 7-Eleven earlier this year bought 76 CST stores in California and three stores in Wyoming for $408 million. CST and Blackstone declined to comment, while Couche-Tard and Apollo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.CST shares rose over 18 percent to $44.95 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of around $3.4 billion.CST, spun off from Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) in 2013, is one of the largest publicly traded fuel retailers in North America.  Based in San Antonio, Texas, CST owns and operates convenience stores and gas stations in Canada and the U.S. It also controls the general partner of gas station company CrossAmerica Partners LP (CAPL.N).CST has been working with investment banks JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to explore a sale after coming under pressure from activist investors JCP Investment Management and Engine Capital LP.  A sale of CST would follow similar deals in the sector. In 2014, Marathon Petroleum Corp's (MPC.N) subsidiary Speedway acquired oil and gas company Hess Corp's  (HES.N) retail operations and other assets for $2.82 billion. Last March, Couche-Tard closed its acquisition of The Pantry, a Cary, North Carolina-based convenience store chain, in a deal valued at $1.7 billion, including debt.

116,"  HOUSTON Marathon Petroleum Corp evacuated workers from a portion of its Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas on Wednesday due to a butane leak, the company said, but no injuries were reported.A backhoe struck a butane pipeline near butane storage spheres and the 31,500 barrel per day (bpd) Alkylation 3 Unit at about 9 a.m. CDT (1400 GMT), sources familiar with plant operations said. Butane continued to be released from the pipeline until shortly 12 p.m. CDT.The company said a butane line was damaged during maintenance.""There were no injuries and no impact to the community or refinery,"" said Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry in an email. ""As a precaution, some personnel in the area (of the leak) were evacuated.""By early afternoon, Marathon said it was monitoring the butane line for any recurrence of the leak. Late last month, Marathon shut the 459,000 bpd refinery's two coking units and two hydrotreaters for an overhaul expected to last about a month. Texas City Emergency Management Director Derek Duckett said city officials were notified of the butane release on Wednesday morning. ""No action was needed by the city as we were not impacted by the incident,"" Duckett said in an email.  Highly flammable butane is cooled and stored as a liquid, but converts to gas at atmospheric temperatures.A 2007 pipe leak triggered a butane gas cloud explosion at Valero Energy Corp's McKee refinery in Sunray, Texas, which forced an evacuation of the refinery and a three-mile area around it for fear the ensuing fire would cause one of the butane storage spheres to explode. In 2005, while under the ownership of BP Plc, the Galveston Bay refinery was the site of the deadliest U.S. refinery accident so far this century when 15 workers were killed and 180 others injured in a hydrocarbon vapor cloud explosion.In April 2015, former and current employees told Reuters, Marathon had rolled back policies implemented by BP following the 2005 explosion to improve safety at the refinery. Marathon purchased the refinery from BP in 2013.

A nearly 15-percent slump in U.S. crude prices in July, the worst monthly loss in a year, also triggered liquidation as trading began for August.Monday's slide in crude prices also came after Marathon Petroleum unexpectedly shut its lone crude unit and an associated unit at its 212,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Robinson, Illinois, at the weekend, according to a source. The cause and duration of the outage were not clear.""It's stop-loss technical selling combined with sheer liquidation by those fearing we'll soon be swimming in oil again,"" said Phil Davis, trader at PSW Investments in San Diego, California. ""We've had crude builds during the summer, when we were supposed to be having runaway draws from record driving.""U.S. West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude plumbed $39.86, its lowest since April 20, before settling at $40.06, down $1.54, or 3.7 percent. Brent crude closed down $1.39, or 3.2 percent, at $42.14 a barrel, after a session low of $41.87.Not all oil statistics are bearish. A Reuters poll on Monday showed U.S. crude stockpiles likely fell last week, after a surprise rise in the previous week ended nine straight weeks of drawdowns.Still, market focus was on reports such as the Reuters survey on Friday which showed that output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries likely rose in July to its highest in recent history as Saudi Arabia pumped at near record level, Iraq raised production and Nigeria boosted crude exports. Other data from last week showed the United States added 44 oil drilling rigs in July, the most for a month in two years,  intensifying concerns that global production could again get to unmanageable levels like in 2014-2015.Crude prices remain nearly 55 percent above 12-year lows of $26 to $27 hit in the first quarter.But WTI and Brent have also slipped into bear market territory since last week after losing more than 20 percent from the 2016 highs above $50 that were hit in June.Hedge funds slashed their positive bets on U.S. crude to a five-month low during the week to July 26, while holding a record net short, or bearish position, on gasoline, data showed on Friday.Barclays noted that Brent averaged $46.50 a barrel so far into the third quarter and could fall further.""With the macroeconomic picture worsening and Saudi Arabia unlikely to exhibit much restraint as Iran seeks incremental market share, refineries are going to find themselves in the line of fire,"" the British bank said in a research note.Iran's oil minister concurred that the market was oversupplied but said balance between supply and demand will be restored, Iranian state television reported.

129,"  HOUSTON A contract worker was injured by an electric shock on Sunday while working on a coking unit at Marathon Petroleum Corp's Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas, a Marathon spokesman said.The refinery's emergency personnel were able to restore the man's breathing and heartbeat and he was taken to an area hospital, sources familiar with the incident said.Marathon shut the coking complex and two hydrotreating units in July at the 459,000 barrel per day (bpd) Galveston Bay Refinery for planned work which is expected to continue through the middle of August. A spokesman for Analytic Stress Relieving Inc said the injured man was an employee of the company, which provides heat treating services to refineries and petrochemical companies.Daniels said the worker was injured shortly after 5 a.m. CDT (06:00 a.m. EDT). The man was injured while working on the 13,500 bpd Coker C unit in the coking complex, the sources said. The 13,500 bpd Coker B unit is also shut down. Both the 105,000 bpd cat feed hydrotreater and the 64,000 bpd hydrotreater are shut as part of the overhaul under way at the Galveston Bay Refinery. The man hurt on Sunday was the fifth contractor injured this year at the Galveston Bay Refinery. Four contractors were in separate incidents during unit overhauls in January.Cokers increase the yield of refinable material from a barrel of oil and convert residual crude into petroleum coke, which can be used as a coal substitute.

131,"  HOUSTON The hydrocracking unit at Marathon Petroleum Corp's 459,000 barrel-per-day Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, was shut on Sunday after the steam supply was temporarily lost at the refinery, said sources familiar with plant operations.Marathon was able to restore the steam supply within about 45 minutes of its outage early on Sunday morning.But the 60,000-bpd hydrocracker, called the Ultracracker, which uses hydrogen under high pressure to produce diesel and jet fuel from gas oil, was shut down.All other units were brought back to stable operations by mid-afternoon on Sunday, the two sources said.A Galveston Bay Refinery electrician was injured while working on the Ultracracker on Friday. The electrician was listed in fair condition at a Galveston, Texas hospital on Sunday, a hospital spokesman said. He was being treated for lacerations and chemical exposure, according to a statement Marathon released on Friday. Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry declined in an email message on Sunday to discuss operations at the Galveston Bay Refinery.Kheiry also declined to discuss the man's condition on Sunday. The electrician was working on a level indicator when the substances were released.  According to a notice Marathon filed with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality that was posted online Sunday, an estimated 1,749 pounds of pentane, 435 pounds of propane, 277 pounds of isobutane, 164 pounds of butane among other substances were released, including 1.1 pounds of hydrogen sulfide in the leak on Friday.Separately, only a portion of the coking complex has restarted from a planned overhaul that began in early July.A small fire broke out on a coking unit during the restart on Aug. 16, the sources said. It was quickly extinguished with no injuries. The coking complex houses two 13,500 bpd coking units.The refinery's 105,000 bpd catalytic feed hydrotreater, which removes sulfur from feedstock going to the gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit and was shut along with the coking complex, was restarted this week, the sources said.A coking unit increases the yield of refinable material from a barrel of oil and converts residual crude into petroleum coke, a coal substitute.

Marathon and Evercore did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the defense plan.The deadline for Marathon shareholders to nominate directors is Dec. 15, meaning Elliott could seek board seats if talks between the two sides fail to improve. Elliott, which joins fellow activist Jana Partners as a Marathon shareholder, also said the company needs to speed up its so-called ""drop down"" plan related to its master limited partnership, MPLX Inc. (MPLX.N).Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon last month said it would seek to place some of its assets into MPLX, a move Jana said it supports.  Elliott, however, said the company should proceed with the drop down immediately and better communicate what is being put into MPLX.""We believe the recent strategic announcement exacerbated the uncertainty surrounding MPLX,"" Quentin Koffey, a portfolio manager at Elliott, said in the letter.Marathon should consider spinning off just Speedway, its retail chain of gasoline and convenience stores, or all three of its retail, refining and pipeline businesses.  Marathon shares were up 5 percent at $45.70 on Monday while MPLX's stock was up 3 percent to $33.98.""We agree with Elliott Management that there is upside to our valuation, which we are addressing with the value-creating actions we announced last month, but we disagree with their letter and presentation,"" Marathon CEO Gary Heminger said on Monday.Elliott's stake makes it Marathon's fourth largest shareholder. Cowen & Co said in a research note that a retail spin-off was less likely than speeding up the drop down plan.Jana's managing partner, Barry Rosenstein, said in October he supported the shift of assets to MPLX and the possible changes to Marathon's financial reporting that would result. Jana, which raised its stake in the company to 0.8 percent last quarter, has been a Marathon investor dating back to 2012, when it pushed the company to spin-off MPLX.

Marathon and Evercore did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the defense plan.The deadline for Marathon shareholders to nominate directors is Dec. 15, meaning Elliott could seek board seats if talks between the two sides fail to improve. Elliott, which joins fellow activist Jana Partners as a Marathon shareholder, also said the company needs to speed up its so-called ""drop down"" plan related to its master limited partnership, MPLX Inc. (MPLX.N).Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon last month said it would seek to place some of its assets into MPLX, a move Jana said it supports.  Elliott, however, said the company should proceed with the drop down immediately and better communicate what is being put into MPLX.""We believe the recent strategic announcement exacerbated the uncertainty surrounding MPLX,"" Quentin Koffey, a portfolio manager at Elliott, said in the letter.Marathon should consider spinning off just Speedway, its retail chain of gasoline and convenience stores, or all three of its retail, refining and pipeline businesses.  Marathon shares were up 5 percent at $45.70 on Monday while MPLX's stock was up 3 percent to $33.98.""We agree with Elliott Management that there is upside to our valuation, which we are addressing with the value-creating actions we announced last month, but we disagree with their letter and presentation,"" Marathon CEO Gary Heminger said on Monday.Elliott's stake makes it Marathon's fourth largest shareholder. Cowen & Co said in a research note that a retail spin-off was less likely than speeding up the drop down plan.Jana's managing partner, Barry Rosenstein, said in October he supported the shift of assets to MPLX and the possible changes to Marathon's financial reporting that would result. Jana, which raised its stake in the company to 0.8 percent last quarter, has been a Marathon investor dating back to 2012, when it pushed the company to spin-off MPLX.
