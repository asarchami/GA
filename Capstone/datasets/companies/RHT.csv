The Nasdaq, however, remained on track for a negative week following an extended period of investors taking profits in some of the market's biggest outperformers. China's Premier Li Keqiang said the government had the necessary accommodative policies in place and would push ahead with infrastructure investment. ""We cannot neglect the increasing downward pressure and difficulties,"" he said in a speech on Wednesday, reported by the Xinhua news agency early on Friday.The prospect of slowing growth in China, the world's second-largest economy, has long been a market headwind. Recent data has pointed to the weakest growth there since the global financial crisis, raising hopes that Beijing would step in with support for the economy.""This could avert a slowdown in China, and any stimulus that helps growth somewhere should help growth globally,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.Red Hat Inc reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations late Thursday, though the company gave a full-year profit view that was below forecasts.

Some analysts say the selloff in ""momentum"" stocks has yet to run its course, though this could benefit more value-orientated names. A move to such companies helped limit the Dow's weekly decline.One of the more prominent momentum names, Netflix Inc , continued its downward trend, slipping 0.5 percent to $362.50.

""We were able to do it. We think somebody with good security knowledge would also be able to do it,"" he said. The vulnerability is caused by a security flaw in the open-source Linux GNU C Library, which is used by Red Hat and other Linux software makers, according to Qualys. It is called GHOST because it can be triggered by what are known as gethostbyname functions. Qualys uncovered the bug following discoveries last year of high-profile vulnerabilities, including Heartbleed and Shellshock, which were caused by security flaws in other kinds of widely used open-source software.""It won’t be as widespread as those flaws, but it is widespread enough that IT operations at many companies are scrambling to patch,"" said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer of security software firm Veracode.
