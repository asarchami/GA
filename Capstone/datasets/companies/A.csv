2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Keysight Technologies  Inc. (Keysight) an initial long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' in  anticipation of Keysight's spin-off from parent, Agilent Technologies, Inc.  (Agilent). The Rating Outlook is Stable.  On Sept. 13, 2014, Agilent announced it planned to separate its Electronics  Measurement (EM) segment from the Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Applied Markets  (LDA) segments, creating two stand-alone companies. The separation will take the  form of a tax-free pro rata spinoff to Agilent shareholders. The separation is  expected to close November 2014. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for improving operating  performance driven by the resumption of revenue growth after bottoming in fiscal  2013. Meaningful operating leverage and lower fixed costs from restructuring  will drive operating profit margin expansion and strengthen annual free cash  flow (FCF), providing sufficient internal liquidity to maintain conservative  financial policies.  The ratings and Outlook are supported by: i) leading positions and significant  share in the majority of key end-markets; ii) Fitch's expectations for solid  annual FCF of $250 million to $500 million through the cycle; and iii)  conservative financial policies underpinned by a net cash position in the  intermediate term, although a significant portion of cash will be located  outside the U.S.  Rating concerns include: i) challenges growing the top line within the context  of a diversified but volatile set of end-markets; ii) weak personal computer  demand and lower testing penetration in low-end legacy handsets, which  constitute Keysight's largest end-markets; and iii) flattish end-market demand  anticipated within defense and aerospace markets, given lower military spending. Keysight's leading positions and strong share in key end-markets has resulted in  a significant and diversified global installed base. This enables highly  profitable software upgrades, supports research and development (R&D) investment  levels through the cycle, and key technology platform development.  Fitch expects $250 million to $500 million of annual FCF through the cycle,  driven by low capital intensity and countercyclical inventory. Profitability  will remain cyclical but Keysight has reduced fixed costs to maintain a  double-digit operating profit margin at the trough of the cycle. Financial policies should provide Keysight with headroom for operational  shortfalls, tuck-in acquisitions, and cash-build outside the U.S. Keysight plans  to achieve a net cash position by the anniversary of the spin-off, maintain  total leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) below 2x, and pay no dividend in  the near term.  Revenue growth will remain cyclical with substantial downturns followed by  commensurate recoveries, as was the case in the most recent recession.  Significant operating leverage will exacerbate profitability swings and could  result in below double-digit operating profit, lower-than-expected FCF, and  weakened credit protection measures over the short term.  Keysight will be challenged to accelerate low single-digit long-term revenue  growth, in the absence of steady product refreshes and further market share  gains. Nonetheless, long-term growth drivers in most of Keysight's end-markets  remain healthy. Significant acquisition opportunities appear limited, given the  strong share and consolidation in most markets. For communications markets, mobile data traffic growth, increasing components  and chipset complexity, and increasing penetration in developing economies  should drive long-term growth. Aerospace and defense growth will depend upon  non-U.S. demand for new satellites and radar technologies and growing  intelligence and surveillance needs. Increasing electronics penetration in  industrial applications, mobile computing, high-performance requirements for  cloud computing and the continuation of Moore's Law should drive growth for the  industrial, computers, and semiconductor markets. In the absence of increased working capital from stronger top-line growth, cash  balances will build and could result in shareholder pressure to return excess  cash. As a result, conservative financial policies could give way to initiating  a more than anti-dilutive share repurchase program and sizeable dividend,  potentially pressuring conservative financial policies.  RATINGS SENSITIVITIES  Positive rating action is unlikely in the absence of significantly higher  mid-cycle revenues and FCF from sustained market share growth in conjunction  with a long-term commitment to a net cash position and total leverage below 2x. Negative rating action could result from: i) structurally lower mid-cycle  revenues or operating profit margin below 10%, likely from diminished technology  leadership, or ii) net debt beyond the separation's anniversary or expectations  for total leverage to remain above 2.5x, indicating more aggressive financial  policies. Liquidity will be solid and consist of: i) $700 million of cash at separation,  $200 million of which will be located in the U.S., and ii) a $300 million  revolving credit facility. Annual FCF of $250 million to $500 million also will  support liquidity.

3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term ratings of  Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Agilent) at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  A full list of rating actions, which apply to approximately $1.6 billion of debt  at Oct. 31, 2014, follows at the end of this release. Agilent completed its spin-off of its electronic measurement (EM) business, now  named Keysight Technologies, Inc., through a tax-free pro rata distribution to  Agilent shareholders on Nov. 1, 2014. Keysight accounted for roughly 42% of  Agilent's total net revenues and a similar proportion of operating income. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The process of spinning out Agilent's EM business has gone smoothly and  largely as expected, to Fitch's knowledge. Pre-separation costs have not been  excessive. Fitch expects continuing Agilent to improve margins and cash flows,  albeit with some remaining separation-related costs, in fiscal 2015-2016. --Fitch believes Agilent is committed to maintaining strong investment grade  ratings and is expected to operate with a moderate leverage profile (gross  debt-to-EBITDA below 2x). Debt maturities are long-dated, with only $100 million  of debt due before July 2020, subsequent to the repayment of $1 billion of its  unsecured notes during fiscal 2014. --Agilent holds leading positions in its largest markets, with a significant  installed base of capital equipment supporting a good amount of recurring sales  of consumables. Nevertheless, the life sciences industry is highly competitive  and consolidation is likely to remain a key theme. A sustained commitment to  productive R&D investment for new product development will be necessary to  maintain market leadership. --The continuing business has more stable operations and cash flows post-spin,  because of a larger proportion of recurring revenues (around 40%) and less  volatile end-market demand. Fitch forecasts normalized free cash flow (FCF; cash  from operations less capital expenditures and dividends) to exceed $400 million  over the next few years. --Agilent will remain well-diversified in terms of product categories, end  markets, and geographies, even after the EM spin-off. Diversification supports  stability, although a fairly large exposure to academic and government research  budgets (around 12% of revenues) may constrain sales growth in periods of  macroeconomic weakness. --Acquisitions may be sizeable in the aggregate, given significant growth  opportunities in diagnostics and genomics markets. Fitch anticipates smaller,  capabilities-based deals, as fewer transformational targets remain. But larger  deals are not out of the question, within the parameters of Agilent's history of  and commitment to conservative financial management. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of Agilent's 'BBB+' ratings will require gross debt-to-EBITDA  generally maintained at or below 2x. Temporary increases to consummate strategic  M&A accompanied by a credible de-leveraging plan would be appropriate at the  current rating category. Fitch recognizes that a successful long-term strategy  in key areas like diagnostics and genomics may require sizeable acquisitions in  the aggregate over the medium term.  Annual cash from operations of approximately $300 million will be required to  generate adequate cash in the U.S. to fund Agilent's dividend, which Fitch  expects the firm to grow over the ratings horizon, and share repurchase activity  meant to offset dilution. Modest margin expansion will evidence successful new  product introductions and operational efficiencies supportive of the 'BBB+'  ratings. A downgrade could result from the incurrence of debt to fund dividends or share  repurchases, or to consummate a large acquisition such that cash flows would not  be sufficient to permit adequate and timely de-leveraging. Margin deterioration  due to market commoditization or the inability to flex costs in response to weak  demand (i.e. from government and research budget cuts) could also precipitate  downward ratings pressure. An upgrade is not anticipated in the near- to medium-term. Fitch's 'BBB+'  ratings provide Agilent with flexibility to take part in the consolidation  expected to characterize the life sciences and diagnostics sector over the near-  to medium-term. MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, CONSOLIDATING Agilent holds strong market positions in most of the markets in which it  participates, but several of the its primary competitors have greater overall  scale and financial flexibility. These include Thermo Fisher Scientific Corp.  (Thermo Fisher); Danaher Corp.; Abbott Laboratories; and Roche. Thermo Fisher in  particular has been aggressively expanding its genomics capabilities, and its  recently completed acquisition of Life Technologies Corp. resulted in an  organization four times the size of Agilent, by revenues. New product launches  will be vital for Agilent to maintain leadership positions and to sustain  pricing. For Agilent, becoming a major player in diagnostics and genomics may require  large-scale aggregate M&A. However, larger firms may have the ability to outbid  Agilent and other mid-sized corporations as new technologies emerge and as  consolidation occurs over time. EXPECTATIONS FOR DEMAND GROWTH; PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENTS Fitch expects demand growth in Agilent's key markets to be sustained in the  mid-single digits, with diagnostics/genomics possibly in the low-double digits,  over the next several years. Gradually improving macroeconomic conditions and  lapsing sequestration/austerity measures should alleviate pressures felt in  academia and government end-markets, though demand growth in the U.S. and Europe  will likely remain modest. Growth in biologic drug development should support  solid demand among pharma and biotech firms. Agilent is also well-positioned to  benefit from strong growth prospects in emerging markets in food safety,  environmental, and chemical/energy end-markets. Fitch thinks annual margin improvement of at least 30 basis points (bps)  post-spin is achievable for the firm, driven by remaining synergy capture from  the 2012 Dako acquisition and cost optimization initiatives following the EM  spin. EBITDA margins are expected to run between 21% and 23% over the forecast  period. Performance will be notably more stable after spinning out the more  cyclical EM business. SOLID LIQUIDITY; NO DEBT MATURITIES UNTIL FY2018 Liquidity is solid, comprising more than $2 billion (Fitch estimate) of cash on  hand and full availability under the firm's $400 million revolver due September  2019. Most cash is held outside the U.S., but Fitch expects U.S. cash balances  and cash flows generated in the U.S. (Fitch estimated 30%-40% of total operating  CF) to be sufficient to fund Agilent's dividend, with the excess being directed  toward U.S.-based M&A and/or share repurchase. Fitch forecasts cash from  operations of approximately $680 million-$800 million in fiscal 2015-2017. Total debt outstanding approximated $1.6 billion at Oct. 31, 2014, consisting  primarily of: --$100 million of 6.5% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2017; --$500 million of 5.0% senior notes due July 15, 2020; --$400 million of 3.2% senior notes due Oct. 1, 2022;  --$600 million of 3.875% senior notes due July 15, 2023. Fitch has affirmed Agilent's ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'BBB+';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'.

12,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to  Agilent Technologies, Inc.'s (Agilent) senior unsecured notes offering. Fitch  expects that Agilent will use the proceeds of the issue to repay outstanding  indebtedness under its revolving credit facility ($235 million at July 31, 2016)  and for general corporate purposes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $1.9 billion of debt at July 31, 2016. A full  list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch believes Agilent is committed to maintaining strong investment-grade  ratings and is expected to operate with a moderate leverage profile (run-rate  gross debt-to-EBITDA of around 2.0x or a bit higher), despite a capital  deployment policy that will see Agilent issue incremental debt of $250 million  each year from 2016-2018 to help fund share repurchases. The company's financial  policy nevertheless reduces headroom at the current rating category and leaves  its ratings more vulnerable to event risk, including debt-funded acquisitions of  significant size. --In the near term, Fitch expects that Agilent will focus on smaller,  capabilities-based deals, since fewer transformational targets remain in the  wake of recent transactions. Larger deals are not out of the question, however,  within the parameters of Agilent's history of and commitment to conservative  financial management. --Agilent's business has a stable operating and cash flow profile, owing to a  large proportion of recurring revenues (approximately 50%) and steady end-market  demand. Fitch forecasts improving margins and normalized free cash flow (FCF;  cash from operations less capex and dividends) of between $350 million-$400  million for the next four fiscal years. --Agilent remains well-diversified in terms of product categories, end markets,  and geographies. Diversification supports stability, although exposure to  academic and government research budgets (approximately 10% of revenues) may  lead to constrained or negative sales growth in periods of macroeconomic  weakness. --Agilent holds leading positions in its largest markets, providing a  significant installed base with a significant amount of recurring sales of  consumables, etc. Nevertheless, competition will remain heightened and  consolidation is likely to remain a key theme. A sustained commitment to R&D  investment for new product development will be necessary to maintain market  leadership. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch anticipates that revenues will grow between 3%-4% annually from  2016-2019, reflecting growth in end-user demand and benefit of new products. --Fitch models EBITDA growth resulting from growing revenues and incremental  margin expansion, benefitting from cost savings derived from recent  restructuring activities and increased operating leverage. --Fitch models incremental annual debt increases of $250 million annually  beginning in fiscal 2016 to help finance share repurchases, resulting in gross  leverage ranging between 2.0x-2.25x throughout the forecast period.  --Any acquisitions are expected to be targeted in nature and manageable in size. RATING SENSITIVITIES Maintenance of Agilent's 'BBB+' ratings will require gross debt-to-EBITDA  generally maintained between 2.0x-2.5x. Temporary increases to fund strategic  M&A accompanied by a credible de-leveraging plan could be appropriate at the  current rating category. Fitch recognizes that a long-term strategy in key areas  like diagnostics and genomics may require sizeable acquisitions over the medium  term. Modest margin expansion, suggesting successful new product introductions  and operational efficiencies, would be supportive of the 'BBB+' ratings. A downgrade could result from lower than expected cash flows, leading Agilent to  issue more than the expected additional debt to fund dividends or share  repurchases. A downgrade could also result from the consummation of an  acquisition of a size such that cash flows would not be sufficient to permit  adequate and timely de-leveraging. Margin deterioration due to market  commoditization or the inability to flex costs in response to weak demand (e.g.  from government and research budget cuts) could also precipitate downward  ratings pressure. An upgrade is not anticipated in the near- to medium-term. Fitch's 'BBB+'  ratings provide Agilent with flexibility to take part in the consolidation  characterizing the life sciences and diagnostics sector in the near- to  medium-term. CURRENT FINANCIAL POLICY REDUCES FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY  Management intends to return 85% of pre-dividend FCF (up from historical levels  of around 40%) to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and  share repurchases. Agilent will help finance the share repurchases with $250  million of incremental debt each year from 2016-2018. In Fitch's view, this  stance remains in line with the current 'BBB+' ratings, as resulting gross  leverage is likely to remain between 2.0x-2.25x if EBITDA growth largely offsets  incremental debt issued. Fitch views gross debt leverage in this range as  supportive of Agilent's current rating level, given the company's good earnings  visibility and a stable operating profile characterized by steady demand, light  CAPEX requirements, and stable operating margins. Importantly, Fitch believes Agilent would remain committed to returning 85% of  FCF to shareholders for the 2016-2018 fiscal years, even if it were to execute a  debt-funded transaction of material size. This expectation reduces flexibility  at the current rating category. If the company were to pursue a strategic  acquisition without a credible deleveraging plan to reduce the company's gross  debt-to-EBITDA to levels between 2.0x-2.5x within 12-18 months following the  transaction, Fitch would likely downgrade Agilent's ratings by one notch. STEADY GROWTH OUTLOOK WITH PROFITABILITY ENHANCEMENTS EXPECTED Fitch expects Agilent to achieve low- to mid-single-digit organic growth in each  of its key business areas, benefitting from favorable secular and demographic  trends that should increase end-user demand, particularly in emerging markets.  New products could further benefit top-line gains although the pace of uptake is  more difficult to predict. The biggest risk to near-term top-line gains could be  continued foreign currency translation headwinds. If currency translation  continues to work against the company, reported EBITDA margins could be  challenged to show marked improvement. However, even if revenues are flat, the  company should be able to generate more modest margin improvement due to cost  saving initiatives and product portfolio rationalization that includes the  recent exit of two unprofitable business lines. STRONG, DIVERSE MARKET POSITIONS Agilent holds strong market positions in most of the markets in which it  participates. However, several of the its primary competitors have greater  overall scale and financial flexibility than Agilent, including Thermo Fisher  Scientific Corp. (Thermo Fisher); Danaher Corp.; Abbott Laboratories; and Roche.  Thermo Fisher in particular has been aggressively expanding its genomics  capabilities, and its acquisition of Life Technologies Corp. resulted in an  organization four times the size of Agilent. New product launches will be vital  to maintaining leadership positions and to sustaining pricing. For Agilent, becoming a leader in diagnostics and genomics may require  large-scale aggregate M&A. But larger firms may have the ability to outbid  Agilent and other mid-sized corporations as new technologies emerge and as  consolidation occurs over time. LIQUIDITY Agilent maintains a solid liquidity profile, although U.S. cash balances are  kept relatively low (approximately $124 million at July 31, 2016). Fitch  estimates that roughly 25% of total operating cash flow is generated in the U.S.  but that between 40%-50% of Agilent's cash flows are regularly available to  address funding requirements in the U.S., which is sufficient to fund  operational needs, service the company's debt, and pay shareholder dividends.  The company's increased share repurchase commitment will require incremental  debt of $250 million in each of the next three years. Following the completion  of Agilent's refinancing transactions discussed above, full availability under  the firm's $700 million revolver due Sept. 15, 2019 should be adequate to fund  smaller U.S.-based acquisition targets. Only $100 million of 2018 debt matures over the next four fiscal years,  mitigating the risk of lower U.S. cash balances. Agilent's next debt maturity is  $500 million due in 2020, with the remaining $1 billion due thereafter.  Long-dated debt maturities could provide flexibility for the use of shorter-term  debt to fund acquisitions over the ratings horizon. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Agilent as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'BBB+';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'.
