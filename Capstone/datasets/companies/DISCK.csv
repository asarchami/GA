4,"  By Eric KelseyLOS ANGELES Jan 28 Fifty came with a televised bash, celebrity friends and a black-tie dinner, but Oprah Winfrey will have a low-key 60th birthday  at home in California on Wednesday.The billionaire media entrepreneur will have a ""quiet dinner"" in the seaside town of Montecito, 90 miles (145 km) northwest of Los Angeles, says a source familiar with her plans. Winfrey had previously said she would have ""the biggest blowout party I can dream of,"" but scaled back the affair after the guest list grew too large, the source said.Instead, last week she and her friends in West Hollywood attended a birthday SoulCycle spin class, an indoor stationary cycling exercise with motivational coaching. Winfrey posted a video online after the class with a group of people wearing navy blue T-shirts with ""Happy Birthday Oprah"" on the front. A self-made woman, she rose from poverty as an African American born to a teenage mother in rural Mississippi to become one of the world's most powerful celebrities, with an estimated net worth of $2.9 billion, according to Forbes magazine.She runs her own cable TV channel, the Oprah Winfrey Network, in partnership with Discovery Communications Inc. Winfrey's popular daytime talk show ended in 2011, and her trademark interviews were a must for public figures looking to remake their images.She told CBS television's ""This Morning"" program last October: ""The 6-0 number, I've always said to people to own it. Even I, who has said to women all these years, own it, own it, own it, took a pause for that.""Her 50th birthday party in 2004 on her ""Oprah Winfrey Show""  featured actor John Travolta, comedian Jay Leno and singers Tina Turner and Stevie Wonder, who all surprised her on set. She followed up with a high-profile luncheon and black-tie dinner.",2014-01-29,DISCK,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 9:19pm EST",REFILE-Larger than life Oprah celebrating 60th birthday quietly at home,http://www.reuters.com//article/people-oprahwinfrey-idUSL2N0L21TO20140129?type=companyNews

23,"  * Plans to launch more brands internationally* Biggest deal for Viacom since split from CBS   (Adds CEO interview)By Jennifer SabaApril 30 U.S.-based Viacom Inc said on Thursday it would buy British TV broadcaster Channel 5 from media baron Richard Desmond for $760 million (450 million pounds) as a keystone to develop its worldwide presence.Viacom, which owns a stable of cable channels such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and movie studio Paramount Pictures, said the deal would also allow the company to tap new ideas.Channel 5 is the free-to-air network that broadcasts popular hit shows such as reality show ""Big Brother"" and the crime drama CSI franchise and has more than 43 million viewers per month, according to the company.""It was a unique opportunity,"" Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman said about the deal, the largest to date for Viacom since it split from broadcaster CBS in 2006.""This gives us another significant base of programming,"" he said, adding Britain was a leading center of creativity for television and film. Dauman cited Channel 5's ""Milkshake!"" a block of children's programming that will complement Viacom's Nickelodeon kids network.Viacom shares fell 1.2 percent to $83.95 in afternoon trading Thursday on Nasdaq. The company also reported third-quarter results and lower-than-expected advertising revenue.Channel 5 was launched as the UK's fifth public-service broadcaster in March 1997. It competes with ITV PLC, Britain's largest free-to-air broadcaster, the BBC and Channel 4 in the UK. ITV's shares were up 2.19 percent at 186 pence at 1219 GMT on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday.Desmond sold Channel 5 for more than four times what he bought it. His privately held Northern & Shell media group bought Channel 5 in 2010 for 103.5 million pounds.Desmond, who also owns the Daily Express and Daily Star newspapers and OK! magazine in the UK, is credited with turning the channel around by cutting costs aggressively and focusing on cross-platform promotion and reality TV shows.Viacom will finance the deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals, with existing cash, and expects the acquisition to add to earnings immediately after closing. The media conglomerate, which is controlled by billionaire Sumner Redstone, generated about 16 percent of its 2013 revenue from Europe, noted Vijay Jayant, an analyst with ISI Media.""This acquisition in one of the strongest markets in Europe will help diversify the company's exposure,"" he said.Channel 5 had reportedly drawn interest from more than 20 potential buyers, including Discovery Communications, Scripps Networks and British Sky Broadcasting Group . (link.reuters.com/fac98v)BSkyB provides advertising sales for Viacom's channels like MTV and Comedy Central in Britain. Dauman said Channel 5 would retain its own separate sales force.Barclays advised Northern & Shell on the deal and Rosenblatt Solicitors acted for Channel 5 and Richard Desmond.($1 = 0.5922 British Pounds)   (Reporting by Karen Rebelo, Richa Naidu and Supantha Mukherjee; Editing by Richard Chang, Rodney Joyce, Sofina Mirza-Reid and Bernadette Baum)",2014-05-01,DISCK,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 2:27pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Viacom buys Britain's Channel 5 to boost global presence,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-channel-5-sale-idUSL2N0NN0CT20140501?type=companyNews
24,"  By Liana B. BakerMay 6 DirecTV DTV.O, the No. 1 U.S. satellite TV provider, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and said Los Angeles customers were not cancelling their subscriptions even though they are shut out from watching LA Dodgers' baseball.DirecTV Chief Executive Mike White said that the rate of cancellations, known as churn, was immaterial in Los Angeles, where Dodgers games are now being carried on a channel that an estimated 5 million local residents cannot see.Dodgers games are being shown on the new SportsNet LA channel, which is owned by the team but operated by Time Warner Cable, which distributes the channel and paid billions for the rights. Time Warner Cable TWC.N and two smaller operators in the area are the channel's only carriers, while DirecTV, which has a large foothold in Los Angeles, has been holding out.""The prices we've been quoted so far are so far beyond what a rational view of the market is, that we don't think that it's appropriate to put that on our pay TV customers,"" White said.Time Warner Cable said in a statement that it is eager for fans to get the channel and ""DirecTV has shown no sense of urgency in getting a deal done.""DirecTV declined to address any rumors related to mergers and acquisitions on its conference call. The Wall Street Journal reported on April 30 that telecom company AT&T T.N had approached the satellite operator about a potential takeover. RESULTS U.S. net subscriber additions fell to 12,000 from 21,000 a year earlier. Analysts were expecting net additions of 14,000, according to StreetAccount. Net income fell to $561 million, or $1.09 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $690 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.63 per share, beating analysts' average estimates of $1.50 per share.The growth in adjusted earnings per share was in part driven by stock repurchases of $895 million in the quarter, the company said. (Full Story)Revenue increased 4 percent to $7.86 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $7.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from its DirecTV Latin America unit - which accounts for 21 percent of total revenue - remained flat at $1.72 billion as average revenue per user fell 10 percent. That unit was hit with a $281 million charge related to devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar.Net subscriber additions in Latin America, its largest growth area, fell to 361,000 from 583,000 a year earlier, but came above analysts' estimates of 277,000.DirecTV shares, which gained 16 percent this year, were trading 2.7 percent higher at $82.03 on Tuesday.

37,"   By Kate Holton | LONDON  LONDON U.S.-based cable group Liberty Global (LBTYA.O) has bought BSkyB's BSY.L 6.4 percent stake in ITV (ITV.L), Britain's biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, boosting its shares on hopes of a wider bid.Billionaire John Malone's Liberty, which bought British cable operator Virgin Media as part of a European expansion last year, said it did not intend to make an offer for the rest of the broadcaster, but ITV shares still rose 7 percent. The sale, at a price of 481 million pounds ($824 million), may also indicate that BSkyB is looking to raise cash to push ahead with its own expansion plans after it opened talks this year to buy Rupert Murdoch's (FOXA.O) Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland SKYDn.DE.The purchase is just the latest in a string of deals in the global media sector to buy content and follows ITV's drive to develop its production arm and generate revenue beyond its traditional, and volatile, advertising source. ""It is hard to see how this will not be looked at as anything other than Liberty planting a flag in the ground for a potential acquisition at some point,"" Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said. ""ITV is now likely to be seen as a potential M&A story, especially given recent news flow in the media sector.""     Just this year, Liberty teamed up with Discovery Communications (DISCA.O) to buy TV producer All3Media, Discovery took a controlling interest in European sports broadcaster Eurosport and Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has been seeking to buy Time Warner. The cost for buying protection against a default of ITV's debt rose in the credit derivatives market, based on the fact that Liberty Global has a much higher degree of leverage.Moody's Investors Service rates Liberty Global as speculative grade, or junk, while it rates ITV as investment grade.Cable operators have traditionally focused on providing broadband and television to households, meaning they were more likely to be aggregators and re-sellers of programing, but Liberty has owned content companies in the past. ""Liberty Global has previously stated that it would invest in selected content assets ... but this is still a somewhat surprising development,"" Espirito Santo analyst Andrew Hogley said. ""In our view management will need to provide further clarity on the group’s content strategy and long-term plans.""Dubbed everything from the Cable Guy to Cable Cowboy, Malone made his fortune through a series of deals that transformed and ultimately consolidated the U.S. cable industry into one dominated by a few big players. Liberty Global is now also present in 12 European companies. Two people familiar with the situation said BSkyB had contacted eight banks to auction off the stake on Wednesday afternoon, which pressured Liberty into offering a premium. Liberty then called ITV officials to make them aware of the stake sale and to say it did not intend to make a full bid. ITV'S GOT TALENT ITV, which began broadcasting in 1955 as Channel 3, is known for airing ""Britain's Got Talent"" and ""Downton Abbey"".The company, renowned for producing some of Britain's most popular dramas in the 1980s and 1990s such as ""Prime Suspect"", was hammered during the financial crisis as advertisers and viewers deserted its TV channels. It has since been rebuilt under Chief Executive Adam Crozier by improving the quality of its programing and selling it around the world, which helped non-advertising sources contribute 44 percent of its revenue in 2013.  With shares up 6 percent at 195 pence, ITV had a market valuation of 7.9 billion pounds. BSkyB sold the shares at 185 pence, up from Wednesday's close of 183.8 pence. ""ITV has a strong studios business (25 percent of profits) with an international presence, and as such should command a premium valuation and be of interest to international companies expanding in content,"" UBS said. ""ITV is trading on 13.2 times 2015 expected earnings per share versus the subsector on 14.3 times, an undeserved discount in our view given the quality of the studios business, the strength of the UK recovery and potential for M&A.""     The stake sale brings an end to one of the most controversial corporate moves in the British media sector - the decision by James Murdoch, then BSkyB boss, to buy 17.9 percent of the then struggling ITV to block rival NTL from creating a larger, more powerful competitor.The move in 2006 kicked off a long-running regulatory investigation, which eventually forced BSkyB to reduce the stake to 7.5 percent. BSkyB bought the shares in 2006 for 135 pence each, sold more than 10 percent at 48.5 pence, a deep loss, and sold the remainder at 185 pence. NTL went on to become Virgin Media, which was then bought by Liberty. ""This is an opportunistic and attractive investment for us in our largest cable market,"" Mike Fries, Liberty Global's chief executive said in a statement.($1 = 0.5840 British Pounds) (editing by Jason Neely and Jane Baird)",2014-07-17,DISCK,"Thu Jul 17, 2014 | 12:46pm EDT",Liberty Global buys stake in UK broadcaster ITV,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bskyb-itv-liberty-idUSKBN0FM0JZ20140717?type=companyNews

43,"   By Malathi Nayak and Lisa Richwine | SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES  SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES Aug 25 Amazon.com Inc  tracked Twitch's evolution from scrappy guerrilla startup to one of the Internet's hottest media properties. On Monday, it announced a near-$1 billion acquisition to get into one of the fastest-growing online arenas: live-streaming video.Amazon's $970 million bet - its largest ever - underscores how a loyal and fast-growing following for live-streaming video has grabbed the attention of big brands. Some believe live and interactive streaming, in which Twitch is a pioneer, is the new frontier in online video.Bessemer Ventures' Ethan Kurzweil admitted on Monday that people gave him blank stares when he initially described Twitch to them. The San Francisco-based startup lets gamers livecast their play while responding in real time to cheers, tips and random musings from online viewers.In three years, Twitch has become the fourth-largest U.S. producer of peak Internet traffic, ahead of Facebook and Hulu, according to Bessemer, a backer.""It's a captive audience and one that is loyal,"" said Adam Shlachter, head of media activation at marketing agency DigitasLBi. ""Where you have like-minded people ... all aggregated in one place, kind of holed up around the same thing and participating in the same experiences, that offers a really unique environment to target (ads) against.""Live streaming draws a following partly because of its immediacy: fans message their favorite personalities and can evoke a response during livecasts. Twitch and other live-stream networks such as Livestream also cater to niches, featuring content such as offbeat sports to videogames that mainstream outlets eschew.Twitch had 55 million monthly viewers in July, up about 45 percent from a year earlier. That growth caught the attention of advertisers, who spotted the chance to reach younger viewers who watch less television. Brands will spend $6 billion this year on digital video advertising in the United States, according to research firm eMarketer. Live events are appealing to advertisers because audiences can't skip commercials.Most of Twitch's thousands of livecasters are simply gamers. Some boast a following of hundreds of thousands and earn a cut of ad revenue from the likes of PepsiCo's Mountain Dew and Time Warner Inc's Warner Bros.YouTube, whose parent Google Inc was in talks to buy Twitch, streams some events live, but most of its videos are recorded. On live platforms such as Twitch, ads appear as a user opens a stream or when livecasters take a break.""Interacting with celebrities and artists is a growing trend,"" said Max Haot, chief executive of Livestream. BEYOND GAMING Twitch is adding staff with expertise in programmatic ad buying, which uses computers to sell ads in real time, Twitch's chief revenue officer, Jonathan Simpson-Bint, told Reuters this month. That will give advertisers the option to insert commercials into Twitch videos that see a sudden surge in viewership. It's also branching out into music events.""Amazon has a direct media sales group of its own...I think our ad sales numbers will be accelerated by the fact that we are going to have access to resources of Amazon,"" Twitch chief executive Emmett Shear said.Twitch's breakneck growth is now propelling the live streaming video format beyond gaming and pushing media companies and YouTube personalities to test it.Discovery Communications Inc hosts a monthly Google+ Hangout with NASA scientists and Animal Planet live streams events such as the Internet Cat Video Festival in Minnesota. Discovery plans to invest in more interactive streaming events to help build a ""two-way"" relationship with viewers, said Sean Atkins, senior vice president of digital media.Tom Cote, co-host of ""Funny Stuff & Cheese,"" an independent online comedy series that streamed over a hundred shows live during its first season, says his fans like the fact that they can ask a question and get a response within minutes.The format has its challenges. It takes creators time to find a groove and overcome technical glitches, Cote said. And there's no chance for editing or retakes.""It will be widespread,"" he said. ""Right now, I think people don't have the confidence to go live. It's a whole different beast than traditional video.""

44,"  JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 South African health insurer Discovery said it had only limited exposure to failed African Bank Investments (Abil) as it reported an expected 20 percent jump in headline full-year earnings on Wednesday.Abil was rescued in a $1.6 billion bailout led by the central bank last month after being hit by waves of bad debt as its core market of low-income borrowers failed to pay back loans.""Discovery is only effected through indirect money market and equity unit trust investments and the exposure for shareholders and policy holders is immaterial,"" South Africa's largest health insurer said in its earnings report. Discovery said diluted normalised headline earnings increased to 595 cents a share for the year ended June from 496 cents a year earlier. Discovery had already flagged normalised headline earnings would rise by as much as 25 percent.The company wrote new business worth 12.2 billion rand ($1.14 billion), up 15 percent. Discovery's business model gives customers incentives to lead a healthier lifestyle by subsidising gym fees, fruits and vegetables and even refunding fuel costs to good drivers.

46,"  Discovery Communications Inc (DISCA.O) is seeking a controlling interest in The Hub, reducing partner and toymaker Hasbro Inc's share of the children's cable TV network, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.Hasbro will retain a large stake in the Hub Television Networks Llc, which Discovery will rebrand as a family network, the newspaper said.Since its launch nearly four years ago, the joint venture has struggled to compete against two more established children's networks: Viacom Inc's (VIAB.O) Nickelodeon and Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) Disney Channel.In June, Hub President and Chief Executive Margaret Loesch said she would leave the channel at the end of the year. The Hub will be renamed Discovery Family, with the rebranding and launch possibly taking place as early as the fourth quarter, WSJ said.

55,"   By Abhirup Roy  Discovery Communications Inc (DISCA.O), owner of cable channels such as Animal Planet and Discovery Channel, cut its full-year revenue and profit forecasts, citing a strong dollar, weaker U.S. ratings and tensions between Russia and the West.The company's shares fell as much as 10.2 percent in early trading on Tuesday.Discovery gets more than half its revenue from its international networks, with about 2 percent of the total coming from Russia.Economic growth in Russia has stalled, hit by large capital outflows and sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union in response to Kremlin's policy on Ukraine.Adding to the company's problems in the country, a law banning advertising on cable TV will come into effect on Jan. 1.The government says the law is aimed at reducing competition between pay TV and free-to-air channels.Revenue from Discovery's international operations jumped 32 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, while revenue from the United States fell 1 percent.The company said its ad revenue in the United States was hurt by a fall in summer cable viewership and lower-than-expected ratings. ""I think it is too early to call it a trend,"" Chief Executive David Zaslav said in a post earnings conference call. ""There are a lot of markets where we have seen viewership come down and then come back up.""Discovery makes money from advertising and fees paid by cable networks such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and DirecTV DTV.O to carry their channels.""I think the impact (of Russia) on fourth-quarter guidance was greater than expected because ... you are starting to see a tapering of advertising ahead of the Jan. 1 change in policy,"" Nomura Securities analyst Anthony DiClemente told Reuters. Diclemente said the dollar's recent sharp rise against most currencies, including the rouble, in recent weeks was also largely unexpected.The dollar rose about 7 percent against a basket of major trading currencies .DXY in the third quarter, compared with the third quarter of 2013.Discovery forecast a full-year adjusted profit of $1.28 billion-$1.31 billion, on revenue of $6.3 billion-$6.35 billion.It had earlier forecast a full-year adjusted profit of $1.34 billion-$1.4 billion on revenue of $6.45 billion-$6.53 billion. Analysts on average expect revenue of $6.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income available to the company rose to $280 million, or 41 cents per share, in the quarter from $255 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.

61,"   By Lehar Maan and Sai Sachin R  Discovery Communications Inc, the owner of Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, said better pricing would help its U.S. advertising revenue improve in 2015, and forecast continuing strong growth in its international networks.The upbeat forecast helped Discovery's shares reverse initial losses to rise as much as 4.8 percent in early trading on Thursday.The company forecast full-year revenue and adjusted profit to grow in the ""high-single to low-double digits"" in percentage terms on a constant currency basis.Discovery expects U.S. ad sales to accelerate in the first quarter due to ""solid"" pricing, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Warren said on a post-earnings call.Ad revenue from Discovery's U.S. networks fell 3.2 percent to $398 million in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, hurt by lower demand for the company's content.Discovery also reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit, driven by strong growth in its international networks. Ad revenue from international networks rose 6.7 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, helped by higher delivery in Western Europe and volume growth in Latin America.""From a fundamental perspective, the trends outside the U.S. are still very strong, and inside the U.S., they're clearly focused on fixing areas of weakness... Clearly today, the stock is looking towards 2015 and beyond,"" BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen told Reuters.However, Discovery's revenue from Russia, which has dragged on the company's otherwise impressive international revenue growth in recent months, looks set to continue its downward spiral due to a new Russian law that bans advertising on cable channels with foreign content. The ""difficult geopolitical situation"" in Russia hurt the company's revenue forecast by about $50 million, Warren said.Falling viewership in the United States has led to Discovery losing advertisers to companies such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc, which offer video on-demand content.Discovery partnered with Hulu last December in an attempt to reverse the trend, allowing the television-streaming website to offer shows such as 'MythBusters' and the Emmy Award-winning 'Deadliest Catch'. Discovery's channels will also be available on PlayStation Vue, a cloud-based TV service by Sony Network Entertainment International LLC, a unit of Sony Corp of America.Excluding items, Discovery earned 43 cents per share in the quarter, above the average analyst estimate of 41 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The stock was up 2.7 percent at $31.72 in midday trading on the Nasdaq.

The company forecast full-year revenue and adjusted profit to grow in the ""high-single to low-double digits"" in percentage terms on a constant currency basis.Discovery expects U.S. ad sales to accelerate in the first quarter due to ""solid"" pricing, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Warren said on a post-earnings call.Ad revenue from Discovery's U.S. networks fell 3.2 percent to $398 million in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, hurt by lower demand for the company's content.Discovery also reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit, driven by strong growth in its international networks. Ad revenue from international networks rose 6.7 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, helped by higher delivery in Western Europe and volume growth in Latin America.""From a fundamental perspective, the trends outside the U.S. are still very strong, and inside the U.S., they're clearly focused on fixing areas of weakness... Clearly today, the stock is looking towards 2015 and beyond,"" BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen told Reuters.However, Discovery's revenue from Russia, which has dragged on the company's otherwise impressive international revenue growth in recent months, looks set to continue its downward spiral due to a new Russian law that bans advertising on cable channels with foreign content. The ""difficult geopolitical situation"" in Russia hurt the company's revenue forecast by about $50 million, Warren said.Falling viewership in the United States has led to Discovery losing advertisers to companies such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc, which offer video on-demand content.Discovery partnered with Hulu last December in an attempt to reverse the trend, allowing the television-streaming website to offer shows such as 'MythBusters' and the Emmy Award-winning 'Deadliest Catch'.Discovery's channels will also be available on PlayStation Vue, a cloud-based TV service by Sony Network Entertainment International LLC, a unit of Sony Corp of America.Excluding items, Discovery earned 43 cents per share in the quarter, above the average analyst estimate of 41 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The stock was up 2.7 percent at $31.72 in midday trading on the Nasdaq.

David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery Communications, said the company would sub-license some of the rights to national broadcasters such as the BBC or France Televisions to maximise the reach of the Games.Discovery has also made a commitment to the IOC that a certain amount of the Games will be available on free-to-air TV and not only paid channels. The agreement covers the Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, in 2018, and the 2020 Games in Tokyo in 2020, as well as the Olympic Games in 2022 and 2024, the host cities of which have yet to be selected. It includes 53 countries in Europe, but excludes Russia as well as the rights to France and Britain in 2018 and 2020 since those rights have already been sold.The IOC's Lumme told Reuters in an interview that the European broadcast rights from the four Olympics Games from 2018 to 2024 could bring in 1.6 billion euros total, about 10 percent higher than the last period, although the Russian rights have not yet been sold.Billionaire cable entrepreneur John Malone is a long-time board member and second-largest shareholder of Discovery with a 0.39 percent stake. Malone also owns a significant stake in Europe's largest cable company Liberty Global.",2015-06-29,DISCK,"Mon Jun 29, 2015 | 10:15am EDT",CORRECTED-Olympics- Discovery wins European broadcast rights to Games from 2018-2024,http://www.reuters.com//article/olympics-broadcasting-europe-idUSL9N0T304520150629?type=companyNews

88,"   By Tim McLaughlin and David Randall  U.S. media stocks have taken an indiscriminate beating this week, but many big fund managers still like entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney Co while turning negative for the long term on Discovery Communications, owner of several niche television franchises.Shares of leading media stocks slid again on Thursday as investors sorted winners and losers. Television advertising has been drying up as consumers downsize or eliminate expensive cable TV packages and watch more programs on mobile devices. The stock decline, fanned by a slew of disappointing financial reports, hurt a number of U.S. funds this week. Portfolio manager Don Yacktman has seen the performance of both his $11.2 billion Yacktman Fund and the $7.6 billion Yacktman Focused fund tumble into the 98th percentile of their Morningstar peers.Along with 7.7 million shares of Viacom Inc spread between those two funds, Yacktman owns about 30 million shares of Twenty-First Century Fox, down about 22 percent for the year. Viacom is off 22 percent this week and down nearly 45 percent over the past 12 months. Yacktman did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of Disney are off nearly 10 percent this week amid concerns that its leading sports channel franchise ESPN is losing subscribers. Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Iger admitted to ""modest losses"" during a conference call with analysts and investors this week. But he said cable packages are not dead and ESPN will still be the centerpiece of any offering. Pound for pound, the $866 million Fidelity Select Multimedia Portfolio has one of the biggest bets on Disney's future, with 24 percent of its assets in the stock at the end of June, fund disclosures show. As a result, the fund is down 4.2 percent this week, underperforming nearly all of its peers, according to Morningstar Inc. But thanks in part to Disney, the fund's three-year average annual total return of 21.76 percent is better than 83 percent of peers.  Portfolio manager Nidhi Gupta was not available for comment, but earlier this year declared Disney the ""clear winner among the content providers."" Like many other fund managers, Gupta has soured on Discovery Communications, hard hit by the consumer shift to watching Internet-based content. Discovery shares are down 7 percent this week and down 29 percent over the past 12 months.Fund managers began unloading large blocks of Discovery early last year. Fidelity's behemoth Contrafund had a $1 billion stake in Discovery in early 2014.

90,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON  BOSTON Aug 25 Popular consumer brands Discovery Communications, Chipotle Mexican Grill and CVS Health Corp pay their chief executive officers more than a thousand times what they pay their typical worker, giving them the biggest internal pay gaps among S&P 500 companies, according to a study released on Tuesday.The research from job-hunting website Glassdoor.com provides an early glimpse of data that publicly traded companies will be required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to report starting in 2017. On average, the research showed that a CEO of an S&P 500 company makes 204 times as much as the company's median worker.""I don't think most people are aware of the inequality of payrolls within a firm,"" Glassdoor's chief economist, Andrew Chamberlain, said.The study used CEO compensation figures reported by 441 S&P 500 companies through Aug. 14 and Glassdoor.com user reports about salaries at those companies. Only companies for which Glassdoor had 30 or more worker salary reports were included. The data could be skewed if workers under-counted tips or bonuses, Glassdoor said. Cable network operator Discovery had the biggest pay gap. Its CEO, David Zaslav, was the highest paid among S&P 500 companies last year, at $156 million. That was 1,951 times the amount paid to Discovery's median worker, Glassdoor found.In second and third place were restaurant chain Chipotle and drugstore operator CVS, whose CEOs in 2014 received $28.9 million and $32.4 million, respectively, both more than 1,000 times their median workers, according to the study. CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said its employees have opportunities to be promoted and receive higher pay, while its CEO is paid in line with industry standards. Discovery and Chipotle representatives did not return messages requesting comment.The Glassdoor study found the average CEO received $13.8 million, while the median worker at those CEO's companies made an average of $77,800. Glassdoor's findings were in line with other studies, said Todd Sirras, managing director of compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. He said the new reporting requirements could add pressure on companies to change their executive pay plans.""It will be one more arrow to sling at companies,"" he said.In a few cases workers made more than their CEOs, such as at Google Inc where CEO Larry Page got $1 in 2014.

93,"  (Repeats story with no changes to text)By Ross KerberBOSTON Aug 26 Investors in Discovery Communications Inc, including Manning & Napier Inc  and BlackRock Inc, withheld support for a member of the company's compensation committee, recent securities filings show, after the cable network operator gave its CEO the richest pay package in the S&P 500.The filings also show how some large fund firms backed opposite sides in a major proxy fight at DuPont this spring, with BlackRock funds backing management and Fidelity funds like Magellan supporting dissident director candidates.Because fund firms rarely discuss their proxy voting in detail, the disclosures provide a rare look at the influential votes they cast. Spokespeople for BlackRock, Fidelity and Discovery declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Manning & Napier did not return messages. Compensation for Discovery CEO David Zaslav became a flashpoint this spring after he received $156 million for 2014,  most of it tied to performance goals meant to align his interests with those of shareholders.Discovery did not hold an advisory vote on Zaslav's pay this year, leaving the votes on two directors, Robert Beck and J. David Wargo, as the main way for investors to express displeasure on the pay, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. Beck, an independent consultant who sits on Discovery's compensation committee, received support of just 56 percent of votes cast at the company's annual meeting on May 20. Wargo, was supported by 69 percent of votes cast. A number of BlackRock Funds that opposed Beck supported Wargo, filings showed, including BlackRock Long-Horizon Equity Fund.Manning & Napier funds like Pro-Blend Maximum Term  opposed both directors. S&P 500 directors on average received 97 percent support, according to consulting firm Semler Brossy. In the case of DuPont, the company in May repelled a challenge by activist investor Nelson Peltz, with shareholders backing all 12 directors nominated by the U.S. chemical conglomerate's management. Peltz's Trian Fund Management had sought four seats on the board, including one for himself, and had pushed the company to split its business.A source close to the matter had previously said DuPont had won backing from large fund firms including BlackRock, but the funds had not previously disclosed their voting.In a recent corporate governance report, BlackRock described its talks with an unnamed company, likely Dupont, and said that while a dissident shareholder ""raised reasonable questions,"" board changes were unnecessary.(Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Alan Crosby)",2015-08-27,DISCK,"Thu Aug 27, 2015 | 7:00am EDT",RPT-Funds snub Discovery director after rich CEO pay package,http://www.reuters.com//article/discovery-ceopay-funds-idUSL1N1112OX20150827?type=companyNews

104,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Discovery Communications (DISCA.O), which owns networks like the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, on Thursday became the latest TV company to invest in digital content in an effort to reach mobile viewers.Discovery invested $100 million in a new holding company, Group Nine Media, that combines millennial-focused online publishers Thrillist, a food, drink and travel brand; video news creator NowThis and animal video site The Dodo with its own digital assets, the company said in a statement. Through the deal, Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake in Group Nine, which will be run by Thrillist CEO Ben Lerer, according to David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery.Discovery, like many traditional media companies, is working to get more of its content online as viewers increasingly go to their phones or other mobile devices to view programs. Discovery's move comes months after Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal invested $200 million in online publisher BuzzFeed and Vox media.  ""We think this is a great play in attacking the 7 billion mobile devices with streams across the world,"" Zaslav told Reuters in an interview Thursday. ""This company is great at creating short form content that people want to consume and send to their friends...it's going to be a few more innings before we figure out how to monetize it.""For Discovery, the deal marks a push to become a bigger player on platforms like Facebook Inc (FB.O), where NowThis is the number one video news publisher, as well as platforms like Snapchat, Zaslav said. Additionally, the Silver Spring, Maryland-based company hopes to learn from the data and analytics that the new digital venture will offer up, and share that with advertisers, he said.Given its focus on science, Zaslav sees a lot of opportunity to expand its reach with more short form video content digitally, he said. ""This is really a global play for us,"" he said, noting that Discovery's Science Channel is available in 200 countries. ""Culturally right now smart is the new sexy.""

106,"  Eurosport, Discovery Communications Inc's European sports broadcaster, announced on Monday it has signed a deal to broadcast drone races, joining a number of networks to televise the fledgling sport in which pilots navigate remote-controlled aircrafts at high speeds through aerial obstacle courses.Eurosport has signed a one-year deal with DR1 Racing, a Los Angeles-based drone racing organization, to broadcast the Drone Racing Invitationals on Nov. 8 as well as three additional races next year in 70 countries.The pan-European sports media group, which Discovery bought last year, has 228 million subscribers in 93 countries in Europe, Asia and Australia and hopes drone racing will help it reach a younger audience, Peter Hutton, chief executive of Eurosport, told Reuters.For Eurosport and other networks, drone racing represents an opportunity to combine the live-event attraction of NASCAR and Formula 1 with the digital-age appeal of what has become known as eSports, in which video game players compete while millions of viewers watch online, usually for free. ""We think the space has gotten interesting ... and we like the idea of having storylines around individuals that we can build up as heroes,"" Hutton said of the drone pilots. ""We see this as a journey toward a younger demographic.""Reuters reported earlier this month that Eurosport was in talks with potential partners to broadcast drone racing. Eurosport, like other networks experimenting with drone racing, will broadcast the races on TV after they have occurred on a post-produced basis in order to show edited clips,  Hutton said, adding that other footage will be available online. Eurosport joins Disney Corp's ESPN, British broadcaster Sky Plc and Germany's ProSiebenSat.1, all of which have recently signed on to broadcast races by the 15-month-old Drone Racing League. Sky also agreed to invest $1 million in the league.

108,"   By Tim Baysinger | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Discovery Communications Inc and video-streaming firm BAMTech will form a joint venture to provide back-end technology for content owners, broadcasters and other platforms throughout Europe, the companies said on Tuesday.Eurosport Digital, Eurosport's website and subscription based streaming platform, will be the initial client of the joint venture, called BAMTech Europe. Discovery acquired full ownership of Eurosport last year. BAMTech is the digital arm of Major League Baseball.Terms of the joint venture were not released.BAMTech, which was spun off from MLB Advanced Media, has a significant footprint in the United States, serving 7.5 million paid subscribers with its U.S.-based clients' so-called over-the-top (OTT) streaming services, including the NHL and Time Warner Inc's HBO.Discovery and other media companies are struggling with ""cord cutting"" consumers who abandon large bundles of channels sold by cable TV providers.  With Discovery holding a large footprint in the European sports market, David Zaslav, Discovery’s president and chief executive, sees the deal beneficial to both companies.“We think we can help (BAMTech) build a platform business in Europe,” he told Reuters. “They’ve got a lot of knowledge in the direct-to-consumer business.” Unlike the United States, where 85 percent of homes subscribe to pay-TV, only about half of Europe’s 740 million homes count themselves as TV subscribers, said Zaslav. Discovery reaches most of those paid-TV subscribers but that still leaves another 370 million potential customers, the executive said.Discovery has focused on building out Eurosport’s digital businesses, which include Eurosport.com and its subscription-based OTT platform, Eurosport Player. In September, Discovery brought Ralph Rivera from the BBC on board as managing director for Eurosport Digital.Walt Disney Co said in August it was buying a 33 percent stake in BAMTech for $1 billion to allow it to sell more content directly to consumers. Zaslav said it will take around six months for BAMTech to be fully implemented within Eurosport Digital, at least four to six  months prior to the PyeongChang (South Korea) Winter Olympics, which begin in February 2018.Discovery on Tuesday also reported a 22 percent slide in third-quarter earnings, hurt by at $50 million after-tax impairment charge related to its investment in Lionsgate Shares of Discovery were 1.6 percent lower at $25.70 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.
