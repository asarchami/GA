0,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nasdaq OMX Group is prepared to walk away from running the data processor that was at the center of a three-hour trading halt in August, in a sign of its frustration with the pace of talks over implementing fixes for the system, according to documents seen by Reuters.The fairness and transparency of the U.S. equity markets depends in part on three ""securities information processors"" (SIPs) that provide investors with the same stock quotes and last sale prices, across venues.One SIP is run by Nasdaq and two by units of IntercontinentalExchange Inc's NYSE Euronext. Each SIP is controlled by a committee that decides on finances and upgrades, and members from all of the other exchanges sit on those committees. The costs of running a SIP come out of the revenues from the sale of its data.A software glitch crippled Nasdaq's SIP in August, forcing the exchange to halt trading on stocks it lists. Soon after, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White ordered the exchanges to come up with new protocols to improve the resiliency of the processors.But letters between Nasdaq and the committee that oversees its SIP and interviews with people familiar with the situation reveal that little progress has been made nearly five months after the outage.One source familiar with Nasdaq's thinking said the exchange would be happy to get rid of its SIP responsibilities, which it sees as having far more risk than reward, as it makes very little money from operating the system.Nasdaq declined to comment. It is not clear who would take over running the SIP if Nasdaq was to walk away. One of the NYSE-related SIPs, for options trading, was recently put up for tender and it is not yet clear if there are any bidders.The slow pace of talks suggest that it could still take months -- or even years -- for exchanges to implement long-term fixes to the SIP system. It also highlights how automation and fragmentation have made markets increasingly complex, leaving them vulnerable to glitches that have caused hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for participants.Software bugs, for example, botched Facebook Inc's 2012 IPO and cost brokerage Knight Capital Group, now a part of KCG Holdings, more than $440 million in trading losses.Information security, resilience and reliability of the SIP systems came into sharp focus only after the August outage. The Nasdaq SIP committee earlier focused on making sure the speed of the consolidated data feed was adequate, after NYSE was fined in 2012 because some of its customers got a head start on trading information from its proprietary feed, one source said. In November, Nasdaq presented its SIP committee with a list of 10 recommendations, including expanding the SIP's capacity, upgrading the testing environment for the system, and enhancing information security, the letters show.It also asked that the SIP be registered as a limited liability company (LLC) - similar to one of the NYSE-run SIPs - and that a formal contract be signed regarding Nasdaq's operational duties. Two sources said a deal for the LLC is close, which would limit the exchange's liability for losses arising from any future issues.The enhancements would take around two years to complete, but so far the committee has not given the go-ahead on any of the recommendations, the sources said. A person familiar with the SIP committee's thinking said the group will meet on February 13 in Florida, where it expects more clarity on whether it would need to look for a new entity to run the SIP or stick with Nasdaq. The source added that the group has formed subcommittees to look into various demands made by Nasdaq and expects their reports at the meeting as well.Without an agreement on all 10 enhancements and the creation of the LLC, Nasdaq said it would not sign a service agreement. To inject a sense of urgency in the talks, Nasdaq gave a notice of its intention to stop operating the SIP, according to one of the letters.The termination notice would take effect two years from January 1, two people familiar with the matter said.""Without these recommendations being implemented it is impossible for us to represent to the SEC, the ... committee or the public that the SIP technology is world class in resiliency and performance,"" Nasdaq said in one letter.Two people with knowledge of the NYSE-run SIP's plans said those committees have action plans in place that are being implemented.NYSE declined to comment.(Reporting by John McCrank; Editing by Leslie Adler)",2014-01-14,NDAQ,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 2:03pm EST",Exclusive: Nasdaq pushes to speed up talks over market fixes,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nasdaq-sip-idUSBREA0D18820140114?type=companyNews

8,"  (Adds details from CEO interview and conference call, background on market structure debate)By John McCrankApril 24 Author Michael Lewis' claim that the U.S. stock market is rigged was ""irresponsible,"" but the debate it has sparked could lead to positive change, said Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX Group, which reported higher earnings on Thursday.In ""Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,"" Lewis says that high-speed traders bilk billions from the financial system using ultra-fast telecommunications links, microwave towers and special access to exchanges to gain an edge over other traders.""I think certainly it was an irresponsible piece of work and it served to tell a story without any research or factual checking of what was going on and I think it did a disservice to the industry,"" Greifeld said in an interview.The debate over the fairness of the markets and the role of high-speed traders is not new, but Lewis took it mainstream. Shortly before ""Flash Boys"" was released in late March, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said U.S. stock exchanges and alternative trading platforms provide high-frequency traders (HFTs) with unfair technological advantages that give them early access to key data.Schneiderman said he had begun meeting with exchanges and alternative trading venues, known as dark pools, to discuss reforms. Last week, Reuters learned that his office had sent subpoenas to at least half-a-dozen HFT firms seeking information on their relationships with exchanges.Nasdaq has not been subpoenaed, Greifeld said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have said they had several active probes into HFT.HFT AND MARKET MAKERS There is no agreed upon definition of HFT, but Nasdaq said on Thursday firms it considers to fit into the category add only 1 percent to its total revenues. The transatlantic exchange operator said its first quarter revenue was up 27 percent from a year earlier, at $529 million, helped by new revenue from recent acquisitions, as well as organic growth. Nasdaq did not include in its HFT definition firms with market making obligations on its exchange, meaning firms that take the other sides of trades in stocks they have been assigned responsibility for. Several such firms are considered by HFT critics to be among the largest high-frequency traders.""These are people who are providing a two-sided market, who always have to be on the adverse side of the investment decision, providing immediate liquidity to the marketplace, and under our rules have to be within a certain percent of the inside market on a continuous basis,"" Greifeld said on a call with analysts. ""So I think in any construct you talk about, nobody is going to try to restrict that activity. Why would you? The market needs that."" SHINING A LIGHT ON DARK CORNERS Nasdaq said its net income in the last quarter rose to $103 million, or 59 cents per share, from $42 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-ago results were hit by charges related to problems with Facebook Inc's initial public offering, when a glitch on Nasdaq's exchange led to a collective loss by market makers - which absorbed the losses of other firms - estimated at around $500 million.Not including one-time items, the New York-based company earned 72 cents per share, beating the average estimate of analysts by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Non-transaction-related services, such as providing market data and public relations, made up 72 percent of Nasdaq's revenues. Like other exchanges, Nasdaq has had to rely less on trading revenues in recent years as nearly 40 percent of all stock trades now happen on private broker-owned dark pools and other off-exchange venues where trading information is hidden until after trades are executed.Some academics and former regulators say so much trading now happens on ""dark"" venues that publicly quoted prices for stocks on exchanges may no longer properly reflect where the market is. And this problem could cost investors more than any shenanigans related to high frequency trading.Greifeld said he has been frustrated by the lack of movement on this issue. But he added that with all of the attention generated from ""Flash Boys,"" he is hopeful progress will be made toward rules that would force brokers to only route trades off-exchange if those trades are of a certain size or could be executed at meaningfully better prices than on a public market.""We certainly feel increased optimism that with this publicity, we can have maybe an acceleration of the evolution of the market. And with 40 percent of the market trading away from the lit markets, there is certainly great opportunity for us.""

11,"   By John McCrank and Greg Roumeliotis | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nasdaq OMX Group Inc lured back former Chief Financial Officer Adena Friedman as co-president with the understanding that she will succeed Chief Executive Bob Greifeld, possibly as soon as next year, sources familiar with the matter said.There is no written agreement that lays out such a timeline. And Greifeld, 56, who has been the financial market company's CEO for 11 years, could still stay until 2017, when his contract ends, the sources said. But one of the sources said that Friedman, 44, left her job as CFO of private equity firm Carlyle Group LP with the clear impression that she could become CEO within the next 12 to 18 months if she did not perform poorly.While her return, announced last month, was widely seen as positioning her to succeed Greifeld, the understanding on the expected timeline has not been reported previously. Nasdaq declined to comment or make Friedman available for an interview. Both Greifeld and the Nasdaq board were involved in hiring back Friedman, the sources said.    Friedman, who had left for Carlyle three years ago after an 18-year career at Nasdaq, begins her new job on Monday. She will oversee the transatlantic exchange group's global corporate, information services, and technology solutions business lines, accounting for around 60 percent of Nasdaq's total revenue, which last year was $3.2 billion. Succession has been top of mind at Nasdaq over the past few years but a number of possible internal candidates have not been prepared to wait for Greifeld to step down, complicating such planning at the company.In September, sources told Reuters that the company had put together a list of external and internal candidates to succeed Greifeld. External candidates on Nasdaq's list included London Stock Exchange Group Plc CEO Xavier Rolet, Singapore Exchange Ltd CEO Magnus Bocker, TMX Group Ltd CEO Tom Kloet, and former CME Group Inc CEO Craig Donohue. CEO BOOT CAMP In November, Eric Noll, who headed trading operations at the exchange and was seen as the top internal candidate for the job, left to become CEO of brokerage ConvergEx Group[BNYCG.UL]. One source said so serious was Nasdaq about Noll as a candidate that it had even put him through CEO boot camp training.  Noll had replaced yet another CEO-hopeful in 2009. Chris Concannon, who until then had been Greifeld's No. 2, left for trading firm Virtu Financial, where he is president and chief operating officer.Friedman's decision to leave New York-based Nasdaq in 2011 was spurred in part by the career opportunity at Carlyle, but also because it meant she could spend more time in the Washington DC area, where her family lives, the sources said.  Carlyle also offered her more money. The cash portion of her compensation at Carlyle was similar to what she made at Nasdaq, but the equity portion was higher. At the end of last year, Friedman had around $15.7 million worth of Carlyle stock that had not yet vested. She had to give up unvested stock when she returned to Nasdaq.    Friedman and Greifeld developed a strong working rapport at Nasdaq, where Friedman helped orchestrate the takeovers of OMX Group, INET, and the Philadelphia and Boston Exchanges. The two stayed in contact after she left Nasdaq, the sources said. In February last year, Carlyle also approached Nasdaq about taking the exchange private. Talks broke down over a disagreement on price.  'HERS TO LOSE' Greifeld was a proponent of Friedman being his chosen successor even in 2011. But at the time the board was split as to whether she could lead the company, one of the sources said. She had spent her entire Wall Street career at Nasdaq, and some directors worried about her lack of outside experience and her management skills, the source said. Now, with the experience from Carlyle under her belt, the board is ready to give her a shot, the sources said. Three top Nasdaq executives, John Jacobs, Anna Ewing, and Bruce Aust, will report directly to her. One source said, the CEO job is “hers to lose.”Under Greifeld, Nasdaq has been diversifying away from transaction businesses, which are challenged after years of soft trading volumes and competition from upstart trading venues as well as brokerages that execute stock orders internally in so-called ""dark pools.""It is instead investing in providing technology, data, and corporate services to companies. These more stable sources of income largely fall under the business lines that Friedman now leads. Co-President Hans-Ole Jochumsen is in charge of transaction services.

12,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied a plan by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc to offer rebates to some of the biggest customers of one of its options exchanges, based on the amount of trading they do across all three of Nasdaq's options markets.Nasdaq's plan would have run afoul of rules stating that an exchange's fees cannot be unfairly discriminatory or hinder competition, the SEC said in an order posted on its website on Thursday. (1.usa.gov/UcwDvi)The U.S. options market is fiercely competitive, with 12 exchanges owned by six different exchange operators, including Nasdaq, Intercontinental Exchange Inc, and CBOE Holdings Inc. There are also 11 U.S. stock exchanges, many owned by the same corporate parents as the options exchanges, and dozens of bank- or broker-owned private trading venues.  By having more than one exchange, the parent companies can offer more than one type of pricing model, allowing them to target different types of customers. Under U.S. law, each exchange is supposed to compete with the others, even if they are owned by the same parent. Had Nasdaq's plan been allowed, it could have had far-reaching effects on competition, pricing and complexity across the financial markets, as it would have effectively broken down the walls between the units of the big exchange operators.  That idea alarmed smaller rivals, such as Deutsche Boerse's International Securities Exchange and MIAX Options Exchange, which said in letters to the SEC that tearing down those barriers would allow Nasdaq and other large operators to offer pricing that they could not compete with.""Can exchanges that supposedly compete against each other cooperate to establish joint fees?"" ISE wrote in a letter to the SEC. ""We believe that the answer is a resounding 'No.'"" Nasdaq will evaluate the SEC's decision and the company's options before deciding whether to pursue the matter, a spokesman said on Thursday.

15,"  SAO PAULO Nov 24 BM&FBovespa SA  wants to buy up to 15 percent of every major stock exchange operator in Latin America in a move to assert the influence of Brazil's sole listed bourse across the region, Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto told the Financial Times.São Paulo-based BM&FBovespa, which was created after the tie-up of two arch-rivals in 2008, hired two banks last month to acquire stakes in the main exchanges of Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina, Pinto said in an interview with the FT  published on Monday.He added that the goal of those purchase is to ensure a board seat on each of the bourses. Pinto's remarks underscore a trend among the world's largest exchanges, which are building up stakes in some rivals to tap into the potential of some of the world's fastest-growing capital markets. CME Group Inc, which owns a stake in BM&FBovespa, and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc are among bourse operators increasing their foothold in countries across Latin America and Asia. The media office of BM&FBovespa did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the FT story, but an external public relations executive working for the bourse said the content of the article accurately reflected Pinto's comments.

17,"  (Adds info on smart beta, comment from Nasdaq)By Amrutha Gayathri and Jessica ToonkelJan 5 Nasdaq OMX Group Inc said on Monday it will buy smart beta index provider Dorsey, Wright & Associates LLC for $225 million to boost its index business.Nasdaq will manage DWA's exchange-traded funds (ETF) and its own so-called smart beta ETFs, focused mainly on dividend and income strategies.Smart beta strategies, the fastest growing segment of the ETF market, weigh their component stocks by criteria other than market capitalization and are typically created via algorithms designed for their ability to cherry pick winning stocks.Fifty nine percent, or $115.8 million, of new investor money that has gone into exchange traded funds since January 2013 has been placed in smart beta ETFs, making them the fastest growing segment of the market, according to Morningstar. With the acquisition, Nasdaq anticipates being able to use its global market presence and sales force to promote Dorsey Wright's smart beta indexes, Adena Friedman, president of Nasdaq, said in a telephone interview.Nasdaq has relationships with a number of ETF providers, both in the United States and abroad, and sees opportunities both domestically and globally, she said. Dorsey Wright's analytics help users choose companies that have performed better on a relative basis to their peers depending on sector, asset class or geography.Nasdaq Global Indexes will have nearly $45 billion in assets benchmarked to its smart beta indexes and more than $105 billion benchmarked to all its indexes following the deal.Chris Allen of Evercore Partners said this was a small but smart deal as it targeted a growth area where Nasdaq already has some scale. Nasdaq said it will fund the transaction through debt and cash, and expects the deal to add to earnings once it closes, which should happen in the first quarter.The company does not expect the deal to have a material impact on its financial leverage or capital return strategy.Nasdaq's shares closed at $47.86 on Friday and were at $47.63 in afternoon trading on Monday.Friedman said she would continue to consider other index acquisitions if they fit strategically and provided return for shareholders.

19,"  (Adds financial details, background on acquisitions)NEW YORK Jan 29 Transatlantic exchange operator Nasdaq OMX Group on Thursday reported a drop in fourth-quarter profit, due in part to acquisition-related expenses and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.Net income attributable to Nasdaq totaled $87 million, or 50 cents per share, down from $141 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, such as asset impairment charges, merger costs, and property-related expenses, the New York-based company earned 75 cents per share, beating the analysts' average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue fell 1 percent to $517 million. Operating expenses were affected by foreign exchange rates, rising 22 percent to $344 million. Stripping out one-time charges, operating expenses fell 5 percent to $296 million.Nasdaq said its non-GAAP operating expense guidance for 2015 would be in a range of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. Chief Executive Robert Greifeld said the company planned to boost revenues by upgrading and launching new products within its recently acquired fixed income and corporate solutions businesses. In 2013, Nasdaq financed its $750 million purchase of eSpeed, the electronic Treasuries-trading platform, from BGC Partners Inc, a deal giving it a foothold in fixed income. It also closed a $390 million deal to buy Thomson Reuters Corp investor relations, public relations and multimedia services businesses.Market services revenue at Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent to $205 million. Of that segment, cash equities revenues rose on higher U.S. stock trading volume, while access and broker services revenues were flat, and fixed income and derivatives revenues declined. Technology solutions revenue, including corporate solutions and market technology, fell 6 percent to $138 million.Information services revenue, which includes market data and index licensing and services, rose 6 percent to $113 million.Listing services revenues were up 5 percent at $61 million, as Nasdaq a higher number of new listings in the quarter helped offset the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.

20,"   By John McCrank | BOCA RATON, Florida  BOCA RATON, Florida Nasdaq OMX Group said on Wednesday it is expanding into energy derivatives with energy futures and options set to trade on the Nasdaq Futures Exchange at less than half the prices charged by incumbents CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange. The energy futures and options products, collectively called Nasdaq Energy Futures, will be based on oil, natural gas, and U.S. power benchmarks, and are expected to begin trading by mid-year.Nasdaq has been pitching the new offerings to brokerages and banks for months and has secured support from firms that collectively account for 85 percent of the volume in market, including ABN AMRO Group, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley, and Virtu Financial. The exchange operator hopes to gain a 10 percent market share within 18 to 24 months of going live, which would make it a $50 million-a-year business, Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld told reporters at a Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida.  In January, Bryan Durkin, CME’s chief commercial officer, said in response to Nasdaq considering entering the derivatives market: ""We welcome competition” and “I wish them well.""Futures trading has gone mostly electronic over the past decade with less efficient and more costly open outcry trading pits shut down, but the savings from doing so have not filtered down to the customers, Greifeld said, adding that Nasdaq's prices would be less than half of those charged by CME and ICE.  The new energy futures will be traded through the U.S.-based Nasdaq Futures exchange, the license for which Nasdaq acquired when it bought the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 2008. No products have yet traded on Nasdaq Futures, which the Commodities Futures Trading Commission reinstated as a designated contract market in November after it had been deemed dormant on Jan. 1, 2014.The products will be cleared through the Options Clearing Corporation.     Nasdaq has a foothold in the commodities business through Nasdaq Commodities, a power derivatives market formerly known as Nordpool that Nasdaq acquired in 2010. It operates in Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Iceland.CME and ICE, however, have a duopoly on energy futures, which can have better profit margins than in matching stock trades, for which Nasdaq is better known.

24,"   By Ole Mikkelsen | COPENHAGEN  COPENHAGEN Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) is poised to launch a platform for foreign exchange trading which it says would make the $5 trillion-a-day global market more transparent and would diversify its own business, a top executive from the stock market operator said.Nasdaq Co-President Hans-Ole Jochumsen, one of two presidents who are both second in command of the tech-oriented stock market operator, told Reuters the FX trading platform is ready to be tested with banks although a launch was more likely in 2016.Authorities in the United States and Europe have fined major  banks more than $10 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates on the largely unregulated forex market.""There are two main problems in retail FX markets. How can customers be sure they receive the correct price and secondly the counterparty risk,"" said Jochumsen, also the head of Nasdaq's transaction business.""The criticism of banks and the fines show the market is not transparent and compliant and it speaks for it to be organized more like a stock market,"" Jochumsen told Reuters at the stock exchange in Copenhagen which is owned by Nasdaq.Stock exchanges globally have been positioning themselves to take leading roles in foreign exchange as regulatory pressures force banks to move more trading onto exchanges, which tend to be more transparent than traditional phone-based trading between brokers.The counterparty risk became real in January when losses from the surprise move by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to end its currency cap against euro nearly crippled brokerage FXCM FXCM.N while online forex broker Alpari UK was forced into administration after suffering heavy losses on the Swiss franc. Copenhagen-based foreign exchange brokerage Saxo Bank last week said the SNB's move cost it 700 million Danish crowns ($109 million) and booked a loss of 485 million crowns for the first six months in 2015 due to that cost.Jochumsen declined to say when exactly Nasdaq will launch the FX platform but said it was likely to happen in 2016.""We have a system ready that banks can test in their own systems but we don't want to launch it before we have enough banks committed to secure sufficient liquidity,"" he said. He did not see why most currency pairs such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/CHF could not trade on a system similar to the stock market where banks add bid and ask prices every day. Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) in July beat out U.S. commodities and currency exchange operator CME Group (CME.O) in an auction to buy the Germany-based foreign exchange trading platform 360T for 725 million euros ($842.4 million).And in March, BATS Global Markets, the No.2 U.S. stock exchange operator by volume and the largest pan-European stock market operator, closed its acquisition of FX trading platform Hotspot from KCG Holdings (KCG.N) for $365 million.But while Nasdaq's aim is the same – to enter the lucrative world of FX trading – its plan differs by building its own platform rather than buying one.

26,"   By John McCrank | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Exchange operator Nasdaq Inc said on Tuesday it plans to lower trading prices for some U.S. stocks during times of extreme market volatility to determine whether the incentives lead to less disruptive trading.  The move comes as exchanges and regulators re-examine rules designed to ensure orderly markets following a chaotic trading session on Aug. 24 when a near-unprecedented bout of volatility triggered a record intraday drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Nasdaq's experiment is set to begin on April 1 and is related to a regulation called Limit-Up Limit-Down, which prevents stocks from trading outside of a specific range based on recent prices, pausing the stocks when prices run afoul of the bands.Under the rule, if the best available offer for a stock falls below the bottom end of the price band, the stock goes into what is called a limit state for 15 seconds. If no trade happens during that time, or the order is not canceled, the stock is halted for five minutes and then reopened using an auction process. The measure was put in place to curb volatility following the 2010 ""flash crash,"" when around $1 trillion was temporarily wiped from U.S. stock markets in minutes.The first big test of the rule was on Aug. 24, when panic over the health of the Chinese economy led to steep market declines. Panic selling and a lack of buyers that day led to more than 1,250 trading halts in 455 stocks and exchange-traded funds, causing confusion that may have compounded the problem and led to some investors getting worse prices than they otherwise would have.     Now, as an incentive to provide bids for traders to hit during the limit state, Nasdaq plans to give its market makers rebates of 10 cents per 100 shares for buy orders that are placed and executed inside the price band, said Walt Smith, Nasdaq's head of U.S. equities and business analysis.The idea is to have fewer trading halts, but for those stocks that do get halted, Nasdaq said it would give rebates of five cents per 100 shares for all orders posted that are executed during the reopening.  The experiment will start with 200 of Nasdaq's more than 3,700 listed stocks, including Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, and Starbucks Corp. More stocks will be added and the incentives adjusted over time with the goal of making the plan permanent, Smith said.

""The ability to further that lead gives us advantages as to how we could serve our customers because you have a different volume-versus-scale arrangement,"" Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said in an interview.The deal would also free up capital for Deutsche Boerse, which has said it plans to merge with LSE to create a European trading powerhouse that could better compete with U.S. rivals.  Nasdaq, which plans to move ISE's trading platforms onto Nasdaq technology, said it could strip out $40 million of costs from the two businesses through the transaction.

36,"   By Jonathan Stempel  May 16 A Ukrainian man has become the first computer hacker to plead guilty in what U.S. authorities called a worldwide scheme to hack into services that distribute corporate news releases, and use stolen information to conduct insider trading.Vadym Iermolovych, 28, of Kievm, on Monday joined three traders in admitting criminal wrongdoing over the largest known hacking scheme designed to game financial markets, resulting in more than $100 million of alleged illegal profit.The defendant had not previously been linked publicly to the  alleged theft of more than 150,000 news releases from Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire from February 2010 to August 2015, and subsequent trades based on the stolen content.Ten defendants, including three hackers and seven traders, have been criminally charged by federal prosecutors in New Jersey and Brooklyn.More than 40 individuals and entities were also charged civilly by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Iermolovych pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and aggravated identity theft, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey said.K. Anthony Thomas, a public defender representing Iermolovych, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Authorities have said traders, including many with ties to Russia, gave hackers ""shopping lists"" of releases they wanted to see in advance, including financial results, and then traded in companies such as Caterpillar Inc, Home Depot Co, Las Vegas Sands Corp and Panera Bread Co. Iermolovych admitted to hacking PR Newswire between January and March 2013, after buying an employee's credentials that had been stolen in a hack on a social networking website.The defendant also admitted to selling news releases stolen from Marketwired for tens of thousands of dollars, and buying access to Business Wire's network, court papers show. Iermolovych had been arrested in November 2014 on other charges related to computer hacking and credit card fraud.He entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Madeline Cox Arleo in Newark, New Jersey. Iermolovych faces roughly 5-1/2 to 6-1/4 years in prison under recommended federal guidelines at his August 22 sentencing.The other accused hackers include Oleksandr Ieremenko and Ivan Turchynov, both of Ukraine. Their whereabouts were not immediately known.Business Wire is a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. PR Newswire is a unit of UBM Plc  being sold to Chicago-based Cision. Marketwired is owned by Nasdaq Inc. None was accused of wrongdoing.The cases in the U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, are U.S. v. Iermolovych, No. 14-mj-03237; U.S. v.

Nasdaq will also add rebates for new ETFs listed on its exchange and further incentives based on the amount of ETPs a firm supports.""We want to try to offer programs that help less-liquid products improve their trading quality,"" Jeff McCarthy, Nasdaq's head of ETP Listings, said in an interview. Nasdaq competes with Intercontinental Exchange Inc's ICE.N NYSE Arca and Bats Global Markets BATS.Z for ETP listings.Some 264 ETPs have launched over the last year in the United States, up from 241 in the prior year period, according to Morningstar Inc MORN.O. But the number of such funds trading fewer than 5,000 shares a day, on average, has grown nearly 10 percentage points to 31 percent in two years, according to XTF, a London Stock Exchange Group LSE.L unit that excluded exotic ""leveraged"" ETFs from its analysis.Trading firms known as market makers are essential to the smooth trading of ETFs. The lead market maker, or designated liquidity provider, will often use its own money to buy and distribute the first shares of a new ETF. The companies also help keep the funds' market prices roughly in sync with the value of the securities held by the funds. Companies that sign on to support new funds are required to offer to buy or sell shares at competitive prices in return for trading rebates.Yet some ETF issuers have had to delay fund launches as they vie for backing from overextended trading firms that have millions of dollars of seed capital and trading support tied up in fledgling ETFs.  Under Nasdaq's changes, which take effect on Sept. 1, market makers will earn rebates of 36 cents to 47 cents per 100 shares traded, depending on the volume of the ETP. Current rebates of 40 cents to 46 cents are not tied to trading volume.Firms may also receive rebates of up to 70 cents per 100 shares on new ETPs.

42,"   By Steven Scheer | TEL AVIV  TEL AVIV The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) must make significant changes to its structure, regulations and image or it will run itself out of business, a senior Nasdaq OMX official said on Wednesday.The U.S. bourse cooperates closely with TASE on various issues and earlier this year the two exchanges agreed to create a private market to support small Israeli growth companies. While Israel is home to a flourishing start-up sector many of those companies opt to be sold or ultimately list on New York's Nasdaq rather than go public in their home market.TASE, which is struggling with falling trading volumes and a declining number of listed companies, is in the process of a demutualization plan that has already been approved by the bourse's members and Israel's cabinet.""They have to move forward quickly and successfully or there won't be a stock market. I truly, truly believe that,"" Meyer Frucher, vice chairman of Nasdaq OMX, told a conference at Ono Academic College in Israel.He said the Israeli exchange needs to open itself to new ideas and to ""trade everything"".      The demutualization plan, which still needs parliament's approval, aims for TASE to be more competitive, enable it to cooperate with foreign exchanges and end Israeli banks' control over the exchange.TASE has also agreed to deploy Nasdaq's Genium INET technology for trading in equities, derivatives, bonds, fixed income and commodities.Many companies have complained that new regulations since the 2008 financial crisis keep them from listing on TASE. ""Whether it's true or not there is a perception of over-regulation. But it doesn't matter because it's a barrier,"" Frucher said.Under the demutualization plan, announced in 2014, member brokerages and Israeli and foreign banks including Citicorp, UBS and HSBC would become shareholders. It would also separate between ownership and companies on the bourse.Trading volumes this year have averaged 1.25 billion shekels  ($331 million) a day, down from 1.45 billion in 2015 and 2 billion in 2010. The number of companies listed on the bourse has dropped by 200 over the past decade to 454 while there are very few public share offerings. Rather than raise money on TASE, many high-tech companies have been sold to large foreign ones, which has led to a steep drop in Israel's intellectual property.Shmuel Hauser, head of Israel's securities regulator, admitted the stock market was ""in a battle of to be or not to be.""""It is clear to all of us that if we don't change the negative dynamics of the stock exchange, the situation could worsen,"" he told the conference.Recently approved measures that provide incentives to smaller companies and tech firms, such as tax benefits, being able to report in English and eliminating quarterly reports for smaller firms, may change the dynamic, while cutting trading fees should also bring boost trading, he said.
