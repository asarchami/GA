0,"  * Alaska Air profit also better than expected* Shares fall amid broader market slowdownJan 23 U.S. airlines United Continental Holdings  and Southwest Airlines reported higher-than-expected fourth quarter profit on Thursday, aided by strong revenue and lower fuel costs.Airline shares fell as the broader market headed lower. Some analysts said a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast from United and profit-taking also pressured the sector.Chicago-based United said unit revenue, a measure of passenger revenue per available seat mile, would be flat to up 2 percent in the first quarter. The carrier cited January storms and the Easter holiday shift into April this year from March in 2013 as drags on performance.Delta had forecast a rise of 2 percent to 4 percent and Southwest said its unit revenue for the first period would be higher on a year-over-year basis. Southwest shares were off 2.4 percent to $21.24 and United fell 1.5 percent to $48.43 in afternoon trading. Alaska Air Group, which also reported a higher profit  on Thursday, shed 0.6 percent to $81.35.Jim Corridore, an analyst with S&P Capital IQ, said concern about United's revenue outlook weighed on the sector. The strong fourth-quarter results from Southwest and United, which benefited from fare increases, followed a similar report from Delta earlier this week.American Airlines Group, the carrier formed by December's merger of AMR Corp and US Airways, will report results next week.Most U.S. airlines have bounced back to profitability since 2010, and Corridore said he expected more solid results in 2014. Carriers ""are keeping a tight rein on capacity and are looking to raise fares and price their product to earn a sustained profit,"" Corridore said.United earned $298 million, or 78 cents per share, in the fourth period, as revenue rose 7 percent to $9.3 billion. Analysts expected profit of 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income at Southwest rose to $212 million, or 30 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $78 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit was 33 cents, compared with 29 cents expected by analysts. Southwest revenue rose 6 percent to $4.43 billion.Alaska Air, the parent of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air Industries, had quarterly earnings of $78 million, or $1.10 a share adjusted for items. That compared with $1.07 expected by analysts on average.",2014-01-23,ALK,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 4:43pm EST","WRAPUP 1-United, Southwest profits top estimates as fuel costs fall",http://www.reuters.com//article/airlines-results-idUSL2N0KX0XD20140123?type=companyNews

2,"  SEATTLE Feb 4 Alaska Airlines is determined to remain independent and its financial results are crucial to staving off a takeover, the head of the airline said on Tuesday.""The best defense is performance,"" Brad Tilden, chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group, told an aerospace conference. ""If we're not performing, we're in trouble.""The Seattle-based airline has come under increasing competition from codeshare partner Delta Airlines, which is expanding flights in Alaska's home turf of Seattle. That is driving Alaska to consider partnerships with other airlines, Tilden said. He declined to elaborate.He said Alaska had strategies to allow it to succeed as an independent airline and that it intends to keep working with Delta.

22,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Alaska Air Group Inc said on Monday that it would buy Virgin America Inc for $2.6 billion in cash to become the top carrier on the U.S. West Coast and compete more effectively with larger airlines.At $57 a share, the deal represents a premium of about 86 percent from Virgin America's stock price before reports in March that the company was considering a sale. Analysts characterized the price as steep but said the merger would strengthen Alaska Air. ""The perception is that they paid a very, very high price,"" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel. However, he said Alaska Air could handle the cost because its strong balance sheet would allow it to raise capital at a low borrowing rate.The merger would help Alaska Air compete against Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc, which have embarked on major expansions in Los Angeles, Hackel added.The deal appears to end what Alaska Air Chief Executive Officer Brad Tilden called a ""hard-fought competition"" to purchase the offshoot of billionaire Richard Branson's London-based Virgin Group, which had become famous for its mood lighting and media-rich entertainment on flights.

23,"   By Jeffrey Dastin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Alaska Air Group Inc said on Monday that it would buy Virgin America Inc for $2.6 billion in cash to become the top carrier on the U.S. West Coast and compete more effectively with larger airlines.At $57 a share, the deal represents a premium of about 86 percent from Virgin America's stock price before reports in March that the company was considering a sale. Analysts characterized the price as steep but said the merger would strengthen Alaska Air. ""The perception is that they paid a very, very high price,"" said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel. However, he said Alaska Air could handle the cost because its strong balance sheet would allow it to raise capital at a low borrowing rate.The merger would help Alaska Air compete against Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc, which have embarked on major expansions in Los Angeles, Hackel added.The deal appears to end what Alaska Air Chief Executive Officer Brad Tilden called a ""hard-fought competition"" to purchase the offshoot of billionaire Richard Branson's London-based Virgin Group, which had become famous for its mood lighting and media-rich entertainment on flights. JetBlue Airways Corp had also made an offer but said in a statement that the price reached a point where it decided to withdraw from the bidding. The Alaska Air deal would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline after a decade of mergers that have shrunk the industry to a handful of companies.

29,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Alaska Air Group Inc's (ALK.N) plan to buy Virgin America Inc (VA.O) makes the company a more attractive partner to Asian airlines looking for extra revenue from connecting passengers to flights within the United States, industry executives and experts say.Foreign airlines could market Alaska Air's U.S. flights to their customers in Asia and take a commission for those sales - a common airline practice called code-sharing. Travelers from Asia would earn frequent flyer miles under their preferred airline's loyalty program even while traveling on Alaska Air.Seattle-based Alaska Air said its $2.6 billion purchase of Virgin America, based in California, gives it 22 percent of seats on North America flights from the U.S. West Coast, more than any other airline. California was the No.1 U.S. destination for visitors from Asia in 2014, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.""We'll be a very desirable partner for these international airlines,"" Alaska Air's Chief Executive Officer Brad Tilden said on an investor call Monday. The company's effort to woo Asian airline code-sharing partners comes as Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) are competing more aggressively with Asian airlines for trans-Pacific passengers. Each of the three carriers said in the past month that it intends to add a route to China.The Alaska-Virgin deal is ""definitely a positive"" for independent carriers abroad - those who are not in marketing alliances with the three big U.S. carriers, said Joel Chusid, the U.S. executive director for China's Hainan Airlines Co Ltd (600221.SS).""With Alaska, we're helping each other. There's no competition,"" Chusid said in an interview. When Hainan's other U.S. partner American started flying to China, he said managing the relationship ""became a lot trickier"" even though their code-share remains in place. American, Delta and United declined to comment.Many foreign airlines already market Virgin America's or Alaska Air's flights.  But the merger opens up new opportunities, said John E. Jackson, vice president of passenger marketing and sales for the Americas at Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (003490.KS), which shares codes with Alaska Air and has a more modest arrangement with Virgin America.Industry executives said foreign airlines will likely wait to see how the merger is executed before undertaking what could be long processes of structuring new code-sharing deals and getting regulatory approval for those agreements.
