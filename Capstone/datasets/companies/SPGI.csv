1,"  JOHANNESBURG South Africa's rand rose to its firmest in nearly one month on Monday while government bonds also strengthened after S&P Global Ratings affirmed the country's investment-grade credit status on Friday.S&P left its BBB- rating on Africa's most industrialised economy but warned that its negative outlook reflected the potential adverse consequences of low GDP growth.By 1515 GMT the rand ZAR=D3 had gained 1.25 percent to 14.9105 per dollar, its firmest since May 12, breaking through a number of key technical milestones as the greenback floundered with bets of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve receding.""The rand has broken below its 50-day moving average at 15.00, which from a technical perspective is quite an important move. If it can close below that it would be rand positive,""  market analyst at ETM Analytics Ricardo Da Camara said.The rand was also firmer against the British pound GBPZAR= and the euro EURZAR=, gaining 1.7 percent and 1.1 percent against the currencies respectively.Government bonds also firmed, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 ZAR186= falling 16 basis points to 9.04 percent, its firmest since May 9. South Africa's dollar-denominated bonds also firmed. The rand added to gains achieved on Friday after weak employment figures from the United States data quashed expectations for a near-term U.S. interest rate hike, boosting appetite towards riskier emerging market assets.Traders said the rand was in line to stretch the recent gains ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen later in the session.""After Friday's nonfarm payrolls report investors are going to put a lot of weight on what Janet Yellen says today,"" Da Camara said. On the bourse South African equities fell, led by petrochemicals group Sasol (SOLJ.J), which slid over 12 percent after it flagged lower annual earnings and said costs would rise on a major U.S. project.The benchmark Top-40 index .JTOPI fell 0.5 percent to 47,822 while the wider All-share index .JALSH also ended 0.5 percent lower at 53,991, reversing two straight sessions of gains. Sasol's shares closed 11 percent lower at 433 rand. The company raised its forecast for the cost of its U.S. ethane cracker by 26 percent to as much as $11 billion due to construction delays.Telkom SA (TKGJ.J), South Africa's biggest landline provider, leapt 8 percent to 65 rand after reporting a 15.5 percent jump in annual earnings and announcing the end of its cost-cutting strategy.Overall, around 229 million shares changed hands, compared with last year's daily average of 280 million, according to preliminary bourse data.

2,"  * S&P warns of political tensions, low growth* August elections could derail reforms* Finance minister concerned about state firms   (Adds details, finance minister, analyst quote)By Mfuneko ToyanaJOHANNESBURG, June 6 Standard & Poor's said on Monday that political upheaval might derail South Africa's economy and that it expected that risk to intensify ahead of local government elections on Aug. 3, although it does not anticipate a recession.The ratings agency also said that economic reforms must be implemented to avoid a downgrade in December, having, on Friday, kept its rating at BBB- with a negative outlook and lowered its economic growth estimate to 0.6 percent from 1.6 percent. South Africa's economy grew by only 1.3 percent in 2015 and major sectors in Africa's most industrialised nation have shrunk due to a weak rand, low consumer demand and rising inflation.""The potential impact of increasing political tensions within the ruling ANC and within government can potentially derail policy implementation and the reform endeavours that have been intensified since the beginning of this year,"" S&P's Africa analyst, Gardner Rusike, told a media conference call.President Jacob Zuma has faced mounting criticism from the opposition over managing the economy after he changed finance ministers twice in a week in December. But the ruling African National Congress party has backed him, helping him survive an impeachment vote in parliament in April. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Monday the reprieve from a downgrade to ""junk"" status by S&P was an opportunity to focus on improving the economy, creating jobs and implementing reforms that would see GDP move towards two percent.""We have lots going for us if we can convert plans into action,"" he said on state-owned SABC television.South Africa now awaits a review by Fitch, which also rates its debt one notch above non-investment grade, with the decision due on Wednesday, according to the Treasury. Last month Moody's held its rating at Baa2.""It remains to be seen just how fixed the view of S&P Global Ratings is and how it will play out in six months' time, with some expectation that the rating downgrade has been postponed, not avoided,"" NKC African Economics analyst, Gary van Staden, said.Gordhan admitted the Treasury was worried about the risk posed to the rating by the 467 billion rand ($31 billion) in state guarantees to government-owned firms.""Now what we want to see is that each of these are managed properly financially, are governed properly, make the right kinds of decisions within the parameters of the law and take the pressure off the government fiscus,"" he said.On Friday, the Treasury said it would decide by the end of this year which state-owned companies would be privatised or closed after warnings by S&P, Moody's and Fitch that their reliance on state bailouts posed a major risk.

3,"   By Claire Milhench | LONDON, June 6  LONDON, June 6 Emerging equities rose to one-month highs on Monday after weak U.S. jobs growth reduced expectations of a Fed rate rise, whilst South African bond yields fell to multi-week lows after the country dodged a ratings downgrade.Ratings agency S&P Global maintained South Africa's investment grade credit rating on Friday, bucking expectations of a downgrade to junk. That pushed South Africa's 10-year benchmark local bond yield to multi-week lows, whilst dollar bonds fell across the curve.The rand extended gains against the dollar to touch its strongest level in three weeks after firming more than 3 percent on Friday. Five-year credit default swaps were steady at three-week lows of 297 basis points, according to Markit data.""South Africa still has a lot of challenges and there is the Fitch rating decision to come this month, but they haven't been downgraded ... cyclically there is still room for the rand to do a bit better,"" said Dominic Bunning, emerging markets FX strategist at HSBC.MSCI's emerging equity index was up almost 1 percent, extending Friday's 0.85 percent gains after U.S. non-farm payrolls showed the slowest jobs growth in more than five years. This has cooled expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise rates in the near term.""The market is now saying June is not going to happen, July is possible but not that likely. That gives a bit more time for emerging markets,"" said Bunning.Emerging Europe stocks opened stronger, with Russian dollar-denominated stocks up 1.5 percent, helped by crude futures  above $50 a barrel. Prague shares  also rose 0.9 percent and Turkish stocks were up 0.8 percent.This followed decent gains in Asia, where Hong Kong  rose 0.4 percent and Indonesia 0.7 percent. But Chinese mainland shares slipped 0.3 percent as investors awaited this week's May data for clues as to the health of the economy.Emerging Asian currencies firmed, playing catch-up after the dollar's retreat on Friday to three-week lows but some European currencies gave up some of the gains they had enjoyed at the end of last week.The Russian rouble softened around 0.2 percent after firming almost two percent on Friday, and the Turkish lira  lost 0.3 percent after gaining 1.5 percent on Friday to hit its strongest level in a month.The Hungarian forint however rose 0.2 percent against the euro to touch its strongest in a month, whilst the Polish zloty firmed 0.2 percent.But Bunning was cautious on the zloty given concerns about a government plan to convert foreign currency mortgages at a cost to the Polish banks. ""Generally that story will be negative for the zloty - it will be very challenging for the government to come up with a plan that works for the banks,"" he said.For GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2016, see link.reuters.com/jus35tFor GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2016, see link.reuters.com/weh36sFor GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging Europe performance 2016, see link.reuters.com/jun28sFor GRAPHIC on MSCI frontier index performance 2016, see link.reuters.com/zyh97sFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, seeFor TURKISH market report, seeFor RUSSIAN market report, see )Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters              Equities                  Latest    Net Chg  % Chg  % Chg on yearMorgan Stanley                 Emrg Mkt Indx    823.84    +7.66   +0.94   +3.74Czech Rep            888.12    +8.61   +0.98   -7.13Poland           1802.27    +8.84   +0.49   -3.06Hungary           27243.85  +109.68   +0.40  +13.89Romania           6511.60   -34.10   -0.52   -7.03Greece              651.02    +2.39   +0.37   +3.12Russia             918.20   +15.56   +1.72  +21.29South Africa   47772.62  -310.92   -0.65   +4.31Turkey          78743.41  +603.91   +0.77   +9.78 China             2934.29    -4.40   -0.15  -17.09India           26822.61   -20.42   -0.08   +2.70Currencies              Latest    Prev    Local    Localclose   currency currency% change % changein 2016 Czech Rep      27.00     27.02   +0.07    -0.00Poland          4.38      4.39   +0.18    -2.80Hungary       311.43    312.08   +0.21    +1.03Romania         4.52      4.51   -0.03    +0.07Serbia        123.23    123.14   -0.07    -1.43Russia            65.73     65.61   -0.18   +10.99Kazakhstan       335.06    337.71   +0.79    +1.62Ukraine           24.95     24.90   -0.20    -4.00South Africa      15.10     15.09   -0.10    +2.38Kenya            101.10    100.90   -0.20    +1.09Israel             3.83      3.84   +0.21    +1.47Turkey             2.91      2.90   -0.37    +0.16China              6.56      6.56   -0.01    -1.10India             66.93     66.99   +0.09    -1.09Brazil             3.52      3.52   +0.04   +12.41Mexico            18.61     18.58   -0.12    -7.71Debt                 Index   Strip Spd  Chg   %Rtn   IndexSov'gn Debt  EMBIG   419        -1    .00  7 24.33 1(Editing by Alison Williams)",2016-06-06,SPGI,"Mon Jun 6, 2016 | 5:39am EDT","EMERGING MARKETS-EM stocks at month high, South African yields fall as downgrade averted",http://www.reuters.com//article/emerging-markets-idUSL8N18Y0ZA?type=companyNews

9,"   By Stephanie Kelly | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Several U.S. states studied by S&P Global Ratings are ill-equipped to deal with an economic recession, hampered by the slow rebound in U.S. economic growth after the damage wrought by the Great Recession.Fiscal imbalances, slower state tax revenue growth and increased spending on social services have contributed to a challenging economic landscape, as real GDP has only increased at 2.1 percent per year since 2009, S&P said in a report issued on Tuesday.Real U.S. GDP growth of 2.43 percent in 2014 and 2015 compared to pre-recession rates of 3.79 percent in 2004 and 3.35 percent in 2005, according to data from the World Bank.To determine states' fiscal capacity to withstand the first year of a hypothetical recession, S&P sampled 10 states, the report said. The study found that a collective revenue shortfall would eclipse the states' combined budget reserves by $5.4 billion. Of the 10 states studied, several have budget reserves that equal less than half of ""potential revenue underperformance"" in the first year of a moderate-intensity recession. These include  Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut.Washington, Florida and New York would fare best, with reserve balances that exceed potential shortfalls. The remaining states sampled, California, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, fall between those two groups.""Fiscal alignment"" is an important indicator of a state's ability to recapitalize budget reserves, the report said. ""Therefore, it's no coincidence, in our view, that the four states in our evaluation we found to be most fiscally vulnerable to a recession have also struggled with chronic structural budget imbalance,"" it said.States have also raised spending on public welfare, such as Medicaid, and pension benefits. Spending on entitlements increased to 40 percent in 2013 from 34 percent in 1995 as a share of total state spending, the report said.  This has reduced the states' ability to finance infrastructure and higher education — pro-growth ventures, it said. Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June and a slowed rate of job growth in the United States have increased economic concerns. However, it said there is still only a 20 to 25 percent chance of a recession occurring in the next 12 months.
