0,"  TORONTO Jan 15 Nordstrom Inc, is opening a store in the heart of Canada's largest city in fall 2016, the U.S. luxury retailer said on Wednesday, taking over the flagship space soon to be vacated by Sears Canada Inc .The Seattle-based company will open a three-level, 213,000-square-foot full-line department store at Toronto Eaton Centre, one of the top tourist attractions in the city and minutes from Canada's financial center. The store will be Nordstrom's sixth in Canada, with construction set to begin in March. Nordstrom opens its first Canadian store in Calgary this fall. Struggling Sears announced last October that it was closing its flagship location along with four other stores in a C$400 million ($365.66 million) deal. The lease termination freed up highly coveted commercial real estate, with Nordstrom a leading candidate to take over the space.

1,"  Jan 29 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on  Nordstrom, Inc. (Nordstrom, NYSE: JWN), including the Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions  appears at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Nordstrom'€™s position as a market share consolidator in the  department store sector, differentiated merchandise and a high level of customer  service which have enabled the company to enjoy strong customer loyalty and high  operating margins relative to its industry peers.Nordstrom's comparable store sales (comps) growth has moderated in 2013 at  projected 2.5%, versus high-single digit growth over the prior three years. The  deceleration is partially due to the shift in consumer spending away from  apparel and general merchandise. However, Fitch expects Nordstrom'€™s comps to  grow in the low-single digits and for its EBITDA margin to continue to lead the  sector over the next three years. Fitch expects Nordstrom's strong growth in  online sales and continued growth in its Rack business remain important drivers  for consolidated top-line growth of mid-single digits.Rack (23% of year-to-date sales) has seen its comps growth decelerate to 2.3% in  the first three quarters in 2013, versus 7.4% in 2012, as competition in the  off-price channel has stepped up significantly. Nordstrom expects to grow the  Rack store base to more than 230 stores by 2016 from the current base of 140  units, or an average of 25'30 openings annually, given the conceptâ€™s attractive  profile of generating high investment returns and fitting into the macroeconomic  environment. Fitch expects overall Rack sales to grow in the mid to high-teens  over the next two to three years, even if comps remain in the low single-digit  range.Direct channel (including Hautelook) continues its double-digit growth momentum  in 2013. Fitch estimates the direct channel will contribute more than $1.6  billion in sales and represent 13% -14% of total net sales. Fitch expects  Nordstromâ€™s direct channel will grow by 15%-20%, given the companyâ€™s investments  in its online fulfillment capacity, increased product selection, and free  shipping/free returns policy. Nordstrom has industry-leading sales productivity and profitability among the  major department stores. Its EBITDA margin has improved to the 15% range over  the past four years due to an improved mix of full-priced selling and strong  inventory control. The increased investments to support online sales growth and  other business initiatives will likely cap further margin expansion in the near  term. However, return on invested capital should remain at healthy and industry  leading levels.Fitch expects Nordstromâ€™s adjusted debt/EBITDAR to remain in the low to mid-2.0x  range, or 1.7x-1.9x for core retail business if adjusted for the more leveraged  credit card business over the next 24 months. The leverage calculation for the  core retail business assumes the companyâ€™s credit card receivables are financed  using a mix of 80% debt and 20% equity.Fitch expects Nordstrom to generate modest free cash flow (FCF; after dividends)  over the next two years, as capital expenditures are expected to increase  significantly to the $900 million level to support new store openings, remodels  and technology investments. Fitch expects future share repurchases will be  conducted within the context of maintaining the companyâ€™s stated leverage target  of 1.5x-2.5x (equivalent to 1.75x-2.75x using Fitch's methodology of 8.0x gross  rent expense) and adequate liquidity.The companyâ€™s liquidity is supported by a cash balance of $947 million as of  Nov. 2, 2013 and its $800 million senior unsecured revolver scheduled to mature  in March 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action is unlikely at this time as Fitch anticipates Nordstrom  will manage its capital structure to its publicly stated target of 1.5x-2.5x  consolidated debt/EBITDAR leverage using 8.0x net rent expense. This roughly  equates to a leverage target of 1.75x-2.75x using Fitch's methodology of 8.0x  gross rent expense.A negative rating action could result if a more aggressive financial posture  leads credit metrics to come in worse than targeted levels. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for Nordstrom:--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-';--$800 million bank credit facility at 'A-';--Senior unsecured notes at 'A-';--Short-term IDR at 'F2';--Commercial paper at 'F2'.The Rating Outlook is Stable.",2014-01-29,JWN,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 9:34am EST",RPT-Fitch affirms Nordstrom's IDR at 'A-'; outlook stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-affirms-nordstroms-idr-at-a-outloo-idUSFit68767320140129?type=companyNews

5,"   By Phil Wahba  Nordstrom Inc JWN.N is postponing the opening of its discount Rack stores in Canada until 2017, to focus on the launch of its full-line department stores there, its first department stores abroad. The Seattle-based upscale retailer had initially planned to start opening Rack stores in Canada next year. But Nordstrom said on Friday it has its hands full preparing to open six Canadian department stores, starting with a location in Calgary this autumn, and with a five-year, $1 billion technology upgrade. ""Given everything on our plate in both the U.S. and Canada and the complexity of it, we thought, let's work on getting the (Canadian) full-line stores up and running to the best of our ability first,"" Nordstrom spokeswoman Brooke White told Reuters. Nordstrom said altering its computer systems and distribution for its first international expansion was proving to be more complex than expected, despite the similarities between the U.S. and Canadian markets. The change in plans for Nordstrom comes soon after discount retailer Target Corp TGT.N reported a nearly $1 billion (U.S.) operating loss in Canada for 2013, with more losses forecast this year after a bungled entry there. Rack stores, which offer lower-priced designer merchandise made specifically for the chain as well as clearance items from the Nordstrom stores, have been key to Nordstrom's results. Comparable sales at Rack rose 2.7 percent last year, compared with a 2.1 percent decrease at the full-line stores. Nordstrom estimates there is room for as many as 20 Rack stores in Canada and 10 full-line department stores. Nordstrom will face competition from fellow U.S. luxury chain Saks Fifth Avenue, which will open a store in downtown Toronto next year. Saks is part of Hudson's Bay Co HBC.TO. The news of the Rack store delays was first reported by the Globe and Mail.

Shoppers can try them on, inspect the gems' quality up close, but to buy them requires a visit to Blue Nile's website.    The arrangement is a departure of sorts for Blue Nile Inc, the company that pioneered the sale of jewelry online at steep discounts. It is the first time the company has turned to brick and mortar in its 15-year history, showcasing products in two Nordstrom stores.To be sure, the move is not a dramatic shift - it is an extended test to attract new customers to its site. But it comes at a time when most national chains have established Web identities, eroding some of Blue Nile's allure and leaving it without the benefits of a chain of physical stores. ""Now everyone is online,"" said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand, shortly after dropping coverage of Blue Nile in June because his clients lacked interest. ""What they do is less unique.""LACK OF NAME RECOGNITION Analysts believe the company may have a place in the more crowded field, especially thanks to rapidly growing sales in China. But they say it must spend more to build its brand in the United States and more effectively compete with big national jewelry chains and the likes of Amazon.com.""People recognize Kay Jewelers. People recognize Jared more than they recognize Blue Nile,"" said Stephens Inc analyst Rick Patel, referring to two of the biggest U.S. brands. ""That's not a very easy situation to tackle.""Blue Nile, which reports results next week, lets shoppers research diamonds and customize jewelry online. Prices are 20 percent to 40 percent below diamonds sold in stores thanks to low overhead costs.

The U.S. jewelry business has rebounded to $59.1 billion since the recession, and Euromonitor estimates it will grow another 14 percent by 2018.Higher diamond costs were the main factor behind the stock's slide this year, Blue Nile Chief Financial Officer David Binder said. Other retailers keep large inventories of diamonds, shielding them from wholesale price increases. Yet Blue Nile cut its prices in 2012 and gradually increased its marketing budget, reaching $450 million in sales last year. But Signet's e-commerce sales grew more than twice as fast to $164 million. Blue Nile's net income last year was $10.9 million, a fraction of Signet's $368 million.

The market continued to take its cue from news overseas. Ukrainian border guards crossed the frontier to inspect a huge Russian aid convoy, which some had speculated could be a cover for a military invasion. The inspection comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a softer tone in comments regarding Ukraine.In Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki stepped down as prime minister, paving the way for a new coalition that world and regional powers hope will be able to quash a Sunni Islamist insurgency that threatens Baghdad.""While no one is discounting the possibility that these issues could get worse next week, there hasn't been anything untoward yet with the inspections or in Iraq, and that's a positive,"" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York. In the latest economic data, the New York Federal Reserve's report on manufacturers showed business conditions improved in August, though at a slower rate than expected.  Separately, U.S. consumer sentiment fell in August to its lowest since last November, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.""These are disappointing, but there's a growing feeling that the U.S. is going to be the best market to be in for the rest of the year,"" Colas said. ""U.S. equities look like a better value than U.S. Treasuries, or certainly European equities.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.05 points or 0.31 percent, to 16,764.63, the S&P 500 gained 7.92 points or 0.41 percent, to 1,963.1 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 28.24 points or 0.63 percent, to 4,481.24. For the week, the Dow is up 1.3 percent, the S&P is up 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq is up 2.5 percent. It is the biggest weekly gain for the S&P since April, and the biggest for the Nasdaq since February.The S&P is 1.2 percent off a closing record hit late July. In a sign of the market's long-term strength, the index has marked more than 1,000 days since its last correction, which Wall Street defines as a drop of 10 percent from the most recent high.Monster Beverage Corp jumped 28 percent to $92 after Coca-Cola Co said it was buying a 16.7 percent stake in the company for $2.15 billion.The stock was the S&P's biggest gainer, followed by Applied Materials Inc, up 5.6 percent to $22.34 a day after it reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations.On the downside, Nordstrom Inc fell 3.8 percent to $66.09 a day after its results, the latest disappointing read for the retail sector after both Macy's Inc and Wal-Mart  cut their outlooks earlier this week.

The Nasdaq matched an eight-session winning streak from a year ago and inched closer to its 5,132.52 all-time intraday high, reached in March 2000 just before the dot-com bubble burst. The S&P 500 ended slightly higher for the week as well, its third straight week of gains.The Greek accord will allow investors to concentrate on the fundamentals that should be driving the market, said Ben Pace, chief investment officer at HPM Partners in New York.""You're seeing a little bit better U.S. economic statistics than you've been seeing over the past three or four weeks. The European statistics have gotten a lot better too,"" Pace said. ""So maybe a relief rally today, because the markets were down as there was a lot of consternation going around.""

23,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Feb 26 Macy's Inc's planned push into the off-price retailing sector, dominated by chains such as TJX Cos Inc's TJ Maxx, shows the venerable department store chain has faced up to new realities of retailing in the United States.For the past six years, Macy's has focused more on cutting costs and streamlining its operations rather than expanding as a way to fuel earnings. Now, that has changed.Macy's said this week it would spend $1.2 billion to expand internationally and set up off-price stores, which sell items such as seconds, returned goods and off-season merchandise at prices that squeezed middle-class customers have found increasingly attractive since the 2008 recession.""It's a new world. Since so many peoples' salaries are off-price they also need to shop that way,"" said Robert Brusca, chief economist at consulting firm Fact and Opinion Economics. ""Macy's is bending to the reality of retailing.""The customer mindset has also changed, analysts said, as even higher income shoppers who tightened their belts and traded down during the recession have stayed with off-price retailers. The move will give Macy's the opportunity to stake a claim on three main types of shopper - the luxury buyer, through its Bloomingdale's chain; middle-income shoppers through its namesake stores; and the more bargain-hungry crowd attracted to TJ Maxx, Ross Stores and Burlington Stores.TJX's sales have increased 6 percent in each of the past two years, while Macy's sales have grown an average 0.75 percent. ""If you're looking for growth vehicles going forward in this retail environment, it (off-price retailing) has to be a consideration,"" research firm Retail Metrics' President, Ken Perkins told Reuters.""... It's something very very wise to look at.""Perkins noted the success of upmarket retailer Nordstrom Inc's off-price Nordstrom Rack stores, which have generated almost all of its parent's recent growth. Nordstrom Rack's sales have grown at least 10 percent every quarter for the past two years, while the company's overall sales growth has ranged from 0.4 percent to 8.9 percent.Macy's' holiday-quarter sales rose just 2 percent.""This new phase we have entered has the opportunity to take our company to a whole new level of success,"" Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said on an earnings call.""We have the ability to create a larger relationship with existing customers and make inroads with customers that have not traditionally shopped either Macy's or Bloomingdale's.""

24,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded its long-term ratings on  Nordstrom, Inc. (Nordstrom), including the company's Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings is  provided at the end of this release.  Nordstrom expects to conclude the review process of its credit card receivables  ($2.3 billion as of Jan. 31, 2015) in the first half of 2015 and use the  potential proceeds primarily towards reinvestment in its business and share  buybacks, rather than paying down debt which Fitch had allocated to the credit  card business. Post the transaction, total retail adjusted debt/EBITDAR is  expected to increase to the low to mid-2.0x range, versus 1.5x currently for the  core retail business stripping out credit card related debt and income. Nordstrom's consolidated leverage including the more highly levered credit card  business stood at 2.3x at the end of 2014.  To date, Fitch's ratings on  Nordstrom incorporated a retail adjusted leverage after assigning a portion of  the company's debt to the more highly leveraged credit card business. This  assumed the company's credit card receivables are financed using a mix of 80%  debt and 20% equity, which translated into $1.8 billion in credit card-related  debt based on Nordstrom's 2014 year-end receivables. Therefore the amount of  adjusted debt allocated to the retail business would be $2.9 billion (including  $1.3 billion of book debt and $1.6 billion capitalized leases using 8x rent  expense) which had resulted in a retail adjusted leverage of 1.5x.  Implicit in this assumption was that if Nordstrom ever sold its receivables  portfolio, it would pay down debt both directly secured by credit card  receivables as well as allocated unsecured corporate debt to a level consistent  with Fitch's assumption. If the ultimate allocation of proceeds differs from  Fitch's assumption and is used for purposes other than paying down debt  proportionately, the consolidated leverage ratio for the remaining retail  business post the deal would be higher leading to a negative rating action. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Nordstrom's position as a market share consolidator in the  department store sector, differentiated merchandise and a high level of customer  service which have enabled the company to enjoy strong customer loyalty. This  has resulted in industry-leading sales productivity, with EBITDA margins that  are in line with other industry leaders in the department store space such as  Macy's Inc. and Kohls Corp. Fitch expects Nordstrom's increased investments to  support online sales growth, and other business initiatives, including its entry  into Canada, is to likely cap or put some modest pressure on EBITDA margin over  the next 12-24 months.   Nordstrom's comparable store sales (comps) growth in 2014 was 4% compared to  2.5% in 2013, at the higher end of Fitch's expectations of low-single digit  growth. Overall sales grew 7.8% given three full line (including Canada) and 27  Nordstrom Rack store openings, as well as the addition of Trunk Club. The  performance is strong relative to Fitch-rated department stores, which grew  comps at approximately 0.5% in 2014, and the overall department store industry  sales decline of 2%.  Additionally, there has been a general slowdown in apparel and accessories sales  which grew 2% in 2014, indicating strong share gains for Nordstrom. Fitch  expects Nordstrom's comps to grow in the low single digits and overall top line  to grow 6% to 7%, primarily driven by continued growth in its online sales and  Nordstrom Rack (Rack) businesses with segment forecasts below.  Full-line stores (58% of total sales): Fitch expects full-line stores comps to  be flat to modestly negative due to the increased demand in the off-price  channels and ecommerce sales. Total sales growth for full line stores is  expected to be flat to modestly positive in the low single digit range, given a  handful of new full line store openings over the next few years, including its  expansion into Canada. Nordstrom Rack (24% of total sales): Fitch expects overall Rack sales to grow in  the mid to high teens over the next two to three years, driven by strong store  growth (230 stores by 2016 from the current base of 167 units) contributing 10%  - 12% to Rack's top line, and moderate comps growth in the low single-digit  range.  Direct Channel (15% of total sales): The direct channel, or Nordstrom.com,  continued its double-digit growth in 2014 and ended the year with approximately  $2 billion in sales. Fitch expects Nordstrom's direct channel to grow by 10%-15%  annually as consumers continue to shift spending towards the online channel.  Other (3% of total sales): Nordstrom has also been growing its online presence  through various channels including NordstromRack.com, Trunk Club (a  subscription-based personalized clothing service for men acquired in 2014), and  HauteLook (a flash discount sales Web site acquired in early 2011). Fitch  expects Nordstrom's other online channels to grow by 15%-20% annually. Fitch expects FCF to be negative $200 million in 2015, as capex is expected to  increase significantly to $1.2 billion level from $860 million in 2014, to  support new store openings, remodels, and technology investments. FCF is  expected to be positive $300 million annually thereafter as Fitch expects capex  to return to a more normalized $800 million to $900 million range.  Nordstrom's liquidity is supported by a cash balance of approximately $827  million as of Jan. 31, 2015 and an $800 million senior unsecured revolver due  March 2018. Upcoming maturities include $325 million of asset-backed senior  secured notes due October 2016, which Fitch expects will be paid off post the  sale of the credit card receivables and $650 million of senior unsecured notes  due January 2018. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch expects total retail adjusted debt/EBITDAR to increase to the low to  mid-2.0x range, post the sale of the credit card receivables, versus 1.5x  currently for the core retail business stripping out credit card related debt  and income.  Fitch expects Nordstrom's comps to grow in the low single digits and overall top  line to grow 6% to 7% annually over the next 24 months, primarily driven by  continued growth in its online sales and Nordstrom Rack (Rack) business. Fitch  expects full-line stores comps to be flat to modestly negative; overall Rack  sales to grow in the mid to high teens with comps growth in the low single-digit  range, and online revenue to grow in the mid-teens.  Fitch expects retail-only EBITDA margin to decline modestly from 12.9% in 2014,  due to Nordstrom's increased investments do support online sales growth, and  other business initiatives, including its entry into Canada.  Fitch expects FCF to be negative $200 million in 2015, reflecting an increase in  capex to the $1.2 billion level from $860 million in 2014 to support the  business initiatives. FCF is expected to be positive $300 million annually  thereafter as capex returns to a more normalized $800 million to $900 million  range.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action is unlikely at this time as Fitch anticipates Nordstrom  will manage its capital structure in the mid-range of its publicly stated target  of 1.5x-2.5x debt/EBITDAR leverage using 8.0x net rent expense. This roughly  equates to a leverage target of 1.75x-2.75x using Fitch's methodology of 8.0x  gross rent expense or 2.3x at the mid-range.  A negative rating action could result if a more aggressive financial posture  leads credit metrics to come in worse than targeted levels with adjusted  leverage above 2.5x on a prolonged basis. Fitch has downgraded the following ratings for Nordstrom: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; --$800 million bank credit facility to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB+' from 'A-'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  --Short-term IDR at 'F2';  --Commercial paper at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

25,"  TORONTO Toronto Dominion Bank (TD.TO) said on Tuesday it will acquire Nordstrom's (JWN.N) U.S. consumer credit card portfolio as the Canadian bank looks to use its strong balance sheet to expand its lending business in the United States.The value of the deal was not disclosed. But under the terms, Nordstrom will receive a large slice of net revenue generated by the credit card accounts.The move, which comes about two years after completing a similar deal with Target Corp (TGT.N), increases TD's reach among top U.S. retailers and supplements its presence in the U.S. Northeast. Nordstrom's U.S. credit card portfolio is valued at about $2.2 billion in receivables. Under a long-term agreement, TD will become the exclusive U.S. issuer of Nordstrom-branded Visa and private label consumer credit cards. Private-label credit cards are used by retailers without the stamp of a credit card company such as Visa or MasterCard and can typically only be used at that retailer alone. TD has expressed a willingness to make acquisitions in the United States. ""Given the type of balance sheet we have in the U.S., we are also highly liquid and are always looking at opportunities that would fill out our balance sheet because we are rich in deposits but not as rich in loans,"" Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said at a recent roundtable with media.

The data supported the view the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as early as next month, offsetting speculation in the previous two sessions that the Fed could wait until December to raise rates after China devalued its currency. Jitters over China remained. Sources had told Reuters this week that some powerful voices in the government were pushing for an even deeper yuan devaluation to help China's struggling exporters.""The market is still adjusting to the Chinese devaluation.

38,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 16 (Fitch) Subpar performance of late has driven credit  default swap (CDS) spreads on Nordstrom, Inc. out to their widest levels since  2012, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest CDS case study snapshot. Five-year CDS on Nordstrom widened out 75% over the past week, underperforming  the broader North America Retail sector, the CDS of which widened by 10%.  CDS  credit protection on Nordstrom has also increased, moving from the 'A/A-' space  for much of this year and now pricing in 'BBB' territory.  'Nordstrom's plunge in market sentiment is likely attributed to weaker than  expected earnings and lowered outlook for the year,' said Director Diana  Allmendinger.  Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

The strong results and forecast sent TJX's shares up as much as 6.5 percent on Tuesday and also boosted its rivals Ross Stores Inc and Burlington Stores Inc.TJX and other off-price chains sell home furnishings and apparel brands such as Dolce and Gabbana and Juicy Couture priced 20-60 percent lower than at most retailers, helping them draw price-conscious customers away from full-price retailers.""We believe this momentum will continue,"" Guggenheim Securities analyst Howard Tubin wrote of TJX in a client note. TJX has been the world's No.1 apparel and footwear retailer by revenue since 2007, according to Euromonitor, whose list includes retailers such as Gap Inc and American Eagle Outfitters, but excludes companies such as Nike Inc , which mainly sells to wholesalers.Macy's and Nordstrom last week reported disappointing same-store sales and cut their full-year forecasts, which analysts said may indicate consumers are increasingly expecting deeper discounts.TJX's comparable sales rose 5 percent in the third quarter ended Oct. 31, more than the 3.9 percent growth analysts on average were expecting, according to Consensus Metrix. The retailer raised its comparable sales growth forecast to 4-5 percent for the year ending Jan. 30 from 3-4 percent.The company said it was ""very comfortable"" with its inventory position, which it raised ahead of the holiday quarter to be able to send fresh merchandise to its stores. Macy's said last week that it would be forced to offer discounts in the quarter to clear fall season inventory.TJX's net income fell 1.3 percent to $587.3 million in the third quarter. On a per share basis it earned 86 cents per share. Revenue rose 5.3 percent to $7.75 billion.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 84 cents per share on revenue of $7.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.TJX said it expects average ticket prices to fall in the current quarter and forecast sales of $8.6-$8.7 billion.

Big retailers are keeping discounts for the weekend following Thanksgiving at around the same level as last year, according to data supplied to Reuters by Market Track.But polls by Reuters/Ipsos and some others show shoppers, who got even bigger discounts closer to Christmas last year, are cautious with their spending and willing to wait for deals.The Reuters/Ipsos survey found more people planned to cut holiday spending than increase in every category surveyed: clothing, jewelry, electronics, food and toys, and that 46 percent felt they could wait longer in the season to buy because of faster shipping.Black Friday shopping will help set the tone for the rest of the holiday season, signaling to retailers whether they need to drop prices or change promotions. While Black Friday is not always a strong forecaster of holiday spending, last year reports of poor Black Friday spending were followed by deeper discounting and a rush of buying in the week before Christmas.

""Seeing a little bit of a pause from the extremes that we've been put through over the past several weeks,"" said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in New York.""Now I think it's back to ""We're largely past earnings season, we have some political events to be mindful of and the central banks continue to be at the fore"","" he said.A report showed core consumer price index rose by a bigger-than-expected 0.3 percent in January, signs of an uptick in price pressures that could allow the Federal Reserve to gradually raise interest rates this year. While traders are not expecting any increases at this year at all, Fed policymakers appear to be at odds.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Friday rates will likely need to remain accommodative for some time, while other officials maintain that weak inflation and global turbulence are enough to pause on further hikes.At 9:37 a.m. ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 72.39 points, or 0.44 percent, at 16,341.04.The S&P 500 was down 9.09 points, or 0.47 percent, at 1,908.74 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 14.95 points, or 0.33 percent, at 4,472.59. Consumer stocks, especially retailers, fell after weak results from department store operator Nordstrom and sports apparel maker VF Corp.The reports follow disappointing holiday-quarter results from Wal-Mart on Thursday, which, along with falling oil prices, snapped a three-day rally on Wall Street.Nordstrom dropped 9 percent to $47.97 and VF Corp  was down 7.5 percent at $55.54.Applied Materials was up 7.5 percent at $18.47 on the chip equipment provider's buoyant forecast.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,120 to 497. On the Nasdaq, 1,374 issues fell and 771 advanced.The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded six new highs and 20 lows.

45,"  U.S. luxury fashion retailer Neiman Marcus Group Ltd LLC [NMRCUS.UL] reported a second straight quarterly drop in sales at its established stores amid a slowdown in spending on high-end goods.Sales at stores open more than a year fell 2.4 percent in the quarter ended Jan. 30, compared with a 5.6 percent rise a year earlier.A volatile stock market has curbed spending on high-end goods, while the strong dollar has hit spending by tourists, reducing sales at Tiffany's Inc (TIF.N) and Macy's (M.N) high-end Bloomingdale's chain, among others.Unseasonably warm weather also hurt holiday quarter sales at several high-end retailers, including Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N). Neiman Marcus had filed for an initial public offering in August last year. Reuters reported in October that the IPO had been pushed to 2016 due to volatile stock markets. The company's net income fell to $7.8 million in the second quarter from $27.8 million a year earlier, hurt by higher depreciation and other expenses.Revenue fell 2.3 percent to $1.49 billion.

46,"   By Ramkumar Iyer  Upscale jeweler Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) reported a better-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter as it raised prices and benefited from lower prices of diamonds, gold and silver.Shares of the company, which became a household name due to the 1961 Hollywood classic ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", rose as much as 4 percent in morning trading on Friday. Weakness in the global economy and a strong dollar have hurt Tiffany and other luxury retailers such as Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), Neiman Marcus Group and Macy's Inc-owned (M.N) Bloomingdale's as tourists shy away from buying high-end items.  Tiffany's reluctance to offer promotions also prevented it from attracting local shoppers looking for deals, especially in the holiday season. The company warned that it expected profit per share to fall by 15-20 percent in the current quarter and by 5-10 percent in the second quarter, based on the trends seen so far. However, earnings are expected to start growing from the second half of the year ending January 2017, Tiffany said.  The company will launch more new products and it has been pretty successful with recent product launches, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ""Also, expectations were low and the stock's been beat up,"" he said, suggesting that Friday's rise in Tiffany's shares was a relief rally after a fall of 18 percent in the past 12 months. The jeweler's gross margin rose to 63 percent in the fourth quarter from 60.8 percent a year earlier as raw material, labor and marketing costs declined.  However, sales fell 5.6 percent to $1.21 billion, the fifth straight quarter of decline. Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 10 percent in the Americas, a bigger drop than the 9.4 percent analysts had expected, according to Consensus Metrix. Tiffany sales have also slowed in Greater China as fewer Chinese tourists visit Hong Kong, one of its most important markets in the region, Mark Aaron, vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call. In Europe, sales to tourists are expected to fall due to sociopolitical uncertainties, Chief Executive Frederic Cumenal said. Tiffany's net income declined 17 percent to $163.2 million, or $1.28 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31.Excluding items, the company earned $1.46 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Tiffany's shares were up 2.7 percent at $72.02 in late morning trading.
