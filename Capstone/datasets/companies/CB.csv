8,"   By Avik Das  Chubb Corp (CB.N) lowered its full-year earnings forecast after severe weather in the United States and an unusually high number of fires led to bigger insurance payouts in the second quarter.The company's shares fell 3.5 percent in extended trading.The property and casualty insurer said it now expects to earn about $6.75-$6.95 per share in 2014, below its earlier forecast of $7.10-$7.40.Analysts on average were expecting $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The outlook for the remainder of the year was unchanged.     ""We reduced our guidance primarily because of our operating results in the first half of this year,"" a Chubb executive said on a post-earnings call. Chubb's second-quarter profit also missed estimates.""Our results this quarter were adversely impacted by catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses related to severe weather in the United States as well as an unusually high level of homeowners' and commercial fire losses,"" CEO John Finnegan said.Net profit fell about 14 percent to $499 million, or $2.03 per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, from $579 million, or $2.21 per share, a year earlier.  Losses and loss expenses widened 5.8 percent to $1.79 billion.""The losses are unlikely to move the needle on pricing in the space, given the recent lack of large-scale catastrophes,"" Macquarie Securities analyst Amit Kumar said.On an operating basis, the Warren, New Jersey-based insurer earned $1.70 per share, below the $1.90 analysts expected. Rival Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) also reported a steeper-than-expected fall in quarterly operating profit, hurt by bigger catastrophe losses and a slowing pace of premium rate increases. Chubb's net written premiums rose about 4 percent to $3.22 billion.Its combined loss-and-expense ratio fell to 90 percent from 88.8 percent. The ratio, an indicator of the total claims and expenses incurred over net earned premiums, crossing 100 percent shows the company has an underwriting loss.Shares of Chubb closed at $92.76 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

11,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings today affirmed all ratings for The  Chubb Corporation (NYSE: CB) (Chubb), including the 'AA-' Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) and 'A+' senior debt rating. Fitch has also affirmed the 'AA' Insurer  Financial Strength ratings (IFS) of Chubb's property/casualty insurance  subsidiaries, which are led by Federal Insurance Company (Federal). A full  rating list is shown below. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation of the current ratings reflect Chubb's market position as a  leading property/casualty insurer, history of favorable underwriting  performance, strong capital position at both the insurance subsidiary and parent  holding company levels, and conservative investment portfolio. Chubb's  operations are segmented into personal, commercial and specialty operations,  each of which has a track record of consistent, strong underwriting  profitability. The company's pretax operating income for the first half of 2014 was just over  $1 billion an approximate $400 million decline over the first half of 2013. The  deterioration was partly due to higher catastrophes and both lower favorable  reserve development and net investment income.  Chubb reported a consolidated GAAP underwriting combined ratio that deteriorated  to 91.6% for the first half of 2014 compared to an 86.7% in first half 2013. On  a segment basis personal lines underwriting results deteriorated the most in  first half of 2014 which was led by homeowners which experienced higher fire and  non-catastrophe weather related losses accounting for an almost 14 point  differential year-over-year. In spite of the elevated claims homeowners produced  an underwriting profit for the first half of 2014 as did all segments including  commercial property and marine which was heavily impacted by a combination of  large fire losses and some non-catastrophe weather related losses.  CB generated  a solid return on average equity of 12.3% for the first half 2014. The company's financial leverage ratio was 17.7% at June 30, 2014 equivalent to  the year-end 2013 level. Operating interest coverage remained strong at 10.9x  for the first half of 2014. Chubb has significant resources available for debt  servicing needs as the parent holding company held approximately $2 billion of  cash and other liquid assets at June 30, 2014. Chubb's insurance subsidiary  capital adequacy as measured by risk based capital, traditional operating  leverage metrics, and Prism remains 'Very Strong'. Chubb's debt ratings currently benefit from narrower notching from the IFS  rating due to lower leverage, strong interest coverage, and significant  liquidity at the holding company. The existing debt ratings are sensitive to  future increases in financial leverage or reductions in debt servicing capacity. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to consideration of a downgrade of Chubb's debt and IDR  ratings include: --Reduction in holding company liquid investments to less than $1 billion,  sustained reductions in statutory fixed charge coverage below 5x-6x, or a  sustained decline in GAAP interest coverage below 9x. Factors that could lead to consideration of a ratings downgrade include: --A significant level of near-term earnings volatility which is outside the  historical average; --A material weakening of operating company capital quality, through either a  deterioration in reserve or asset quality. Factors that could lead to an upgrade include: --A material increase in capital strength such that GAAP operating leverage was  0.7x or lower accompanied by a Prism score of 'Extremely Strong'. However, given  publicly traded companies' sensitivity around managing capital, this level of  capitalization is unlikely. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: The Chubb Corporation --IDR at 'AA-';  --5.75% senior notes due May 2018 at 'A+'; --6.6% notes due August 2018 at 'A+';  --6.8% debentures due November 2031 at 'A+';  --6% senior notes due 2037 at 'A+'; --6.5% senior notes due May 2038 at 'A+';  --6.375% junior subordinated debentures due 2067 at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'.

16,"  Chubb helps Georgia race past Louisville in Belk BowlCHARLOTTE, N.C. - Not much more than a year ago, Nick Chubb was a dazzling performer in high school football.A different platform hasn't slowed him down.It showed as Chubb earned Belk Bowl Most Valuable Player honors and ran for a Georgia bowl-record 266 yards in a 37-14 victory over No. 20 Louisville at Bank of America Stadium on Tuesday.""I did a lot in high school, but it's a whole different animal up here,? Chubb said. ""I try to take advantage of all opportunities. It wouldn?t happen without the rest of the team.""Chubb carried a season-high 33 times as the thirteenth-ranked Bulldogs finished 10-3. Chubb had a 30-yard sprint and an 8-yard touchdown scamper with 2:02 left.""That last touchdown I was tired, but I got it in there,"" he said. ""You score, you get off the field.""Chubb finished 17 yards shy of Herschel Walker's single-game school record set against Vanderbilt in 1980.Georgia starting quarterback Hutson Mason did his damage in the first half. After completing 10-of-15 passes for 148 yards, Mason didn't play in the second half because of vision issues.Chubb's 82-yard run -- a Belk Bowl record -- on the first play after a punt pinned the Bulldogs at their 3-yard line set up running back Sony Michel's 2-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.""He showed everyone in the country that he's pretty talented and a tough kid,"" Georgia coach Mark Richt. ""We know Nick is a great player. Kind of the timing of when Nick took over, he had to carry that rock a bunch. So going into this game, it wasn't a mystery that he was going to be able to do something like this.""Chubb finished with 1,547 yards this season, taking a major role after touted Todd Gurley's suspension and season-ending injury. Chubb also kept the Cardinals off balance. ""He's hard to tackle,"" Louisville coach Bobby Petrino said. ""There were a number of times we had numbers there and he made them miss.""Chubb's performance was a boost to the entire group of Bulldogs, who reached double digit wins for the 21st time in school history.""Anytime you can get that yardage, that's something you take pride in,"" Georgia center David Andrews said.By the end, the Bulldogs had 505 yards of total offense. For the season, Georgia posted a school-record 537 points.""The plays are good if they execute them and they did,"" Richt said. ""We can run the football and we weren't going to shy away from it."" Georgia's Marshall Morgan kicked three field goals, including a 41-yarder with 5:20 remaining.Georgia safety Dominick Sanders intercepted two passes. Bulldogs safety Damian Swann picked off a fourth-quarter pass one play after Louisville's defense made a fourth-down stop.Georgia also lost safety Quincy Mauger to a second-quarter concussion and receiver Michael Bennett to a third-quarter knee injury.The Bulldogs converted on 12 of 18 third-down snaps.""We couldn't get off the field on third down and that really hurt us throughout the night,"" Petrino said. Louisville (9-4), completing its first season as an Atlantic Coast Conference member, couldn't crank up enough offense after scoring at least 30 points in its last five regular-season games.Cardinals running back Brandon Radcliff scored on a 6-yard touchdown run in the third quarter on a 10-play drive. Senior receiver DeVante Parker notched eight catches for 120 receiving yards, eclipsing 100 yards for the 10th time in his career.Georgia, which led 20-7 at halftime, put together a strong second quarter, taking the lead on Morgan's 41-yard field goal. Chubb's tackle-breaking, 31-yard touchdown run pushed the lead to 17-7 with 6:40 left in the first half.Sanders made a 40-yard interception return to set up the Bulldogs at the Louisville 9. This time, Georgia settled for Morgan's 22-yard field goal with 4:58 remaining.Georgia got the ball back at the Louisville 31 when punter Ryan Johnson's fourth-down pass on a fake punt was underthrown. On the next play, Cardinals cornerback Terell Floyd intercepted backup Ramsey's pass at the Louisville 3.Earlier, Georgia cashed in on its first possession with a touchdown as receiver Chris Conley caught a 44-yard touchdown strike from Mason. That capped an eight-play, 90-yard drive.Louisville's first scoring drive went 84 yards, with the highlight coming on tight end Gerald Christian's one-handed grab in the back of the end zone of a Kyle Bolin pass. It came on a third-and-goal play from the Georgia 11.The Cardinals completed only 21 of 44 passes as Bolin finished with 300 passing yards while completing 20-of-40 passes.""When you call plays and somebody is covered, you have to throw the ball away,"" Petrino said. ""Our young quarterbacks will learn a lot from watching (footage) of this game. Our inexperience showed up a little bit.""NOTES: This was the first meeting between Georgia and Louisville. ... For the first time, there was a Top 25 matchup in the Belk Bowl's 13-year history. ... It's a new era for the Belk Bowl by adding the Southeastern Conference providing one of the teams. ... Louisville lost to North Carolina State in the 2011 Belk Bowl. ... This is Georgia's 50th bowl game, with its first postseason outing in Charlotte. The Bulldogs improved to 28-19-3. ... This was Georgia's third ACC opponent of the season, opening by defeating Clemson and closing the regular season with a loss to Georgia Tech. ... Both teams posted November victories against Kentucky. ... Louisville RB Michael Dyer was removed from the team's bowl roster because of academic issues. ... In days leading to the game, Georgia announced that standout RB Todd Gurley is entering the NFL Draft. He has been out with a knee injury, preventing him from playing in his home state's bowl.",2014-12-31,CB,"Tue Dec 30, 2014 | 10:32pm EST",Chubb helps Georgia race past Louisville in Belk Bowl,http://www.reuters.com//article/fbc-georgia-louisville-writethru-idUSMTZEACVFFZCGR20141231?type=companyNews

23,"   By Richa Naidu and Avik Das  Swiss insurance giant ACE Ltd (ACE.N) will buy upmarket property insurer Chubb Corp (CB.N) for $28.3 billion to get access to wealthy clients who pay higher premiums at a time when fierce competition has cut deeply into the industry's profit margins.The takeover, the biggest ever in the insurance sector, will create the world's largest property and casualty insurer by underwriting income.Rock-bottom catastrophe insurance premiums, the rise of catastrophe bonds, low interest rates and stiff competition have prompted a wave of acquisitions among underwriters.Chubb shares rose to a record high of $129.31, above the offer price of about $124.13, suggesting some investors see potential for a rival bid. ACE shares rose 5.3 percent.Potential rival bidders include Allianz (ALVG.DE), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), AXA SA (AXAF.PA) and Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N), Wells Fargo analyst John Hall wrote in a note.The combined company, which will adopt Chubb's name, will be led by ACE Chief Executive Evan Greenberg, the son of AIG (AIG.N) ex-chief Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg. The new company will operate in more markets with less exposure to property and casualty insurance and the deal will be double-digit accretive within three years, Evan Greenberg said on a call on Wednesday.The combined company is expected to save about $650 million in annual costs by 2018, he said.The deal, at a premium of 30 percent to Chubb's closing price on Tuesday, is the largest insurance takeover in an industry that rarely sees such high price tags. Zurich-based ACE has been on an acquisition spree under Greenberg.  ACE bought Allianz's Fireman's Fund personal insurance unit for $365 million in December and Itau Unibanco Holding SA's high-risk corporate insurance business for about $680 million last July.Reuters reported in November, citing sources, that ACE was also interested in buying the pension and insurance arms of Turkey's state-run Halkbank.Chubb shareholders will receive $62.93 in cash and 0.6019 ACE share for each share held. ACE, with operations in 54 countries, plans to issue $5.3 billion of senior notes to partly fund the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.Chubb CEO John Finnegan will be the combined company's executive vice chairman for external affairs for North America.Morgan Stanley & Co LLC was ACE's financial adviser and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP its legal counsel. Guggenheim Securities LLC was Chubb's financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz its legal counsel.

24,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Insurer Financial  Strength ratings (IFS) of The Chubb Corporation's (NYSE: CB) (Chubb)  property/casualty insurance subsidiaries, which are led by Federal Insurance  Company (Federal) at 'AA' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also placed Chubb's  'AA-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'A+' senior debt rating on Rating Watch  Negative. A full rating list is shown below.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's rating action follows the announcement today that ACE Limited (ACE; 'AA'  IFS) and CB have entered into a definitive agreement whereby ACE will purchase  all outstanding shares of Chubb for $29 billion with a combination of cash,  debt, and equity, or approximately a 30% premium relative to yesterday's closing  stock price for CB. The close is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2016,  subject to regulatory approvals and CB shareholder approvals. Fitch's affirmation of Chubb's IFS ratings reflect a proposed combination of two  large insurance organizations with strong, well capitalized operating  franchises, and a history of favourable underwriting performance and  profitability.  Both ACE's and Chubb's operating performance consistently exceeds peers,  characterized by low combined ratios with manageable catastrophe losses,  consistent favorable loss reserve development and stable investment income from  strong operating cash flow. For the five-year period 2010-2014, ACE's average  consolidated GAAP combined ratio was 91% and the operating return on equity was  12%. Chubb's average combined ratio and operating return on equity for the same  period was 91% and 13% respectively. The Rating Watch Negative on Chubb's holding company IDR reflects that holding  company ratings currently have narrower notching from the IFS ratings due to a  history of high GAAP fixed charge coverage and a substantial holding company  cash and investment position.  Following the closing, the new combined entity will have higher financial  leverage, lower pro forma GAAP fixed charge coverage and liquidity than Chubb's  current position. Under proposed changes in Fitch's technical notching criteria,  the combined ACE-Chubb entity is likely to have a traditional three notch  difference between the IFS and senior debt ratings that is standard for an  organization with a high percentage of U.S. based operation and assets, or a  wide geographic spread of operations and assets. Resolution of the Rating Watch  will coincide with the closing of the transaction or implementation of Fitch's  new notching criteria.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch notes that if the acquisition occurs CB's holding company ratings would  likely be lowered by one notch to standard notching as Fitch anticipates reduced  near term holding company liquidity and GAAP earnings based fixed charge  coverage. Should this acquisition fail to materialize Fitch would likely affirm  CB's ratings. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following IFS ratings at 'AA' with a Stable Outlook: --Chubb Atlantic Indemnity Ltd.;  --Chubb Custom Insurance Co; --Chubb Indemnity Insurance Co.;  --Chubb Insurance Company of Australia Ltd.; --Chubb Insurance Company of Canada;  --Chubb Insurance Company of Europe, S.E.; --Chubb Insurance Company of New Jersey; --Chubb Lloyds Insurance Company of Texas; --Chubb National Insurance Co.; --Federal Insurance Company; --Great Northern Insurance Co.; --Pacific Indemnity Co.; --Executive Risk Indemnity, Inc.;  --Executive Risk Specialty Insurance Co.; --Texas Pacific Indemnity Company; --Vigilant Insurance Co.

25,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AA' Insurer Financial  Strength (IFS) ratings of ACE Limited's (NYSE: ACE) insurance subsidiaries with  a Stable Rating Outlook. Fitch has also placed the ACE holding company ratings,  including the 'AA-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'A+' senior debt rating on  Rating Watch Negative. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. Fitch last affirmed all of ACE's ratings with a Stable Outlook on March 9, 2015. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's rating action follows the announcement today that ACE and The Chubb  Corporation (Chubb; 'AA' IFS) have entered into a definitive agreement whereby  ACE will purchase all outstanding shares of Chubb for $28.3 billion with a  combination of cash, debt, and equity, or approximately a 30% premium relative  to yesterday's closing stock price for CB. The acquisition is expected to close  in the first quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. Fitch's affirmation of ACE's IFS ratings reflect a proposed combination of two  large insurance organizations with strong, well-capitalized operating  franchises, and a history of favorable underwriting performance and  profitability. ACE's North America premium exposure will increase to roughly 66%  of total net premiums written from 56% as the acquisition adds Chubb  underwriting portfolio and expertise in several segments, including:  professional liability, middle market commercial lines, and personal lines.  Both ACE's and Chubb's operating performance consistently exceeds peers,  characterized by low combined ratios with manageable catastrophe losses,  consistent favorable loss reserve development and stable investment income from  strong operating cash flow. For the five-year period 2010-2014, ACE's average  consolidated GAAP combined ratio was 91% and the operating return on equity was  12%. Chubb's average combined ratio and operating return on equity for the same  period was 91% and 13% respectively. The Rating Watch Negative relating to ACE's holding company and debt ratings  reflects pending changes in Fitch's technical notching criteria, as well as the  company's higher pro forma financial leverage and lower interest coverage  post-acquisition.  ACE's debt ratings benefit from narrower notching relative to the IFS ratings  due to ACE's significant amount of capital, dividends, and earnings held and  generated in Bermuda, which is heading towards a Solvency 2-style group  regulation approach. Post-acquisition, ACE will be less Bermuda-focused and have  an increased U.S. market presence. Under the proposed notching criteria changes,  holding companies with U.S. focused operations or assets and capital distributed  widely across multiple countries are more likely to maintain a traditional three  notch difference between IFS ratings and holding company senior debt ratings.  ACE's financial leverage ratio (FLR) (total debt to capital excluding FAS 115  unrealized gains and losses) as of March 31, 2015 was 19.9%, which included  nearly $2 billion of pre-funded debt to be repaid in 2015, 2017, and 2018. Fitch  estimates the pro forma FLR at closing will increase to roughly 26% primarily as  a result of increased debt (both newly issued and assumed from Chubb) which  remains consistent with Fitch's median sector credit factors for the current  rating category. After the repayment of $700 million pre-funded debt in November  2015, the pro forma FLR would decrease to 25%. Financial leverage is likely to  decline due to near term debt maturities and future retained earnings growth.  ACE's operating interest coverage (excluding realized investment gains) was  favorable at approximately 15x in both 2014 and 2013. Post-acquisition, Fitch  expects coverage to be lower in the high-single digits due to higher near term  debt levels and interest expense. The new combined entity is anticipated to have  favorable debt servicing capacity from operating subsidiary dividend capacity  and other liquidity sources. While ACE has demonstrated past success in executing successful acquisitions,  Fitch believes there is significant uncertainty related to integration risk and  realization of anticipated cost savings from a transaction of this magnitude.  Resolution of the Rating Watch is anticipated to coincide with the closing of  the transaction, or implementation of Fitch's new notching criteria. Fitch  recently published an exposure draft of proposed changes to insurance notching  criteria. Fitch notes that, regardless of the transaction, if the new notching  criteria proposed by Fitch are made final, Fitch would expect to downgrade ACE's  IDR, debt, and hybrid ratings by one notch. Additionally, Fitch expects to  upgrade operating subsidiary ACE Reinsurance (Switzerland) Limited's IFS rating  by one notch to 'AA', reflecting anticipated notching criteria changes.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch expects to update rating sensitivities upon acquisition closing. Key  current rating triggers that may lead to an upgrade include: --Generating a combined ratio consistently under 85%;  --Maintained growth in stockholders' equity that corresponds with premium and  asset growth; --A reduction in financial leverage to a run-rate level of 15% or lower; --Operating earnings-based interest and preferred dividend coverage at or above  15x; --Movement in ACE's retention ratio (net premium written to gross premium  written) to increase over time to be more in line with highly-rated peers; --Continuing a track record of successful acquisition execution. Key rating triggers that may lead to a downgrade include: --A sustained material deterioration in operating performance such that the  combined ratio is consistently less profitable at over 95%;  --A significant reduction in stockholders' equity that is not recovered in the  near term;  --Increases in financial leverage to a sustained level of over 25%.  Any future acquisitions and the associated integration risks and company profile  changes could lead to pressure on the ratings, upward or downward, depending on  the nature and size of the acquisition and corresponding integration risks.

28,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed all the ratings for ACE  Limited and its subsidiaries (ACE) and the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS)  ratings for The Chubb Corporation (Chubb) operating subsidiaries. Fitch has  downgraded Chubb's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A+' from 'AA-' and downgraded  all other holding company obligations one notch. The Rating Outlook for all  ratings is Stable. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS ACE's acquisition of Chubb for roughly $29.5 billion closed Jan. 14, 2016. The  combined company is now known as Chubb Limited. On July 1, 2015, ACE announced  that the company and Chubb had entered into a definitive agreement whereby ACE  would purchase all outstanding shares of Chubb with a combination of cash, debt,  and equity, or approximately a 30% premium relative to the prior day closing  stock price for Chubb.  Fitch views the transaction favorably due to the increased size and scale of the  combined entity which is estimated to write roughly $32 billion in global net  premium with a historical five year average combined ratio of near 90%. ACE has  demonstrated past success in executing successful acquisitions which mitigates  integration risk; however, the size and complexity of the Chubb acquisition  represents a unique challenge and it will take time to realize the anticipated  cost savings from this acquisition.  The combined company's rating strengths include a strong balance sheet position  and financial flexibility with moderate leverage and diverse sources of revenues  and earnings with the advantages of increased global size and scale and strong  management teams.  ACE's North America premium volume will increase to roughly 66% of total net  premiums written from 56% as the acquisition adds Chubb's underwriting portfolio  and expertise in several segments, including: professional liability, middle  market commercial lines, and personal lines.  The rating downgrade of Chubb's holding company and debt ratings reflects  technical consideration under Fitch's criteria as the former Chubb holding  company received narrower notching due to larger committed holding company cash  levels and higher operating interest coverage than the holding company of the  newly combined companies. The ratings now align with the new parent and reflect  Chubb's core status.  Both ACE and Chubb's operating performance consistently exceeds peers,  characterized by low combined ratios with manageable catastrophe losses,  consistent favorable loss reserve development and stable investment income from  strong operating cash flow. For the five-year period 2010 - 2014, ACE's average  GAAP combined ratio was 91% and the operating return on equity was 12%. Chubb's  average combined ratio and return on equity was 91% and 13%, respectively. To fund this transaction ACE raised $5.3 billion in debt and $15 billion in  equity plus cash dividends. Fitch estimates the pro forma financial leverage  ratio (FLR) (total debt to capital excluding FAS 115 unrealized gains and  losses) at closing has increased to roughly 24%, primarily as a result of the  increased debt (both newly issued and assumed from Chubb), which remains  consistent with Fitch's median sector credit factors for the current rating  category. Financial leverage is anticipated to decline over time due to  near-term debt maturities and future retained earnings growth.  Operating interest coverage (excluding realized investment gains) was favorable  and consistent at roughly 15x through nine months 2015 and in both 2014 and  2013. Post-acquisition, Fitch expects coverage to be lower in the high-single  digits due to higher near-term debt levels and interest expense. The new  combined entity is anticipated to have favorable debt servicing capacity from  operating subsidiary dividend capacity, earnings, and other liquidity sources. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key current rating triggers that may lead to an upgrade include: --Given increased market position size and scale, demonstration of continued  strong operating performance consistent with the individual performance of the  former ACE and Chubb entities; --A reduction in financial leverage to a run-rate level of approximately 20%; --Operating earnings-based interest and preferred dividend coverage  approximating 15x; Key rating triggers that may lead to a downgrade include: --A material deterioration in operating performance such that the combined ratio  is consistently less profitable at over 95%;  --A significant reduction in stockholders' equity that is not recovered in the  near term;  --Increase in financial leverage ratio to a sustained level of over 27%; --Failure to execute acquisition integration plans as expected resulting in  material economic impact on the company.

30,"   By Jim Finkle  Insurer Chubb Ltd said on Wednesday it has added coverage to help U.S. victims of cyber bullying pay for costs, including mental health treatment, legal expenses and lost wages.The company said it added $60,000 of cyber bullying coverage to its U.S. Masterpiece Family Protection policy, a $70-a-year add-on. The insurance already covers threats including stalking, carjacking, home invasion, air rage, hijacking and child abduction. Chubb added the coverage amid unprecedented public awareness of cyber bullying.

56,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A+' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Chubb Limited and the 'AA' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS)  rating of its insurance operating subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook for all  ratings is Stable. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS On Jan. 14, 2016 Chubb Limited was created when legacy ACE acquired legacy Chubb  for approximately $29.5 billion, creating one of the largest non-life insurance  companies in the world.  Fitch views the transaction favorably due to the increased size and scale of the  combined entity which is estimated to write roughly $36 billion in global gross  written premiums with a little over one-third coming from outside the United  States. Legacy ACE demonstrated past success in executing successful  acquisitions, but the size and complexity of the Chubb acquisition represents a  unique challenge. However, the company recently raised its run rate integration  savings estimate by $50 million to $800 million by the end of 2018. The combined company's rating strengths include a strong balance sheet position  and financial flexibility with moderate leverage and diverse sources of revenues  and earnings with the advantages of increased global size and scale and strong  management teams.  Both legacy ACE and legacy Chubb's operating performance consistently exceeded  peers, characterized by low combined ratios with manageable catastrophe losses,  consistent favorable loss reserve development and stable investment income from  strong operating cash flow. However, past performance is no indication of future  success.  For analytical purposes Fitch utilizes pro forma 2016 figures that treat the  acquisition as if it took place on Jan. 1 instead of Jan. 14. With almost nine  months of combined operations, net written premiums were $22 billion, down about  3% from prior year period on a constant dollar basis. The calendar year combined  ratio YTD 2016 remains favorable at 88.2%, relatively flat compared to 87.6% for  the prior year period. To fund this transaction legacy ACE raised $5.3 billion in debt and about $15  billion in equity plus cash dividends. Stated financial leverage was 22% as of  Sept. 30, 2016, which is consistent with rating tolerances.  Operating fixed charge coverage was 9.0 times (x) as of Sept. 30, 2016, which is  lower than historical averages due to the higher debt load but still in line  with rating expectations. The new combined entity is anticipated to have  favorable debt servicing capacity from operating subsidiary dividend capacity,  earnings, and other liquidity sources. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key current rating triggers that may lead to an upgrade include: --Given increased market position size and scale, demonstration of continued  strong operating performance consistent with the individual performance of  legacy entities; --A reduction in financial leverage to a run-rate level of approximately 20% or  lower; --Operating fixed charge coverage approximating 15x; Key rating triggers that may lead to a downgrade include: --A material deterioration in operating performance such that the combined ratio  is consistently less profitable at over 95%;  --A significant reduction in stockholders' equity that is not recovered in the  near term;  --Increase in financial leverage ratio to a sustained level of over 27%; --Failure to execute acquisition integration plans as expected resulting in  material economic impact on the company.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.

Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent).
