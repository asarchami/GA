""There has been no progress in narrowing these differences recently, and thus we are well away from an agreement,"" IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters.U.S. retail sales increased 1.2 percent in May, topping the 1.1 percent growth expected by economists, as households boosted purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods even as they paid a bit more for gasoline.Solid retail sales data followed robust job growth numbers and stabilizing manufacturing activity, suggesting the economy was gaining momentum after getting off to a slow start in the second quarter.""I think the upward revisions in March and April are more important because they show that consumers are showing up and spending money,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. At 11:23 a.m. ET (1523 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 48.15 points, or 0.27 percent, at 18,048.55, the S&P 500 was up 3.59 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,108.79 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 4.73 points, or 0.09 percent, at 5,081.41.Eight of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the utilities index's 0.66 percent rise leading the gains.The Fed has said it will raise rates only when it sees a rebound in the economy after growth came to a standstill in the first quarter.Economists and top Wall Street banks expect the Fed to raise rates in September, which would be the central bank's first hike in almost a decade and finally mark a turn in the direction of the flow of easy money that has driven world stocks and bond prices to record highs in recent years. The World Bank on Wednesday joined the International Monetary Fund in urging the U.S. Federal Reserve to hold off on a rate hike until next year to avoid worsening exchange rate volatility and crimping global growth.""It's the U.S. Fed, not the world Fed, and they're going to do what they think is right,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.The Fed will be keen to raise rates at least once this year before the U.S. presidential races heats up in 2016, she said.Citrix Systems rose 7.1 percent to $70.72 after shareholder Elliott Management said the software maker should sell some units, cut costs and buy back shares.Krispy Kreme soared 12.6 percent to $19.59 after the doughnut chain raised the bottom end of its 2016 profit forecast.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,671 to 1,225.

16,"   By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis  Citrix Systems Inc (CTXS.O), the U.S. cloud computing company targeted by activist hedge fund Elliott Management, is making a final attempt to sell itself as a whole before it embarks on asset sales, according to people familiar with the matter. Citrix, which had attracted the interest of private equity investors before it agreed in July to give Elliott a seat on its board of directors, is having new conversations with buyout firms, the people said this week.The company, which has a market capitalization of $11.6 billion, has also reached out to other technology firms to solicit interest, including Dell Inc[DI.UL], the computer maker that was taken private two years ago by its founder Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP, the people added.Citrix announced in July it would explore strategic alternatives for its GoTo family of products, including videoconferencing and desktop sharing service GoToMeeting. However, a sale process for these assets has not started yet because Citrix wants to see if it can still sell itself at a satisfactory valuation, according to the sources. If Citrix does not sell itself in its entirety, it will not just seek to sell or spin off its GoTo products, but it will also explore options for other assets down the line, according to the sources.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Citrix, Dell and Silver Lake declined to comment.Based in Santa Clara, California, Citrix provides communications software and networking solutions for businesses. It reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013. Earlier this year, Elliott called on Citrix to sell some units, cut costs and buy back shares to make up for six years of underperformance. In addition to the GoTo business, Elliott has called for Citrix to explore the sale of NetScaler, which helps speed up Web-based applications.Elliott clinched a deal with Citrix in July that gave Jesse Cohn, one of its senior partners, a seat on the company's board. Citrix also said it would start a search for an independent board member, mutually agreeable to Citrix and Elliott. It also said at the time that Chief Executive Mark Templeton was retiring and that it would search for a new CEO.Earlier this month, Citrix said it would repurchase up to an additional $500 million of its common stock.

""I think some investors could be a bit disappointed as they were hoping for a sale of the GoTo piece as well as ultimately a sale of the business,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.

Ives, who values the GoTo business at $3.5 billion to $4 billion, said Citrix might sell different business units and the company as a whole could be an acquisition candidate after the restructuring.   Elliott had also called for Citrix to explore the sale of NetScaler, which helps speed up Web-based applications. The company said on Tuesday it would stop investing in certain programs and products and shut down non-core products.The job cuts do not include the impact of the spinoff, the company said on Tuesday.The company said it expects about $200 million in annualized pre-tax cost savings, 75 percent of which is likely to be in 2016.  Citrix also said it would incur pretax charges of about $65 million-$85 million related to the job cuts in the fourth quarter of 2015 and fiscal 2016.Most of the restructuring would be done in November and in January, the company said.Citrix also said it expects a 1-2 percent net revenue growth for the year ending December 31 with an adjusted earnings of $4.40-$4.50 per share.Ives said the restructuring was a move towards a more positive path of growth and especially higher operating margin.
