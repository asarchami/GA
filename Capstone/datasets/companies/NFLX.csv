0,"   By Liana B. Baker  U.S. cable and satellite television operators, already locking horns with programmers over subscriber fees, are now squaring off over the mobile apps that viewers are increasingly using to watch TV.Internet-based services such as Netflix Inc have gotten millions of viewers accustomed to catching shows on tablets and phones. And as the incumbents are getting in on the act with apps of their own, that has become a sticking point dragging out major programming negotiations, as in the case of Dish Network Corp and Walt Disney Co, which are trying to reach a new rights agreement.These disputes increase the dangers of further blackouts and may mean delays in the development of apps that combine the content, technology and marketing muscle of both sides of the industry.Missteps by cable and satellite operators also raise the danger that some consumers will rely more on Netflix, and other such services, and cancel their pay-TV subscriptions, causing a major drop in industry revenue. Meanwhile, both sides are scrambling to draw consumers to their apps and get the most appealing and profitable deals in place for the future.Attendees at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week will sample apps across a range of mobile and connected TVs. Dish will show off a new version of its ""Dish Anywhere"" app, which enables live viewing and lets users transfer shows from their DVR to mobile devices and watch them offline, a feature that has upset media companies.And it is not just Dish: Time Warner Cable Inc, Comcast Corp, DirecTV and Verizon FiOs have all created apps in recent years, while the largest content companies, including Disney, Viacom Inc and Time Warner Inc's HBO and Turner Broadcasting System, have countered with their own.""Both sides are paranoid. The operators think that if the programmers can create a one-to-one relationship with the consumer, some day they peel off and become their own HBO,"" said an executive at a media company involved in content negotiations who was not authorized to talk to the media.Among the areas being fought over are advertising revenue and user data. Ad sales on the platforms are still small and hard to estimate, but revenue is expected to grow as more viewing moves to mobile devices, said Jeff Minsky, director of emerging media at media agency OMD. Both sides are trying to figure out the best way to split that revenue.Media companies also want to gather and crunch all the data about viewing habits they can to sell to advertisers. The companies receive less high quality data when people watch network programming through an app from Dish Network or DirecTV instead of using their own apps. ""The fight is in the details. Who is controlling the user experience, who is controlling the data and where is the experience taking place?"" said another person involved in programming negotiations.'FIND IT ELSEWHERE' Executives worry that not adapting to changing habits could send viewers away from cable altogether. Needham research analyst Laura Martin, citing PWC figures, estimates that in 2012 consumers paid $75 billion to U.S. pay-TV providers, $45 billion of which was reaped by content companies while $30 billion was kept by cable, satellite and telecommunications companies offering the TV services.""There's no question more and more people will continue to consume whatever content they are looking for on a variety of devices, not just the television set. If we are not evolving and providing our content in the way people want to consume it, then people will find it elsewhere,"" said ESPN's senior vice president of digital distribution, Matt Murphy, who oversees the business side of Disney's viewing apps.Apps from cable operators and programmers have the same goal in mind - to demonstrate the value of a cable or satellite subscription. But in the quest to show that cable subscriptions are worth the money, both sides end up competing to lure the consumer to different apps that feature the same content. Sports fans, for example, need to choose between the WatchESPN app or Comcast's Xfinity TV GO app to watch the same programs.There's also fear from operators that if programming providers build up large audiences through their own apps, they could one day go ""over the top"" or dispense with cable. One of the most closely watched issues in pay TV is when popular streaming service HBO Go will go direct to consumer.Deals on programming last several years, so negotiations have to address how people might watch TV five or 10 years from now. One large media company was pushing for clauses to protect its apps in case a cable company one day adopted usage-based Internet pricing, according to people familiar with the matter.If cable companies one day make customers pay for how much broadband Internet they use at home, they could offer use of their own TV viewing apps free to customers, which would give them an edge over the apps made by media companies. Some are trying to bridge the gap. The third-largest U.S. cable company, Cox Communications Inc, offers ""Contour,"" a well-reviewed iPad app that integrates 30 apps within it, the only offering on the market so far to keep all the apps under one roof.APP OVERLOAD When TV viewers want to use an app to watch a show, they are likely to turn to channels and networks they know, such as WatchESPN, WATCH ABC or HBO Go, said David Wolf, managing director of Accenture's digital service practice in North America, whose firm has been gathering research on viewing from a global consumer survey of 12,000 consumers.To be sure, usage of these apps is still small compared with how many people watch TV the traditional way. But it is growing quickly. The ""Watch ESPN"" app is available in 55 million U.S. homes and has been downloaded 24 million times, ESPN said, and minutes viewed on the app on mobile devices is up more than 6.5 times from two years ago.The next place viewers turn to are apps that do not require a cable subscription, such as Netflix or Hulu, Wolf said. Only then, in third place, will viewers turn to apps made by their cable or satellite company, he said.One hurdle facing the world of media apps is that users often need to figure out their cable account information to log in. But it's getting easier. Some operators are letting customers use Facebook credentials or a phone number to sign in while cable operators are working on technology for automatic authentication so a viewer does not have to sign in at all.Simonette Lowy, a 26-year-old fashion designer in Los Angeles who uses DirecTV's app to set her DVR recordings, said with so much choice out there, it is hard to know which apps have best streaming quality or carry which shows.""Why are there so many? It's too much. People just want everything in one place,"" Lowy said.(Reporting by Liana B.

1,"  SAN FRANCISCO Battery Ventures has lured away Adrian Cockcroft, the engineer who remade Netflix's streaming-entertainment service, to become the venture-capital firm's first technology fellow.Cockcroft will help Battery advise and evaluate companies and formulate investment theses, said Mike Dauber, a principal at Battery, in a blog post on Tuesday. While Cockcroft will play a role in sourcing deals, he won't be a partner.In his own blog post, Cockcroft said he would counsel large enterprise companies who want to work more in the cloud-- using remote computers that work over the Internet rather than proprietary centralized computers. In Netflix's case, Cockcroft moved its streaming entertainment to Amazon's cloud platform. Hiring entrepreneurs-in-residence is a common practice in Silicon Valley, where venture capital firms see it as a way to foster the next big start-up. But Cockcroft's role as technology fellow is different because while EIRs typically stay for 6-12 months, Cockcroft will stay with Battery long term, Dauber wrote. Bringing Cockcroft into the fold underscores Battery's commitment to enterprise computing. Its prior investments include Akamai, an Internet delivery network, and Omniture, the online marketing and web analytics business acquired by Adobe. Last year, Battery raised $900 million to invest, including its $650 million Battery X fund.(Reporting by Sarah McBride; editing by Andrew Hay)",2014-01-07,NFLX,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 3:11pm EST",Battery Ventures lands Netflix executive Cockcroft,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-batteryventures-cockcroft-idUSBREA0613120140107?type=companyNews

3,"  (Amends spelling in second paragraph to ""Netflix"" instead of ""Neflix"")LAS VEGAS Jan 6 Amazon.com Inc is teaming up with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and major media corporations including Warner Bros and Lionsgate  to popularize ""4K"" ultra high-definition television.Amazon, whose Instant Video service serves up thousands of movies and TV programs in direct competition with Netflix Inc , did not outline specifics on their collaboration in a Monday announcement.But Samsung and other consumer electronics makers are hoping that 4K TV - so-called because they are said to offer four times the resolution of conventional high-definition images - will take off as a format and recharge sales. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the South Korean tech giant said in a separate statement it also will work with other content distributors, including Netflix and cable operators Comcast and DirecTV, on promoting 4K TV.Amazon, for its part, has been investing heavily in digital media, hoping to draw traffic and drive new sales as consumers increasingly spurn traditional TV offerings in favor of on-demand content. Ultra high-def TV has been slow to take off, partly because of the high cost of the new-fangled displays and insufficient content. High-definition television took years to become mainstream, after TV prices came down and content became more widely available.Netflix has said the second season of its popular political drama ""House of Cards"" was shot and will be available in ultra high-def, becoming one of the first major TV series to take advantage of the technology. ""There are a number of elements that need to work together to create a true 4K experience for customers,"" Bill Carr, Amazon vice president of digital video and music, said in a statement.""You need great content and compatible devices, but you also need a service that can deliver that content to your devices so that it plays beautifully.""In Monday's announcement, Amazon also named 20th Century Fox  and Discovery among its media partners. It added that it will film all original series slated for 2014 in 4K ultra high-def.

7,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Jan 17 Any expansion by cable provider Comcast, including a deal with Charter Communications to split provider Time Warner Cable between them, would get a tough review from U.S. regulators, who might use the proposal to force Internet providers to treat all traffic equally, antitrust experts said.Charter Communications Inc reached out to Comcast Corp this week about teaming up to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, according to people familiar with the matter.Comcast is the top U.S. cable provider and video provider, Time Warner Cable is No. 2 and Charter is the fourth largest.The Federal Communications Commission and U.S. antitrust authorities will closely scrutinize any deal between the companies since it would involve a vast range of content, video, cable and telephony.But ultimately the government would be unlikely to try to stop a deal, said Robert Doyle, an antitrust expert at Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, who argued that some antitrust concerns could probably be remedied by strategic asset sales.""We don't think this is one that rises to the level of a challenge,"" he said, referring to a lawsuit that the Justice Department could file to stop a deal. Antitrust experts agreed, however, that any approval - particularly for Comcast - would almost certainly come with strings attached.In particular, the FCC could require the companies to treat all traffic the same, which means that companies such as Comcast with lots of content would be deterred from charging customers more if they watch movies or shows owned by other providers, such as Netflix Inc.That is no small matter. Netflix's share price fell following Tuesday's decision by U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to reject federal ""net neutrality"" rules that required Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally. Antitrust expert Jacqueline Grise of the law firm Cooley LLP said there was no guarantee a deal would be approved. The merger proposal would get a careful look from antitrust regulators, but the companies might craft a ""creative solution"" to satisfy the government, she said.The net neutrality condition is similar to one that Comcast was required to agree to in order to win approval for a $30 billion deal to take control of NBC Universal in 2011. Those conditions expire in 2018.Or, again echoing a condition in the 2011 deal, regulators could require Comcast to make content available to online providers, said Grise. Harold Feld of the group Public Knowledge, which campaigns for the preservation of an open Internet, agreed that the 2011 agreement could lead to similar conditions should the Time Warner transaction go ahead.""The conditions that they (regulators) would want, if I were Comcast I'm not sure I would want to take,"" he said.Charter, backed by billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp, formally announced its $132.50 per share bid for Time Warner Cable on Monday, which the larger rival promptly rejected as too low.Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, urged regulators to reject the gobbling up of Time Warner Cable.""I'm very worried about control over the pipes that allow the cable company to discriminate against content particularly in the absence of a net neutrality rule. If the deal goes through, we're likely to see a spiral of consolidation both at the pipe end and the content end,"" he said.""What's so wrong with having Time Warner (Cable) remaining an independent company?""",2014-01-17,NFLX,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 11:38am EST",Time Warner Cable deal likely to have strings attached by regulators,http://www.reuters.com//article/timewarnercable-comcast-antitrust-idUSL2N0KQ2FR20140117?type=companyNews
8,"   By Liana B. Baker and Ronald Grover  Verizon Communications Inc's acquisition of Intel Corp's venture to create a web-based TV service may be the catalyst that pushes U.S. cable players to start similar products to fend off fast-growing video rivals such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.The deal, announced on Tuesday, came two weeks after Sony Corp revealed it was working on its own cable-like video service and makes it likely that Internet-delivered TV services may be getting closer after attempts from Apple Inc and other technology companies.Amazon has also considering an online TV service, and has been talking with content owners about licensing TV networks, according to the Wall Street Journal.Verizon said it acquired Intel Corp's OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with its FiOS product, the fiber-based Internet and TV offering that has 5.3 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households.In a more ambitious move, Verizon also says it intends to deliver ""over the top to any device,"" which almost certainly would kick off a race to capture eyeballs that will force cable operators to offer standalone services outside their service territories.""For Verizon this could be an opportunity for them to offer a triple play to subscribers in the rest of the country,"" said Blair Westlake, who until recently headed Microsoft Corp's media and entertainment group. ""If you're a Comcast that may get you thinking that it's time to start offering video in other markets as well.""Verizon has the brand, marketing dollars and customer relationships to make it a viable threat to cable operators, said UBS analyst John Hodulik.There is a likely market waiting for it as well. North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from over-the-top services such as Netflix, more than twice what they spent in 2010, according to PwC's annual entertainment and media forecast. Cable TV operators, meanwhile, are losing video subscribers to satellite and telecom operators, according to SNL Kagan, putting pressure on their operating margins due to rising programming costs.CABLE WARS If Verizon's move prompts a similar bid from cable companies, it would upset a decades-long balance in the cable TV industry, which operates in near monopoly status with markets carefully carved up by local governments. Customers could choose between Comcast and Time Warner Cable for their video service, or Verizon for that matter.Comcast may be furthest along with a potential over-the-top service with its Xfinity X1 platform, which allows a subscriber to its traditional video service to toggle between live and on-demand programming with a slick interface. A Comcast spokeswoman said the company is focused on getting that product released across its markets and not on an ""over-the-top"" service.""If Comcast really launches one, it starts a war between all the different cable companies that are already incumbents,"" said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. ""That probably means they fight over price, service and features that are great for the consumer.""It won't be easy for a new entrant to get started, however. Content owners so far have not granted cable operators the digital rights to sell their shows outside their markets.That has not stopped both cable and satellite companies from eyeing the opportunity. Both Time Warner Cable Inc and satellite operator DirecTV bid on Hulu - the video streaming site owned by Walt Disney Co's ABC network, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Fox parent Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Hulu's owners, the major content companies, decided instead to invest in it rather than sell it. Charter, which has made a bid to buy No. 2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, has openly floated the idea. ""We may sell subscriptions everywhere,"" Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge said in an November conference call, responding to a question about Charter's streaming TV application.Cable's competitors aren't sitting idle. DirecTV CEO Mike White has said the No. 1 satellite operator is working on an ""over-the-top"" video package to suit niche audiences, such as Hispanic or kids programming. DirecTV's rival Dish Network Corp is also eyeing the online opportunity.""We're thinking of over the top too,"" Dish CEO Joe Clayton said on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in early January.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson research, is skeptical that online video newcomers such as Sony can be profitable enough to take on the incumbents. When folks start using huge amounts of bandwidth for TV viewing, he predicts Internet bills will jump as providers start charging by usage.""A virtual provider like Sony could be left with a me-too service,"" Moffett says, ""and an even higher total cost to the end user than the Pay TV subscription they would be hoping to replace.""For some cable operators, this could mean opportunity emerging from the chaos. Cablevision Systems Corp CEO James Dolan, for one, has said he sees a future in which cable operators no longer use their wires to offer video service and instead just offer broadband Internet, which makes more money.(Reporting by Liana B.

9,"   By Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Netflix Inc added more than 2.3 million U.S. households to its TV and movie streaming service in the fourth quarter, pushing its profit above Wall Street expectations and sending its shares up 17 percent in after-hours trading.The world's largest video streaming company on Wednesday reported net income of $48 million for the quarter, up from $8 million a year ago. Earnings-per-share were 79 cents, Netflix said in a statement, beating the 66 cents average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The strong U.S. subscriber growth, a closely watched barometer of company performance, came in at the top end of Netflix's forecast range. Netflix signed up 1.74 million new customers in foreign markets, bringing its worldwide total to 44.4 million.Answering critics who question how big Netflix can grow, the company said it expected to add more U.S. subscribers in the first quarter of 2014 than in the year-ago period.Netflix shares rose more than 17 percent to $391.77, eclipsing the all-time intraday trading high of $389.16 the stock hit in October.Reed Hastings, Netflix's CEO, discounted a recent U.S. court ruling on ""net neutrality"" that some analysts said might lead broadband providers to charge the company for quick delivery of its video content, possibly inflating costs for the company. ""Our economic interests are pretty aligned,"" he said. Broadband providers want to sell higher-priced service with faster speeds, he explained, and need content for it from services like Netflix that work well with faster speeds.The CEO didn't comment on reports that it had talked to cable operators about agreeing to have Netflix accessed from their set-top boxes.""People will use Netflix anyway, and I'd think (cable operators) would rather have them use it on their boxes rather than on Roku or some other box,"" Hastings said. ""We expect this momentum to continue in Q1 with net additions of 2.25 million to exceed the prior year by about 11 percent,"" the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders.Netflix also reported shrinking losses in international markets. ""The international losses are going to subside and therefore show the strength of the overall streaming business,"" said FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, who rates Netflix ""outperform.""The company ended 2013 as one of the year's highest-flying stocks, surging 297.6 percent, as investors bet the company would keep dominating the subscription video market and expand its roster of customers who pay $8-a-month for unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows.

10,"  By Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover      LOS ANGELES, Jan 22 Netflix Inc added more than 2.3 million U.S. households to its TV and movie streaming service in the fourth quarter, pushing its profit above Wall Street expectations and sending its shares up 17 percent in after-hours trading.     The world's largest video streaming company on Wednesday reported net income of $48 million for the quarter, up from $8 million a year ago. Earnings-per-share were 79 cents, Netflix said in a statement, beating the 66 cents average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     The strong U.S. subscriber growth, a closely watched barometer of company performance, came in at the top end of Netflix's forecast range. Netflix signed up 1.74 million new customers in foreign markets, bringing its worldwide total to 44.4 million.     Answering critics who question how big Netflix can grow, the company said it expected to add more U.S. subscribers in the first quarter of 2014 than in the year-ago period.     Netflix shares rose more than 17 percent to $391.77, eclipsing the all-time intraday trading high of $389.16 the stock hit in October.     Reed Hastings, Netflix's CEO, discounted a recent U.S. court ruling on ""net neutrality"" that some analysts said might lead broadband providers to charge the company for quick delivery of its video content, possibly inflating costs for the company.     ""Our economic interests are pretty aligned,"" he said. Broadband providers want to sell higher-priced service with faster speeds, he explained, and need content for it from services like Netflix that work well with faster speeds.     The CEO didn't comment on reports that it had talked to cable operators about agreeing to have Netflix accessed from their set-top boxes.         ""People will use Netflix anyway, and I'd think (cable operators) would rather have them use it on their boxes rather than on Roku or some other box,"" Hastings said.     ""We expect this momentum to continue in Q1 with net additions of 2.25 million to exceed the prior year by about 11 percent,"" the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders.            Netflix also reported shrinking losses in international markets. ""The international losses are going to subside and therefore show the strength of the overall streaming business,"" said FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, who rates Netflix ""outperform.""     The company ended 2013 as one of the year's highest-flying stocks, surging 297.6 percent, as investors bet the company would keep dominating the subscription video market and expand its roster of customers who pay $8-a-month for unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows.     In its letter, the company acknowledged it had been testing variations of the $8 monthly charge ""at various price points.""

Trading volume was heavier than in recent sessions.The market sentiment was dented by a report on manufacturing in China which showed a mild slowdown at the end of 2013 in the world's second-largest economy had continued into the new year. U.S.-traded Chinese stocks were down sharply after a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission judge ruled that the Chinese units of the world's top accounting firms should be suspended from auditing those companies.Among the biggest losers were Internet services provider Baidu Inc, down 6.2 percent, and SINA Corp, down 5.9 percent, on heavier-than-usual volume. The U.S. shares of Petrochina , the country's largest stock by market value, fell 3.1 percent.The CBOE Volatility index VIX often used as a fear gauge on Wall Street, closed up 7.2 percent at 13.77 after rising more than 11 percent earlier.""The day's panic was largely associated with China and I think it's a temporary reaction,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. ""If we have good corporate earnings from a couple of big names or good economic reports, I think we will be right back up to where we were a couple days ago.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 175.99 points or 1.07 percent, to 16,197.35, the S&P 500 lost 16.4 points or 0.89 percent, to 1,828.46 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 24.126 points or 0.57 percent, to 4,218.875.Trading volume was higher than usual with 7.4 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms compared to a five-day average of 6.7 billion shares, according to BATS exchange data. Both on the NYSE and Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by a ratio of about 2 to 1.

18,"   By Lisa Richwine and Ronald Grover | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Netflix Inc, riding high after another strong earnings report, is in better shape to raise prices for new U.S. customers to its movie and TV streaming service than it was in 2011, when a price hike sent its stock into a downward spiral.On its side is the addition of award-winning original series like ""House of Cards"" and an expanded library of TV shows and films that have made it a proven force in Hollywood with 35.6 million U.S. subscribers.The expectation that Netflix is headed toward a price increase was one of the factors that sent its stock upward by more than 16 percent following a better-than expected earnings, analysts said.Shares leaped 16.5 percent on Thursday to $388.72 on Nasdaq, beating their all-time closing high of $380.58.""They're giving too much value to the consumer,"" said Needham and Co analyst Laura Martin, who rates the company a ""buy."" ""They absolutely need to raise prices.""On Wednesday, Netflix signaled it might consider an increase when the company said it was testing tiered pricing plans to replace or supplement the $8 price paid by most of its U.S. members. It stressed the existing customers would be able to keep the $8 price for a time. In 2011, Netflix raised prices for some customers by as much as $6, or 60 percent. The company lost more than 800,000 U.S. subscribers in the third quarter after the price increase, it said then, and a quickly aborted plan to separate its DVD-by-mail business.Netflix's stock fell from $298.73 a share in mid-July, when it posted the price changes on its blog, to $69.29 by the end of the year.This time around, the company made clear it intends to gingerly raise the notion of a price hike. Last year, it introduced a higher $12 option for subscribers who use four streams at a time. In a letter to its shareholders that ""eventually"" it hoped to offer new members a selection of ""three simple options to fit everyone's taste."" Netflix did not say whether the $8 price would remain an option.Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould expects Netflix will raise its core domestic price for new members by $1 to $9, while locking in the current price for existing members for two years, as it recently did in Ireland. That should help reduce cancellations, he said.""I think they can easily do a buck without a backlash,"" Gould said. Two dollars ""might be a stretch,"" he said. A new pricing structure could take a year or longer for the company to institute, if it does so at all, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in an interview.""If we do make pricing changes for new members, existing members would get a generous grandfathering of their existing plans and prices,"" Hastings and Netflix CFO David Wells wrote in bold type in a letter to shareholders.Not every analyst, however, thinks Netflix should alter its pricing scheme.""They're making money, so raising prices should be the last resort,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who rates Netflix ""underperform."" ""A price increase solely to make more money is counter to the way they have run the company.""A price hike, said Pachter, should be considered only if Netflix's margins shrink due to increases in its costs to secure content or deliver it online.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; editing by Andrew Hay)",2014-01-23,NFLX,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 4:48pm EST","Analysis: New shows, customer gains give Netflix muscle to hike prices",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-netflix-prices-analysis-idUSBREA0M1YK20140123?type=companyNews

This year he returned to Sundance with that film and entered the highly selective U.S. drama competition.Hodierne's successful exposure illustrates how companies such as Netflix, YouTube and Vimeo are stepping in to provide filmmakers with a new platform for distributing films, expanding alongside the traditional path of theatrical release.This year, movie studios have been slow to snap up some of the buzzed-about Sundance films. So far, only a handful of films have been acquired by studios. The hot film of the festival was opening night movie ""Whiplash,"" which attracted strong bidding and was finally bought by Sony Pictures Classics for $3 million, according to a source with knowledge of the deal.None of the films acquired yet have hit the eight-figure level, unlike last year when Fox Searchlight purchased quirky Steve Carell comedy ""The Way, Way Back"" for $10 million.Netflix, a video rental and online streaming platform, premiered documentary ""Mitt"" at Sundance a week ahead of the film being released on the website, drastically cutting down the time between a festival premiere and subsequent release.For independent filmmakers, who often debut at Sundance, Netflix offers an opportunity to capitalize on the buzz generated from the festival and release to a wide audience without having to wait for a studio to distribute to theaters.""It's an unreasonable request to expect independent films to continue playing in the cinemas as the primary source to connect with the audience,"" said Keith Kjarval, producer of closing night film ""Rudderless.""""People are always more impressed with the theatrical release, but in reality, you see more money back if your film makes $3 million digitally."" Actor and filmmaker Mark Duplass, who was at Sundance to promote his latest film ""The One I Love,"" told Variety that ""the most important part of making a movie is making sure the film streams on Netflix,"" adding that it ""made my career"" and urging filmmakers to do the same.Sundance films have often found a lease of life through video-on-demand platforms such those provided by RADiUS-TWC, a pioneering multi-platform boutique offspring of The Weinstein Co. Last year, RADiUS snapped up five Sundance films including two Oscar-nominated documentaries, often finding an audience through non-traditional media.RADiUS co-presidents Tom Quinn and Jason Janego said that while not all of their films would suit the VOD model, it has proven to be a successful one for some films.""Great movies are available also at home, for the same price as a movie ticket,"" Quinn said. ""We like that our eclectic approach to distribution is as equally eclectic as our slate of movies.""RADiUS has yet to acquire a Sundance film this year, but was chasing a documentary and drama as of Wednesday. NEW DISTRIBUTION MODELS Digital media platforms were a prominent feature on Park City's Main Street, the central hub of the Sundance Film Festival where companies hire out spaces for the week and hold events for filmmakers and the public.Video-hosting site YouTube, owned by Google Inc, set up a large space on Main Street, with events and panels on how to use the platform to build an audience. YouTube sponsors Sundance Film Festival's short film program, hosting the competition shorts.""The short film format is really innovative. That's where we help creators understand the different stages of their campaign to build their film,"" said Derek Callow, director of creator marketing at YouTube. Callow said the company was not concerned with having filmmakers release exclusive content through YouTube - rather, ""exclusivity for us is not really central to our strategy. We often remove the exclusivity clause in contracts,"" he said.Vimeo, a video-hosting site that is a competitor to YouTube but focuses on attracting longer videos such as short or feature films, is also making a concerted effort to connect with the Sundance community.Vimeo, which has around 400,000 paying subscribers who generate $40 million for the website, is offering a platform for filmmakers to host their films and charge for it directly through the website, with Vimeo taking a 10 percent cut.Kerry Trainor, CEO of Vimeo, also said the platform was not trying to compete with Netflix, but rather wanted to bring up-and-coming filmmakers like Hodierne to its roster.Vimeo has also been involved with crowd-funding sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter, hosting videos and allowing project starters to seek funding through the Vimeo audience.Kickstarter has funded 20 films that are at Sundance this year, including Zach Braff's ""Wish I Was Here"" and documentary ""The Internet's Own Boy."" Braff's film, which raised $3 million from more than 46,000 backers, was purchased by Focus Features for $2.7 million, Variety said.""With crowd-funding, you're not just buying the film, you're buying the experience,"" said Greg Clayman, Vimeo's general manager of audience networks.(This story has been refiled to correct magazine Vice to media company Vice in paragraph 2)(Editing by Mary Milliken and Eric Walsh)",2014-01-23,NFLX,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 12:26pm EST",Digital brands woo Sundance filmmakers with new platforms,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-sundance-business-idUSBREA0M0WF20140123?type=companyNews

The hot film of the festival was opening night movie ""Whiplash,"" which attracted strong bidding and was finally bought by Sony Pictures Classics for $3 million, according to a source with knowledge of the deal.None of the films acquired yet have hit the eight-figure level, unlike last year when Fox Searchlight purchased quirky Steve Carell comedy ""The Way, Way Back"" for $10 million.Netflix, a video rental and online streaming platform, premiered documentary ""Mitt"" at Sundance a week ahead of the film being released on the website, drastically cutting down the time between a festival premiere and subsequent release.For independent filmmakers, who often debut at Sundance, Netflix offers an opportunity to capitalize on the buzz generated from the festival and release to a wide audience without having to wait for a studio to distribute to theaters.""It's an unreasonable request to expect independent films to continue playing in the cinemas as the primary source to connect with the audience,"" said Keith Kjarval, producer of closing night film ""Rudderless."" ""People are always more impressed with the theatrical release, but in reality, you see more money back if your film makes $3 million digitally.""Actor and filmmaker Mark Duplass, who was at Sundance to promote his latest film ""The One I Love,"" told Variety that ""the most important part of making a movie is making sure the film streams on Netflix,"" adding that it ""made my career"" and urging filmmakers to do the same.Sundance films have often found a lease of life through video-on-demand platforms such those provided by RADiUS-TWC, a pioneering multi-platform boutique offspring of The Weinstein Co. Last year, RADiUS snapped up five Sundance films including two Oscar-nominated documentaries, often finding an audience through non-traditional media.RADiUS co-presidents Tom Quinn and Jason Janego said that while not all of their films would suit the VOD model, it has proven to be a successful one for some films.""Great movies are available also at home, for the same price as a movie ticket,"" Quinn said. ""We like that our eclectic approach to distribution is as equally eclectic as our slate of movies."" RADiUS has yet to acquire a Sundance film this year, but was chasing a documentary and drama as of Wednesday.NEW DISTRIBUTION MODELS Digital media platforms were a prominent feature on Park City's Main Street, the central hub of the Sundance Film Festival where companies hire out spaces for the week and hold events for filmmakers and the public. Video-hosting site YouTube, owned by Google Inc, set up a large space on Main Street, with events and panels on how to use the platform to build an audience. YouTube sponsors Sundance Film Festival's short film program, hosting the competition shorts.""The short film format is really innovative. That's where we help creators understand the different stages of their campaign to build their film,"" said Derek Callow, director of creator marketing at YouTube.Callow said the company was not concerned with having filmmakers release exclusive content through YouTube - rather, ""exclusivity for us is not really central to our strategy. We often remove the exclusivity clause in contracts,"" he said.Vimeo, a video-hosting site that is a competitor to YouTube but focuses on attracting longer videos such as short or feature films, is also making a concerted effort to connect with the Sundance community.Vimeo, which has around 400,000 paying subscribers who generate $40 million for the website, is offering a platform for filmmakers to host their films and charge for it directly through the website, with Vimeo taking a 10 percent cut.Kerry Trainor, CEO of Vimeo, also said the platform was not trying to compete with Netflix, but rather wanted to bring up-and-coming filmmakers like Hodierne to its roster.Vimeo has also been involved with crowd-funding sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter, hosting videos and allowing project starters to seek funding through the Vimeo audience.Kickstarter has funded 20 films that are at Sundance this year, including Zach Braff's ""Wish I Was Here"" and documentary ""The Internet's Own Boy."" Braff's film, which raised $3 million from more than 46,000 backers, was purchased by Focus Features for $2.7 million, Variety said.""With crowd-funding, you're not just buying the film, you're buying the experience,"" said Greg Clayman, Vimeo's general manager of audience networks.

27,"   By Liana B. Baker  Time Warner Inc broke out the financials for its premium movie network HBO on Wednesday for the first time, giving investors a better picture of how the unit stacks up against video streaming service Netflix Inc.Netflix was one of the best-performing stocks last year and analysts said Time Warner wants more recognition from investors for the strength of HBO and its streaming product, HBO Go, which has a similar feel to Netflix. The effort to highlight the digital aspect of its business comes as the company prepares to spin off its slow-growth magazine publishing business Time Inc.""Perhaps the Street should put a higher multiple on the HBO business. It's the largest potential competitor to Netflix, which is trading at such a high multiple,"" said Gabelli & Co analyst Brett Harriss, adding HBO's performance last year was in line with his estimates.HBO, which said adjusted operating income rose 8 percent to $1.7 billion last year, is much more profitable than Netflix, but it has also been around much longer and is growing more slowly. Netflix posted $112.4 million in net income last year.HBO's revenue increased 4 percent to $4.9 billion, compared with Netflix's revenue which rose 21 percent last year to $4.37 billion. Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes said HBO recorded its biggest gain in domestic subscribers in 17 years, about 2 million last year, a figure that includes subscribers for HBO's sister channel Cinemax.But these subscriber gains did not generate any revenue, executives said, due to some of HBO's agreements with cable operators that allow the providers to keep some of the money it makes from subscribers.""We definitely think, and we are doing it, that we can grow the sub base,"" said Bewkes. ""You can see the result of those investments in programming and sub growth we have had in the last couple years."" The company also said it would spin off its Time Inc publishing unit in the second quarter and put $1.3 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In contrast, when News Corp and Fox separated last year, the publishing unit was not loaded with any debt and it was given $2.6 billion in cash.

32,"  By Svea Herbst-BaylissFeb 14 Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the fourth quarter focused on the consumer sector, with investment plays ranging from high-end auction house Sotheby's to large retailers Target Corp and Walgreen CoGeneral Motors also became the flavor of the quarter with many hedge funds as the U.S. government exited its position. This year, however, the stock price has fallen nearly 14 percent, making for a rough start for new Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra.But on Friday, the automaker's stock rose 75 cents, or 2.13 percent, to $35.95.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings don't disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there's also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.  Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the fourth quarter.SOTHEBY'S Activist investor Marcato Capital Management, run by Mick McGuire, boosted the firm's holdings of Sotheby's by 35 percent, having bought an additional 1,200,000 shares in the auction house to now own 4,562,991.Eric Mindich's Eton Park Capital Management also is a huge fan, buying an additional 265,000 shares, bringing his stake to 2.2 million shares.FACEBOOK Tiger Consumer Management got back into Facebook Inc after exiting it in the third quarter. The filing shows the fund owned 1,384,507 shares of the social media powerhouse at the end of the fourth quarter.Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors bought an additional 13.9 million class A shares, bringing its stake to 18.3 million class A shares.Scout Capital Management closed out of its position, selling 3 million shares. Scout Capital may be going on a junk food diet, as it liquidated its entire position in Whole Foods  and Starbucks but added 3.9 million shares in Yum! Brands Inc. The fund's owners said last month that they are splitting up and shutting down the $6.7 billion fund after 13 years. Returns were strong at 21 percent last year.GENERAL MOTORS Kyle Bass's Hayman Capital announced in early December that he established a position and that the 4,606,005 million shares he owned made up nearly one quarter of his portfolio.Bridger Capital trimmed its holdings in General Motors Co by selling 155,000 shares, but the fund still owns 1,695,000 shares, which ranks the stock as the fund's fourth largest position.Bronson Point Management, founded by former managers at SAC and Pequot, added to its holding of GM by buying another 400,000 shares, increasing its stake by 34 percent. And Cooperman's Omega added a new position, buying 1.04 million shares of the automaker.HERBALIFE Meanwhile, Bass of Hayman Capital liquidated his position, selling 436,371 shares. Tiger Consumer Management sold 368,252, cutting its stake by 47 percent. NETFLIX INC Blue Ridge sold all of its Netflix exposure, liquidating 349,000 shares of the American provider of on-demand Internet streaming media, while Carl Icahn cut his stake by 2.9 million shares, bringing his exposure to 2.7 million shares.Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan's Tiger Global Management bought an additional 223,000 shares, bringing their stake to 663,000 shares.TARGET CORP Carlson Capital took a new position in Target, buying 1.4 million shares only weeks before the retailer made headlines after becoming the victim of computer hackers who stole millions of credit card records.WALGREEN CO  Viking Global Investors opened a new stake of 11.6 million shares. Jana Partners increased its stake in Walgreen to 7.3 million sole shares versus 1.3 million sole shares. For more on activist investors Jana Partners, please see.AMERICAN AIRLINES Fresh from bankruptcy and a merger with US Airways, the ""new"" American has become a new favorite with money managers and the stock has climbed 38.71 percent this year alone.Hutchin Hill opened a new position in the airline with 875,000 shares.TIME WARNER CABLE Farallon Capital Management added to its holding of Time Warner Cable Inc in the fourth quarter by buying 1,905,500 shares. It owned 2,432,00 shares at the end of the quarter, making it the firm's biggest position.On Thursday, a proposed all-stock deal in which Comcast Corp would take over Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion was announced.SIRIUS XM HOLDINGS Viking Global Investors opened a new stake of 15.1 million shares.THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC Aaron Cowen's Suvretta Capital opened a new position, buying 322,000 shares to make it his fund's third biggest positions, while Omega Advisors added 209,630 shares.Adage sold 607,400 shares of the scientific instrument maker, cutting its stake by 43 percent to own 800,505 shares at the end of the quarter.

33,"  By Alina SelyukhWASHINGTON Feb 19 U.S. federal regulators will once again try to set rules that make sure broadband providers do not block or slow access to content on the Internet, or charge content providers like Netflix or Amazon  for faster Web service.The Federal Communications Commission's plan for new so-called ""Net neutrality"" rules comes a month after a U.S. court struck down their previous iteration, which was the second court's rejection of the rules.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January said the FCC, in adopting the 2010 open Internet order, improperly treated Internet service providers as regulated public utilities providing telecommunications services, like telephone companies, while they were actually classified as information service providers.But the court did affirm that the FCC had authority to regulate broadband as it oversees its expansion and competitiveness of services, giving the agency new legal opportunity to bring back non-discrimination and no-blocking regulations for Internet service providers.FCC commissioners will now negotiate a new version of the rules that would ensure that network operators disclose exactly how they manage Internet traffic and that they do not restrict consumers' ability to surf the Web or use applications.Virtually all large Internet service providers, in the wake of January's ruling, pledged to continue abiding by the principles of open Internet. But consumer advocates worry that without properly reclassifying broadband providers, the FCC leaves the door open for backdoor deals that would give unequal treatment to websites or services. Though the FCC did not move to begin the reclassification, Wheeler said the option to remained on the table.New rules are likely to be finished in the late spring or early summer, a senior official said, as the FCC takes on the review of a proposed merger between the two biggest U.S. cable and broadband providers, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc.Though Comcast is bound by an earlier agreement to abide by the FCC's net neutrality rules until 2018, and has reiterated its commitment, the size of the merger has rekindled concerns about what future agreements between content and Internet providers may mean for open Internet.Verizon Communications Inc, which challenged the FCC's rules in court, arguing they violated the company's right to free speech and stripped control of what its networks transmit and how, is not expected to appeal. Company spokesman Ed McFadden on Wednesday said Verizon remained committed to providing consumers ""with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want.""BATTLE LINES The issue of Net neutrality rules has drawn political battle lines in Washington as many Republicans have sided with Verizon's argument that it amounted to government overreach, referring to the rules as ""a solution in search of a problem."" ""The Internet was free and open before the FCC adopted Net neutrality rules. It remains free and open today,"" said FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, the senior of the two Republicans on the five-member commission. ""I am skeptical that this effort will end any differently from the last.""Democratic telecom leaders in Congress welcomed the FCC's move on Wednesday, after California Representatives Anna Eshoo and Henry Waxman introduced a bill that would reinstate the open Internet order that the FCC approved in late 2010.But consumer groups Free Press and Public Knowledge expressed disappointment that the FCC was did not take a tougher stance for reclassification of broadband providers to give the agency more oversight power.An online citizen petition to the White House calling for such a reclassification collected 105,572 signatures, prompting a response from the Obama administration .""Absent Net neutrality, the Internet could turn into a high-priced private toll road that would be inaccessible to the next generation of visionaries,"" White House officials responded on Tuesday, deferring to the FCC on the matter.Reclassification would face a tremendous pushback from the broadband industry, and Republican leaders in Congress on Wednesday called on the FCC to tread lightly.""No matter how many times the court says 'No,' the Obama administration refuses to abandon its furious pursuit of these harmful policies to put government in charge of the Web,"" said House Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton and Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairman Greg Walden.",2014-02-19,NFLX,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 2:32pm EST",UPDATE 3-U.S. telecom regulator will write new 'Open Internet' rules,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fcc-internet-idUSL2N0LO19920140219?type=companyNews

Someone has to pay that cost,"" Jim Cicconi, AT&T's senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs wrote in a company blog post.""Mr. Hastings' arrogant proposition is that everyone else should pay but Netflix,"" he said.The post was a rebuttal to comments published by Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Thursday calling for greater protections for open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, which require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges.In January a U.S. appeals court rejected federal rules that required Internet service providers to treat all web traffic equally, a decision that could allow mobile carriers and other broadband providers to charge content providers for faster access to websites and services. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast Corp   for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service.Comcast is seeking approval from U.S. regulators for its proposed $45.2 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N. Treatment of internet traffic is one issue expected to receive scrutiny during the government's review. In his original post, Hastings said internet service providers should give content companies adequate network connections for free, and singled out Comcast for supporting ""weak"" internet traffic rules.Comcast responded by saying no other company had a ""stronger commitment to openness of the Internet.""""While in the short term Netflix will in cases reluctantly pay large [internet service providers] to ensure a high quality member experience, we will continue to fight for the internet the world needs and deserves,"" wrote Hastings. On Friday, Hastings along with several large U.S. internet companies met with President Barack Obama to discuss changes to government surveillance programs. [ID: nL2N0MI178]Netflix did not respond immediately to requests for comment.Hasting's argument would force service providers to pay for the increased capacity necessary to satisfy the growing demand for Netflix video streaming at the expense of AT&T's other customers, said Cicconi.""If there's a cost of delivering Mr. Hastings's movies at the quality level he desires - and there is - then it should be borne by Netflix and recovered in the price of its service,"" he said.

66,"  * Biotech, momentum stocks lead Nasdaq down 1 pct* Wider U.S. trade deficit to weigh on first-quarter GDP* Dow off 0.2 pct; S&P 500 off 0.2 pct; Nasdaq down 1.1 pct   (Updates to afternoon)By Angela MoonNEW YORK, April 3 U.S. stocks fell on Thursday afternoon, led by a sharp drop in biotech and momentum stocks, including Facebook, Tesla and Netflix.The Nasdaq fell 1.1 percent as investors sold some of the market's biggest outperformers, mostly in the Internet and biotech space, to take profits from recent gains.Investors were also reluctant to make big bets ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, when they will be looking for evidence that recent weather-related weakness in the economy has passed. In the latest week, U.S. jobless claims rose more than expected, the Labor Department said on Thursday, but the underlying trend still pointed to some strength in the job market. ""Momentum names are usually the ones that take the quickest hit when investors get anxious or worried, in this case, a bit of hesitancy ahead of tomorrow's payrolls,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research in Austin, Texas.The Global X Social Media ETF, which includes Facebook Inc, LinkedIn Corp and Groupon Inc , dropped 3.1 percent. The Nasdaq biotechnology index  slid 3 percent.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 26.40 points or 0.16 percent, to 16,546.60. The S&P 500 slipped 4.48 points or 0.24 percent, to 1,886.42. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 45.172 points or 1.06 percent, to 4,231.284.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 hit intraday record highs during the morning, with the Dow climbing to 16,604.15, above its record close set on Dec. 31. The S&P 500 rose as high as 1,893.80. Some analysts said the selloff in ""momentum"" stocks has yet to run its course, though this could benefit more value-oriented names. Buyers scooped up some of those companies' shares, which helped to limit the Dow's decline. Intel Corp gained 2.1 percent to $26.43. American Express Co added 0.5 percent to $90.87.Among momentum stocks, the shares of Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, fell 2.4 percent to $224.90 and the shares of Netflix Inc, the online movie rental company, lost 2.6 percent to stand at $353.49.The options market also focused on momentum stocks, with Tesla Motors remaining a favorite with the speculative crowd for a second day. The total option volume by afternoon was running at about a 30 percent mark-up to what's typically seen. Shares of Barnes & Noble Inc plunged 14.7 percent to $18.87 after Liberty Media Corp said it has sold almost all of its stake in the company, ending a nearly three-year bet that the struggling retailer would emerge as a dominant seller of e-books.The S&P 500 now consists of 501 stocks, with the index including both Google Inc's Class A and Class C  shares after the company's special dividend. Google's Class A shares rose 0.5 percent to $570.88 while its Class C shares gained 0.4 percent to $569.18.On the economic front, the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly widened in February to $42.3 billion as exports hit a five-month low, suggesting that first-quarter growth could be much weaker than initially expected.A bright spot came from the services sector, where growth accelerated in March after being hampered by unusually cold weather, according to the Institute for Supply Management's services-sector index.In the biopharmaceutical sector, Gilead Sciences Inc  said late Wednesday that a trial of its hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir, sold under the brand name Sovaldi in the United States, showed the drug was safe and effective in treating Japanese patients infected with a common form of the virus. However, its stock slipped 0.7 percent to $73.44.Vivus Inc shares tumbled 7.3 percent to $5.73 after Piper Jaffray cut its rating on the pharmaceutical company's stock to ""underweight"" from ""neutral.""

67,"  (Corrects story to show vote took place in Brussels, not Strasbourg)BRUSSELS, April 3 The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of ending mobile phone roaming fees on Thursday, a move that will cheer Europe's consumers even as it frustrates telecoms companies.In a sitting of the parliament in Brussels, lawmakers backed legislation that will phase out roaming fees across the 28-country European Union by December 2015.""This vote is the EU delivering for citizens,"" said Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for digital affairs and an ardent advocate for ending the charges.""This is what the EU is all about - getting rid of barriers to make life easier and less expensive. We should know what we are buying, we should not be ripped-off, and we should have the opportunity to change our mind.""At the same time, the parliament voted in favour of maintaining ""net neutrality"", effectively declaring that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally, regardless of the source or the content. The decision is a move to limit the ability of network operators to provide quicker Internet access to content providers in exchange for a fee and is another decision in favour of consumers.Both steps are part of Kroes's plans to overhaul Europe's telecoms sector and try to make it more competitive with rivals in the United States and Asia. But they also come just two months before EU elections, when more than 300 million Europeans will vote for candidates to the European Parliament.Putting an end to mobile roaming - and the phone-bill shock that affects those who use their phones abroad - has been a banner issue for legislators over the past three years, leading to tense exchanges with the powerful telecoms industry. Sector analysts estimate telecoms revenues could fall around five percent without roaming fees, although the Commission argues that since more consumers will use their mobiles as a result, some of the impact will be offset.European lawmakers also set restrictions on the kind of online services that telecoms operators can charge popular, bandwidth-hungry content providers such as Facebook, Google and Netflix in exchange for delivering their services at faster speeds.Operators are fighting for a share of the profits from video streaming and music downloads to offset declining revenues in their traditional phone services. Sales are forecast to fall for the fifth consecutive year in 2014. The industry says charging for different services and speeds would would help fund network upgrades. But Internet activists say that goes against the spirit of an open Internet and would lead to the creation of a two-speed system.The European Parliament's vote on Thursday effectively sides with consumers and Internet activists, backing ""net neutrality"".Lobbying group ETNO, whose members include Deutsche Telekom , Orange, Telefonica and Telecoms Italia, said the parliamentary vote was a step in the wrong direction.""Today's vote risks derailing the original objectives of the Connected Continent Regulation, namely a strong European digital industry igniting growth and jobs creation,"" ETNO head Luigi Gambardella said.Following parliament's backing, the measures will become law after they are approved by the European Council, which represents the EU's member states. After further discussions, the Council is expected to take a decision in October.

68,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Momentum shares like Netflix and TripAdvisor sold off sharply for a second straight day on Friday, giving the Nasdaq its worst day since February and leaving investors anxious about how much further they may fall.The big drop in momentum stocks overshadowed the day's relatively strong March jobs data, which helped the Dow and S&P 500 hit intraday record highs early in the session.Nasdaq's 2.6 percent loss follows a nearly 1 percent slide on Thursday and puts the index more than 5 percent below its closing high for the year, which was set on March 5.The day's action in momentum names - typically high-growth companies mostly in the tech and biotech sectors that led 2013's rally - extends their recent selloff, which investors mostly have been at a loss to explain.""For the past couple of weeks, the high-beta, high-risk, high-reward type plays have been underperforming the larger-cap S&P 500 and even the Dow,"" said Joe Bell, senior equities analyst with Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.He said it doesn't necessarily mean a longer-term pullback is in store for the market, but he pointed out that ""in the short term, it's a concern.

77,"  April 21 Video streaming service Netflix on Monday became the most visible company with a business relationship with Comcast to oppose the No. 1 cable operator's $45.3 billion merger with Time Warner Cable.""It's more in the public interest to either not have them merge or if the government goes ahead with it, to at least put some significant merger agreements, settlements in there,"" Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said in a webcast following the company's quarterly results.Netflix added in a quarterly letter to shareholders that Comcast would control access to broadband in a majority of U.S. homes while also having ""anticompetitive leverage"" to charge arbitrary fees on companies that rely on its Internet service.Until now, the only vocal advocates calling for an outright rejection of Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger had been public interest and consumer groups such as Public Knowledge and the Consumers Union, as well as Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat who has often opposed media concentration.Netflix has tussled with the cable operator in recent months over the speed Comcast delivers the online streaming service to its cable customers. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service.While Netflix and Comcast announced the news in a joint statement that sounded friendly at the time, just a month later, Netflix's Hastings blasted Comcast for charging these interconnection fees in a blog post.In an interview with Reuters on Monday, the Netflix executive said he favors the federal government imposing ""some enduring form of no-fee interconnect"" if the merger is approved by regulators. Comcast quickly responded with a lengthy statement.""Netflix's opposition to our Time Warner Cable transaction is based on inaccurate claims and arguments,"" the cable operator said. ""There has been no company that has had a stronger commitment to openness of the Internet than Comcast.""The cable operator noted that, as part of its 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal, it is the only Internet provider that is legally bound to follow the U.S. Federal Communications Commission' net neutrality rules. Comcast charged that Netflix is using the interconnection argument to ""shift its costs from its customers to all Internet customers, regardless of whether they subscribe to Netflix or not.""A DEAL HURDLE?  Netflix's decision to publicly oppose Comcast's plan to merge with Time Warner Cable may give the company headaches when it makes its case to the Justice Department that their deal is legal under antitrust law, said Allen Grunes, an antitrust expert with Geyer Gorey LLP law firm.""The significance here is that we know from the (2011) Comcast NBCU deal that DOJ (Justice Department) was worried about Netflix,"" said Grunes. ""I suspect that Netflix has a whole bunch of information and concerns that could support DOJ bringing a case because this is the person whose business is placed at risk.""Critics of the merger say that a bigger, more powerful Comcast would have the power to throttle Internet traffic.Since announcing its bid for Time Warner Cable in February, Comcast has underscored that the merger combines two companies that do not directly compete in any markets, meaning no consumer would lose a choice of an Internet or cable provider.It has argued that Time Warner Cable's customers would see a boost in quality of their services and Internet speeds.

80,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Netflix Inc, the video streaming service, on Monday criticized AT&T's high-speed fiber network as inadequate and slow, while renewing its call for AT&T to interconnect directly with Netflix.Netflix made the remarks in a letter to shareholders on its first-quarter results. The company has been calling for greater protections for open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality, which require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or tiered charges.Netflix, in a letter signed by its chief executive, Reed Hastings, and chief financial officer, David Wells, said AT&T's fiber-based U-verse service has ""lower performance than many DSL"" Internet service providers.The letter came hours after AT&T said it expects to expand its fiber network and TV services to up to 21 U.S. cities.AT&T did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a March blog post, AT&T dismissed Netflix's call for free interconnection as an ""arrogant"" and unfair attempt to force others to pay for the content provider to gain access to faster broadband speeds and better services.""The 249 customer comments on AT&T's anti-Netflix blog post indicate that AT&T customers expect a good quality Netflix experience given how much they pay AT&T for their Internet service,"" the Netflix letter said.Netflix added that AT&T can connect directly with Netflix for free, saying that doing so would ""quickly improve their customers' experience."" Netflix also addressed wider tensions with the Internet service providers it relies on to distribute its services. The company said it opposes the proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable because it would give Comcast a monopoly over high-speed broadband and allow it to charge ""unprecedented fees"" from transit and service providers like Netflix.AT&T, which is fighting rivals such as Google Inc as well as cable companies with its fiber-based product, on Monday said it is considering providing broadband Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and its U-verse television service in some metropolitan areas, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. Before the company can enter these markets, it must make agreements with local leaders in each city.The services are currently available in Austin, Texas, and some surrounding communities, and will be rolled out in parts of Dallas this summer, the company said.AT&T said it may consider expanding its reach to 100 cities eventually.U-verse launched in 2006 and currently has 10.7 million combined Internet and TV customers.(Additional reporting by Liana B.

90,"  Netflix Inc's planned price hikes will allow the video streaming company to increase spending on original content that will help attract more customers globally, analysts said, as many of them raised their price targets on the stock.Netflix's shares rose more than 9 percent in early trading on Tuesday after the company said it planned to increase prices for new subscribers and reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.At least nine brokerages raised their price targets on the stock. Raymond James and Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded the stock to their equivalent of a ""buy"" rating, citing strong growth prospects from international markets.Analysts said Netflix has sufficient room to raise monthly subscriptions for new subscribers by $1-$2 in some countries.""This dramatically increases our revenue and profit estimates from current markets over the next three years,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves wrote in a note.""Further, it seems highly likely that Netflix will accelerate international expansion beginning in the second half of 2014, which should expand the company's TAM (total addressable market) and allow it to drive meaningful upside to long-term profit expectations.""Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould said he expects Netflix to face little price resistance up to $9.99. Subscribers in the United States now pay $7.99 per month. Gould said the company is approaching 50 million global subscribers, and a $1-2 price increase would raise $600 million to $1.2 billion.Gould estimates the company — home to shows such as the critically acclaimed Kevin Spacey thriller ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" — will spend about $3 billion on content in 2014 and $5 billion by 2016.Netflix, which is expected to expand to France and Germany in the second half of the year, reported a 72 percent jump in international subscribers on a net basis in the quarter ended March 31. (r.reuters.com/juv68v) The company said its international unit would become profitable this year and that it expects international revenue to eventually surpass revenue from its U.S. market.Netflix, which operates in 41 countries, gets about a quarter of its revenue from international operations.""This is the year of Internet Pricing Power - Amazon, Pandora and Netflix - their value propositions are strong enough to command higher prices,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research report. However, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter cautioned that while price increases should allow Netflix to add content and keep its subscriber base satisfied, even modest price increases have the potential to slow subscriber growth and attract competition. Pachter has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock.Netflix suffered from a consumer backlash and stock plunge after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011. Since then, the company has started producing popular original content.Netflix, with a 32.3 percent video streaming market share in the United States, leads rivals such as Google Inc's YouTube, Hulu and Amazon.com Inc, according to a research by broadband networking equipment company Sandvine Corp.

The heaviest activity in Netflix options expiring this week was in far out-of-the-money options, contracts that profit only if the stock's price moves dramatically.""With the event now out of the way, implied volatility is imploding, and many of the significantly aggressive out-of-the-money puts and calls played ahead of earnings have turned to big losers,"" said Ryan Detrick, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.With the chances of a big rally now diminished, traders are selling options as fast as they can.

99,"   By Liana B. Baker and Lisa Richwine  Amazon.com's streaming video service will offer some older shows from premium-cable channel HBO starting next month, a deal that intensifies both companies' competition with subscription-video service Netflix.This is the first time HBO, owned by Time Warner Inc, has licensed its award-winning programming to an online subscription streaming service, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday.HBO shows are not available through Netflix. Netflix shares fell 4.7 percent to $355.31 on Nasdaq.The deal does not include the entire library of HBO shows that are available on HBO Go streaming service. HBO Go will become an option on Amazon's Fire TV device, but only for subscribers to the HBO cable channel.The partnership with HBO helps Amazon build a stronger case for its Amazon Prime service roughly a month after the largest U.S. online retailer boosted its annual Prime fee to $99 from $79.Prime subscribers will have access to the HBO programming on May 21. Most will be older shows such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire,"" or earlier seasons from current series such as ""True Blood."" ""HBO has the catalog depth to serve as a game-changer for Amazon,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.Amazon likely agreed to pay $200 million to $400 million a year for the rights to HBO programming, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali estimated.HBO's top program, ""Game of Thrones,"" is not part of the deal. Older hit series ""Sex and the City,"" ""Entourage"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" are also excluded because they are tied up in syndication deals on cable. Episodes of current shows such as ""Girls,"" ""The Newsroom"" and ""Veep"" will become available three years after they run on HBO, the network said.HBO negotiated the streaming deal with Amazon and did not seek bids from other companies, according to two sources familiar with the deal.Amazon has been building its content libraries to tap the growing appetite for online video. Like Netflix, it offers original shows including political comedy ""Alpha House"" starring John Goodman.

100,"  (Adds analyst comments)By Liana B. Baker and Lisa RichwineApril 23 Amazon.com's streaming video service will offer some older shows from premium-cable channel HBO starting next month, a deal that intensifies both companies' competition  with subscription-video service Netflix.This is the first time HBO, owned by Time Warner Inc , has licensed its award-winning programming to an online subscription streaming service, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday.HBO shows are not available through Netflix. Netflix shares fell 4.7 percent to $355.31 on Nasdaq.The deal does not include the entire library of HBO shows that are available on HBO Go streaming service. HBO Go will become an option on Amazon's Fire TV device, but only for subscribers to the HBO cable channel.The partnership with HBO helps Amazon build a stronger case for its Amazon Prime service roughly a month after the largest U.S. online retailer boosted its annual Prime fee to $99 from $79. Prime subscribers will have access to the HBO programming on May 21. Most will be older shows such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire,"" or earlier seasons from current series such as ""True Blood.""""HBO has the catalog depth to serve as a game-changer for Amazon,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.Amazon likely agreed to pay $200 million to $400 million a year for the rights to HBO programming, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali estimated. HBO's top program, ""Game of Thrones,"" is not part of the deal. Older hit series ""Sex and the City,"" ""Entourage"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" are also excluded because they are tied up in syndication deals on cable.Episodes of current shows such as ""Girls,"" ""The Newsroom"" and ""Veep"" will become available three years after they run on HBO, the network said.HBO negotiated the streaming deal with Amazon and did not seek bids from other companies, according to two sources familiar with the deal. Amazon has been building its content libraries to tap the growing appetite for online video. Like Netflix, it offers original shows including political comedy ""Alpha House"" starring John Goodman.A Netflix spokesman said both Amazon and another one of its competitors, video website Hulu ""are acquiring lots of new content that represents the maturation of Internet television, which is great for the consumer.""

101,"  (Adds details on agreement, background on the companies)By Liana B. BakerApril 23 Amazon will begin streaming some HBO shows to its premium customers next month, the companies said on Wednesday, in a move that could lure subscribers away from Netflix Inc, a company they both compete with.The companies said this was the first time HBO, the premium cable channel owned by Time Warner Inc, had licensed its programming to an online subscription streaming service. HBO shows are not available through Netflix.Netflix shares fell 4.9 percent to $354.54.HBO's top program, ""Game of Thrones,"" and shows newer than three years old are not part of the deal. Older hit series ""Sex and the City,"" ""Entourage"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" are also excluded because they are tied up in syndication deals on cable. Amazon has been building up its content libraries to tap the growing appetite for online video, and its Amazon Instant Video product has been taking on Netflix. Like Netflix, Amazon has been dabbling in original programming, with ""Alpha House,"" a comedy starring John Goodman.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Last June, Amazon agreed to pay more than $200 million to Viacom Inc for access to mostly children's programming from channels such as Nickelodeon. At the time, that was Amazon's largest subscription-streaming transaction ever.Amazon Prime customers will have access to the HBO programming on May 21, but most of it will first be older shows such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire,"" or a smattering of earlier seasons from current series such as ""True Blood."" HBO said episodes of shows such as ""Girls,"" ""The Newsroom"" and ""Veep"" will be not be available until three years after it shows them.Popular streaming service HBO Go will also be available on Amazon's Fire TV, a new Internet-based TV device, by the end of the year. While HBO is not letting Amazon get all of its wares, it shows a new willingness on the network's part to be flexible in licensing as well as a shift away from agreements with traditional cable networks. HBO's past licensing deals have been with networks such as E!, TV Guide Network and A&E.Older seasons of serialized shows will fare better online than on traditional cable, and the Amazon deal could ultimately draw in new subscribers to the premium channel.Time Warner broke out HBO's financials for the first time last quarter, giving investors a better picture of how the business stacks up against Netflix.HBO's operating income rose 8 percent to $1.7 billion last year. While the unit is much more profitable than Netflix, it is growing much more slowly in terms of revenue and subscribers than the younger company.Time Warner shares were 1.3 percent higher at $65.73, while Amazon fell 1.1 percent to $325.70.

116,"  LOS ANGELES May 5 Netflix Inc  confirmed on Monday its dark comedy ""Orange Is the New Black"" has been renewed for a third season after one of the show's stars announced the news on social media.Actress Laura Prepon, who plays incarcerated drug smuggler Alex Vause in the online streaming platform's original series following inmates at a women's prison, posted ""It's official!! Season 3!!"" with a picture on Instagram. The news comes ahead of the second season of the raunchy series, adapted from Piper Kerman's biography of her experiences while jailed at a women's prison, which will debut with the  release of all 13 episodes on June 6. The show, which premiered on Netflix last summer and became a hit among audiences and critics, features a diverse cast led by actress Taylor Schilling, who plays a version of author Kerman. Schilling was nominated for an Emmy last year. ""Orange Is the New Black"" is one of the big shows in  Netflix's original programming push led by political drama ""House of Cards."" The online streaming company has challenged traditional network and cable television by releasing every episode in a season at once.

119,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON One U.S. Supreme Court justice referred to Netflix as “Netflick.” Another seemed not to know that HBO is a cable channel. A third appeared to think most software coding could be tossed off in a mere weekend. These and other apparent gaffes by the justices during oral arguments have became a source of bemused derision, as tech aficionados, legal experts and others have taken to social media, blogs, YouTube and other outlets to proclaim the justices black-robed techno-fogeys.“Everyone who’s anyone inside that courtroom is most likely an incompetent Luddite,” Sarah Jeong, a 25-year-old Harvard Law School student, wrote on her personal blog following a recent Supreme Court argument dealing with a copyright dispute over TV online startup Aereo.When it comes to cutting-edge technology, Jeong told Reuters: ""Mom and Dad are the Supreme Court.""Parker Higgins, a 26-year-old digital rights advocate who works at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, spliced together audio of the Aereo argument for comic effect and posted it on a sound cloud and at YouTube.About a minute long, it's a compilation of the justices' references to ""the cloud,"" highlighting some misuse of terminology and uncertainty about how the technology works.""Sometimes it's just amusing and sometimes it's really troubling,"" Higgins said. ""The justices are just unfamiliar with how the industry works. (They) don't understand how software comes together.""The court, via spokeswoman Kathy Arberg, declined comment on the recent criticism.    SLOW TO CHANGE The sense that the Washington, D.C.-based court is slow to embrace technology is heightened by its having persistently resisted calls to allow cameras or personal recording devices into its hallowed halls. Visitors, including reporters, are allowed to take only a pen and pad into the grand marble courtroom. The court has a simple website and no presence on social media. During oral arguments, the justices can be seen thumbing through hard copies of court papers, in contrast to some lower courts where judges tap away on laptop computers.In some ways the debate reflects the well-known generational divide over technology. Young people tend to be the early adopters. The average age of the Supreme Court's nine justices is just over 68. At 54, Justice Elena Kagan is the youngest on the court. Four of her colleagues are over 70 and several have served on the court since cellphones were the size of bricks.Some critics say the Supreme Court’s apparent lack of awareness about the technology that increasingly permeates the lives of everyday Americans could have real consequences as the court grapples with such issues this term as maintaining privacy in the digital age, when software is eligible for patent protection, and the future of the TV industry.To be sure, some long-time court observers are not too concerned that the justices occasionally seem clueless about the latest computer hardware or software. What matters, they say, is what's ultimately in their rulings, not the bantering and parrying of oral arguments, when justices fire questions at the lawyers who appear before them.      No one attending a court session should expect ""the equivalent of a TED Talk on technology and the law,"" said Andy Pincus, a veteran Supreme Court litigator, referring to the popular lecture series. Court experts said justices take tech issues seriously, even if they make the occasional slip during oral arguments. The justices read “friend of the court” briefs from experts in the field, and some had experience in the realm of science and technology before joining the bench. Justice Stephen Breyer worked on regulations as a U.S. Senate staffer and wrote widely on issues related to technology and the law. If all else fails, they can turn to their twentysomething law clerks. JUDICIAL RANKINGS In late April, Mashable.com ranked the justices on their perceived knowledge of technology, based on comments they made during oral arguments in the Aereo case. The question before the court in the case is whether Aereo, which charges users a low monthly fee to stream live broadcasts of TV channels, violates copyright law.Justice Sonia Sotomayor was ranked number one, because she appeared to be familiar with such products as Roku Inc's streaming video device and services that store files on the Internet, such as Apple Inc's iCloud - although she was also the justice responsible for the ""Netflick"" comment. Ranked last, Justice Antonin Scalia was faulted for the HBO remark. Justice Breyer was somewhere in the middle. He was seen as being out of touch for making several references to ""phonograph records.""FROM PATENTS TO PHONES  Other tech cases have prompted similar ribbing.Some techies chided Justice Anthony Kennedy for suggesting in a software patents case in March that code to implement an idea could be done by ""any computer group of people sitting around a coffee shop"" over a weekend.In another closely watched case, over whether police should be able to search smartphones without warrants, Chief Justice John Roberts alarmed privacy advocates when he sharply questioned a lawyer about her assumption that many people carry more than one cellphone.""What is your authority for the statement that many people have multiple cellphones on their person?"" he asked Judith Mizner, a public defender arguing on behalf of a criminal defendant. ""That was definitely an odd moment,"" said Orin Kerr, a professor at George Washington Law School.It remains to be seen what, if anything, the justices' comments this term mean for the intersection of law and technology, say Kerr and others. The key tech cases have yet to be decided, and it's unlikely the stray remarks will be echoed in the justices' written opinions, due out by the end of June.

120,"  (Recasts first paragraph with entertainment apps, adds executive quote, details throughout)By Malathi NayakSAN FRANCISCO May 13 Microsoft Corp  will take $100 off the price of its Xbox One gaming console and let users view popular entertainment apps such as Netflix and ESPN without a $60-plus ""Live"" subscription, hoping to spur sales against rival devices like Sony's Playstation 4 and Amazon's Fire TV.The moves mark another reversal for the software giant on the Xbox One, which is lagging Sony's PS4 in sales and faces  competition from existing consoles, streaming boxes such as Apple TV and Amazon's new $99 gaming-and-entertainment device. Microsoft has backtracked several times in marketing its gaming console. It dropped a requirement that Xbox One users maintain a constant Internet connection before the console went on sale. And it decided to allow support for used games after an outpouring of outrage from gamers last year.On Tuesday, the company said it will now sell the Xbox One for $399, or $499 with a ""Kinect"" motion sensor, starting June 9. Executives had previously talked about the Kinect, which tracks hand and body movements, as integral to the device's experience. ""That's going to appeal to our fans on Xbox 360 who have been excited to try Xbox One but, because of affordability options, haven't had the opportunity,"" Yusuf Mehdi, Xbox vice president for strategy and marketing, said in an interview. ""So we think that's going to grow the market.""As with Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's  Wii U consoles, Xbox One and Xbox 360 users will not be charged by Microsoft to run entertainment apps starting June. Previously, only those who subscribed to its Xbox LIVE game and entertainment streaming service, which starts at $60 a year, could stream content from popular apps such as Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go.Sales of the Xbox one console have lagged Sony's PS4 since their holiday launches. Microsoft Corp said last month it has sold over 5 million Xbox One video game consoles as of April 17.The console went on sale on Nov. 22 in 13 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, a week before Sony's PS4 which sold more than 7 million units as of April 6.

125,"   By Lisa Richwine and Robert-Jan Bartunek | LOS ANGELES/BRUSSELS  LOS ANGELES/BRUSSELS Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) will launch its online movie and TV subscription service in six more European countries including France and Germany this year, a test of its global expansion strategy as it faces a patchwork of local rules and competitors.The other new countries it will enter in late 2014 are Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, the California-based company said on Wednesday. Details on programming and pricing in each country will be announced later.Netflix, which already operates in Britain, Scandinavia and the Netherlands, will offer a mix of Hollywood movies and TV series in the new markets and plans to include its own original shows such as ""House of Cards"" where possible.However, it does not have exclusive rights to all its own shows in all markets - House of Cards, for example, has been broadcast in Germany by ProsiebenSat1 (PSMGn.DE) and Sky Deutschland SKYDn.DE.Netflix will compete with other video streaming services, such as Canal Play Infinity of Vivendi's (VIV.PA) Canal Plus in France, as well as Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Prime Instant Video and ProSiebenSat1's Maxdome in Germany.A possible merger of Britain's largest pay-TV company BSkyB BSY.L with Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, would add a further strong player on the European market with which Netflix would need to compete for rights and customers.The success of Netflix in the Netherlands points to the challenges local operators could face in the new markets.Since launching in the country in September 2013, the U.S. company has won about 500,000 customers, Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Matthijs van Leijenhorst estimates. Dutch cable operator Ziggo said that it lost 16,000 digital pay-TV subscribers in the first quarter of this year because of increased competition from providers such as Netflix.Netflix may be able to win over customers by offering low monthly fees in its new countries. In the Netherlands, a subscription costs 8.99 euros ($12.31) a month, while in Britain Netflix costs 5.99 pounds ($10.09).In Belgium, for example, that compares with cable operator Telenet's (TNET.BR) on-demand packages of between 14.95 and 24.95 euros per month and Belgacom's BCOM.BR 14.95 euro movies and series pass.FIGHT BACK  However, local operators have not simply sat back waiting for Netflix to expand in Europe beyond its current operations.In Germany, ProSiebenSat1 has cut the price of its Maxdome video-on-demand service by almost half over the past year which it said had pushed subscriptions up 120 percent in the first quarter, year-on-year. The service now costs 7.99 euros a month.Belgium's Telenet launched an unlimited video-on-demand service, dubbed ""Rex and Rio"", late last year which offers many hit series such as HBO's Game of Thrones for a monthly fee.France, meanwhile, could also present problems for Netflix as it has a complex set of rules on when movies can be released in different formats.

126,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES May 21 Netflix Inc will launch its online movie and TV subscription service later this year in France, Germany and four other European countries, in a major push into new markets.The other new countries Netflix will enter in late 2014 are Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, the California-based company said in a statement on Wednesday.Netflix previously said it planned a substantial expansion in Europe this year but had not said specifically where. The costs of launching in the new markets  will keep the company's international unit at a loss, Netflix said in an April 21 letter to shareholders.The company will offer a mix of Hollywood, local and global TV series and movies in the new markets. It plans to include Netflix original shows such as ""House of Cards"" where possible, but the company doesn't have rights to all Netflix shows in all markets. Details on programming and pricing in each country will be announced later.Netflix currently has 48 million customers for its monthly subscription service in more than 40 countries, with 35.7 million of them in the United States, where it dominates the subscription video on-demand market. In Europe, the company has been operating in the UK, Scandinavia and the Netherlands. Germany ranks first among European countries in the number of broadband households, with 29.1 million in 2013, according to estimates from SNL Kagan. France is third with 24.7 million, behind Russia.Netflix will compete with other video streaming services, such as Canal Play Infinity from Vivendi's Canal Plus in France, and Amazon.com Inc's Prime Instant Video in Germany. In addition, France has a complex set of rules on when movies can be released in different formats. The rules prohibit a film from appearing on a monthly subscription video service until three years after its debut in theaters, though it can be rented through a set-top box four months after its premiere.Netflix's international unit is losing money as it spends to buy content and market the service.In April, Netflix reported a loss of $35 million for its international segment, less than half of what it was a year earlier.

128,"   By Jason Hughes  LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Thanks to her performance in Netflix's ""Orange Is the New Black,"" Laverne Cox has quietly emerged as one of the nation's most recognizable transgender people. As her star has risen, Cox has taken advantage of her ever-larger platform to speak out about transgender issues, and particularly the fear and harassment experienced by many transgender individuals. Ironically, or perhaps not, Cox graces the cover of Time magazine exactly one month after she failed to make the Time 100 list. She stands as the face of their cover story, ""The Transgender Tipping Point."" Cox credits her fans and supporters for her appearance on the cover. After failing to make the Time 100 list, the hashtag #WhereIsLaverneCox started trending nationwide. Inside the magazine, Cox opened up about her own struggles growing up, while trying to figure herself out. It was a confusing time, filled with bullying and a lack of support or understanding from her mother and grandmother. This is a big part of why she speaks out now, to help other young people who are struggling with their own identities. ""There's not just one trans story. There's not just one trans experience,"" she said in the interview. ""And I think what  need to understand is that not everybody who is born feels that their gender identity is in alignment with what they're assigned at birth, based on their genitalia. If someone needs to express their gender in a way that is different, that is okay, and they should not be denied healthcare. They should not be bullied. They don't deserve to be victims of violence. ...

137,"   By Alina Selyukh and Marina Lopes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. regulators will review agreements between Netflix, Verizon, Comcast and other content and Internet providers to figure out whether they are causing slow web download speeds for some consumers, especially for streaming video content. Consumers have complained to the Federal Communications Commission about the ongoing spat between Netflix and Internet service providers (ISPs). Both sides accuse each other of causing a slowdown in Internet speeds by the way they route traffic. ""At the heart of this is whether ISPs that provide connectivity in the final mile to the home can advantage or disadvantage content providers, and therefore advantage or disadvantage consumers,"" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday. Large content providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) have historically paid middlemen or ISPs to deliver their content to consumers. The specifics of such agreements, known as ""interconnection"" and sometimes ""peering,"" have been secret and outside of the FCC's regulatory scope.The FCC earlier this year launched a new effort to set rules regulating how broadband providers manage Internet traffic on their networks. Netflix has urged the agency to begin regulating such agreements to do away with fees that content companies pay.Though the FCC has not indicated that it plans to regulate the deals, the agency is now asking multiple Internet service providers and content companies, particularly video service providers, to provide details, Wheeler said.""Consumers need to understand what is occurring when the Internet service they’ve paid for does not adequately deliver the content they desire, especially content they’ve also paid for,"" he told reporters after a monthly FCC meeting.""What we are doing right now is collecting information, not regulating. We are looking under the hood. Consumers want transparency. They want answers. And so do I,"" he said.  In an earlier statement Wheeler said the commission is ""not suggesting that any company is at fault."" Consumer advocates, who support stricter regulatory oversight of relationships between content and Internet providers, welcomed the step and called on the FCC to make details of those agreements public.It is unclear whether the FCC plans to do so.Analysts pegged the FCC's move as a win for Netflix, which on Friday welcomed the move toward more transparency. ""Americans deserve to get the speed and quality of Internet access they pay for,"" Netflix spokesman Joris Evers said in a statement.Netflix earlier this year agreed to pay fees to Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Comcast (CMCSA.O) to bypass middlemen and deliver content directly to the companies' subscribers, ensuring faster speeds.""Netflix has been paying (for traffic delivery) since inception. It wants free, I get it, but someone has to pay for it,"" Jim Cicconi, AT&T Inc (T.N) senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said earlier this week.Netflix streaming accounts for nearly one-third of North American web traffic during peak times, according to research by Sandvine Corp. Netflix vice president for global public policy, Christopher Libertelli, this week said the company already invests money in delivering traffic to the Internet provider.""We pay a lot of money to drop content at the doorstep of an ISP.

138,"  (Rewrites throughout with background)By Alina Selyukh and Marina LopesWASHINGTON, June 13 U.S. regulators will review agreements between Netflix, Verizon, Comcast and other content and Internet providers to figure out whether they are causing slow web download speeds for some consumers, especially for streaming video content.Consumers have complained to the Federal Communications Commission about the ongoing spat between Netflix and Internet service providers (ISPs). Both sides accuse each other of causing a slowdown in Internet speeds by the way they route traffic.""At the heart of this is whether ISPs that provide connectivity in the final mile to the home can advantage or disadvantage content providers, and therefore advantage or disadvantage consumers,"" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday.Large content providers such as Netflix Inc have historically paid middlemen or ISPs to deliver their content to consumers. The specifics of such agreements, known as ""interconnection"" and sometimes ""peering,"" have been secret and outside of the FCC's regulatory scope.The FCC earlier this year launched a new effort to set rules regulating how broadband providers manage Internet traffic on their networks. Netflix has urged the agency to begin regulating such agreements to do away with fees that content companies pay.Though the FCC has not indicated that it plans to regulate the deals, the agency is now asking multiple Internet service providers and content companies, particularly video service providers, to provide details, Wheeler said. ""Consumers need to understand what is occurring when the Internet service they've paid for does not adequately deliver the content they desire, especially content they've also paid for,"" he told reporters after a monthly FCC meeting.""What we are doing right now is collecting information, not regulating. We are looking under the hood. Consumers want transparency. They want answers. And so do I,"" he said.In an earlier statement Wheeler said the commission is ""not suggesting that any company is at fault.""Consumer advocates, who support stricter regulatory oversight of relationships between content and Internet providers, welcomed the step and called on the FCC to make details of those agreements public. It is unclear whether the FCC plans to do so.Analysts pegged the FCC's move as a win for Netflix, which on Friday welcomed the move toward more transparency.""Americans deserve to get the speed and quality of Internet access they pay for,"" Netflix spokesman Joris Evers said in a statement.Netflix earlier this year agreed to pay fees to Verizon Communications and Comcast to bypass middlemen and deliver content directly to the companies' subscribers, ensuring faster speeds. ""Netflix has been paying (for traffic delivery) since inception. It wants free, I get it, but someone has to pay for it,"" Jim Cicconi, AT&T Inc senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said earlier this week.Netflix streaming accounts for nearly one-third of North American web traffic during peak times, according to research by Sandvine Corp.Netflix vice president for global public policy, Christopher Libertelli, this week said the company already invests money in delivering traffic to the Internet provider.""We pay a lot of money to drop content at the doorstep of an ISP. All we're really asking is for the ISPs to swing the door open,"" Libertelli said at the Aspen Institute think tank. ""This has become a new choke point.""The FCC has regulated ""net neutrality"" only on the part of the network that goes from the Internet service providers to the consumer, and has not delved into what happens before that.

148,"  (Adds details on overlooked shows, quotes from nominees)     By Mary Milliken and Eric Kelsey     LOS ANGELES, July 10 Television newcomers ""True Detective,"" a crime drama from HBO, and ""Orange is the New Black,"" a dark prison comedy from Netflix, racked up a dozen Emmy nominations each on Thursday in a challenge to stalwarts like ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Modern Family.""     Online streaming company Netflix Inc, the big disrupter of the Emmys last year, more than doubled its nominations for TV's highest honors to 31 this year. Its political thriller ""House of Cards,"" which stars Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, earned 13 nods for its second season.     HBO's medieval thriller and fan favorite ""Game of Thrones"" received the most nominations - 19 - and pushed the premium cable service's overall nods to 99, the most of any network for the 14th year in a row.         While cable networks and Netflix fared well, the broadcast networks were once again shut out of the top competition, best drama. Last year's winner, AMC's gritty drug tale ""Breaking Bad,"" will compete for its final season, along with the network's ad world drama ""Mad Men,"" ""House of Cards,"" PBS's British period drama ""Downton Abbey,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""True Detective.""     ""It's a horse race between 'True Detective' and 'Breaking Bad,'"" said Cynthia Littleton, the TV editor-in-chief at trade publication Variety.      ""Homeland,"" a big winner in its first year, failed to snag a nomination in the best drama category despite good reviews for the Showtime domestic-terrorism tale in its third season. Claire Danes, who has won best lead actress for a drama for the last two years, was nominated again.           FILM STARS SHINE     ""True Detective,"" which follows a sadistic crime spree in rural Louisiana, earned best actor in a drama nominations for both Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, two of the biggest film stars to move into the thriving television industry.     The co-stars and friends will also do battle with last year's surprise winner, Jeff Daniels from ""The Newsroom,"" as well as Spacey for his conniving congressman, Bryan Cranston for his final turn as the teacher-turned-drug dealer in ""Breaking Bad,"" and Jon Hamm, who plays brooding ad man Don Draper in ""Mad Men.     Hamm has been nominated seven times for his role in the series, which ends next year, but he has not won.      In another cross-over from film, FX's ""Fargo"" mini-series, based on the cult movie from the Coen brothers, notched up 18 nominations, including best actor in a mini-series nods for stars Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman.     In the TV movie category, HBO's ""The Normal Heart,"" based on the true story of an early AIDS activist in New York City, earned 16 nods, including a best actor nomination for Mark Ruffalo and best supporting actress for Julia Roberts.            'QUALITY SELLS' FOR NETFLIX     Last year, Netflix received the first Emmy nominations for shows produced solely for the Internet.     The company has made original programming a priority to lure subscribers around the world, much like Time Warner Inc's  HBO. It has also spurred competition from the likes of Internet retailer Amazon.com Inc, which has had less success with its own forays into TV production.      ""There is such great television being made in the entire landscape of TV right now, but Netflix has an intense respect for the creative process, and they know that quality sells itself,"" ""House of Cards"" creator Beau Willimon told Reuters after the dawn nomination announcement.             Netflix's second big bet is ""Orange is the New Black,"" which is based on the real story of a woman who goes to prison on old drug charges. The nominations this year are for season one, although season two was made available all at once last month.      For the year's best comedy, ""Orange is the New Black"" will compete against ABC's ""Modern Family,"" which won last year. Rounding out the competitors are political satire ""Veep"" and tech-world take-down ""Silicon Valley,"" both from HBO; CBS nerd-fest ""The Big Bang Theory""; and the irreverent comedy ""Louie"" from FX.     Among the new faces in the lead actress categories were Taylor Schilling as the imprisoned Piper Chapman in ""Orange is the New Black"" and Lizzy Caplan as sex researcher Virginia Johnson in ""Masters of Sex.""     ""I am shocked and thrilled and shocked and really, really excited,"" said Caplan. ""Champagne before 6 a.m. is OK, right?""     The 66th Emmy Awards will be broadcast live from the Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles on Aug. 25.

152,"  LOS ANGELES Netflix Inc said on Monday its quarterly profit more than doubled, boosted by strong growth in U.S. and international subscribers as a price increase for its most popular U.S. video streaming plan did not deter new users.Netflix added 570,000 U.S. customers in the second fiscal quarter ended June 30, passing 50 million worldwide subscribers for the first time. It added 1.12 million customers in international markets. bit.ly/UnqT1DThe company's shares rose nearly 1 percent at $456.21 in after-hours trading, after the company also said it expected average revenue per user to rise slowly as it wins over more subscribers at the new prices.The company in May increased the price of its most popular video streaming plan by $1 per month to $9 for new customers in the United States — the company's first price hike in its largest market in three years.The company suffered a consumer exodus and stock plunge after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011. Netflix executives also said they were contemplating an eventual move into China, the world's most populous country. ""It's conspicuously large, and it's conspicuously a growing and very strong economy,"" David Wells, Netflix's chief financial officer, said on a video-streamed conference call with analysts. ""Look for the future in terms of an answer from us in China.""Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings cautioned that any move into China, if it happens, would occur far in the future. ""We're not thinking about it hard right now,"" Hastings said in an interview. ""We are really focused on Europe at this point.""The company said it planned to expand into Germany, France,  Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg in September, taking its international addressable market to more than 180 million broadband households — double the current U.S. market. Netflix has invested in original series such as ""House of Cards"" and the Emmy-nominated ""Orange is the New Black"" to square off against competition from online video players Amazon.com Inc and Hulu. The June release of a second season of ""Orange"" helped lure customers during the quarter, Netflix said.The company's profit rose to $71 million, or $1.15 per share, from $29.5 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.34 billion from $1.07 billion.

153,"  (Adds comments from Netflix executives)LOS ANGELES, July 21 Netflix Inc said on Monday its quarterly profit more than doubled, boosted by strong growth in U.S. and international subscribers as a price increase for its most popular U.S. video streaming plan did not deter new users.Netflix added 570,000 U.S. customers in the second fiscal quarter ended June 30, passing 50 million worldwide subscribers for the first time. It added 1.12 million customers in international markets. bit.ly/UnqT1DThe company's shares rose nearly 1 percent at $456.21 in after-hours trading, after the company also said it expected average revenue per user to rise slowly as it wins over more subscribers at the new prices.The company in May increased the price of its most popular video streaming plan by $1 per month to $9 for new customers in the United States - the company's first price hike in its largest market in three years. The company suffered a consumer exodus and stock plunge after it announced an unpopular price increase in July 2011.Netflix executives also said they were contemplating an eventual move into China, the world's most populous country. ""It's conspicuously large, and it's conspicuously a growing and very strong economy,"" David Wells, Netflix's chief financial officer, said on a video-streamed conference call with analysts. ""Look for the future in terms of an answer from us in China."" Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings cautioned that any move into China, if it happens, would occur far in the future. ""We're not thinking about it hard right now,"" Hastings said in an interview. ""We are really focused on Europe at this point.""The company said it planned to expand into Germany, France,  Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg in September, taking its international addressable market to more than 180 million broadband households - double the current U.S. market. Netflix has invested in original series such as ""House of Cards"" and the Emmy-nominated ""Orange is the New Black"" to square off against competition from online video players Amazon.com Inc and Hulu. The June release of a second season of ""Orange"" helped lure customers during the quarter, Netflix said.The company's profit rose to $71 million, or $1.15 per share, from $29.5 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier.

163,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK, July 29  NEW YORK, July 29 With some of Wall Street's more volatile names set to report in the next couple of days, traders who bet on big swings in shares are hoping to see moves more like Facebook than Netflix.Netflix, along with Gilead Sciences and several other stocks famous for their sharp gyrations, were unusually calm following their latest quarterly reports. However, Amazon.com and Facebook have had big days after their reports, heightening expectations for upcoming releases from Tesla Motors Inc and Expedia Inc.For volatility investors, the direction of the move is not important, just the magnitude. Traders use an option strategy known as a straddle - buying a bullish call option and a bearish put option at the same strike price - in a bet that a stock will move by a certain amount. Even if a stock rises, the trader can lose money if it moves less than implied by the combined cost of the put and call options.On average, the realized stock change on earnings is about 1.5 percent lower than expected, according to derivatives strategists at Credit Suisse in New York.""Many of the companies that are typically volatile have had in-line numbers, which wouldn't result in a materially volatile stocks afterwards,"" said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners in Palm Beach, Florida.Expedia and Tesla are both due to report results on Thursday. Over the past eight quarters, both have averaged a move of about 15 percent following results, according to Thomson Reuters data. Based on where they traded on Monday, investors expect a move of 9.4 percent for Expedia and 7.8 percent for Tesla. Investors trading options in 3D Systems Corp, scheduled to report on Wednesday, are looking for an 11 percent move in shares, compared with the eight-quarter median of 6 percent, according to Goldman Sachs.VOLATILITY SUCCESSES Recent days have seen more volatility among individual names. Amazon.com Inc on Friday tumbled almost 10 percent following results, while both Facebook Inc and Chipotle Mexican Grill soared to records. Amazon lost more than $34 on the day after reporting results. The options market had priced in a $22 move. Facebook shares rose as much as $5.45, beyond the $4.92 move estimated by the options market, said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.Still, moves like these have been the exception this season, in an environment where the CBOE Volatility index is less than 13, well below its historical average of 20. Netflix Inc  fell 5 percent in the week after its results, less than a third of its nearly 19 percent average move over the past eight quarters.""One might expect a little more volatility to the downside, which we haven't seen,"" said Peter Cecchini, managing director and chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. ""We could be in a calm before the storm, there's a lot of complacency.""

170,"  (Adds further details of FCC proposal, Nancy Pelosi letter)LOS ANGELES, Sept 8 Video streaming service Netflix Inc will join Reddit, Kickstarter and thousands of other websites on Wednesday in an online protest that calls for strong U.S. rules to ensure equal treatment of Internet traffic.Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, also joined the ranks of Netflix, consumer advocates and others who are calling on the Federal Communications Commission to set stricter rules for Internet service providers (ISPs) by regulating them more like public utilities.The FCC is considering so-called ""net neutrality"" rules that would determine whether Internet providers should be able to charge content companies in some circumstances to ensure their websites or applications load smoothly and quickly.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed allowing payments for prioritized delivery as long as the deals are deemed ""commercially reasonable."" Critics, however, worry this could lead to fast lanes for websites that pay broadband providers for quicker delivery, and slow lanes for companies that do not pay. A federal court in January struck down the FCC's earlier version of the rules in a case brought by Verizon Communications Inc.On Wednesday, Netflix and other websites will display a spinning icon that represents a slow-loading Internet, with a link to more information about the FCC's proposal. On Netflix, the icon will appear on the Netflix.com home pages for members and non-members. No videos will be slowed.Thousands of other websites will display the spinning icon, according to a statement from consumer group Free Press, one of the organizers of the online protest. Internet campaigns have impacted policy issues in the past. In 2012, a massive online mobilization of Internet users and major websites helped sink U.S. anti-piracy legislation.Netflix, Free Press and other advocates have urged the FCC to reclassify ISPs as telecommunications services rather than the less-regulated information services they are now. They say the move would give more power to the FCC to stop potential violators of net neutrality. ISPs such as Comcast Corp and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC, staunchly oppose the reclassification idea. Wheeler has not proposed reclassification as the solution, but has not taken it off the table as a potential option.""Innovators prefer bright-line rules and worry the proposed rules would force them into commercial arrangements that require payments of tolls in cash or equity to get their ideas on the Internet,"" Pelosi, of California, wrote in a letter to Wheeler on Monday.""I oppose special Internet fast lanes, only open to those firms large enough to pay big money or fraught enough to give up big stakes in their company,"" Pelosi wrote, asking the FCC to reclassify ISPs.The FCC is collecting public comments on the net neutrality proposal through September 15.

But the question of whether the regulator needs to expand its reach to online outlets or reduce its grip on domestic companies is still up for debate. The hearings, which will run for two weeks, will include appearances by media and distribution company CEOs, unions and public advocacy groups.The federal government is also looking for the CRTC to force distributors to offer smaller packages of channels, saying Canadian viewers should not be compelled to pay for channels they don't watch in order to get the channels they do want.The implications may extend beyond Canada's borders.

175,"   By Gwénaëlle Barzic and Leila Abboud | PARIS  PARIS When Netflix launches its video streaming service in France and Germany next week, it will have to contend with the locals' preference for watching content in their own languages as well as the presence of formidable pay-TV competitors.The California-based company's growth and profitability hinges on the next chapter of its four-year old international expansion in which it is set to enter six European countries, including Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg.The move would expand Netflix's potential market to 180 million homes -- double the number of homes with broadband connections in the United States where the service has 36 million customers and consumes up to a third of bandwidth on telecom networks at peak hours. [ID:nL4N0PW47V]Chief Executive Reed Hastings must walk a tightrope when launching in new countries, said analyst Toby Syfret of Enders Analysis, because the group must absorb significant content and other investment costs to build up in each market before reaching profitability. [ID:nL4N0PX4EW]But Netflix has gotten the formula right since 2012 launches in Britain, the Netherlands and Nordic countries, where viewers are also comfortable watching shows in English, and may break even there next year.""I think Netflix will face a much stiffer test in France and Germany because of the language issue,"" said Syfret. When French and Germans watch American movies and TV series, they tend to be dubbed and not sub-titled, a factor that could slow Netflix down. ""It will need to invest in localized content but the question remains how much and if it can afford it."" CROWDED FIELD Pay-television operators in France's Canal Plus, which is owned by Vivendi, and Germany's Sky Deutschland, have already launched streaming video services to blunt Neflix's arrival. They are betting their established brands and exclusive content, especially live sports, will keep customers loyal to their core pay-TV subscriptions, despite higher prices, even if some will try Netflix on the side.Others such as France's leading telecoms operator Orange and German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 have also created similar offerings to Netflix. There are at least four streaming services in Germany already: Maxdome from ProSieben, Snap from Sky, Prime Instant Video from Amazon, and Watchever from Vivendi.Both countries have a multitude of free-to-air channels that broadcast movies and series, and Germans especially are not in the habit of paying extra for TV, analysts said.   ""They are not entering virgin territory where everything is for the taking,"" said Philippe Bailly, consultant for media companies at NPA Conseil in Paris.In France, Netflix also has to contend with telecom companies who deliver TV services to almost half of households via set-top boxes. Netflix has not yet signed with Orange, SFR, Bouygues Telecom, Iliad or cable operator Numericable so that it would be accessible on people's televisions directly instead of only over the Internet.Industry executives who declined to be named said Netflix was likely to eventually strike deals with broadband providers as it had in the United States and Britain. But Bailly said its absence from the distribution channel could slow its French roll-out and thinks it will take some 18 months to hit 1 million subscribers. HOME GROWN Nevertheless, taking a page from the playbook of its U.S. operation which created hits like prison comedy ""Orange is the New Black"", Netflix plans to produce an original series in France, called ""Marseille"", a political thriller set in the southern port city. It also bought the rights to a French kids cartoon called Wakfu created by an independent studio Ankama in northern France.It's expected to take similar steps in Germany to produce content in partnership with local studios.But tailoring Netflix to European tastes is not expected to come cheap.

176,"  * Launches seen in six countries including France, Germany* Challenge to offer content in local languages* Pay-TV leaders Canal Plus, Sky have created copycatsBy Gwénaëlle Barzic and Leila AbboudPARIS, Sept 12 When Netflix launches its video streaming service in France and Germany next week, it will have to contend with the locals' preference for watching content in their own languages as well as the presence of formidable pay-TV competitors.The California-based company's growth and profitability hinges on the next chapter of its four-year old international expansion in which it is set to enter six European countries, including Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg.The move would expand Netflix's potential market to 180 million homes -- double the number of homes with broadband connections in the United States where the service has 36 million customers and consumes up to a third of bandwidth on telecom networks at peak hours.Chief Executive Reed Hastings must walk a tightrope when launching in new countries, said analyst Toby Syfret of Enders Analysis, because the group must absorb significant content and other investment costs to build up in each market before reaching profitability.But Netflix has gotten the formula right since 2012 launches in Britain, the Netherlands and Nordic countries, where viewers are also comfortable watching shows in English, and may break even there next year. ""I think Netflix will face a much stiffer test in France and Germany because of the language issue,"" said Syfret.When French and Germans watch American movies and TV series, they tend to be dubbed and not sub-titled, a factor that could slow Netflix down.""It will need to invest in localised content but the question remains how much and if it can afford it.""CROWDED FIELD  Pay-television operators in France's Canal Plus, which is owned by Vivendi, and Germany's Sky Deutschland , have already launched streaming video services to blunt Neflix's arrival. They are betting their established brands and exclusive content, especially live sports, will keep customers loyal to their core pay-TV subscriptions, despite higher prices, even if some will try Netflix on the side.Others such as France's leading telecoms operator Orange  and German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 have also created similar offerings to Netflix. There are at least four streaming services in Germany already: Maxdome from ProSieben, Snap from Sky, Prime Instant Video from Amazon , and Watchever from Vivendi.Both countries have a multitude of free-to-air channels that broadcast movies and series, and Germans especially are not in the habit of paying extra for TV, analysts said.""They are not entering virgin territory where everything is for the taking,"" said Philippe Bailly, consultant for media companies at NPA Conseil in Paris. In France, Netflix also has to contend with telecom companies who deliver TV services to almost half of households via set-top boxes. Netflix has not yet signed with Orange, SFR, Bouygues Telecom, Iliad or cable operator Numericable so that it would be accessible on people's televisions directly instead of only over the Internet.Industry executives who declined to be named said Netflix was likely to eventually strike deals with broadband providers as it had in the United States and Britain. But Bailly said its absence from the distribution channel could slow its French roll-out and thinks it will take some 18 months to hit 1 million subscribers.HOME GROWN Nevertheless, taking a page from the playbook of its U.S. operation which created hits like prison comedy ""Orange is the New Black"", Netflix plans to produce an original series in France, called ""Marseille"", a political thriller set in the southern port city. It also bought the rights to a French kids cartoon called Wakfu created by an independent studio Ankama in northern France.It's expected to take similar steps in Germany to produce content in partnership with local studios.But tailoring Netflix to European tastes is not expected to come cheap. Some investors are already worried about the cost of Netflix's international ambitions, although Netflix shares have risen more than 30 percent this year, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite index, which is up 10 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial, up 3.5 percent.The company has said its international operations would lose about $42 million (32.45 million euro) in the third quarter, while its spending on content overall would hit nearly $3 billion this year.

StarMine's measurement of intrinsic value, which looks at anticipated growth over the next decade, indicates Netflix is one of the most overvalued names in the S&P 500, calculating it should be trading at $99.27, about a fifth of its current price. In premarket, Netflix was up 0.8 percent at $485.30.Still, the stock is a favorite for traders and a long-time ""momentum"" bet, meaning investors are playing it for its future growth prospects as much as its current fundamentals. Barclays wrote that based on the company's international growth plan, ""we believe our estimates are likely achievable and now see the upside/downside to subscriber growth as more balanced.""The firm noted that Netflix was launching its service in France and Germany in the next two weeks: ""Over the next few months, we will be closely watching penetration rates in these regions as, in our view, the crux of Netflix's current valuation rests on the success of their product there.""

But he emphasized that getting the new European countries right was his priority.""After launch is when the real work begins: improving the content being offered and getting on set-top boxes,"" he said. That means deals with broadband and cable groups that allow people to subscribe to Netflix on their TVs instead of over the Internet.Netflix said on Monday that its French service would cost from 7.99 euros to 11.99 a month and give access to films, series and documentaries on television, computers, tablets, smartphones and game consoles. Prices will be the same elsewhere in Europe, the company added.Netflix's future growth and profitability hinges on the next chapter of its four-year-old international expansion in which it is set to enter the six European countries.

It need to absorb significant content and other investment costs to build up in each market before it starts making a profit.The company appears to be getting off to a faster start in France and Germany than in other areas where it has expanded, such as Latin America. It has built a massive data center in eastern Paris to improve the service offered to French consumers by housing a copy of the catalogue there and allowing broadband and cable companies to connect directly. ""We have provisioned capacity for many months of growth and reached for the high end of what we think is possible,"" said Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt.Netflix also signed a distribution deal with the third-largest telecom operator, Bouygues Telecom, which includes interconnection fees to carry its traffic to customers. In Germany, press reports said it would sign with Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom at launch on Tuesday.The company has already backed the creation of an original series called ""Marseille"", a political thriller set in the southern port city, to attract French customers, something it did  much later in its U.S. with exclusive shows like the prison comedy ""Orange is the New Black"". Ted Sarandos, chief content officer, said Netflix was exploring creating new shows in Germany but had not made a decision yet. ""Our original shows are not supposed to be a one-off in Europe,"" he said. In both France and Germany, Netflix will have to contend with local rivals that have offer similar services and have stronger brands, including pay-TV operators Sky Deutschland and Canal Plus. The French and Germans also prefer content dubbed in their local language. Hunt said about 90 percent of the content in France and Germany would be  dubbed and subtitled. Netflix's methods can speed up dubbing so it takes as little as a week, compared with six weeks for most TV shows.  Another feature that drove Netflix's success in the U.S. that will have to be adapted to new territories is the analytical software that examines viewing habits and suggests movies and series to users.  Netflix has roughly 250 people on its 800-strong product team working on the algorithm that powers the recommendation engine. Through their efforts, the service becomes more tailored as the users log on to watch. ""We want to figure out what French people want to watch most and then tweak the catalogue to fit that,"" Sarandos said.With Netflix's expansion in Europe, the debate around ""net neutrality"", or the practice of treating all traffic flowing over broadband networks equally regardless of its sources, will get a powerful new lobbyist. The European Union is now debating a package of telecom reforms that would embed net neutrality into law, barring cable and telecom groups from charging web companies like Netflix and Google for carrying their traffic.Hastings, who has long fought with U.S. telco and cable companies over such fees, said he planned to speak about the issue in a upcoming speech in Brussels.

189,"  BRUSSELS U.S. video streaming service Netflix is in talks with cable and telecoms groups to distribute its content in Belgium, Belgian media reported on Friday, the day the company launched its on-demand service in the country.Netflix is talking with telecoms group Belgacom and privately held cable operator Voo, in an effort to mirror distribution deals with Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Bouygues in France, business daily L'Echo wrote.While Netflix is available online and many newer TV sets and media players have a Netflix application built in, partnering with a telecoms company may help reach those customers who do not have access to such technology.Both former state telecoms monopoly Belgacom, which has 1.5 million TV customers, and Voo, which has nearly 1 million in French-speaking region of Wallonia, declined to comment. Netflix was not immediately available for comment. Cable operator Telenet, which has 2 million TV subscribers, was not mentioned in the report, as the company has feverishly stepped up its preparations to fend off Netflix by launching its own on-demand library.On Wednesday, Telenet announced it had renewed its partnership with U.S. broadcaster HBO for exclusive access to its hit series such as Game of Thrones and announced it would start to make its own Dutch-language TV series. Neflix launched its service in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg this week for 7.99 euros ($10.29) or 11.90 Swiss francs ($12.70) per month. It is also available in Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries.

190,"  BRUSSELS, Sept 25 Belgian telecoms group Telenet  ruled out further payouts to shareholders this year due to fiercer competition in the Belgian market, including the entrance of U.S. video streaming service Netflix last week.Telenet had said at the time of its first-half results in July that its strong business growth and cash flow flexibility should translate into attractive future shareholder value.However, it said its board would decide on shareholder remuneration towards the end of the third quarter. In a statement on Thursday, the company said its board had decided not to propose any payouts at this stage beyond a 50 million euro ($63.7 million) share buyback announced at the start of the year. Last year, it returned 950 million euros to shareholders via a 7.90 euro per share payout and share buyback of up to 50 million euros. Telenet is facing increased competition from incumbents such as Belgacom and now facing a challenge to its core TV business, with last week's launch of Netflix in Belgium.Telenet, with 2 million TV subscribers, has responded by launching its own on-demand library and renewed its partnership with U.S. broadcaster HBO for exclusive access to hits series such as Game of Thrones.

209,"  NEW YORK Oct 4 Redbox Instant, a streaming video service operated by Verizon Communications Inc and Outerwall Inc's Redbox, will shut down next week because the venture has not been as successful as hoped, the two companies announced Saturday.The service, which combined the Redbox DVD rental kiosk business with a streaming video offering from Verizon, was launched in 2013 to compete against online video company Netflix Inc, but never caught on with consumers.Redbox Instant will shut down on Oct. 7th, the companies said in a joint statement. ""The joint venture partners made this decision after careful consideration,"" the statement said. ""The service had not been as successful as either partner hoped it would be."" Subscribers will receive an email notifying them of the termination of the service. A separate email will be sent on Oct. 10 with details on refunds, the statement said.

213,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Netflix Inc is on a mission to start closing the yawning gap between the theatrical debut of movies and their availability for online streaming, forcing Hollywood to rethink where to release new films.With a sequel to martial-arts drama ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and four Adam Sandler movies, Netflix will have brand-new content for subscribers around the world. That instant access is much quicker than the typical 7-to-18 months Netflix must wait to stream new releases from Hollywood studios.Netflix has said it believes new and exclusive movies will help it build on its base of 50 million global customers. The company will release its latest subscriber numbers in its quarterly report on Wednesday, when it is expected to face questions about the original movie strategy.Sandler's films will go straight to Netflix in the nearly 50 countries where the company operates. The international rights are key because many movie rights are tied up by other providers in overseas territories.Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible estimates Netflix will spend up to $40 million on production of each Sandler film. That cost would be similar to what Netflix pays to stream a single film from a Hollywood producer such as DreamWorks Animation months later, he said. ""The perk here is you don't have to wait nine months,"" said Wible. ""You have something you have exclusive access to across the globe."" If it can convince more stars and directors to accept straight-to-streaming deals, Netflix could shake up movies as it did television. In the case of its original series like ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black,"" it has fueled binge viewing by releasing all episodes at once. Netflix also won the first major Emmy awards for a series delivered online. With more original movie deals in the works for Netflix, Hollywood directors told Reuters they are weighing the pros and cons.David Ayer, director of the coming World War II drama ""Fury"" starring Brad Pitt, said he ""absolutely"" could be lured by an online distributor for a future project. ""The screens we watch on are becoming handheld (and) portable,"" he said. ""It's the future of the business.""   Ayer said he was hopeful that an online platform would grant him the same artistic freedom that Sony Pictures did with ""Fury."" ""That's what studios need to do in order to maintain access to the labor of love of a filmmaker,"" he said.Others in Hollywood may resist going to Netflix first. Ned Benson, a first-time writer and director, took an unconventional approach for his release of ""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby,"" creating three separate films called ""Him,"" ""Her"" and ""Them."" While it seemed logical to release the three installments via video on demand for binge viewing at home, Benson wanted the films shown in theaters first.""I really still believe in the theatrical model and the movie-going experience, even though we live in this day and age where you can stream and do things online via Netflix or VOD,"" Benson said. ""I feel like we still have that option later.""   The plan to release ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend"" on Netflix in all of its markets in August on the same day the movie appears in select IMAX theaters has also raised the hackles of some theater owners. Chains AMC Entertainment, Regal Entertainment Group and Cinemark Holdings Inc are refusing to show the film.It remains to be seen whether such opposition will deter other filmmakers from playing ball with Netflix in the future.

214,"   By Jennifer Saba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Time Warner Inc's HBO will launch a standalone online streaming service next year to make hit shows such as ""Game of Thrones"" available to people who do not subscribe to cable television. The move to take HBO ""over-the-top"" - media jargon that means consumers can watch the channel with only a broadband connection - is a significant milestone for a channel long dependent on cable distributors. It could be a further catalyst spurring more people to dump their cable subscriptions by cutting the cord. It could also prompt other media companies to follow HBO's lead.HBO's chief executive, Richard Plepler, announced the move during an investor day on Wednesday where Time Warner's other top executives laid out plans to boost the company's growth.""In 2015 we will go beyond the wall and launch a standalone,  over-the-top service with the potential to produce hundreds of millions in revenue,"" Plepler said, making a reference to HBO's massive hit show ""Game of Thrones.""""We will use all means at our disposal to grow. This is the most exciting inflection point both domestically and internationally in the modern history of HBO.""Plepler cited that 10 million homes in the United States are broadband-only, without cable subscriptions. Half of those homes subscribe to streaming video services. ""These consumers have no access to HBO. It's a large opportunity that should not be untapped,"" he said.Shares of Time Warner, also home to movie studio Warner Bros and cable network channels Turner Broadcasting, rose 2.2 percent to close at $72.21, still short of the $85 per share offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc which it rejected over the summer.   Streaming video provider Netflix Inc, which announced quarterly results on Wednesday, said it had long viewed HBO as its top competitor.""It was inevitable and sensible that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application,"" said Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings in a letter to investors. ""Many people will subscribe to both Netflix and HBO since we have different shows, so we think it is likely we both prosper as consumers move to Internet TV.""Plepler did not disclose the price or other details about the forthcoming service. HBO currently allows cable subscribers to access its content - including popular shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex and the City"" - on mobile devices through an app known as HBO Go.HBO's announcement comes as Time Warner feels pressure to boost its share price after it rebuffed an $85 per share offer from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox in August.  DISRUPTING THE ECOSYSTEM Time Warner executives emphasized the new service will not cut into the existing lucrative revenue stream with cable distributors and that HBO Go will crack open new markets. The fear of cable distributors is that consumers will drop more expensive cable and satellite packages in favor of cobbling together their own bundle.Plepler said that distributors are looking for opportunities to increase their business, and that premium content is one way to do that.  ""I have spoken to almost every CEO of every major distributor. I don't think anyone is upset, it's their broadband and their ISP. I don't believe any of these things are mutually exclusive.""Still, setting HBO free could further upset the content-distributor ecosystem, as other media companies mull similar options with their channels.""Cable programmers like Viacom and A&E are thrilled that HBO is shining a light down a path they may all have to contemplate in the future,"" wrote James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. Pay TV networks Starz and Showtime have indicated they would like to move in a similar direction. Showtime, a unit of CBS Corp, said in a statement on Wednesday that a standalone streaming video service is ""something that we have been examining for some time."" Starz on Monday announced plans to sell a direct-to-consumer streaming video service called Starz Play in Latin America, West Africa, the Middle East and Asia, starting next year.

218,"   By Lisa Richwine  Netflix Inc signed up fewer video streaming subscribers than forecast for the quarter that ended in September as its U.S. growth slowed markedly, sending its shares plunging as much as 27 percent.The company, which operates in nearly 50 countries, blamed a $1 price hike, to $8.99 a month, for discouraging new sign-ups. It lured 3.02 million new streaming customers globally, versus the 3.69 million it projected in July. Netflix attracted about 980,000 new customers in the United States, its largest market, down from 1.29 million in the same period a year earlier.The news came after Time Warner Inc's HBO said on Wednesday it will offer new competition next year with a streaming service that does not require a pay TV subscription. ""Year-on-year net additions in the U.S. were down,"" the company said in a quarterly letter to shareholders. ""As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago."" Shares of Netflix fell 25 percent to $333.53 in after-hours trading, from its close of $448.59 on Nasdaq.Netflix, waving off fears that a standalone HBO would draw users away, argued in its letter that many will subscribe to both services because they offer different shows. ""It is likely we both prosper as consumers move to Internet TV,"" the company's letter said.Netflix, the world's largest video-streaming service, has invested in original series such as ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" to compete with rivals such as HBO, Amazon.com Inc and on-demand offerings from pay TV providers.Netflix also recently announced a push into original movies, making deals to finance four Adam Sandler films and a sequel to the Oscar-winning martial-arts drama ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" The HBO news, overall stock market weakness, and the subscriber forecast miss likely sparked the selloff in Netflix shares, Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst. But he said Netflix has proven it can bounce back from disappointing quarters.""They have got a good track record in growing past this turbulence,"" said Ernst, who has a ""buy"" rating on Netflix shares.The company forecast it will add 4 million streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter.Netflix is spending to ramp up its service in more countries.

219,"  (Adds Netflix comments on HBO, analyst comments)By Lisa RichwineOct 15 Netflix Inc signed up fewer video streaming subscribers than forecast for the quarter that ended in September as its U.S. growth slowed markedly, sending its shares plunging as much as 27 percent.The company, which operates in nearly 50 countries, blamed a $1 price hike, to $8.99 a month, for discouraging new sign-ups. It lured 3.02 million new streaming customers globally, versus the 3.69 million it projected in July. (bit.ly/1sK5iPy)Netflix attracted about 980,000 new customers in the United States, its largest market, down from 1.29 million in the same period a year earlier.The news came after Time Warner Inc's HBO said on Wednesday it will offer new competition next year with a streaming service that does not require a pay TV subscription.""Year-on-year net additions in the U.S. were down,"" the company said in a quarterly letter to shareholders. ""As best we can tell, the primary cause is the slightly higher prices we now have compared to a year ago."" Shares of Netflix fell 25 percent to $333.53 in after-hours trading, from its close of $448.59 on Nasdaq.Netflix, waving off fears that a standalone HBO would draw users away, argued in its letter that many will subscribe to both services because they offer different shows.""It is likely we both prosper as consumers move to Internet TV,"" the company's letter said.Netflix, the world's largest video-streaming service, has invested in original series such as ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" to compete with rivals such as HBO, Amazon.com Inc and on-demand offerings from pay TV providers. Netflix also recently announced a push into original movies, making deals to finance four Adam Sandler films and a sequel to the Oscar-winning martial-arts drama ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""The HBO news, overall stock market weakness, and the subscriber forecast miss likely sparked the selloff in Netflix shares, Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst. But he said Netflix has proven it can bounce back from disappointing quarters.""They have got a good track record in growing past this turbulence,"" said Ernst, who has a ""buy"" rating on Netflix shares.

A second nurse in Texas tested positive for the Ebola virus, a week after Thomas Eric Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States, died. The day's losses threatened to wipe out 2014 gains for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, with the S&P 500 down more than 3 percent at its session low. The Dow industrials fell further into the red for the year, and closed down for the fifth consecutive session.The pace and depth of the selloff have surprised many investors, who have banked on the market closing out the year with at least modest gains. The S&P 500 is now down 7.4 percent from its Sept. 18 record closing high, and is up just 0.8 percent for the year.""It seems like we got through a good chunk of the year with almost no volatility and almost no movement and in the last month, suddenly the trading community seems to have taken over the stock market like it did several years back,"" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer, North Star Investment Management Corp, in Chicago.Kuby said while his firm has not made any major switches in its allocations, it has moved funds out of energy producers and into consumers of energy. The S&P 500 traded in a 57-point range, the widest since August 2011.""If you look at the lows of the day, maybe we've put in a little bit of a trading bottom here. But there's concern about an absence of aggregate demand in the world, and that's really what's weakening the market,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 173.45 points, or 1.06 percent, to 16,141.74, the S&P 500 lost 15.21 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,862.49 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 11.85 points, or 0.28 percent, to 4,215.32. Volume surged. About 11.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, a nearly 50 percent increase from the average daily volume so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Options activity has also spiked along with the market's recent slide. Total options volume at the close on Wednesday was 33 million contracts, the busiest day since Aug. 8, 2011, according to Trade Alert.After the bell, shares of Netflix dropped 25 percent to $336.33 following quarterly results, including net subscriber additions that were below its forecast.On the U.S. economic front, the day's data showed U.S. retail sales and producer prices fell in September, while manufacturing activity in New York slowed to its weakest pace since April.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,655 to 1,466, for a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,500 issues rose and 1,225 fell.(Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2014-10-15,NFLX,"Wed Oct 15, 2014 | 5:54pm EDT","US STOCKS-Major indexes end down, but well off session lows",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-usa-idUSL2N0SA39620141015?type=companyNews
221,"  (Adds comment from Netflix investor letter)By Jennifer SabaNEW YORK Oct 15 Time Warner Inc's HBO will launch a standalone online streaming service next year to make hit shows such as ""Game of Thrones"" available to people who do not subscribe to cable television.The move to take HBO ""over-the-top"" - media jargon that means consumers can watch the channel with only a broadband connection - is a significant milestone for a channel long dependent on cable distributors.It could be a further catalyst spurring more people to dump their cable subscriptions by cutting the cord. It could also prompt other media companies to follow HBO's lead.HBO's chief executive, Richard Plepler, announced the move during an investor day on Wednesday where Time Warner's other top executives laid out plans to boost the company's growth.""In 2015 we will go beyond the wall and launch a standalone,  over-the-top service with the potential to produce hundreds of millions in revenue,"" Plepler said, making a reference to HBO's massive hit show ""Game of Thrones.""""We will use all means at our disposal to grow. This is the most exciting inflection point both domestically and internationally in the modern history of HBO."" Plepler cited that 10 million homes in the United States are broadband-only, without cable subscriptions. Half of those homes subscribe to streaming video services. ""These consumers have no access to HBO. It's a large opportunity that should not be untapped,"" he said.Shares of Time Warner, also home to movie studio Warner Bros and cable network channels Turner Broadcasting, rose 2.2 percent to close at $72.21, still short of the $85 per share offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc which it rejected over the summer.Streaming video provider Netflix Inc, which announced quarterly results on Wednesday, said it had long viewed HBO as its top competitor.""It was inevitable and sensible that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application,"" said Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings in a letter to investors. ""Many people will subscribe to both Netflix and HBO since we have different shows, so we think it is likely we both prosper as consumers move to Internet TV."" Plepler did not disclose the price or other details about the forthcoming service. HBO currently allows cable subscribers to access its content - including popular shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex and the City"" - on mobile devices through an app known as HBO Go.HBO's announcement comes as Time Warner feels pressure to boost its share price after it rebuffed an $85 per share offer from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox in August.DISRUPTING THE ECOSYSTEM  Time Warner executives emphasized the new service will not cut into the existing lucrative revenue stream with cable distributors and that HBO Go will crack open new markets. The fear of cable distributors is that consumers will drop more expensive cable and satellite packages in favor of cobbling together their own bundle.Plepler said that distributors are looking for opportunities to increase their business, and that premium content is one way to do that.""I have spoken to almost every CEO of every major distributor. I don't think anyone is upset, it's their broadband and their ISP. I don't believe any of these things are mutually exclusive.""Still, setting HBO free could further upset the content-distributor ecosystem, as other media companies mull similar options with their channels.""Cable programmers like Viacom and A&E are thrilled that HBO is shining a light down a path they may all have to contemplate in the future,"" wrote James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research.Pay TV networks Starz and Showtime have indicated they would like to move in a similar direction. Showtime, a unit of CBS Corp, said in a statement on Wednesday that a standalone streaming video service is ""something that we have been examining for some time.""Starz on Monday announced plans to sell a direct-to-consumer streaming video service called Starz Play in Latin America, West Africa, the Middle East and Asia, starting next year.

223,"   By Piya Sinha-Roy | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES As sassy stylist Sophia Burset on Netflix's women's prison drama ""Orange Is the New Black,"" actress Laverne Cox has marked a milestone in the portrayal of transgender characters and was the first transgender actress to land an acting Emmy nomination. Now Cox is lending her voice to ""The T Word,"" airing on Viacom Inc's youth-orientated MTV and Logo TV on Friday, a documentary profiling young transgender kids who transitioned in their teen years.From 18-year-old Ari in New York and Kye, 24, the first transgender Division I basketball player, to 12-year-old Zoe in Los Angeles, each person discusses challenges encountered daily as a transgender teen.Cox, 30, spoke to Reuters about lending her voice to ""The T Word,"" what needs to change about portrayals of the transgender community in media and her dream role. Q: What are some of the biggest misconceptions about the transgender community in media?A: The biggest obstacle is that when people assume that trans people are always and only the gender we were assigned at birth. Most of the arguments against us having equal rights in the law and having our gender identities acknowledged has to do with the point of view that we're not really who we say we are. So we see that reflected in public policy that won't allow us to change our name or recognize health insurance or deny us jobs ....   What I wanted to do with this documentary is move the representation of trans people away from transition and surgery and body. Certainly our bodies matter but we are more than our bodies, and I wanted to move away from the focus on what body parts trans people have and what surgeries we have and haven't had. I believe those narratives have objectified trans people and sensationalized their identities.Q: How do shows like Netflix's ""Orange"" and Amazon's ""Transparent"" help audiences understand transgender people?A: A lot of people didn't watch (""Orange"") knowing there'd be a trans character, so they found themselves relating to this trans character as a human being in a human way.   Where our medium is powerful is the way that we can connect with people as people. So it becomes harder for us to say they don't deserve rights, that they don't deserve to have the same things that everybody else has, and that's the wonderful thing that my representation has connected in a human way. And I see that in ""Transparent"" as well.    Q: What has the biggest challenge been in your career and how have things changed after ""Orange is the New Black""?A: Pre-""Orange,"" I played a lot of sex workers. I don't dehumanize or stigmatize sex work, I believe people who do sex work are people too, and they deserve to have their stories told in a human way. The roles that I'd agreed to do that were about sex work was because I thought they had humanity in those characters.Since (then), there's one independent film I've done that I can't talk about yet and I have a recurring role on MTV's ""Faking It"" where I play a high school drama teacher, and I've never done that before. She's very passionate about her work as a drama coach at a high school and she's really intense and she's really an homage to all of my fantastic ballet teachers growing up and acting teachers that I've had over the years.  Q: What do you love about portraying Sophia on ""Orange""?A: I love that she is really complicated, I love her relationship with her family, her wife and her son Michael. That's really where we find the heart of Sophia, and I love in Season 2 when she did the anatomy lesson, that was a lot of fun.Q: Is there a dream role you'd love to play?A: There's a few things I want to play, but I want to do Lady Macbeth at some point, probably on stage, although a film version of Lady Macbeth would be interesting too.

227,"   By Supantha Mukherjee  Blindsided by a surprise drop in new subscribers to Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), analysts slashed their price targets on the video-streaming company as it shed a fifth of its value on Thursday.Their advice came too late for investors who had followed the recent ""buy"" guidance of at least 20 brokerages - not least BTIG Research, which upgraded the stock just two days before Netflix reported third-quarter results.BTIG set a one-year price target of $600 on a stock that was trading on Thursday afternoon at $362.45, down 19 percent. It said its Oct. 13 upgrade ""could not have been more poorly timed in hindsight.""But, like many others, BTIG is betting on the long-term results of an expensive push by Netflix into original content and more international markets. The title of its Thursday note: ""Roger Roger: Why Selling Netflix Now Is A Mistake.""Netflix, with original shows that include ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"", plans to spend $8.9 billion on acquiring new content in the next few years.With more than a quarter of its 53 million customers now outside the United States, the company is also looking to expand its international business to reach new viewers and increase its buying clout with content providers.BTIG is far from alone in forecasting growth for a company that is financing four Adam Sandler movies and making the sequel to martial-arts drama ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""In a little over a month, Barclays, RBC and Cowen & Co have each raised their price targets. Canaccord Genuity began coverage in September with a ""buy"" rating and $550 price target. But that was before Netflix announced 3.02 million new streaming customers in the quarter ended September, well below its own forecast of 3.69 million. In a market where Netflix is a pioneer, competition is also emerging.CBS Corp (CBS.N) announced plans to launch subscription-based video on demand and live streaming for its TV network just a day after Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) said its HBO channel would launch an online streaming service next year.  'COMPETITION RAMPS UP' Netflix trades at about 76 times forward earnings and scores just 5 out of 100 on Thomson Reuters StarMine Relative Valuation model. The lower the score, the more expensive the stock.Wedbush Securities Inc is one of the few brokerages with an ""underperform"" rating on Netflix, calling its high valuation ""unwarranted given the potential for slowing domestic growth as competition ramps up, coupled with increasing content costs.""At least 19 notes sent by brokerages on Thursday featured a target price cut. In the case of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, the cut was as much as $150; to $375 from $525. CRT Research cut more than its price target; it downgraded the stock to ""fair value"" from ""buy"".""As the company invests heavily in content and expansion, and faces increased competition in 2015, we don't see too many near-term catalysts for the stock,"" CRT said. ""As a result, we are stepping to the side.""Netflix has attributed the subscriber numbers to a jump in monthly subscription fees for new U.S. customers. CEO Reed Hastings, in an interview with CNBC, said Netflix had ""estimated too high"" for the quarter just ended. Despite hefty price cuts, many brokerages maintained their outlook on the stock.

228,"  (Recasts to include previous guidance, adds quotes)By Supantha MukherjeeOct 16 Blindsided by a surprise drop in new subscribers to Netflix Inc, analysts slashed their price targets on the video-streaming company as it shed a fifth of its value on Thursday.Their advice came too late for investors who had followed the recent ""buy"" guidance of at least 20 brokerages - not least BTIG Research, which upgraded the stock just two days before Netflix reported third-quarter results.BTIG set a one-year price target of $600 on a stock that was trading on Thursday afternoon at $362.45, down 19 percent. It said its Oct. 13 upgrade ""could not have been more poorly timed in hindsight.""But, like many others, BTIG is betting on the long-term results of an expensive push by Netflix into original content and more international markets. The title of its Thursday note: ""Roger Roger: Why Selling Netflix Now Is A Mistake.""Netflix, with original shows that include ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"", plans to spend $8.9 billion on acquiring new content in the next few years.With more than a quarter of its 53 million customers now outside the United States, the company is also looking to expand its international business to reach new viewers and increase its buying clout with content providers.BTIG is far from alone in forecasting growth for a company that is financing four Adam Sandler movies and making the sequel to martial-arts drama ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" In a little over a month, Barclays, RBC and Cowen & Co have each raised their price targets. Canaccord Genuity began coverage in September with a ""buy"" rating and $550 price target.But that was before Netflix announced 3.02 million new streaming customers in the quarter ended September, well below its own forecast of 3.69 million.In a market where Netflix is a pioneer, competition is also emerging.CBS Corp announced plans to launch subscription-based video on demand and live streaming for its TV network just a day after Time Warner Inc said its HBO channel would launch an online streaming service next year. 'COMPETITION RAMPS UP' Netflix trades at about 76 times forward earnings and scores just 5 out of 100 on Thomson Reuters StarMine Relative Valuation model. The lower the score, the more expensive the stock.Wedbush Securities Inc is one of the few brokerages with an ""underperform"" rating on Netflix, calling its high valuation ""unwarranted given the potential for slowing domestic growth as competition ramps up, coupled with increasing content costs."" At least 19 notes sent by brokerages on Thursday featured a target price cut. In the case of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, the cut was as much as $150; to $375 from $525.CRT Research cut more than its price target; it downgraded the stock to ""fair value"" from ""buy"".""As the company invests heavily in content and expansion, and faces increased competition in 2015, we don't see too many near-term catalysts for the stock,"" CRT said. ""As a result, we are stepping to the side.""Netflix has attributed the subscriber numbers to a jump in monthly subscription fees for new U.S. customers. CEO Reed Hastings, in an interview with CNBC, said Netflix had ""estimated too high"" for the quarter just ended. (cnb.cx/1xVfEMN)Despite hefty price cuts, many brokerages maintained their outlook on the stock.

239,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is buying online comedy service Rooftop Media, a small deal that underscores the Internet retailer's broader ambition of becoming a media and entertainment powerhouse.Amazon is persisting in buying content to round out its service, with designs to take on Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and other online digital media services. But that increasing spending has helped keep the company in the red, inviting criticism from investors.Audible, the audiobooks service it bought in 2008 for $300 million, is picking up the 10-person company for an undisclosed sum. Audible founder and Chief Executive Donald Katz said in a statement on Monday the company had been attracted by Rooftop's content as well as its pool of comic talent.Rooftop records comedians at clubs across the country and licenses the digital rights to thousands of hours of comedy, which is broadcast either live or later on demand. The company's media partners include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Yahoo (YHOO.O), and it also works with streaming services such as Sirius XM (SIRI.O), Spotify and Pandora (P.N). Its content now becomes part of Audible, itself a fast-growing seller of online audiobooks, and vastly increases Rooftop's audience, said Rooftop Chief Executive Officer Will Rogers.Amazon is expected to continue acquiring digital content at a rapid clip. In past years, it began investing heavily to branch out from its online retail roots, delving into Hollywood-style content production as well as developing a line of tablets, smartphones and set-top boxes to accelerate the sale of digital content. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos' vision of becoming a tech and media powerhouse, however, has drawn protests from an investor community that for years overlooked its lack of profits because of red-hot revenue growth.That growth may be in danger of stalling. Last week, the company missed revenue and income expectations and projected a disappointing 7 to 18 percent rise in holiday-quarter sales.

The 77-year-old Cosby is fighting to protect one of the most storied careers in stand-up comedy and television.

She said she never went to the police because she feared she would not be believed.  Cosby has never been charged with the alleged crimes. In an interview with National Public Radio last week, the comedian, who has been married to Camille Cosby for 50 years, declined to answer questions about the sexual assault allegations.

Netflix will disclose pricing later, and didn't say much it will invest nor how many subscribers it hopes to attract. Fast-growing Netflix had been expected for some time to target the market as it seeks to accelerate international expansion from its home base in the United States. Netflix currently has more than 50 million subscribers worldwide.While its pricing model for Australia and New Zealand remains unknown, Netflix's $8.99 per month fee in the U.S. market is equivalent to just over a third of what some future rivals in its new market charge. Australia offers a lucrative opportunity. A broadband network now being built is expected to give 93 percent of the country's 23 million population high-speed Internet access, but existing home-entertainment content providers have relatively low penetration for now.In September the country's biggest cable TV channel, Foxtel, 50 percent-owned each by News Corp and Australian telecom firm Telstra Ltd, halved its prices to A$25 ($21.68) a month amid reports it's struggling to lift its 30 percent market share and speculation about Netflix's impending arrival. Newspaper publisher Fairfax Media Ltd and broadcaster Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd also plan a A$100 million joint venture streaming service, widely seen as a way to enter the market before Netflix.""The risk with Netflix is that it can replace existing home media sources like free-to-air or pay TV or things like that,""    said one cinema analyst, asked not to be named because he doesn't cover Foxtel.  The analyst said that because almost no Netflix content is new movie releases, its arrival will have less immediate impact on Australian cinema companies like Village Roadshow Ltd and Amalgamated Holdings Ltd.

""The risk with Netflix is that it can replace existing home media sources like free-to-air or pay TV or things like that,""    said one cinema analyst, asked not to be named because he doesn't cover Foxtel.The analyst said that because almost no Netflix content is new movie releases, its arrival will have less immediate impact on Australian cinema companies like Village Roadshow Ltd  and Amalgamated Holdings Ltd. Cinema operator The Hoyts Group, considering a A$1 billion listing, is also less at risk.(1 US dollar = 1.1534 Australian dollar)(Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",2014-11-19,NFLX,"Tue Nov 18, 2014 | 11:06pm EST","UPDATE 1-Netflix to launch in Australia, New Zealand in March",http://www.reuters.com//article/netflix-launch-australia-idUSL3N0T91CD20141119?type=companyNews
256,"  (Corrects spelling of 'Buress' in paragraph 10)By Piya Sinha-RoyLOS ANGELES Nov 19 NBC said on Wednesday it has canceled an upcoming project with veteran comedian Bill Cosby, his second show to be pulled after accusations that he sexually assaulted women resurfaced in recent weeks.The move by NBC comes a day after online streaming company Netflix Inc said it was postponing Cosby's stand-up comedy special ""Bill Cosby 77,"" which was due to be released on Nov. 28.Cosby's lawyers have called the allegations of sexual assault ""discredited"" and ""defamatory.""Cosby's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the NBC and Netflix cancellations.The damage to Cosby's career reached the reruns of ""The Cosby Show,"" a top-rate NBC comedy in which he played his most famous role as the affable patriarch, Dr. Cliff Huxtable. A spokeswoman for Viacom Inc's basic cable channel TV Land said the show is being pulled from its schedule, without commenting further.The 77-year-old Cosby is fighting to protect one of the most storied careers in stand-up comedy and television. He is scheduled to go ahead with a performance on Friday at a sold-out show in Florida, the King Center for the Performing Arts said on its website on Wednesday. Comcast Corp-owned NBC said in a statement that ""the Cosby project is no longer in development,"" while declining to comment further. The project was still in its early stages, with no script delivered and no production date secured.Allegations that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted several young women decades ago gained renewed attention after comedian Hannibal Buress called him a rapist during a stand-up comedy routine last month.Neither NBC nor Netflix referred to the accusations in their statements.In a previously unaired Associated Press television interview released on Wednesday, Cosby declined to comment about  Buress' allegations. It was the first time the comedian has had any response to questions other than silence. ""I don't talk about it,"" he said in the Nov. 6 interview, flanked by his wife, Camille.After the interview and while cameras were still rolling, Cosby asked that his response not be used. ""I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,"" he said.Late Tuesday, model Janice Dickinson became the most high-profile accuser against Cosby, telling Entertainment Tonight she believed she had been sexually assaulted by Cosby in 1982.In a letter received by Reuters, Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer called Dickinson's claims ""fabricated"" and ""an outrageous defamatory lie."" Representatives for Dickinson did not respond to a request for comment. CBS said Dickinson will appear on the show on Wednesday to address Cosby's lawyers.COSBY MEME BACKFIRES Cosby's camp unwittingly intensified the scandal on Twitter last week by asking the comedian's followers to create viral memes about him, and were instead barraged with memes about the rape accusations.One of Cosby's accusers, former aspiring actress Barbara Bowman, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed this month that Cosby had sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions in 1985 when she was 17. She said she never went to the police because she feared she would not be believed.Cosby has never been charged with the alleged crimes.""The Cosby Show"" was a top-ranked show for NBC from 1984 to 1992 and is credited with accelerating racial tolerance and even helping to pave the way for a black U.S. president.

262,"  (Adds CEO comments, Netflix)LOS ANGELES Dec 19 Sony Pictures said on Friday it is looking for alternatives to release ""The Interview"" after it scrapped the Christmas Day theatrical opening of the screwball comedy at the center of a cyberattack on the studio blamed on North Korea.After a rare public shaming of a corporation by President Barack Obama, who said Sony Pictures made a mistake in pulling the film and bowing to intimidation, chief executive Michael Lynton told CNN he hoped that the public would see the film but no other platform had shown interest.On Wednesday, Sony cancelled the theatrical release of the film depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after major movie theater chains refused to show the film following threats to theaters and audiences from hackers. At the time, it said it did not have further plans to release ""The Interview,"" a $44 million film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco.But on Friday, Sony said in a statement that it ""immediately began actively surveying alternatives to enable us to release the movie on a different platform."" It appears there are no takers so far for a film that has incensed North Korea and could ultimately be the reason behind the most destructive hacking of a private company on U.S. soil. The FBI said Friday that North Korean was responsible for the hack. Lynton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that ""there has not been one major VOD - video on demand distributor - one major e-commerce site that has stepped forward and said they are willing to distribute this movie for us.""Netflix Inc, one of the biggest players in online streaming, would not discuss its interest in ""The Interview,"" or lack thereof.""We are approached on virtually every unconventional release by the networks and studios and, as a matter of course, don't discuss publicly the pitches, concepts or ideas that come our way,"" Netflix said in a statement.

281,"  * IBM shares fall after results, Netflix rallies* Investors look ahead to ECB meeting* Crude oil rises but still sharply down for week* Futures down: Dow 79 pts, S&P 5.5 pts, Nasdaq 10.5 pts   (Updates prices)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Jan 21 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Wednesday after a disappointing outlook from IBM and as investors reduced their exposure ahead of an upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) meeting that could result in new stimulus.The ECB is expected to announce a bond-buying program on Thursday to boost the region's flagging economy.  Market participants have been looking for more aggressive measures to combat the risk of deflation that has grown alongside a drop in oil prices. If the ECB does not announce a new program, or unveils a smaller one than investors are looking for, that could exacerbate market volatility. Crude oil rose 1.7 percent after dropping nearly 5 percent on Tuesday, though it remained near multi-year lows. ExxonMobil Corp was up 0.7 percent to $91.70 before the bell.International Business Machines Corp reported lower-than-expected revenues late Tuesday and gave a 2015 profit target below estimates. Shares of the Dow component fell 3.1 percent to $152.06 in premarket trading.Another member of the Dow, UnitedHealth Group Inc, rose 1.7 percent to $107.44 in premarket trading after fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations. Netflix Inc jumped 19 percent to $414.38 and was one of the most active on Nasdaq premarket, a day after the streaming and rental video company said it was growing faster overseas than previously expected, offsetting slower U.S. growth. Adjusted profit was much stronger than expected.With 8 percent of S&P 500 companies reporting, 75 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. About 52 percent beat on revenue.Traders also digested President Barack Obama's State of the Union address late Tuesday, in which he struck a defiant tone with the new Republican-controlled Congress, calling for higher taxes on the rich.

283,"  (Repeats story moved late on Wednesday with no changes)By Paul Carsten and Lisa RichwineBEIJING/LOS ANGELES Jan 21 As Netflix Inc  tackles stalling U.S. growth, the online video pioneer known for hit political drama ""House of Cards"" plans a play for China that may see it lock horns with potent domestic firms that rule the world's biggest Internet market.Netflix said on Tuesday it would expand to as many as 200 countries within two years, up from about 50 now, to extend its growth prospects. ""For every country we know what we want to do, but in China we are still exploring our options,"" Chief Executive Reed Hastings said in an interview.Hastings told investors Netflix would start with a ""modest"" move in China centred around its original series and licensed content. ""We'll learn a great deal if we can successfully operate a small service in China...That is our preference, for the next few years, if we are able to acquire the necessary permissions,"" he said.But China, with two Internet users for every U.S. citizen, is not easy for foreign firms. Google Inc, YouTube, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, have all been blocked in the country.And China now boasts domestic online giants from Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd to rising smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc. Together they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to bring foreign TV and films to China.""The real question is do they (Netflix) think they've got something, have they hammered out all these relationships with foreign content providers that Chinese companies can't offer?""  said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. ""My sense is not."" To succeed in China, Netflix may also need flexibility in its business model, both in finding ways to accept payments and in coping with a domestic streaming market built on advertising rather than subscriptions. And it may need to tailor its programming - ""House of Cards"" has aired in China in dubbed form, to critical acclaim, but garnered comparatively small audiences. PAYMENT QUESTIONMARKS CEO Hastings acknowledged in an interview the ""relatively low"" prevalence of credit cards for online payments in China. To get around this, Netflix may have to partner with online payment services - the biggest of which are run by Alibaba's PayPal-like affiliate Alipay and Tencent's payment platforms.Netflix's potential Chinese rivals, which broadcast popular domestic entertainment as well as foreign content, have another advantage: they are free, supported by advertising in a market where people don't expect to pay for online media. Subscription models are almost entirely non-existent in China.If Netflix doesn't go with an established Chinese partner, it needs a licence to operate. ""It's not 100 percent clear we'll be able to do that,"" Hastings told analysts. Even with a licence, home-grown competition will be tough. China's regulators are imposing new licensing and quota restrictions - helping the domestic TV and film industry develop with less competition from mature foreign media, analysts say. The state has reserved the right to remove anything it considers ""harmful"" content from the Internet, ranging from what it deems to be pornography to ""distortions of history"".Netflix's content itself may be an issue for an audience as particular as China. ""House of Cards"", with Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey as star and co-executive producer, was well received in China but its latest season got 8.2 million average streamed views per episode, a small audience for a nation of 1.3 billion.Meanwhile, the BBC's ""Sherlock"" detective series had 29 million views per streamed episode on average on Alibaba's Youku Tudou Inc, while South Korean romantic comedy ""My Love from the Star"" had a whopping 181 million average views on Internet firm Baidu Inc's iQiyi and streaming site LeTV combined. Two popular Chinese shows averaged 76 million and 61 million per episode.For Marbridge Consulting's Natkin, Netflix's ambition provides an echo of that voiced by the string of international firms dazzled by the market's promise, obscuring China's complexities.""Another company...sees this magical 1.3 billion number, multiplies it by some fractional percentage of market share, and that equals a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,"" said Natkin.(Additional reporting by Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",2015-01-22,NFLX,"Wed Jan 21, 2015 | 11:28pm EST","RPT-In Netflix China push, domestic tech giants, online habits block path to success",http://www.reuters.com//article/netflix-china-idUSL4N0V11UB20150122?type=companyNews

Wheeler is expected to offer new rules that align with Obama's call to ban ISPs from blocking or slowing down websites as well as from charging content companies for ""prioritized"" downloads, so no traffic gets stuck in any slow lane. Wheeler had been considering whether to include interconnection deals in net neutrality rules, which in the past only regulated the part of the network connecting the ISP to the consumer and not the connections made on parts of the network further back. Previous rules were struck down in court last year.Schaeffer and other sources said FCC officials have not yet determined how exactly the agency would adjudicate fees paid by content companies to owners of the networks that would carry their traffic.  They said the discussion was very fluid and several options were considered, including a case-by-case approach to resolving complaints, which would be more palatable to ISPs, or an outright ban on fees for interconnecting with networks, which Netflix has sought.""They establish that they have jurisdiction, that's the most important fight,"" Schaeffer said, adding the FCC could also establish the authority over interconnection in new rules but delay writing specific criteria. ISPs have previously argued the FCC had no authority to regulate interconnection deals, which jumped into spotlight last year during a spat between Netflix and Verizon Communications Inc where both sides accused each other of causing slower download speeds by the way they routed traffic.

Executive producer Leonardo DiCaprio helped promote the film.Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos was a fixture on the Hollywood awards circuit, rubbing shoulders with top producers, actors and directors as the company adds to its documentary slate and moves into original feature films.Its visible Oscar push is one way Netflix aims to expand the reach of documentaries, Lisa Nishimura, Netflix vice president of original documentary and comedy, said in an interview.Most documentaries that make it to theaters come and go quickly.

302,"  (Adds talks with other distributors; updates share prices)By Lisa RichwineMarch 9 HBO's standalone streaming service will launch on Apple Inc devices next month in time for the season premiere of hit series ""Game of Thrones,"" the network said on Monday, a move to reach millions of viewers who do not subscribe to pay television packages.The new HBO Now service will cost $14.99 a month. It will include all of the network's past, present and future series plus its lineup of Hollywood movies, HBO Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Plepler said at an Apple event in San Francisco.It is the first time the premium network will be available to people with Internet access who shun traditional TV bundles with dozens of channels. Other media companies including CBS Corp and Dish Network Corp also are taking steps to reach those audiences. ""This is a transformative moment for HBO,"" Plepler said after an introduction by Apple CEO Tim Cook.The move by HBO could threaten the video businesses of cable and satellite television providers, which are fighting to keep customers from dropping their TV packages. It also amps up competition with streaming video services like Netflix Inc . HBO's library of hits includes acclaimed series such as ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex and the City."" Starting in early April, HBO Now will be available through a new channel on the Apple TV box and on iPhones, iPads and the iPod touch. The fifth season of ""Game of Thrones"" premieres on April 12.Apple will serve as the exclusive digital provider of HBO Now for three months. The network is in talks with pay TV distributors who might also offer the service as early as April, an HBO spokesman said. The network had announced plans for a standalone - or over-the-top - streaming service last October. At the time, Plepler said 10 million U.S. homes were broadband-only, without cable subscriptions.HBO Now is separate from HBO Go, a streaming service for customers who subscribe to HBO through pay TV packages.Apple also said Monday it was cutting the price of the Apple TV device to $69 from $99.Time Warner shares rose 1.3 percent to close at $85.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Netflix fell 1.9 percent to $445.63, while Apple shares climbed 0.4 percent to $127.14. Both trade on Nasdaq.

If approved, the deal will cement Comcast's No. 1 position and reshape the country's pay TV and broadband markets.The Bright House deal will make Charter, in which Malone-controlled Liberty Broadband Corp is the biggest shareholder, the No. 2 U.S. cable TV provider.With Charter looking to close its gap with Comcast, the deal could be the first in a series of acquisitions.Analysts have cited Mediacom, CableOne and Suddenlink as potential targets for Charter. ""I think it is inevitable most of the rest of the cable industry not owned by Comcast is sold to Charter,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak told Reuters.Wlodarczak also said Charter could go after Time Warner Cable if the Comcast deal fell through, the likelihood of which was roughly 20 percent.Charter's shares rose as much as 8.5 percent to a record high of $199 on Tuesday. The company said it would pay Advance Newhouse — the owner of Bright House — $2 billion in cash and the rest in common and convertible preferred units of a new partnership created for the deal.  The deal will help Charter expand in Florida, a market where Bright House has a strong presence. Charter's key markets include Alabama, Georgia, Michigan and California.Liberty Broadband said it would buy $700 million of newly issued shares of Charter.   After the deal closes, Advance Newhouse would likely own 26.3 percent of Charter and Liberty Broadband's stake would slip to 19.4 percent.The deal is contingent on the expiration of Time Warner Cable's ""right of first offer"" for Bright House, which has an agreement for sharing programming rates with the larger cable operator.Goldman Sachs and LionTree Advisors are financial advisers to Charter and UBS Investment Bank is adviser to Advance Newhouse.

308,"  (Fixes typo in 8th paragraph, changes JPM Securities to JMP Securities)By Jessica ToonkelNEW YORK, April 7 When BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager,  evaluates potential stock purchases, its managers look at all the usual financial metrics.Some of them also consider something much harder to quantify: employee sentiment.""We look for companies that have solid employee rankings and want to buy companies that have improvements in employee opinions,"" said Paul Ebner, a portfolio manager and member of BlackRock's scientific active equity group, a team of quantitative managers. ""Happy and engaged employees lead to more wins and more sales opportunities.""That strategy is in line with a growing body of research suggesting that happy workers can be good for profits. But gauging employee satisfaction levels - and understanding how they might affect a company's performance - can be tricky.At BlackRock, which has more than $4.65 trillion in assets, the company's 77-member quantitative team began adding data from social media websites, including employee sentiment data, into its models for evaluating holdings and investment prospects two years ago.Today, 20 percent of the data used by the group to analyze companies is 'unstructured' - meaning it does not come as line items in analyst reports or regulatory filings. Employee sentiment is part of that, said Ebner.He wouldn't say exactly how his group gauges employee sentiment at companies they're interested in, but he did say BlackRock employs automated Internet searches to look for key positive and negative words across a variety of blogs, social media, chat rooms and employee websites. The team is particularly interested in changes in employee sentiment that might indicate good or bad things happening at a company.IMPERFECT INDICATOR  BlackRock is not the only company that looks at employee sentiment. Ron Josey, an analyst at San Francisco-based JMP Securities, said he regularly checks to see what people are posting about the companies he covers on the job website Glassdoor.com, which allows its users to anonymously comment on employers and rate them on a one-to-five scale.  When Marissa Mayer took over as CEO of Yahoo! Inc, he said he noticed positive Glassdoor postings on the change.Even the investors who use sites such as Glassdoor acknowledge they are imperfect tools for analyzing stocks. There is no way of knowing, for example, whether the reviews posted on the site are representative of employee sentiment in general - or even if they were posted by actual employees. And sample sizes tend to be small.Still, a number of examples can be found on Glassdoor's website of rising or falling sentiment that paralleled or came in advance of similar moves in stock price, according to an analysis of the site's ratings and the relationship to share performance that was conducted for Reuters by Accern Corp, a New York-based analytics provider for institutional investors.For example, during much of 2013, Atlanta-based Cumulus Media seemed unstoppable. Between April of that year and January 2014, the nation's second largest operator of radio stations saw its stock price rise by more than 142 percent.But even as the stock was climbing, the percentage of negative reviews of the work environment at Cumulus was rising. Thirty of the 43 anonymous comments posted on the Glassdoor site during the period, or about 70 percent, were negative, compared with 40 of 67, or about 60 percent, that were negative in the preceding 12 months. Between April 2013 and January 2014 the company's average rating on the site dropped from 2.59 to 2.21, according to Accern's analysis. In 2014, in the face of a rapidly changing advertising market, and increasing competition from online competitors, the company's stock fell from its high of $8 on January 7 to a low for the year of $2.88 on November 11. On Tuesday, it closed at $2.56.When asked for comment about any link between its tumbling stock price and the Glassdoor ratings, a Cumulus spokesman said: ""Over the last year, Cumulus has hired more top talent than all other radio companies combined."" He supplied a list of recent hires to back up the statement.""JUST FLUFFY"" Sometimes, increases in Glassdoor ratings go hand in hand with rising stock prices. At video-on-demand company Netflix Inc  ratings rose over the last two years as its stock price rose 157 percent, according to Accern's analysis for Reuters. There are also examples of companies where Glassdoor ratings soared in advance of stock price tumbles, or where comments grew more negative even as a company was doing well or its share price was about to take off.At San Francisco-based online game maker Zynga. The company's stock price has dropped since March of 2014, from $5.89 per share to $2.80 on Tuesday. But at the same time, its average monthly employee rating on Glassdoor has gone up slightly, from 2.78  before the stock dropped to 2.90 in March of this year.Netflix and Zynga declined to comment.(For a graphic view of Glassdoor ratings at Cumulus, Netflix and Zynga in relation to share price moves, see: reut.rs/1wU8A7c)Whether or not employee sentiment should be factored into investment decisions, the research is intriguing to some company trackers. In 2011-2012, human resources consultant Towers Watson surveyed 518,000 employees at 41 companies, and then looked at the 12 months of financial performance that followed. Companies with engaged employees outperformed the average in their sectors at a significantly higher rate than companies with less-engaged employees.Alex Edmans, an associate professor of finance at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, found that companies that made Fortune Magazine's list of the ""100 Best Companies to Work For in America"" outperformed their peers by more than two percent annually between 1984 and 2009.Edmans acknowledges that many investors still don't consider such information important. ""The market has the old school view that the idea of happy workers is just fluffy,"" he said.David James, co-portfolio manager of the $4.1 billion James Balanced: Golden Rainbow Fund, is one of the skeptics. A few years ago, his team tried to see if employee turnover rates were a reliable predictor of company performance, on the theory that high turnover was an indicator of an unhappy workforce. But the team found no quantifiable impact. ""We tabled it and have not looked at it further,"" he said.

Thirty of the 43 anonymous comments posted on the Glassdoor site during the period, or about 70 percent, were negative, compared with 40 of 67, or about 60 percent, that were negative in the preceding 12 months. Between April 2013 and January 2014 the company's average rating on the site dropped from 2.59 to 2.21, according to Accern's analysis. In 2014, in the face of a rapidly changing advertising market, and increasing competition from online competitors, the company's stock fell from its high of $8 on January 7 to a low for the year of $2.88 on November 11. On Tuesday, it closed at $2.56.When asked for comment about any link between its tumbling stock price and the Glassdoor ratings, a Cumulus spokesman said: ""Over the last year, Cumulus has hired more top talent than all other radio companies combined."" He supplied a list of recent hires to back up the statement.  ""JUST FLUFFY"" Sometimes, increases in Glassdoor ratings go hand in hand with rising stock prices. At video-on-demand company Netflix Inc ratings rose over the last two years as its stock price rose 157 percent, according to Accern's analysis for Reuters.There are also examples of companies where Glassdoor ratings soared in advance of stock price tumbles, or where comments grew more negative even as a company was doing well or its share price was about to take off.  At San Francisco-based online game maker Zynga. The company’s stock price has dropped since March of 2014, from $5.89 per share to $2.80 on Tuesday. But at the same time, its average monthly employee rating on Glassdoor has gone up slightly, from 2.78  before the stock dropped to 2.90 in March of this year.  Netflix and Zynga declined to comment.(For a graphic view of Glassdoor ratings at Cumulus, Netflix and Zynga in relation to share price moves, see: reut.rs/1wU8A7c)  Whether or not employee sentiment should be factored into investment decisions, the research is intriguing to some company trackers. In 2011-2012, human resources consultant Towers Watson surveyed 518,000 employees at 41 companies, and then looked at the 12 months of financial performance that followed. Companies with engaged employees outperformed the average in their sectors at a significantly higher rate than companies with less-engaged employees. Alex Edmans, an associate professor of finance at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, found that companies that made Fortune Magazine’s list of the ""100 Best Companies to Work For in America"" outperformed their peers by more than two percent annually between 1984 and 2009.Edmans acknowledges that many investors still don’t consider such information important. ""The market has the old school view that the idea of happy workers is just fluffy,"" he said. David James, co-portfolio manager of the $4.1 billion James Balanced: Golden Rainbow Fund, is one of the skeptics. A few years ago, his team tried to see if employee turnover rates were a reliable predictor of company performance, on the theory that high turnover was an indicator of an unhappy workforce. But the team found no quantifiable impact. ""We tabled it and have not looked at it further,"" he said.  (Reporting By Jessica Toonkel; With additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore; Editing by Linda Stern and Sue Horton)",2015-04-08,NFLX,"Wed Apr 8, 2015 | 5:20am EDT",Insight: Does a happy employee make for a healthy stock price?,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-investors-workers-sentiment-insight-idUSKBN0MZ01V20150408?type=companyNews

319,"  (Updates with close)* Intel pushes higher following quarterly report* Delta profit up, helped by cheap fuel* Netflix gains after the close* Indexes up: Dow 0.42 pct, S&P 0.51 pct, Nasdaq 0.68 pctBy Noel RandewichApril 15 U.S. stocks closed higher on Wednesday, fueled by gains in oil companies and speculation that upcoming first-quarter earnings reports might not be quite as weak as previously thought.All 10 major S&P 500 sectors gained, with the energy index  leading, up 2.3 percent. U.S. crude jumped more than 5 percent after a lower-than-expected build of U.S. crude stockpiles. Intel jumped 4.25 percent to $32.83 after the chipmaker said late on Tuesday it expects flat revenue for the entire year despite some weakness in the first quarter.Investors have feared the March-quarter earnings season, just getting under way, would be crippled by low oil prices, a strong dollar and extreme weather in the eastern United States. First-quarter profits for S&P 500 companies are seen dropping 2.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Companies can jump over a bar that's about as low as a limbo stick,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""Beating expectations should be relatively easy.""Of the 36 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, 81 percent beat expectations, better than the 63 percent of companies exceeding expectations in a typical quarter. But just 47 percent of companies exceeded revenue expectations, worse than 61 percent seen in a typical quarter. That suggests companies are bolstering their bottom lines by cutting costs instead of by expanding their businesses.U.S. shares also benefited after the European Central Bank said it remained committed to its full asset-buying program to revive the euro zone economy.The strong dollar hurts U.S. companies dependent on overseas sales, while slumping oil prices erode the profits of energy companies.But many industrial and transportation companies benefit from cheap oil and its derivatives. Delta Air Lines  posted first-quarter profit above analysts' expectations and its stock rose 2.60 percent to end at $44.20. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.91 points, or 0.42 percent, to close at 18,112.61.

330,"   By Tenzin Pema and Devika  Krishna Kumar  Netflix Inc has been a stock market darling over the past few years and strong first-quarter subscriber additions sent its shares to another record high on Thursday. But is the company's sky-high valuation sustainable?Some Wall Street analysts played devil's advocate, raising doubts about the sustainability of the video streaming service's scorching growth.""I think if Netflix shares are valued based on its fundamentals, the share price is not warranted,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.Netflix's shares jumped as much as 20 percent to $568.75 - their highest ever. The stock, which has risen nine-fold in the last three years, was valued at 123 times forward earnings as of its Wednesday's close of $475.46.In comparison, Apple Inc, the world's most valuable technology company, has a P/E ratio of 17, while Google Inc's stock trades at 26.7 times earnings.Netflix's Wednesday closing implies a forward 5-year earnings growth of 35.1 percent. According to StarMine's intrinsic valuation model, which takes analysts' estimates over five years and models a long-term growth trajectory, the stock should be trading at $77.09 with a 5-year profit growth of just 10.7 percent.Still, at least 22 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock by $25-$500, with FBR Capital Markets analysts more than doubling theirs to $900.U.S. subscribers love the Netflix service more than television itself, FBR analysts said, citing a survey of over 2,000 consumers. A majority of the analysts who assigned high price targets valued Netflix based on its high subscriber adds, a potential rise in average revenue per user and a rebound in its core business of renting out DVDs and streaming movies.Netflix has been wooing customers with original shows including the Emmy-winning ""House of Cards"" and new series such as ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" and ""Bloodline.""The company, which turned to international markets to make up for slowing growth in the United States, recently launched services in Australia and New Zealand and plans to be in Japan later this year.

331,"  (Adds analysts' comments, background, updates shares)By Tenzin Pema and Devika  Krishna KumarApril 16 Netflix Inc has been a stock market darling over the past few years and strong first-quarter subscriber additions sent its shares to another record high on Thursday. But is the company's sky-high valuation sustainable?Some Wall Street analysts played devil's advocate, raising doubts about the sustainability of the video streaming service's scorching growth.""I think if Netflix shares are valued based on its fundamentals, the share price is not warranted,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said.Netflix's shares jumped as much as 20 percent to $568.75 - their highest ever. The stock, which has risen nine-fold in the last three years, was valued at 123 times forward earnings as of its Wednesday's close of $475.46. In comparison, Apple Inc, the world's most valuable technology company, has a P/E ratio of 17, while Google Inc's  stock trades at 26.7 times earnings.Netflix's Wednesday closing implies a forward 5-year earnings growth of 35.1 percent.According to StarMine's intrinsic valuation model, which takes analysts' estimates over five years and models a long-term growth trajectory, the stock should be trading at $77.09 with a 5-year profit growth of just 10.7 percent. Still, at least 22 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock by $25-$500, with FBR Capital Markets analysts more than doubling theirs to $900.U.S. subscribers love the Netflix service more than television itself, FBR analysts said, citing a survey of over 2,000 consumers.A majority of the analysts who assigned high price targets valued Netflix based on its high subscriber adds, a potential rise in average revenue per user and a rebound in its core business of renting out DVDs and streaming movies. Netflix has been wooing customers with original shows including the Emmy-winning ""House of Cards"" and new series such as ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" and ""Bloodline.""The company, which turned to international markets to make up for slowing growth in the United States, recently launched services in Australia and New Zealand and plans to be in Japan later this year.The company expects to be present in 200 countries in the next two years, up from 50 now.But the cost of driving subscriber growth has been high as Netflix continues to invest heavily but is yet to see any profits from outside the United States.""When you are beating sub numbers by tripling the number of original hours, no one cares about any of the less sexy topics like international losses, content amortization policies or changes in working capital,"" MoffettNathanson Research analysts said.

Pivotal Research was the most bullish with a price target of $155 - about 58 percent higher than the stock's Wednesday close. The stock has been on a tear - through Wednesday's close it had more than doubled this year and is just shy of hitting analysts' median price target of $103.57.Netflix is aggressively expanding into new markets and plans to reach almost every country in the world by the end of next year. Next up is Japan this quarter, with Spain, Italy and Portugal to follow later in the year.The company said it expects to sign up 5-6 million subscribers this year and next, but many analysts saw that as too conservative -- even though it has yet to work out how to crack the Chinese market. Cowen and Co analysts forecast global subscriber numbers of nearly 174 million by 2020.

399,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES As consumers flock to streaming video services like Netflix, the cable industry has struggled to regularly attract customers to its own online viewing options. This summer, networks and distributors will unite in a marketing campaign to try and change that.Studies show less than half of pay TV subscribers consistently use what media companies call TV Everywhere, a platform to watch live and on-demand programing on computers, tablets, Internet-connected TVs and mobile phones. Operators acknowledge that many customers do not know it exists.From July 26 to August 8, cable distributors and networks will fill TV screens, websites and social media with messages encouraging customers to ""watch on the go"" through their apps and websites, Anne Cowan, a spokeswoman for the Cable & Telecommunications Association for Marketing (CTAM), told Reuters. Participants include Comcast Corp and its NBCUniversal unit, Cox Communications, Mediacom, A&E Networks, Time Warner Inc's Turner Networks and HBO, and Univision.The campaign is designed to catch people on summer vacation with phones and tablets in tow.TV Everywhere began in 2009 as a response to on-demand services such as Netflix. Examples include the HBO Go, Watch ESPN and Xfinity TV apps. Cable operators hope the platform will help prevent ""cord cutting,"" or dropping of pay TV packages. The TV Everywhere capabilities are added to a pay TV subscription at no extra cost.""We need to become much more consumer-centric and be where consumers want to be,"" said CTAM President and CEO John Lansing. ""TV Everywhere is that product for our industry."" About 13 percent of pay TV accounts were logged in to TV Everywhere content at least once a month during the first quarter of 2015, according to Adobe, which provides software for the platform. It is unknown how many people watched each video.  In an online survey in January by HUB Research and commissioned by CTAM, 34 percent of pay TV subscribers said they had used TV Everywhere at least several times a month.Proponents say awareness and use are rising quickly. The number of videos played on TV Everywhere platforms increased nearly 300 percent in the 12 months through March, Adobe said, lifted by sporting events such as the Olympics and World Cup. Satisfaction surveys also show that people who use it are happier with their cable packages, Lansing said.  There are still holes in the offerings. Not all networks are watchable on all devices. Cable customers have an average of 60 networks available on five devices, CTAM said. Some can be watched only inside the home. A complicated sign-in process also frustrated customers, and operators have moved to simplify it. Comcast, for example, no longer makes subscribers enter a customer number for the Xfinity TV app. It also automatically connects customers to the app when they use devices connected to their home wi-fi network.Comcast promotes TV Everywhere through ""watchathons"" that offer a range of free content for a limited time. One-third of Comcast’s video customers use TV Everywhere each month, said Matt Strauss, executive vice president and general manager of Comcast Cable's video services.

Proponents say awareness and use are rising quickly. The number of videos played on TV Everywhere platforms increased nearly 300 percent in the 12 months through March, Adobe said, lifted by sporting events such as the Olympics and World Cup.Satisfaction surveys also show that people who use it are happier with their cable packages, Lansing said.There are still holes in the offerings. Not all networks are watchable on all devices. Cable customers have an average of 60 networks available on five devices, CTAM said. Some can be watched only inside the home.A complicated sign-in process also frustrated customers, and operators have moved to simplify it. Comcast, for example, no longer makes subscribers enter a customer number for the Xfinity TV app. It also automatically connects customers to the app when they use devices connected to their home wi-fi network.Comcast promotes TV Everywhere through ""watchathons"" that offer a range of free content for a limited time. One-third of Comcast's video customers use TV Everywhere each month, said Matt Strauss, executive vice president and general manager of Comcast Cable's video services.

The stock was also the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes.While there was no clear trigger for the selloff, traders said worries over a slowdown in China and skepticism over demand for iPhone 6s were likely to keep the stock under pressure. Netflix, on the other hand, was on a tear. Its stock surged as much as 9.1 percent to a record high of $122.79, valuing the company well above $50 billion.Earnings reports on Tuesday were a mixed bag. With a bulk of the S&P 500 companies having reported results, investors are taking to the sidelines ahead of Friday's monthly jobs data.The report is seen critical for the market as it is expected to provide clues on the timing of a rate hike. The U.S. economy is expected to have created 223,000 new jobs in July, on par with June, according to economists polled by Reuters.""Given the importance of such a big number, investors are taking a wait-and-see approach,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. Wall Street ended lower on Monday as tumbling oil prices dragged energy shares to a three-year low and factory data from China raised concerns about the world's second-biggest economy.In the United States, consumer spending recorded its smallest gain in four months, while the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector slowed in July.Soft data has prompted some investors to argue that the U.S. Federal Reserve might hold off on raising rates until December. After the Fed meeting last week, investors expected a rate increase in September.""The market is getting such a mixed bag of rhetoric from the Fed, it seems like the Fed isn't sure what it's going to do,"" Ablin said. The Fed, which has kept interest rates near zero for nearly a decade, has said it will raise rates only when it sees a sustained recovery in the economy.At 12:44 p.m. ET (1644 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 36.72 points, or 0.21 percent, at 17,561.48, the S&P 500 was down 3.36 points, or 0.16 percent, at 2,094.68 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 11.44 points, or 0.22 percent, at 5,103.94.Six of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the materials index's 0.76 percent rise leading the advancers. The energy index reversed course to trade down.Among other companies scheduled to release results on Tuesday are Dow component Walt Disney, Devon Energy  and Genworth Financial.Baxalta shares jumped 17 percent to $38.73 after Shire  said it was seeking to buy the company in a $30 billion all-share deal. U.S.-listed shares of Shire fell 7.7 percent to $247.46.American International Group fell 5.2 percent to $60.84 after the insurer's underwriting income fell in almost all of its units, while home and auto insurer Allstate  fell 10.4 percent to $62.13 after its profit missed expectations.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,658 to 1,296. On the Nasdaq, 1,498 issues rose and 1,193 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 31 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 83 new highs and 89 new lows.

405,"   By Kylie Gumpert  Netflix Inc is offering up to a year of paid maternity and paternity leave for employees to care for a newborn or newly adopted child, significantly raising the bar for parental benefits in corporate America.In a blog post, the video streaming company, which employs about 2,200 people, said parents could take off as much time as they wanted during the first year after a child's birth or adoption.Parents can return to work part-time, full-time or go back to work as needed, the company said.The change, which the company called an ""unlimited"" leave, will eliminate the need for employees to request state-funded leave or disability pay because they will continue to be paid their regular salaries.“Netflix’s continued success hinges on us competing for and keeping the most talented individuals in their field,” Netflix Chief Talent Officer Tawni Cranz said in the post. “Experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home.”The Netflix policy far exceeds typical leave at large U.S. corporations. The national norm averages about 30 days paid leave, according to Mary Tavarozzi, a senior consultant with benefit consultant group Towers Watson.While it could push some companies to follow in its footsteps, for others it will not be possible. Top tech firms are among the leaders in offering greater benefits to attract new talent. Facebook offers four months of paid leave for parents, while Google Inc offers at least 18 weeks of paid maternity leave. ""We've seen many employers expanding their amount of paid leave available, but it would be a small number of industries with a relatively small-to-medium size population that could afford to do something as extensive as Netflix,"" said Tavarozzi.According to a Towers Watson survey, adequate paid time off is the third-most-important issue for employees, behind compensation and medical coverage. Terri Rhodes, chief executive of the Disability Management Employer Coalition, a lobbying group that represents employers, called the move a ""game changer."" She said it would not be a significant cost for other employers to add several more weeks to their current paid leave. Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday in a blog post that it would increase its paid parental leave to 12 weeks for all employees becoming parents of newborn or adopted children.In addition to eight weeks of fully paid maternity disability leave, Microsoft currently gives an additional 12 weeks of parental leave, of which eight weeks are unpaid.   One issue with parental leave programs is creating an environment in which employees feel comfortable taking the time offered, said Rich Fuerstenberg, a senior partner at Mercer.""This could be symptomatic of a broader cultural shift,"" he said. ""Companies are moving away from hard and fast rules to whatever the employee and supervisor agree to is fine."" Compared with other developed countries, the United States lags in benefits it offers expecting parents.The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act entitles employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off annually in the event of a birth, adoption or arrival of a foster child. According to a 2013 report from the Pew Research Center, Estonia offers the most paid time off for parental leave, about two years. Hungary offers at least one and a half years of paid leave.

410,"   By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Aug 13 U.S. broadcast TV network NBC is unlikely to extend its binge-watching experiment for the second season of drama ""Aquarius, the head of entertainment at the Comcast-owned network said on Thursday, though he would not rule out trying the approach for other series.The success of Netflix Inc, with 65 million global subscribers, is pressuring traditional TV networks to try new approaches as they compete with online outlets for viewers, especially younger audiences who watch video on mobile devices.In a first for a broadcast network, NBC in May put all 13 ""Aquarius"" episodes online for four weeks right after the premiere aired on TV. The move was similar to Netflix's strategy of releasing entire seasons at once for binge watching.NBC probably will not repeat that pattern for the show's second season, Bob Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, said in an interview at the Television Critics Association press tour. All episodes likely will not be filmed before the new season starts, he said, and the approach is not popular with affiliate stations that rely on TV viewing.""It's not going to become standard practice for the network,"" he said of the simultaneous release of episodes, unless the entire industry shifts in that direction. But he said NBC might try it again for ""the occasional show."" NBC renewed the crime thriller starring David Duchovny despite mediocre ratings for the weekly episodes on TV. Greenblatt said he hoped online viewership would lead to bigger audiences for ""Aquarius"" when it returns to TV. Industry executives credit the availability of AMC's hit ""Breaking Bad"" on Netflix with boosting TV viewership in later seasons.About 94 percent of viewers watched ""Aquarius"" on traditional linear television, and 6 percent online, Greenblatt said. The median age of online viewers was 35, about 15 years younger than the audience on the network.""My instincts tell me those viewers who are much younger probably wouldn't have watched it in a linear way because our average age is so much higher on the network,"" he said. In NBC's research, 50 percent of people who knew they could binge watch ""Aquarius"" said they were more likely to watch it, Greenblatt said.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",2015-08-13,NFLX,"Thu Aug 13, 2015 | 7:52pm EDT",NBC unlikely to repeat binge-watch test for 'Aquarius',http://www.reuters.com//article/television-binge-idUSL1N10O22L20150813?type=companyNews
411,"   By Bobbi Rebell | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Millennial parents are coming to Corporate America, and companies are bracing for impact.This generation of young Americans, who are now as old as 34, demanded that work-life balance be more than aspirational. Now they are getting their way once again as they move into parenthood.The big splash came when Netflix Inc announced on Aug. 4 that it would start offering new parents up to a year of paid leave. While workers can take a full year exit and return with no break in pay, the policy also allows for a more fluid situation, where, for example, parents can break up their leave into several non-consecutive parts - blending work and life from a whole new perspective. Not bad, considering paid maternity leave in the United States is usually about 30 days, according to Mary Tavarozzi, a senior consultant with benefit consultant group Towers Watson.On the heels of Netflix's announcement, a number of other companies have upped the ante as well in what may be a sort of family-friendly arms race. Microsoft is extending leave for all new parents to 12 weeks. Adobe is clocking in at 26 weeks of paid leave for birth mothers. Paternity leave doubles from the current two to four weeks.  And the list will keep growing. Asked about the potential costs of the new policy, Netflix spokesperson Anne Marie Squeo wrote in an email:  ""Hard to make predictions since the policy is brand new, and there isn't much to compare it with. We expect we will learn a lot as employees begin making these decisions for themselves and managers work with them to ensure coverage during their absences.""Netflix, with its soaring stock price and sunny outlook, can afford to take chances. The company already gives many of its 2,200 employees unlimited paid vacation time and continues to flourish. BENEFITS BANDWAGON	   Not all companies can take big risks on benefits packages, though. In order to attract millennials, there is growing pressure to live up to the new, higher standard set by companies like Netflix, says Jennifer Owens, editorial director at Working Mother magazine.""They are all watching, and they are all making changes. It's a great bandwagon for them to jump on,"" Owens says. ""The bandwagon has to include things like corporate culture. There needs to be more than a big number on paper."" In other words, paid leave works only if the company fully supports it.  Companies have a lot of good options to attract millennials, Owens notes. New state initiatives like those in New Jersey and California can help subsidize the cost of better parental leave policies. And if a fully paid leave is truly not viable, companies can also consider partial pay as an option. Paid leave can come at different kind of a cost, though. Millennials must live up to new demands in the workplace. They may insist on, and get, flexibility in terms of when and where they work, but employers also expect them to be more available than previous generations who were tied to the traditional 9-to-5, in-office schedule. That means a mother might be answering work emails while nursing her newborn. Or a father might be on a client conference call as he is pushing a playground swing. But, who cares, as long as work is getting done?It is a good bet that the increased leeway will create a new kind of corporate bonding with millennial parents - just as they bond with their new additions.(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)

415,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Hedge fund managers often promise to find stock ideas off the beaten path but this month many prominent players have been bloodied by doing exactly the opposite; betting on a small handful of popular names that sold off sharply in August.The carnage of the last week - even with Wednesday's and Thursday's rebound - has been particularly acute for investors who have seen their overweight positions in companies such as social media site Facebook, pharmaceutical company Valeant, internet retailer Netflix, carmaker Tesla Motors and renewable energy company SunEdison get pummeled in the last days.As a result, people who have money with David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors, Chase Coleman's Tiger Global, Philippe Laffont's Coatue and others are bracing for red ink when August data comes out next week. Only a few managers have actually told investors about their losses.""People will be shocked by how bad the numbers will be,"" said Peter Rup, chief executive and chief investment officer at Artemis Wealth Advisors, which invests in hedge funds, adding ""they will be down 8 percent (for the month) and for some people it may be a lot worse.""The average hedge fund is off almost 2 percent for the year, according to Hedge Fund Research data, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index is down almost 5 percent. One reason the declines may be so big is that managers have tended to crowd into similar stocks, some lulled by years of rising markets, several investors said.For example, Omega Advisors, which investors say is off 12 percent this month, was hurt most by SunEdison's SUNE.K 47 percent plunge this month, investors said. The stock fell 14 drop in the last five days alone, even though it came back on Thursday, and also hurt Greenlight Capital and Daniel Loeb's Third Point, investors said. Earlier in the week, Omega's Steven Einhorn said his firm believed stocks would rebound. The S&P lost more than 11 percent in a six-day run of losses before recovering, gaining 6 percent on Wednesday and Thursday combined.      Greenlight investors, tracking the fund's returns, said Einhorn is likely down by double digits this month, further worsening a year in which he was down 9 percent through July. A spokesman declined to comment.Similarly, an 8 percent drop in Valeant (VRX.TO) in the last five days, plus Facebook's 9.5 percent decline and a 12 percent tumble in Netflix, also hurt big funds.At William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Valeant makes up roughly one third of the portfolio and the billionaire investor said on Wednesday that his 10 percent gain through the end of July was gone – he's down 13.1 percent in August through the 25th.The declines in Facebook and Netflix were big detractors for Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management, while Netflix was the number one drag on Tiger Global in the last five days, according to Symmetric, which tracks and analyzes public U.S. hedge fund stock holding reports. Shares of Netflix are still up 141 percent for 2015. CROWDED NAMES Hedge fund investors have long complained that when stocks fall, many big-name funds lose money at the same time. Whether managers swap stock picks at private dinners or find tips at conferences, they worry funds no longer deliver the uncorrelated investments they promise. ""Hedge funds do love the crowded names and the bigger a fund gets, the more likely it is we see them in common names,"" said Brad Balter, managing partner at Balter Capital, which invests with hedge funds.But some investors also say there is good reason to crowd into some stocks, largely because they are the ones expected to perform well. The drop in Apple, one of the hedge fund industry's most widely held names, has been largely reversed, easing the initial sting on portfolios. ""Sometimes the fundamentals are extremely compelling,"" said Troy Gayeski, who invests in hedge funds at SkyBridge Capital. ""This is the case primarily for healthcare names where fundamentals are improving, valuations are very reasonable, and continued accretive transactions are highly probable."" Some healthcare oriented funds, including Perceptive Life Sciences Offshore Fund and CCI Micro Healthcare Partners Ltd, have been among the industry's most successful this year. Among S&P 500 sectors, health care is one of just two in positive territory in 2015, having gained 3.1 percent on the year.Even as hedge funds were seen as trying to trim their positions in the wake of this week's sharp losses, many are expected to stick with the names they like. Ackman, for example, said he had not made significant adjustments to his portfolio.Long-term investors expect hedge funds to perform better, especially if markets trend lower.""If we look at how hedge funds have performed over these times of drawdowns, they've done a whole lot better than the average fund,"" said David Saunders, founding managing director, K2 Advisors, which invests with dozens of hedge funds.   (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss.

427,"   By Ross Kerber | BOSTON, Sept 10  BOSTON, Sept 10 Mutual fund company Vanguard Group backed measures at more than  a dozen companies this year that could give shareholders more power over the makeup of corporate boards, securities filings show.Vanguard's votes in favor of so-called proxy access for investors with as little as 3 percent ownership came despite the firm's general preference for a higher threshold of 5 percent and fund industry concerns that the changes would encourage disruptive activist investors.""Our starting point is 5 percent, but we also said we would look on a case-by-case basis,"" Vanguard Fund Treasurer Glenn Booraem said in an interview. He declined to discuss individual cases.The proposals would make it easier for groups of investors to run director candidates. Vanguard funds voted in favor of proxy access at the 3 percent threshold at 15 companies, including streaming video provider Netflix Inc, oilfield services company Nabors Industries Ltd and liquefied natural gas company Cheniere Energy, according to disclosures reviewed by research firm Fund Votes.A few of the 15 boards supported the change, but most opposed it. In those cases, ""you can view the votes as sort of a failing grade from Vanguard,"" said independent governance consultant Francis Byrd.The main supporter of the 3 percent threshold, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, said that because Vanguard voted against most proxy access proposals, including costing a majority at energy company Exxon Mobil Corp, its show of support was ""not credible."" Though non-binding, the proposals have triggered changes. As of July 30, 49 of 84 proxy access resolutions at U.S. companies won majority support, said Institutional Shareholder Services, and 41 companies were moving on new rules.Vanguard rival BlackRock Inc has been a frequent supporter of proxy access, suggesting it can focus boards on shareholder interests. But funds sponsored by Fidelity Investments often oppose the proposals. ""The prospect of certain shareholders utilizing the proxy access process may create a distraction for executives and directors,"" a Fidelity spokesman said.At Netflix, ISS recommended investors break with management on five of nine proposals, noting how the company did not act on shareholder votes in 2014. In June, shareholder majorities followed ISS's advice on four items, including proxy access.Netflix will consider the votes, a spokesman said.Proposals at the 3 percent level also won majorities at Nabors and Cheniere. Nabors ""continues to evaluate potential actions"" on proxy access, it said. Cheniere did not comment.

428,"  * Fibre optic broadband being rolled out in South Africa* Video-on-demand services fight to tap new market* Netflix expected to enter S.Africa in 2016By Mfuneko ToyanaJOHANNESBURG, Sept 18 A rapid roll-out of fibre optic broadband in upmarket South African neighbourhoods has caught the attention of Internet video streaming companies who are racing to capture a slice of a lucrative, untapped market.South Africa is the continent's most developed economy and has a burgeoning middle-class but so far satellite television operators dominate the home-viewing market. Five South African video-on-demand (VOD) services have launched over the last 12 months and when Netflix  announced global expansion plans in January it raised speculation that the U.S. streaming giant would soon be coming to South Africa.Africa's largest mobile operator, MTN, last week said it would waive data charges for subscribers accessing its VOD offering FrontRow. ""We know connectivity is coming to South Africa,"" said Richard Boorman, spokesman for the Napsers-owned VOD service Showmax, launched in August.""The thinking from our end is to make sure we are investing now to take advantage of this boom in connectivity.""An estimated one million South African households have the bandwidth speed to stream videos but this number is expected to swell in coming years as fibre optic Internet providers race to roll-out new services. National fixed-line operator Telkom aims to bring fibre to 1 million households by 2016, while start-up telecoms companies such as Vumatel have signed deals with affluent suburbs to supply ""fibrehoods"" with high speed internet.Installing fibre costs a little more than a fixed line connection, but once that cost is covered it delivers data speeds of up to 20 megabits per second, ten times faster than fixed-line copper connections.""There's an almighty gold rush to try and put in fibre and that's bringing in these streaming services,"" said Dion Chang, analyst and director of Flux Trends, a technology consultancy.Faster Internet speeds globally are expected to increase  VOD subscribers to 200 million by 2020 from around 83 million last year, according to statistics portal Statista.

447,"  * Alibaba offers to pay $26.60 per ADS* Alibaba already owns 18 pct of Youku Tudou* Deal would extend push into online video* Youku Tudou shares trading at $24.95   (Adds CFO, analyst comment, updates share price)By Abhirup Roy and John RuwitchOct 16 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  offered to pay $3.5 billion to become the sole owner of Youku Tudou Inc, known as China's YouTube, in a move that would give the e-commerce giant access to more than half a billion online video users.The offer, a vote of confidence in China's economy from Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma, makes Youku Tudou the latest in a string of U.S.-listed Chinese companies being taken private by big shareholders.""Alibaba needs traffic. Online or mobile video is the number one place for that,"" said Tian Hou, an analyst at TH Capital in New York.Alibaba first bought into Youku Tudou in mid-2014, acquiring a stake of about 18 percent as part of a push into online video. Alibaba's offer for Youku Tudou values the 82 percent of the company it does not own at $4.6 billion.But it will end up paying $3.5 billion, taking into account the $1.1 billion of cash on Youku Tudou's books, Alibaba's chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said on a call on Friday.Youku Tudou said the all-cash offer already had the support of its chairman and chief executive, Victor Koo.Koo, a Bain & Co alumnus who holds an MBA from Stanford University, owns about 18 percent of Youku Tudou, according to a securities filing. THREAT TO NETFLIX? Though Youku has never turned a profit, its more than 500 million monthly users provide an enormous platform for Alibaba's ambitions to sell online film and television and poses a potential threat to Netflix Inc's plans for China.Alibaba's move comes as Netflix is looking to expand aggressively overseas as opportunities to grow become scarcer in its home market. Youku Tudou's subscription service already offers Hollywood and Chinese-made movies. ""For Netflix, I think people already thought that China was going to be a challenge,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. ""This just serves as a helpful reminder.""Alibaba's offer comes at a 30 percent premium to Youku Tudou's closing price on Thursday, valuing the company at about $5.2 billion, based on 194.47 million shares outstanding as of June 30.""Digital products, especially video, are just as important as physical goods in e-commerce,"" Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said. ""Youku's high-quality video content will be a core component of Alibaba's digital product offering in the future.""Youku Tudou is one of about 30 U.S.-listed Chinese companies to have received an offer to go private this year, according to Hong Kong research firm MCM Partners, many in the belief that higher valuations are available back home.In the biggest proposed deal, a consortium offered to buy security software maker Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd for about $10 billion in June.Youku Tudou's New York-listed stock was up 22 percent at  $24.95, below the offer price of $26.60 per American Depositary Share.Alibaba, shares of which were up 0.2 percent at $71.91, said it would fund the offer with cash on hand.(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru and John Ruwitch in Shanghai; Additional reporting by Ismail Shakil; Editing by Robin Paxton and Ted Kerr)",2015-10-16,NFLX,"Fri Oct 16, 2015 | 12:53pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Alibaba offers to buy all of 'China's YouTube',http://www.reuters.com//article/youku-tudou-ma-alibaba-idUSL3N12G37020151016?type=companyNews

449,"   By Lisa Richwine and Devika  Krishna Kumar | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Nov 4 Time Warner Inc on Wednesday re-ignited concerns that U.S. consumers are shifting to Internet television faster than expected and creating challenges to major media companies that have thrived with programming on pay TV.Traditional media companies' shares fell after Time Warner said during its quarterly conference call that it needed to take new steps to address the shakeup in TV viewing.The company's quarterly results added evidence that ""cord-cutting,"" or dropping pay TV services, threatens traditional media companies and built on Walt Disney Co's  admission in August that its ESPN sports powerhouse had lost customers.""What we've got is something of a deja vu,"" said FBR Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett. ""Investor confidence is rattled."" Time Warner, which owns cable channels TBS, TNT and HBO, said it was evaluating whether to keep rights for its shows longer for on-demand viewing instead of licensing them to services like Netflix Inc or Amazon.com Inc. It is also looking for ways to reduce the number of ads in its programming.Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant termed Time Warner's idea to keep programming rights longer a defensive move. ""Long-term, leaders of companies should look at this,"" Jayant said. ""It will be better than the current trajectory they are on.""Netflix shares climbed 3.6 percent, and Amazon rose 2.9 percent on Wednesday. Investors probably took Time Warner's comments as a positive sign about the future of video streaming that Netflix pioneered and feel confident about its original programming and overseas potential, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen. Shares of Time Warner were down 6.6 percent in afternoon trading. Disney, which reports its quarterly results on Thursday, fell 2.2 percent, and 21st Century Fox, which posted lower-than-expected revenue on Wednesday, dropped 6.4 percent.Time Warner lowered its earnings outlook, in part because of bigger-than-expected declines in pay TV subscribers and plans to increase investments in digital technology to keep pace with the changing market.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes acknowledged that changes in media habits posed challenges but said there were also opportunities.""It's critical that we push on the accelerator because every day it becomes clearer that the trends we anticipated are happening,"" he said, ""and in some ways they are happening even faster than we expected.""

453,"  STOCKHOLM Swedish telecoms network gear maker Ericsson raised its forecast for mobile data traffic, in a further boost to companies that benefit from rising numbers of consumers viewing online videos on platforms such as YouTube and Netflix.      Ericsson, the world's top mobile network equipment maker, expects a tenfold surge in mobile data traffic globally between 2015 and 2021 as the number of smartphone subscriptions rise. In its mobile industry report in June it forecast that growth would be eightfold between 2014 and 2020. Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, which invests in telecom and IT shares globally, said Ericsson is aiming to attract telecoms operators to invest in its networks by showing how much data traffic is expected to grow.     Heydorn said the inexorable rise in mobile data benefits telecoms operators more than it does Ericsson, which reported a 7 percent drop in sales this year despite the growth in smartphones.    But content providers, such as Netflix, Facebook and YouTube owner Google are the biggest winners from the increase in data traffic, he added.      Ericsson last week trimmed its market growth forecast for the next few years, indicating no clear correlation between mobile traffic and telecoms operators' investments.      ""Technology development and price pressure move faster than the increase in data traffic,"" said Bengt Nordstrom, head of telecoms consultancy Northstream.     YouTube accounts for up to 70 percent of all video traffic in many mobile networks, while Netflix's share of video traffic can reach up to 20 percent in markets where it is available, Ericsson said.      Video is expected to grow by around 55 percent annually through 2021, increasing its share of total mobile traffic in 2021 to 70 percent, up from around 50 percent in 2015, Ericsson said.       In it twice-yearly Mobility Report, Ericsson said it expected there to be 6.4 billion smartphone subscriptions globally by the end of 2021, up from 3.4 billion in 2015, due to greater affordability in developing markets.     It repeated its expectation that fifth-generation mobile telephony, which will facilitate self-driving cars, will be commercially deployed in 2020.     ""In 2021, South Korea, Japan, China and the U.S. are expected to have the fastest uptake of 5G subscriptions,"" Ericsson said, predicting 150 million 5G mobile subscriptions by 2021.     The new generation of mobile phone technology is expected not only to bring higher data speeds, but also to better accommodate a wide variety of connected devices.

461,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Anya George Tharakan  Dec 21 The record-breaking launch of the latest Star Wars movie puts the shares of U.S. theater operators on course for a stellar performance this quarter and beyond, analysts said, as rave reviews pull in die-hard fans and theater-shy audiences alike.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" had pulled in about $517 million in worldwide ticket sales through Sunday, according to industry experts, re-establishing the celebrated space saga as a global phenomenon for Walt Disney Co.""Box office will likely end up around 5 percent higher year-over-year and concessions may grow by 6 percent or more, so it is likely we will see the exhibitors print record earnings in the quarter,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in an email to Reuters.Fears that the fast-growth of online streaming services such as Netflix Inc would put a permanent dent into ticket sales at U.S. theaters has undermined the share prices of major theater operators this year.""There's never a sure thing with movies,"" Barrington Research Associates analyst James Goss told Reuters. ""(But) in this case, it was probably as close to a sure thing as there was.""Shares Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, Cinemark Holdings Inc and Carmike Cinemas Inc have fallen between 5 and 15 percent this year, underperforming the S&P 500. U.S. and Canadian box office revenue fell 5 percent to $10.4 billion in 2014, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.About 1.27 billion people went to the movies last year, the lowest since 1995, when 1.21 billion turned out, according to the National Association of Theater Owners.""We're expecting that AMC and Regal will perform well over the next three - six- 12 months,"" Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon told Reuters.Theater stocks outperformed the S&P by 7 percent in the month after the release earlier this year of blockbusters such as ""Jurassic World"" and last year's 'The Lego Movie"", he noted. INDUSTRY HEALTHY JBL Advisors analyst Jeffrey Logsdon estimates that AMC's earnings per share could rise by up 5 cents in the current-quarter, based on a box office of $500 million by Dec. 31. For Regal, the biggest U.S. theater operator by market share, earnings could be boosted by 3-4 cents per share, he said. The fact that the Star Wars movie is playing well in premium large- format screens, and that it is family-oriented, is also a plus for theater operators as both of those trends typically leads to higher in-theater spending.""This is the type of movie - if you're going to only see one movie a year - you'll splurge and pay the extra $5 to see it in the best format,"" Beynon said.Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said on Bloomberg TV on Monday that the movie could have raked in $528 million in worldwide ticket sales over the weekend.""I think this result ... puts to rest any concerns that Netflix and Amazon Prime and HBO Go and other over-the-top disruptors are taking away from the box office. That is not true,"" Beynon said. ""We think this was good evidence that the industry is still very healthy.""Still investors - taking Han Solo's advice, perhaps - aren't getting cocky just yet.Disney shares were down 1 percent at $106.60 in morning trading, Regal 1.1 percent at $17.94, AMC 1.8 percent at $24.32 and Cinemark 0.4 percent at $32.30.

462,"  STOCKHOLM Net Insight's new invention that enables synchronized live broadcasts on TV, tablets and smartphones could double its total addressable market in 1-2 years and should have a healthy impact on profit margins, its chief executive told Reuters.The Internet often has a lag of a minute or more compared to traditional TV, causing particular headaches for broadcasters of live events such as sports, which Net Insight promises to help its customers do away with.The Swedish firm in November introduced software enabling live broadcasts to be fully synchronized regardless of device, allowing it to enter the so-called over-the-top (OTT) TV market where video and TV can bypass traditional TV distribution.Examples of OTT video providers include Netflix and Amazon Prime. Meanwhile, Juniper Research predicts that global end-user OTT TV subscription revenues will quadruple to $32 billion by 2019 from $8 billion in 2014.Net Insight, which makes network products for video streaming, currently has a total addressable market of approximately 500 million euros, but its new market could outgrow that within a couple of years. ""It could take 1-2 years to surpass that size of addressable market,"" Net Insight Chief Executive Fredrik Tumegard said.He also noted that it is much cheaper to produce software compared to network gear, so sales on large volumes will incur much lower costs. Net Insight will be paid in relation to the number of users and data volumes in its customers' network.    Its shares have risen 153 percent since November 25, when it announced that India's Tata Communications, which says it handles roughly a quarter of global Internet traffic, would be the first customer to try the innovation. Tata, the official connectivity provider for Formula 1, said it had successfully tested the new technology at a race in Singapore this year.  Tumegard said the invention, which will be rolled out in the first half of 2016, would be difficult to replicate for competitors as it requires expertise from several areas such as synchronization, video streams, networks and data centers. ""Someone would have done it a long time ago if it had been that easy,"" he added.

463,"  MUMBAI Netflix Inc's global expansion is set to reach movie-mad India, industry executives said, where high-speed Internet connectivity is rapidly spreading among a vast population used to paying pennies for their latest Bollywood fix.Slowing growth at home in the United States has put pressure on video-streaming service Netflix to grow internationally and India, where a fifth of the country's 1.3 billion people are online, is widely seen as a likely next step in Asia.Netflix declined to comment on its plans but industry executives told Reuters they expect an India announcement as early as this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where co-founder and Chief Executive Reed Hastings is scheduled to talk about the company's international expansion.""Netflix is entering India at the right time,"" said analyst Tarun Pathak at Counterpoint Technology Research.Most Indian Internet users go online via smartphones, which are increasingly capable of connecting to the latest, fourth-generation network (4G) which cuts streaming times considerably.""We expect at least one in two mobile devices sold this year to be 4G equipped,"" Pathak said.The challenge is convincing Indians to spend, analysts said. Netflix's average revenue per user (ARPU) in the third quarter was $25.29 in the United States and $21.59 abroad.In India, where a movie can cost 29 rupees (44 cents) and monthly subscriptions are as little as 200 rupees, analysts expect ARPUs to be a fraction of that. MOBILE PARTNER With most Indians getting online with smartphones, a telecom partner could speed Netflix's market entry a year after Hotstar - from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc controlled Star Network - and three years after Singapore-based Spuul. Netflix paired with SoftBank Group Corp for its Japan launch, piggybacking on the one of the country's mobile network providers for its first foray in Asia in September.Netflix's U.S.-listed Indian rival Eros International PLC announced a partnership on Monday with Idea Cellular Ltd, the country's third-biggest mobile carrier with 167 million subscribers.For telecoms companies, streaming services increase data consumption which is more lucrative than telephone calls. Moreover, movie subscriber numbers are widely expected to jump with the large scale introduction of 4G services, led by the Jio network of Reliance Industries Ltd.But in price-sensitive India, reaching new customers with big-budget content is likely to prove far easier than fending off the appeal of cheap, easily available pirated copies.

465,"  * Netflix likely to announce expansion plans at CES -industry execs, analysts* Netflix could partner telecoms firms to drive subscriptions* 4G roll-out to boost content consumptionMUMBAI, Jan 5 Netflix Inc's global expansion is set to reach movie-mad India, industry executives said, where high-speed Internet connectivity is rapidly spreading among a vast population used to paying pennies for their latest Bollywood fix.Slowing growth at home in the United States has put pressure on video-streaming service Netflix to grow internationally and India, where a fifth of the country's 1.3 billion people are online, is widely seen as a likely next step in Asia.Netflix declined to comment on its plans but industry executives told Reuters they expect an India announcement as early as this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where co-founder and Chief Executive Reed Hastings is scheduled to talk about the company's international expansion.""Netflix is entering India at the right time,"" said analyst Tarun Pathak at Counterpoint Technology Research. Most Indian Internet users go online via smartphones, which are increasingly capable of connecting to the latest, fourth-generation network (4G) which cuts streaming times considerably.""We expect at least one in two mobile devices sold this year to be 4G equipped,"" Pathak said.The challenge is convincing Indians to spend, analysts said. Netflix's average revenue per user (ARPU) in the third quarter was $25.29 in the United States and $21.59 abroad.In India, where a movie can cost 29 rupees (44 cents) and monthly subscriptions are as little as 200 rupees, analysts expect ARPUs to be a fraction of that.

476,"  By Trevor Hunnicutt and David Randall     NEW YORK, Jan 13 Not every investor is chagrined by the dismal way the year has started in stocks. Some, like self-described value manager Rupal Bhansali, are gleefully loading up on companies that got beaten down when the whole market sold off at the start of the year.     Bhansali, whose Ariel International Equity Fund  had been socking away cash for just such an occasion, says she is buying in the most battered areas, including the one identified most often as the reason for the current market selloff: China.      ""We're finding value in volatility,"" said Bhansali. Her fund is one of just three U.S. large-cap value funds tracked by Morningstar Inc to deliver positive returns over one year after last week's broad market decline. ""We have a very large pond to fish from.""     She is buying shares of China Mobile Ltd , down 13 percent over the last year. She said she expects the massive wireless carrier likely will blossom as consumers there take on data plans and gain internet access for the first time.     She is also buying Microsoft Corp, to her more of a ""staple"" than a risky technology stock, and Dialog Semiconductor Plc, which she sees as a strong balance sheet bet even though it supplies tech giant Apple Inc, which is facing concerns about slower iPhone sales growth.     Other value managers are also adding to existing positions and scooping up new finds after U.S. and global stocks started the year with historically large declines.      The average actively-managed large-cap fund ended 2015 with 2.6 percent of its portfolios in cash, about 73 percent more than the 1.5 percent they held the year before, according to Lipper.      They have put a broad array of beaten-down sectors, from banks to retailers, in their sights.     If these buys pay off, it will be a turnaround for the value investment style, which favors stocks that have lower prices relative to earnings and assets.      In 2016, high-priced growing companies like Amazon  and Netflix rewarded investors. Large-cap value funds lost 4.1 percent in 2015, versus a 3.6-percent gain for large-cap growth funds, Morningstar reported.          DOUBLING DOWN     With $371 million in new inflows last year, the $1.3 billion Smead Value Fund, has been aggressively deploying cash to buy more of companies it may have picked up on the early side. The fund gained 1.5 percent in 2015.      ""This past week has been cheapening up stocks that we think are going to continue to do well for us,"" said Cole Smead, a co-portfolio manager. His fund has been adding to positions in retailers such as Nordstrom Inc and Tegna Inc, the broadcasting and digital companies spun out of newspaper publisher Gannett Co Inc.      He is also looking at adding to Bank of America and American Express, which now makes up one of the largest positions in his fund at 4.5 percent of the portfolio, he said. Both should benefit from rising interest rates.      Smead initiated its position in American Express during the mid-2015 selloff sparked by concerns about China, and has been adding to it steadily since then.     To be sure, there is risk in these contrarian strategies. Adding to positions, such as American Express, that have sold off comes at the risk that they may continue to fall. Bhansali said that even after the selloff she is having trouble finding consumer staples and energy stocks that have sold off enough to make them attractive.      Bryant VanCronkhite, portfolio manager of the $2.3 billion Wells Fargo Special Mid Cap Value Fund , said he has been adding to positions in energy and industrials companies that have ""terrible"" stock performance, he said.     One contrarian pick: Eagle Materials Inc, whose shares have fallen 11 percent year-to-date, and 25 percent over the last three months, largely because of its business providing sand for use in fracking wells. Yet the company also had a strong cement business, he said, and healthy fundamentals including a strong balance sheet that will allow it weather a downturn longer than competitors.     For VanCronkhite, the pessimism presented an opportunity.      ""We've been able to defend positions and build new positions in names that we were waiting on a price on,"" he said.

480,"   By Lisa Richwine  Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) aggressive push into international markets won more customers than the video streaming service and its investors expected last quarter, sending its shares surging 7 percent.The dominant online video company said on Tuesday it had 74.8 million subscribers at the end of December and forecast 6.1 million more through March, fueled by its expansion this month into virtually every country except China, where it is exploring ways to launch its service.The projection is more bullish than the 4.94 million average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet StreetAccount.Shares of Netflix rose 7 percent to $115.42 in after-hours trading.Netflix, which started sending DVDs to customers by mail two decades ago, now offers its subscribers unlimited online access to TV shows and movies from Hollywood studios plus its own original shows such as ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black."" New customers overseas are countering slowing growth for Netflix in the United States, the company's biggest market. It added 1.56 million U.S. subscribers in the fourth quarter, below the 1.65 million it forecast, and less than 1.9 million a year earlier. ""Our high penetration in the U.S. seems to be making net additions harder than in the past,"" the company said in a quarterly letter to shareholders.Netflix said it expects U.S. subscribers to jump 1.75 million this quarter. The company will likely benefit from the return of hit show ""House of Cards"" and a traditional bump in interest at the start of the year from people with new TV sets. Internationally, Netflix added 4.04 million subscribers, compared with its estimate of 3.50 million. Netflix does not break down where its international subscribers are based. From January through March, the company expects to add about 4.35 million international subscribers. ""The rollout in 130 countries in early January ensures that they will have no problem hitting their international target,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. Netflix said it may be able to start a service in China this year, but it may take longer. ""We have work and uncertainty ahead,"" the company said in its investor letter.

482,"   By Lisa Richwine  Netflix Inc's (NFLX.O) aggressive push into international markets won more customers than the video streaming service and its investors expected last quarter, sending its shares surging 7 percent.The dominant online video company said on Tuesday it had 74.8 million subscribers at the end of December and forecast 6.1 million more through March, fueled by its expansion this month into virtually every country except China, where it is exploring ways to launch its service.The projection is more bullish than the 4.94 million average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet StreetAccount.Shares of Netflix rose 7 percent to $115.42 in after-hours trading.Netflix, which started sending DVDs to customers by mail two decades ago, now offers its subscribers unlimited online access to TV shows and movies from Hollywood studios plus its own original shows such as ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black."" New customers overseas are countering slowing growth for Netflix in the United States, the company's biggest market. It added 1.56 million U.S. subscribers in the fourth quarter, below the 1.65 million it forecast, and less than 1.9 million a year earlier. ""Our high penetration in the U.S. seems to be making net additions harder than in the past,"" the company said in a quarterly letter to shareholders.Netflix said it expects U.S. subscribers to jump 1.75 million this quarter. The company will likely benefit from the return of hit show ""House of Cards"" and a traditional bump in interest at the start of the year from people with new TV sets. Internationally, Netflix added 4.04 million subscribers, compared with its estimate of 3.50 million. Netflix does not break down where its international subscribers are based. From January through March, the company expects to add about 4.35 million international subscribers. ""The rollout in 130 countries in early January ensures that they will have no problem hitting their international target,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.

487,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Fund managers who relied on the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix, and Google - to boost their performance numbers in 2015 are cutting ties as the global economy looks weaker than many expected, leaving last year's outperformers in the midst of a deep selloff.The group of stocks that could do no wrong last year now seems like it can do little right. Amazon.com Inc is down 28.7 percent for the year, Netflix has slumped 27.6 percent, and Google parent Alphabet Inc has dropped 11.4 percent over the same time. Only Facebook Inc entered this week with a flat performance for the year before sliding 5.2 percent in midday trading Monday, or about half the 10.2 percent the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index has fallen since the start of January.Fund managers say that last year's outsized gains among FANG stocks - Facebook, for instance, jumped 37 percent, while Netflix soared 144 percent - make them the first choice to sell now. The U.S. stock market is down 12.6 percent over the last three months and investors are questioning whether stocks could fall the 20 percent that signals a bear market. “We’re moving away from growth because the economy is decelerating and investors are starting to play defense,” said Phil Orlando, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York. Orlando said he began selling FANG stocks in early January during the selloff that marked the first weeks of the year and has been moving into defensive healthcare stocks like Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson that pay high dividends.  With so many investors sitting on large profits, the FANG group is the easiest to sell because it is an easy way to lock-in gains while also shifting a portfolio from expensive, growth-oriented stocks, Orlando said. Netflix, for instance, trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 294.8, while Amazon.com trades at a P/E ratio of 404.9, both more than 17 times the valuation of the S&P 500 index as a whole. Bill Nygen, portfolio manager of the Oakmark fund, said that he sold all of his position in Amazon in late 2015 because it had doubled in price while the retailers it competes with had fallen sharply, suggesting it was fully valued. He used the proceeds to move into financial and industrial companies instead.  SAFETY OVER GROWTH The move away from FANG stocks is just one sign that more fund managers are now starting to favor reliable, steady earning companies over the less profitable but higher-growth companies they gravitated to during the earlier stages of the bull market.Utility Consolidated Edison, toy maker Hasbro and pest control company Rollins Inc have each seen more fund managers adding shares this quarter, and as a result have each gained 3 percent or more year to date. Utilities, meanwhile, which are attractive to investors mainly for their dividends rather than the prospects of share price appreciation, are up almost 13 percent since mid-December, partly on the prospects that a weaker U.S. economy could slow the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates.Still unclear is whether the move-to-safety is in itself a sign that the stock market will improve rather than continue to spill blood. The S&P 500 has gained an average of 18.5 percent in the six months after surges in defensive stocks such as telecoms and utilities, and 28.2 percent in the 12 months following the defensive jump, said Gina Martins Adams, equity strategist at Wells Fargo. Consumer discretionary and technology stocks are the most likely to outperform the broad market in the six months ahead, she said. Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager of the Jensen Quality Growth fund, said that defensive stocks will likely continue to outperform as investors prepare for the first prolonged downmarket since 2009. His fund only invests in companies that have been able to post a 15-percent return on equity every year for the last 10 years, and has its largest positions in PepsiCo Inc, Microsoft Corp and surgical tool company Becton Dickinson and Co. ""We've had six years that have unfolded almost entirely as a bull market and people have been taught to pursue momentum,"" he said. ""We are looking for companies that are able to weather the storms.""

488,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Verizon Communications Inc, which launched its pay TV plan ""Fios Custom TV"" last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels they want to watch, has redesigned the offering.The revamped Custom TV now offers a choice of one of two packages with over 100 channels and three optional genre-specific packs, instead of a slim offering of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons.  The move was not in response to objections from content partners but based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said.  The first package, named ""Essentials,"" has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks - Disney's ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC with no sports offerings. The second package, ""Sports & more,"" has more than 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels such as the Cartoon Network.In April last year, Verizon repackaged the traditional pay-TV bundle and created a stir with some programmers by moving some traditional pay TV base-tier channels into optional genre-specific add-on packs. The channels it moved included ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp division NBC Universal's USA. ESPN has sued Verizon, alleging a breach of contract, while Twenty-First Century Fox and NBC Universal have said the Custom TV offering violates their contractual obligations. ESPN is ""encouraged by the changes that Verizon has made to Custom TV,"" spokeswoman Katina Arnold said. She declined to comment on ESPN's lawsuit against Verizon.      FOX and NBC could not be reached immediately for comment. The offering now costs $69.99, along with Fios Internet and digital voice services and three genre-specific add-on packages for $6 each. The first Custom TV iteration started at $65 a month for broadband, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, from a choice of seven for $10 each.The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate.  Last month, Verizon's Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo declined to comment on the ESPN lawsuit on an earnings call with investors, but said customers ""don't want to have to pay for bundles that they never use."" ""We will refresh (Custom TV) here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements,"" he added.Compared to pay-TV giants AT&T Inc with its DirecTV acquisition last year and Comcast, Fios has a small market in 12 states and Washington, D.C., with 5.8 million video customers as of the end of 2015.(Corrects to change ""FiOS"" to ""Fios"" in headline and paragraphs 1, 10 and 14.)

489,"   By Agnieszka Flak  and Danilo Masoni | MILAN  MILAN A jump in the company's share price should brighten the mood of any chief executive but that is unlikely to have been the effect this week on Marco Patuano, the head of Telecom Italia.After he strategy meeting in Paris with executives from his new top shareholder Vivendi on Wednesday, market speculation mounted that the French group led by business tycoon Vincent Bollore might force change with or without Patuano, sending Telecom Italia's shares up by over 6 percent.Investors bet the evidence of increased pressure from Vivendi could open the way to a radical overhaul of the heavily-indebted group.""Patuano is a bit of a man of the past and I'm not sure how long he can stay in the saddle, unless he aligns himself with Vivendi,"" said Tommaso Iaquinta of boutique investment bank Livolsi-Iaquinta & Partners.Since taking over as CEO in late 2013, Patuano has had to steer a course for one of Italy's most politically sensitive companies which will not upset the sometimes conflicting interests of the state, employees and shareholders.Patuano, who started his career in Telecom Italia in 1990 straight after university and worked his way up through the ranks to become chief operating officer before taking over as CEO, has stepped up spending on faster fixed and mobile networks as the government seeks to get internet connections across the nation up to speed with the rest of Europe. He has also struck deals with content providers such as Sky Italia, Netflix and Mediaset in a search for new sources of income and to better compete with rivals.Unlike his predecessor Franco Bernabe, who opposed asset sales and pushed for a share issue before quitting in a clash over strategy with core investors, Patuano began to sell non-core assets to continue cutting Telecom Italia's debt of around 27 billion euros ($29.6 billion).He struck the deal to sell its controlling stake in Telecom Argentina, which after much delay a regulatory source said was finally approved on Thursday, and spun off radio masts unit INWIT. However, Patuano's relations with Vivendi were tense from the start, a source close to the matter said. The French group took 8 percent of Telecom Italia in June as part payment for selling Brazilian broadband firm GVT to Spain's Telefonica, which at the time was Telecom Italia's biggest shareholder.Vivendi has since steadily built up its stake, tightening its grip on the company, and leaving Patuano under pressure to cut costs at home and decide what to do with its Brazilian business, TIM Participacoes, where Patuano was once chief financial officer.What to do is a bone of contention. ""Vivendi wants to sell Brazil, and Patuano does not,"" the source said. Patuano has said he sees TIM Participacoes, Brazil's second-biggest mobile network operator behind Telefonica Brasil, as strategic. And last month Telecom Italia walked away from a proposal to merge TIM with rival Oi because, according to a source close to the matter, it would not have had control of the combined entity.Meanwhile the sudden emergence last October of French telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel as potentially Telecom Italia's second-largest shareholder - he has bought options relating to a 15.1 percent stake - is further complicating matters.Vivendi and Niel have repeatedly said they are not acting in concert, but their exact long-term aims for investing in Telecom Italia remain unclear.However, Vivendi described Telecom Italia as ""a rudderless ship""  in December before going on to secure four board seats.It has since turned up the heat further by raising its stake in the Italian group to 23.8 percent.  However, another source close to the matter said Vivendi might be pushing for change but is not in a position to act alone, given it only has four of 17 board members.""Telecom Italia is strategic for the whole Italian industry, the financial sector and the political powers. Nothing can happen without the involvement of these big powers,"" the source said.Telecom Italia has seen revenues decline steadily amid tough competition in its mature home market, which is just emerging from a protracted recession, and is now grappling with an economic downturn and currency devaluation in Brazil.Analysts say Vivendi's interest might lead to a tie-up between Telecom Italia and another telecoms or media operator. So far the French group has only said that it wants to use Telecom Italia to develop its existing businesses in southern Europe and boost its content offering. ""Vivendi's investment in Telecom Italia is the launchpad for  something bigger to come, like an M&A deal, as the telecoms industry in Europe is expected to consolidate,"" said Enrico Vaccari, fund manager at Italy's Consultinvest.

499,"   By Charles Levinson | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Wall Street banks appear to be routinely mispricing corporate bond issues, potentially costing U.S. companies billions of dollars in excess interest payments, according to a new study by London-based research firm Fideres.Fideres said it analyzed more than 700 bond issuances between 2010 and 2015, and found that, on average, U.S. corporate bond prices rose over 0.50 percent in the first few days after hitting the market. In comparison, bonds issued by banks rose just over 0.30 percent on average, according to Fideres.The gains in corporate bond prices reflect strong investor demand for the issues, which in turn suggests that the yields may be overly steep. The higher the yield, the higher the interest payment for the corporate issuer.Fideres said mispriced bonds cost the issuers of the 700 corporate bonds it studied an estimated $2 billion in excess interest payments. The firm estimated that mispriced bonds cost the whole U.S. corporate bond market as much as $18 billion during the five-year period. ""When banks advise corporate clients, the bonds are systemically underpriced,"" said Alberto Thomas, a former fixed income derivatives banker at UBS and now a partner at Fideres. ""But when they do their own bonds, they seem to know exactly where to price them."" To be sure, banks are among the biggest issuers of bonds and so there are many benchmarks to refer to when setting yields. Non-financial companies tend to tap the debt market less frequently, so setting yields are not as straightforward. The U.S. corporate bond market has ballooned to more than $1.5 trillion worth of issues last year, from $666 billion in 2002, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, as companies took advantage of record low interest rates to raise money. The fees banks have generated for advising and underwriting new corporate bonds have swollen to more than $16.4 billion last year, from $7.6 billion in 2002, according to Thomson Reuters data. Fideres said banks may be torn between trying to please the companies issuing the bonds and the investors buying the bonds. When the price of a corporate bond jumps in value after hitting the market, the bondholders score quick and easy profits.  Many big bond investors are among the banks' largest and most valued clients, whereas most companies who issue bonds do so infrequently though they pay lucrative advisory fees.  Fideres' past research projects have been used in class action suits against banks. The firm's mining of market data have helped plaintiffs score over $30 billion in settlements against banks over the alleged rigging of markets in foreign exchange, credit default swaps, precious metals, and other key financial benchmarks. One of the bonds that Fideres studied was an $800 million issue from Netflix Inc in February 2015. Netflix's advisers, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, set a near 6 percent yield on the bonds. When the bonds hit the market, their price jumped around 2.5 percent within three days. Such a big gain indicated that Netflix could have raised the same capital at a lower interest rate, Fideres said.  Spokespersons for JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Netflix declined to comment.There are no known regulatory or other agency investigations into the pricing of corporate bonds, though U.S. banks have come under scrutiny for other debt market practices. In February 2014, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission opened an investigation into how Goldman Sachs and Citigroup allocated corporate bonds to investors. The ongoing investigation is focused on whether the banks favored certain large investors over other smaller ones. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment on the investigation.

502,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | BOSTON  BOSTON Hedge fund Tiger Global Management, known for making big bets on technology companies, slipped modestly in March, leaving it down 21 percent for the first three months of the year, an investor in the fund said.The numbers put the New York-based firm, which manages roughly $6 billion in its hedge fund, among the year's worst performers, a rare misstep for the highly secretive firm. Overall the firm manages roughly $20 billion.For 2015, Tiger Global had a gain of 6.8 percent gain, while most other firms had losses. A spokeswoman did not respond to an email requesting comment.Tiger's top holdings of publicly traded stocks - Amazon.com, Netflix Inc. and JD.com Inc - are all nursing losses for the year.And although many of Tiger Global's top holdings recovered ground in March, that was not enough to offset some of the heavy losses at the start of the year. Two other stocks that regulatory filings show the firm owned at the end of the fourth quarter have had big losses for the current year-to-date. Software solutions company Tableau Software is down more than 50 percent and luxury home furnishings company Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc is off 45 percent.Tiger Global has been making more concentrated bets in its hedge fund portfolio. Last year Scott Shleifer replaced Feroz Dewan, who left the firm, in running Tiger's public equity business.Many hedge funds are still compiling their quarter-end numbers and investors are bracing for additional losses, on expectations that managers got too nervous when the market was tumbling and missed the recovery. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds do not report their numbers publicly and investors are eager to hear how the big managers performed to get a sense of a trend. Hound Partners LLC told investors it lost 1.9 percent in March and is now off 12.3 percent for the year. Part of the loss is related to the sharp drop in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a favorite with the hedge fund community.Falcon Edge, which listed drug maker Allergan, energy company Cheniere and JD.com among its biggest stock holdings, said it lost 2.2 percent in March and is off 14.6 percent for the year. But there is some good news. Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors gained 1.2 percent in March, shrinking its loss for the year to 8.3 percent.Owl Creek Asset Management, whose biggest stock investment is Yahoo, gained 6.1 percent, leaving its year-to-date loss at just 0.8 percent.

The forecast includes a ""modest impact"" from the beginning of a price increase for its monthly movie and TV subscription service, the company said.The company known for its original shows including ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""House of Cards"" said it expected to add about 2 million subscribers in markets outside the United States, versus analyst expectations of 3.5 million, according to FactSet. It also reported results for the first quarter, when subscriptions outpaced its own target.Netflix is prone to large stock price swings as investors bet on the possible success of its mission to redefine television viewing around the world.The company's long-term results depend in large part on how fast and profitably it expands. Netflix has launched in almost every country in the world, at a substantial cost, and now faces the task of adapting the service to different markets and cultures as competitors also rush in.In January, Netflix went live in more than 130 countries, a huge global push by Chief Executive Reed Hastings to counter slowing growth in the United States.Initial sign-ups were limited in some countries because the service at this point offers only English-language content and does not accept all of the local payment options, Hastings said on Monday. ""Over the next couple years as we further localize, we'll be able to see more opportunity,"" Hastings told analysts on a conference call.Netflix has not yet launched in China, where it has been exploring an entry for some time. It said on Monday it was ""continuing discussions"" and that ""whatever we do,"" the Chinese market would have only a modest financial effect near-term.The company previously promised ""material"" global profit in 2017 as it begins to reap the benefits of its costly expansion. A spokeswoman said Netflix is sticking with that forecast. ""I think that people who relied on unbridled international growth are beginning to have second thoughts, and the company now faces domestic competition that may limit its ability to grow domestic profitability,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock.Amazon.com Inc announced it would offer its video streaming service as a standalone monthly subscription as it looks to drive membership in its Prime subscription service. Netflix said its forecast for fewer international additions than the prior year was due to tough comparisons with the year-ago period when it had launched in Australia and New Zealand.The company will start boosting rates for more than half of its U.S. members from May. ""We are rolling this out slowly over the year, rather than mostly in May, so we can learn as we go,"" the company said in a statement.  Netflix also said it expected to increase its spending on movie and TV content from about $5 billion in 2016 to more than $6 billion in 2017.From January through March, Netflix added 6.7 million subscribers, bringing its worldwide total to 81.5 million.Net income for the quarter was $28 million. Earnings per share came in at 6 cents, beating the forecast of 5 cents from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

514,"   By Nataly Pak and Eveline Danubrata | SEOUL/JAKARTA  SEOUL/JAKARTA Months after its global rollout, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is facing problems in several major Asian markets as it struggles to provide enough strong content to attract consumers amid tough local competition, and also faces many regulatory hurdles, underlining concerns about disappointing subscriber numbers reported this week.From complaints that programming libraries offered in many countries are far smaller than in the United States to delays in offering its signature ""House of Cards"" series in some markets due to rights issues, the U.S. video streaming giant's January launch into 130 new markets worldwide, including a slew in Asia, has been bumpy.When it launched in Indonesia in January, for example, Netflix ran afoul of the film censorship board for carrying content deemed inappropriately violent or sexual. The communications ministry also demanded that Netflix set up a local office and pay Indonesian taxes.State telecoms company PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk (Telkom) (TLKM.JK) will continue blocking Netflix until it adheres to regulations, Arif Prabowo, vice president for corporate communications at the carrier, told Reuters, declining to give details.Netflix is still available in Indonesia via wifi connections and other carriers.    ""Services delivered over the Internet present new questions for everyone, including policymakers, and our intention is to comply with applicable laws and regulations,"" said Jessica Lee, Netflix's head of communications for Asia.""It is all part of the journey as we roll out in different countries,"" she said.The cost of dealing with these kinds of issues are reflected in its results, which show that Netflix suffered a first-quarter operating loss of $104.2 million for streaming video outside the U.S., partly because of higher marketing costs, and also showed that it is earning less per subscriber overseas than at home.Netflix had 34.5 million international subscribers against 47 million in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. It is unclear how many of its customers are in Asia. LICENSING RESTRICTIONS  In South Korea, where local content is popular and consumers have numerous streaming options, the Netflix site offers fewer than 20 local TV shows or movies.    ""Korean Netflix's library in terms of content is pretty thin,"" said Jung Dong-yoon, a 29-year-old Seoul office worker and subscriber since January.    Netflix viewers in the country also this week discovered that well-known shows including ""How to Get Away with Murder"" and season two of ""Better Call Saul"" were missing - temporarily, Netflix says - as the shows are submitted for age appropriate ratings by the country’s ratings board.    Programming rights are an issue globally.    As of January, Netflix Australia, which launched service more than a year ago, offered just 443 TV shows, compared with 1,157 in the United States, and had 1,585 movies, compared with 4,593, according to Finder.com – fewer than those available in Iraq, Haiti, Cuba and many other countries.    ""With the traditional way in which rights to movies and TV titles are structured, there will be licensing restrictions and the goal is to get to a global library that is the same everywhere but that takes time,"" Lee said.      Vivek Couto, executive director of consultants Media Partners Asia, said it is still early in Asia for Netflix. He  expects the company will ramp up local content and eventually get ""reasonable penetration"" in markets such as India, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.    ""Markets like Singapore and India, over time, they can do reasonably well, but I think they're going to find more challenging markets like Japan, Korea, China,"" he said.    Netflix has yet to win permission to enter the coveted but highly restricted China market.  SLOWER GROWTH   Netflix this week said it expected to add about 2 million non-U.S. subscribers in the second quarter, below analysts' average expectations for about 3.5 million.    Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Monday cited a lack of local language content and local payment options for limiting initial sign-ups in some countries.    ""Over the next couple years as we further localize, we'll be able to see more opportunity,"" he told analysts on a conference call.    Netflix can take heart from its performance in Latin America, where it launched in 2011 and is by far the dominant video streaming service.     However, it has seen its share of the key Mexican market eroded slightly by competition from Clarovideo, a streaming service offered by billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil (AMXL.MX). One of Netflix’s biggest obstacles to growth in Mexico has been the low-level of broadband subscribers, according to one industry source. Broadband availability also looms as a potential concern in Brazil, where the telecoms regulator announced earlier this week that broadband providers would soon be allowed to set Internet usage limits.    In Asia, Competition is intensifying from local streaming sites as well as global providers such as Amazon, Hulu, HBO and BBC iPlayer.    Around the time Netflix debuted in South Korea, local company Frograms Inc launched its own Watcha Play service. Two months later, SK Telecom Co Ltd (017670.KS) made its video streaming service available to customers who do not subscribe to its phone service.Around the time Netflix debuted in Australia, publisher Fairfax Media Ltd (FXJ.AX) and broadcaster Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd (NEC.AX) launched a joint venture streaming service, while News Corp (NWSA.O) and Seven West Media Ltd (SWM.AX) teamed up to do the same. All offered heavy discounts, including free trials.    Netflix had an explosive start in Australia, counting nearly 3 million Australians as viewers, OUT OF A population of 24 million, within nine months of its March 2015 launch. But growth has slowed just as dramatically, from a 55 percent leap between April and May to a rise of 4 percent between September and October, according to Roy Morgan research.

516,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Turner Communications is expected to announce Tuesday that it is launching its own streaming video-on-demand service for film buffs this fall, according to a company statement reviewed by ReutersTurner, which is a division of Time Warner Inc, is the latest in a wave of media companies to launch its own over-the-top video service to accommodate the growing number of younger viewers who are cancelling cable subscriptions in favor or watching content online, a practice known as  cord-cutting.The new service, called FilmStruck,  will focus on independent, foreign, art house and cult classic films that people know and not original shows as streaming video providers, like Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, are increasingly doing. Turner is partnering with New York-based film distributor, Criterion Collection, which until now had offered all of its 1,100 films through Hulu.FilmStruck will not only feature films like ""Mad Max,"" ""Cinema Paradiso"" and ""Seven Samurai,"" but also will have filmmakers' commentaries, bonus content and stories about the films themselves,  Coleman Breland, president of Turner Classic Movies and Turner content distribution, said in an interview.  ""We didn't just jump into the fray and say let's offer an SVOD [streaming video on demand] service,"" Breland said. ""This is very targeted and focused."" FilmStruck will be managed by Turner Classic Movies. The company hopes to announce pricing for the service within the next 60 days, said Breland. The service will be solely subscription-based and will not have any advertisements.Turner is launching its own streaming online service just months after reports surfaced that its parent Time Warner was in discussions to take a stake in Hulu, which is jointly owned by 21st Century Fox Inc , Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal. The launch of FilmStruck is one example of what customers and investors should expect to see more of from Turner in the next several months as the company focuses on being more consumer-centric, said John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner.

525,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON, Sept 7  WASHINGTON, Sept 7 The top U.S. communications regulator plans on Thursday to unveil a revised plan to allow about 100 million pay TV subscribers to replace expensive set-top boxes with less-costly apps that provide access to television and video programs, two people briefed on the plan said.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed in January opening the $20 billion cable and satellite TV set-top box market to new competitors and allow consumers to access multiple content providers from a single app or device.The plan, aimed at breaking the cable industry's long grip on the lucrative pay TV market and lowering prices for consumers, drew fierce opposition from TV and content providers, including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.The FCC has said Americans spend $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 annually. Set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones has dropped 90 percent, the FCC has estimated. The pay TV industry raised concerns over copyright, content licensing and privacy issues and made a counterproposal in June, offering to commit to creating its own apps to allow consumers to watch programs without needing to lease a box.Wheeler's revised plan is expected to include some components of the pay TV industry's proposal, and to exempt some smaller cable providers from the new requirements. The plan is also expected to create a licensing body to oversee the pay-TV apps, according to industry filings with the FCC. The revised application-based proposal is expected to come before the five-member commission for a vote on Sept. 29 at the commission's next meeting, the sources briefed on the matter said.Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, declined to comment. Disney, CBS, Viacom, Time Warner  Inc, Scripps Networks Inc and others met with Wheeler aides last week to discuss ""a revised approach... that would ensure that all of programmers' valuable content would remain inside of, and under the control of, apps developed exclusively by"" cable and other pay-TV providers, according to a filing with the FCC this week.These companies fear that rivals like Alphabet Inc  or Apple Inc could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content.Wheeler's January proposal would create a framework for device manufacturers and software developers to produce a single device or app to gain access to content from providers such as Netflix Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Hulu, Alphabet's YouTube and a pay-TV company.Wheeler has an aggressive agenda in the final months of the Obama administration. He wants the FCC to finalize a proposal to ensure privacy for broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent. He also wants to complete reforms of the $40 billion annual market for business data services known as special access lines.

526,"  AMSTERDAM Liberty Global (LBTYA.O), the international telecommunications company controlled by American tycoon John Malone, said on Wednesday it has struck a deal to offer Netflix (NFLX.O) to all its customers directly via cable set-top boxes.The deal follows the launch of Netflix by Liberty Global’s UK subsidiary Virgin Media in 2013. Liberty Global has 29 million customers in 30 countries.Chief Executive Mike Fries said that subscribers in the UK with access to Netflix ""pay more, churn less and are happier.""

535,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK As the number of streaming video services proliferate, about 16 percent of U.S. video viewers have signed up for more than one online streaming service, up from 10 percent three years ago, according to a report from market research firm GfK SE. GfK's October report is based on interviews with 1,054 consumers on their subscription choices of streaming services such as Netflix Inc and Amazon Prime video, the firm said in a statement on Wednesday. In recent years, the television industry has seen viewers increasingly gravitate towards online streaming video services and shunning pricier cable and satellite subscriptions. The online streaming market is expected to get more crowded with new services from Hulu, which will launch a new live TV bundle of broadcast and cable network channels early next year and AT&T Inc, which will roll out its DirecTV Now streaming service by the end of the year. About half of the viewers surveyed subscribe to at least one on-demand video streaming service, while 17 percent subscribe to Netflix and Amazon Prime and 9 percent have Netflix and Hulu Plus, GfK said. Five percent had Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu Plus.Viewers who self-bundle, or create their own content bundles by subscribing to a combination of streaming services, have a mean income of $90,000, versus the mean income of $76,000 of a viewer who watches at least one video per week through any means online, TV or otherwise, the report said.  Even so, those who self-bundle are less likely to subscribe to more the expensive traditional cable and satellite TV services, Gfk found.""As consumers start to self-bundle, the potential impact of increasing subscriber fees for each streaming service will be compounded,"" David Tice, SVP of Media and Entertainment at GfK, said.  ""The last one to a price increase party may be the first one canceled – so individual streaming services need to consider competitor plans before instituting price hikes. There may also be a place in the market for a third-party aggregator of discounted streaming services,"" he added.

Anmuth said he believed Netflix was on track toward 60 million plus subscribers in the United States and about 100 million internationally by 2020.The company has often been criticized for spending too much on content as it tries to aggressively gain subscribers outside the United States, its main market.The company added about 3.20 million subscribers internationally in the third quarter, compared with the 2.01 million average analyst estimate.In the United States, Netflix added 370,000 subscriptions, compared with analysts' estimate of 309,000, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Though the company's stock has fallen nearly 13 percent this year, it trades at 356 times forward earnings, versus the peer median of 5.88.The second season of ""Narcos"", a Netflix original show on  Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar, has proved highly popular, following up on the success of ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""House of Cards"".The company plans to launch ""Crown"", a show about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Netflix plans to release more than 1,000 hours of original programming in 2017, up from 600 hours this year.""This is unprecedented growth that should drive a substantial improvement in the breadth and depth of content on the service, which should provide a tailwind to subscriber growth in 2017,"" said Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves.The company said it now expects a higher free cash flow burn at $1.5 billion in 2016 as producing original content consumes more cash up front.The company, which faces competition from the likes of Hulu and Amazon.com Inc , said it would likely tap the capital markets to fund spending on original content.

543,"   By Jillian Harding  It came down to international subscriber growth. The folks that brought you ""House Of Cards"" and ""Jessica Jones"" added 3.2 million international subscribers, trouncing its internal estimate of 2 million by 60 percent. Netflix attributed its international success to its new original shows such as ""Stranger Things"" and ""Narcos.""There are two risks to this strategy. One is the ever increasing cost of programming. In 2017, Netflix plans to increase its original programming to 1,000 hours from 600 this year. That won't come cheaply. It plans to spend $6 billion on programming next year, up from $1 billion this year. The other risk is that while international subscriptions are expected to be Netflix's engine of growth in the future, for now those subscribers are not profitable. Its third quarter loss margin was 8 percent, although an improvement from a year-earlier loss margin of 13 percent. By contrast in the United States, Netflix added 370,000 subscribers, beating estimates by 50,000 subscribers. The U.S. is a slower growing and far more competitive market (hello Amazon Prime, Hulu and HBO Go). But the segment's profit margin rose to 36 percent from 32 percent. The company's internal estimate was 35 percent. Company-wide, the company increased its average selling price by 10 percent. Put another way, they're raising their prices without losing many subscribers. Add it all up, you get a very happy Wall Street (unless you were short Netflix). Shares were up about 17 percent at the market open.

548,"   By Lisa Richwine and Rishika Sadam   (This version of the October 17 story corrects reference to past quarters in second paragraph)By Lisa Richwine and Rishika SadamNetflix Inc added over 50 percent more subscribers than expected in the third quarter as original shows such as ""Stranger Things"" drew new international viewers and kept U.S. customers despite a price hike, sending its shares soaring 20 percent in late trade.The company's performance represented a turnaround from the previous quarter of disappointing subscription growth. Netflix, which has spent heavily to expand outside its home market, also said that it was on track to start harvesting ""material global profits"" next year, even as it raised spending on original programming.Shares of Netflix rose to $119.82 in extended trade from a close of $99.80.Netflix added about 3.20 million subscribers internationally in the third quarter, higher than the 2.01 million average analyst estimate. (bit.ly/2e2gsRD)In the United States, Netflix added 370,000 subscriptions, compared with analysts' estimate of 309,000, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.""Investors appear laser focused on subscriber growth, and so long as Netflix delivers on that metric, investors will bid its shares up,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. However, Pachter said he thought the continuing cost of developing new shows would undermine plans to deliver material profits in 2017. Netflix has expanded into more than 130 markets worldwide, including most major countries, except China. It said on Monday it was dropping plans to launch a service in China in the near term, opting instead to license its shows for ""modest"" revenue.The company said it still hopes to launch service in China ""eventually.""In the meantime, Netflix plans to keep pouring money into building its stable of original and licensed TV shows and movies. Content spending will rise to $6 billion next year, a $1 billion increase from 2016, the company said.""We will keep investing in growing the content spend, even domestically, for quite a long time,"" Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on webcast. Netflix has been facing a slowdown in subscription growth in the United States as the market matures and a planned U.S. price hike raised concerns it would not hit its targets. It also faces competition from the likes of Hulu and Amazon.com Inc.But the company, whose other popular original shows include ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""House of Cards"", said it expects to add 1.45 million subscribers in the United States in the current quarter.Analysts on average were expecting 1.27 million additions, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.""Netflix has successfully navigated the challenges of a price increase,"" retail research group Conlumino said in a note, adding that it had been ""somewhat less successful"" in maintaining subscriber growth. In its international markets, it expects subscriber additions of 3.75 million, compared with the average analyst estimate of 3.32 million.Third-quarter revenue rose 31.7 percent to $2.29 billion.Netflix's shares have surged in the past few years, driven by rapid growth as the company redefined television and fueled ""binge watching"".The stock, however, was down 12.7 percent this year as investors fretted about slowing growth in its domestic market and increasing competition.

550,"   By Jillian Harding  Like a car missing a wheel or a combo meal without the fries, that's what a media company is like both without original programming and ownership of the means to distribute that programming.  Or so the theory goes.Amazon, Netflix and Google's YouTube are producing their own shows and movies and distributing them over smart TVs, computers, and mobile phones without old-fashioned cable bundling issues. So the pressure is on old-school distributors – cable, phone and satellite companies –  to broaden their offerings and distribution.  A recent PWC survey found 20 percent of consumers could drop cable subscriptions in 2016. But we’ve seen this movie before (at least with Time Warner).  As FBR points out, the AT&T-Time Warner deal is “pushing the melding of mobile and content as visionary. But pipes/content combos have failed before, from Time Warner's AOL disaster to TWX's choice to spin off Time Warner Cable.” Content is still king, though, and BTIG’s Rich Greenfield says that’s what makes Time Warner so attractive for AT&T.  “AT&T is buying Time Warner to get at its content creation engines Warner Bros and HBO, with HBO one of the only legacy media assets to establish a direct-to-consumer business (HBO Now).”  The deal still faces serious regulatory hurdles, and has become a political football.  But even if it’s not approved, we will likely see more media deals. Technology has changed the media landscape again and it's wilder than Westworld.

557,"  Video streaming pioneer Netflix Inc has added an option that allows subscribers to download shows at no additional cost on their mobile device to watch without an internet connection. Netflix signaled in recent months it would add an offline viewing option to better compete as the streaming video market becomes more and more crowded. Amazon.com Inc’s rival streaming video service, Prime Video, has had this option for about a year.While the new option announced on Wednesday is available for all of Netflix’s subscribers, it could have greater appeal in international markets such as Africa and Asia, where internet service is less  ubiquitous than it is in the United States. The international market is becoming the main driver of growth for Netflix. Of their 86.7 million subscribers, 47.5 million of them come from the United States.Growth among U.S. subscribers has slowed in 2016. Netflix added just 370,000 subscribers during the third quarter and only 4.3 million since the third quarter of last year, suggesting they are reaching a saturation point. In that same time frame, Netflix has added 13.2 million international subscribers, including 3.2 million in the third quarter. Much of that has to do with Netflix’s expansion by more than 130 countries earlier this year to over 190 nations currently. China is a notable holdout. Not everything in Netflix’s vast library is available to download just yet, including the recently released “Gilmore Girls” revival. Currently available shows include Netflix-owned “Stranger Things,” “The Crown” and “Narcos” along with licensed shows and movies like “Parks and Recreation” and “Spotlight.”""While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,"" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post. The new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms, the company said.Netflix shares rose as much as 2.4 percent before it eased, up 0.1 percent to $117.62 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq.The new option received widespread praise on social media Wednesday. “You can now download stuff off Netflix to watch without internet,” wrote Twitter user kt (@Katie_Ottaway_), “what did we do to deserve this miracle.”#NetflixOffline was also the top-trending hashtag on Twitter, worldwide.
